1llj3c,47,2013-09-02,"You spin me right round round round, baby",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1llj3c/you_spin_me_right_round_round_round_baby/,"I apologize for the length of this, but I tried to be as detailed as possible describing the WTF moments. This is how we experienced it.

I am The Admin's Hand (read: temporary intern) at a medium-sized company. There are 40 or 50 people at the location I work at right now.

Well, the admin himself is horrifyingly overworked and is forced to rely on a lot of service from external companies. Spending truckloads of money on that doesn't matter to the higher-ups, but hiring is out of the question for some reason. Oh well.

Anyway, this morning I arrived at work and I could immediately tell my boss had been there for at least 2 hours already and had probably aged 2 years in that time. The entire network was down - printers unreachable, servers unreachable, no internet connections, no communication between clients. So it didn't take a long time to determine that the main switch for the entire building was the culprit. That switch is quite big and powerful, but also comparably old.

Because my boss was already at his wits' end and I wasn't even entirely present yet (no coffee), he called the external company who'd generally be handling ""OH SHIT"" situations regarding our network.

The network guy arrived, came to the same conclusion we did (switch might be broken), and gave it a quick test with a small replacement switch. Sure enough, with just a server, one of the routers and the IT office clients on the new switch, everything worked fine. He called a colleague to check if they had a replacement switch of the required size (48 ports plus at least 2 fiber ports) available. But, just to be sure, he accessed the switch configuration via its serial port. A quick look at the logs showed us ""Excessive Broadcasts at ports 7+8"". Whoa. So he unplugged ports 7 and 8. And sure enough, the entire network came back online instantly.

After asking my boss who was connected to those Ports, it took me less than 3 seconds to understand what had happened. I went to the corresponing office room, confirmed it, changed a few things and voila - everything was fine again even with ports 7 and 8 plugged in.

**What had happened?**

Last Thursday, one of the office trainees (unrelated to IT) came to us. My boss was on the phone so she asked me if the network cable attached to her laptop belonged to the laptop. She had to go to another office for a day or two to learn from the office drones there. I said I had no idea, but it wouldn't matter anyway, as we had a supply of literally hundreds of spare cables. I told her she could just unplug it and take it with her.

10 minutes later we get a call from the office she had been in: ""We're offline! HALP!"" I went down there and found out that apparently I had underestimated her... 'lack of expertise'. My bad. There are 2 computers in that room, both plugged into a basic 5port switch. Her Laptop was plugged into that switch while she was there, and the switch was connected to one of the wall sockets.

Well, she had ripped out almost everything in that room. The only connection left was the connection from one of the other computers to the switch. The cable from the wall to the switch was unplugged on the switch side and so was the cable from the 2nd computer to the switch.

So when I went down to that room today, sure enough I found the trainee back in the room. And of course she plugged her Laptop back in herself! And of course, if you plug the Laptop into the switch, the switch needs another connection to the wall. Right? Right. So now we had 2 cables going from the 5port switch to the wall. The wall, which is directly connection to our main switch. Creating a [Switching loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_loop).

So, yeah, I do consider it my bad to a degree. I underestimated this trainee's stupidity. After last Thursday, I probably should have approached her to kindly ask her to call us the next time she has to unplug something or plug something into something else. I just didn't care cause she didn't really do any damage aside from taking 2 people offline for 10 minutes. However, once she learned that she was responsible for a 3 hour network outage for the entire building, she was mortified. I made sure to let her know that nobody blames her, but to please come to us even for minor stuff like unplugging her Laptop in the future. I don't think she's ever going to touch a cable in the building again.

**-----**

Yes, the main switch has no internal loop protection. It could have, with a firmware update, but since the entire network is bound to be upgraded (including some cabling and the main switch) **(edit: within the next few weeks)**, it isn't worth the risk in case something goes wrong during the update.

There's no STP in use; but even if it was, the small 5port switch probably doesn't support STP anyway."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I am a front line supervisor.  Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question as management without the flack that comes with it.  Why did unions get away from policing their own?  Stories I hear from people who work for me say that back in the day, the union helped keep the slackers from getting out of hand.  That is definitely not the case anymore. My workers complain the union is ""over protecting"". Do you agree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07vlo?context=5)|Every union is different and speaking as both a union member AND a union employee I will say this: some unions are run REALLY badly. I personally think the MTA union in New York is one of the worst. With that you also need to remember there are some people that truly are ""slackers"" and others who are just there to get the paycheck and go home by doing the bare minimum. It is not the unions jobs to decide someones motivation for being at a particular job. Those slackers won't advance (we hope) and they can stay at the bottom if thats what they want. If you are talking about someone actively NOT doing their duties then the management has the right to step in to discuss the matter with the member and union rep. 
[Slackers staying on the bottom is usually where the frustration arises. You have to promote by seniority, and if the most senior person does not deserve a promotion then no one gets a promotion.  In practice anyway. Demotivates people in my experience. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc08ht3?context=5)|I think promotion solely based on seniority is a complete outdated practice. 
[That is one of my major griefs with unions (certain ones\). Why should that slacker be allowed to stay at the bottom? His or her ass should be fired, not protected by a rep.  That slacker not only wastes company dollars but the create more work and headache for everyone.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bzgq?context=5)|There is a different between someone not doing their job and someone doing the minimum amount of work. Some people have a job just to have a job. Those that are actively not doing their duties can and should be reprimanded but it needs to be a documented situation. Just saying ""fire the slackers"" lends itself to corruption on behalf of the employer. Making it harder to fire someone just means that yeah, slackers might stay lover before being fired but those being kicked out for reasons that have nothing to do with job performance will remain. 
[I notice that attitudes towards unions in the US seem to be more hostile than elsewhere in the world. Why is this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07fqx?context=5)|I honestly believe that it's the folks with the money spending a lot to convince the middle class that they can do better on their own while there is no study that shows that. Take a look at the Costco business model in the US for a great example of how it should be.
[Over here, Unions are seen as normal. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07fqx?context=5)|Also, unions are doing a really bad job of fighting the propaganda. Some of which has to do the with National Labor Relations Act. Every time it's been amended over the years, it was to modernize the rules for employers but they rules for unions are left reflecting the needs of years ago. 
[Unions are fine as long as they are voluntary and aren't beating up scabs. My only issue with unions is when they try to become legally protected or mandatory.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09o9v?context=5)|Okay. Let me dispel a myth here. No where in the United States are you required to join a union. NO WHERE. you can however be asked to work under a union contract. 
[Lets call a spade a spade. If you have to work under a contract and in many cases have to pay dues, you are effectively forced into the Union.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bjid?context=5)|No you're not. You don't need to pay initiation fees or yearly dues. 
[That is not true, unless you are in a right to work state, Unions can require nonmembers to pay ""fair share fees"" to cover collective bargaining costs.  Link to www.maine.edu.  Edit: members to nonmembers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0c5fk?context=5)|Those dues are solely collected on your salary. Yes. But the YEARLY dues and initiation fees would not apply as you are not a member. And guess what, if you get fired illegally you'll likely be entitled to a grievance or arbitration at no expense to you so you'll be glad it was there. 
[I should have worded my initial statement differently. Regardless, you are forced to pay the union money which many people believe is wrong and a form of extortion.  Individuals should have the right whether or not they want to be represented by a union or pay into one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0cblc?context=5)|Then there is no point to having the union. You cannot have two classes of worker doing the same job. RTW laws cripple unions that are FORCED to represent the worker while getting nothing to contribute to the unions needs.
[Do you think fast food workers will be successful in unionizing?  I feel for them, but unions are usually people of skill, which the fast food sector is not.  Pretty much, if you are easily trained and replaced, a strike isn't effective. Right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09m7z?context=5)|I sure hope they will and yes, if you can be replaced it's a lot harder. The goal would be to get people to refuse to work there without a contract and let the working class rise up and demand better treatment.
[How exactly are they being treated poorly? The whole fast food strike thing to me was ridiculous. You expect $15 an hour for working at McDonalds? Does anyone think thats an appropriate wage for that job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0f8dz?context=5)|Even if you take the $15 wage out of it there are huge safety concerns along with hours they are asked to work and no enforcement of break times. 
[I was in a Union for one year, I paid my dues weekly. When my company laid me off, the Union sat on their hands and did nothing. I violated none of the rules, and I did everything I was supposed to do. Any insight on why the union was cool with taking my money, but not protecting me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc05tkq?context=5)|Let's start here. Why did you get laid off? Did they discriminate against you? Was it part of a larger lay off? Ultimately, unions cant make employment decisions (though Im sure some unions think they can). They can however make sure you are protected if you get laid off for an illegal reason but a simple lay off is sadly part of life. If this went down badly and the union ignored your requests for conversation about your rights and what was happening, then that's on them for not doing their job. While they can't help you keep a job if layoffs happen (though they can try to work with employers to avoid them) they should be there to answer questions.
[In hindsight, I know all of this now. Over the years Ive learned proper procedures on how it should have worked. It was just disapointing at the time. Felt like I gave away alota cash for no reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0669o?context=5)|And that's a shame. I believe that unions need to educate their members on how to contact them and their rights in general. 
[Do you think porn talent should unionize? If so, how would starting a union from 'scratch' work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc090ho?context=5)|I do think it should. There needs to be a standard of safety regulations and enforcement.
 |You wouldn't need to start from scratch. I believe SEIU represented the peep show Lusty Lady in San Francisco. It was the only organized peep show in the nation. :) 
[Are there any unions that you think are out if control and need to be reigned in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc08lt0?context=5)|The MTA is awful. The amount of disability fraud is staggering within that union. Ultimately only union members can change their leadership 
[What do you try to achieve the most in your unions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07otp?context=5)|An equal and fair working environment. We try to maintain wages while understanding that things do change. When I worked at the entertainment union, we actively looked at the ""books"" of employers with their permission so we could better understand what would keep the industry alive. We were lucky in that our top employers didn't really try to low ball on wages because they knew they needed our members as badly as we needed their films/theatre/cabarets...
 |Safety is also a huge factor. A lot of times this types of concerns can be address for minimal cost and completely change the moral of a unit. 
[Do you feel that all members of the union should be paid equally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07xol?context=5)|I would say that my answer applies to all industries but my experience has been with entertainment. I recently moved into something more mainstream.
[ what (broad if you prefer\) industry are we talking about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07xol?context=5)|As far as people being paid equally, yes and no. I think there should be a base salary that is livable and that wages should increase across the the board based upon cost of living. On top of that, I believe in the idea of Merit raises. The annual raise should be simply to keep up with the economy and then I think if you work harder, you should be given other incentives such as an added vacation day, promotion to a team lead (with a monetary increase) or some monetary amount per week/hour/day... The hard part is convincing employers that a merit raise is a good idea. THey think because everyone got a cost of living raise that they don't deserve anything else when as I said before, the COL raise should simply be about keeping up. 
[So workers generally don't want to fight for extra wages after they get a raise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc08c3e?context=5)|I think they would be willing to work harder with a merit raise incentive. Or incentive tied to production.
[Also, have you ever organized a strike and how did it turn out? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc08c3e?context=5)|I've been involved in campaigns where we don't cross picket lines but I have not been involved with a strike. It turned out well for the unions because all of the different unions joined together to deal with an employer who had unfair labor practices going back 12 years. 
[Do you feel that the employer is wrong if he fires striking workers, or do you believe that he's justified in doing so? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0a3wi?context=5)|He is completely in the wrong. There are many circumstances where it's illegal to do so actually. 
[In what cases is it illegal, and why do you feel that it's wrong?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bptq?context=5)|Section 8(a)(4) of the NLRA states that you cannot punish someone for supporting the union. What they can do is ""permanently replace"" them but then the fired employees must be hired back if the job opens up again. That is a law many unions are trying to change.
[Are unions dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09205?context=5)|Not at all. They just have trouble marketing themselves. 
[How can they fix that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09xdw?context=5)|Some of it should start with congress loosening the rules on unions. In the years since the NLRA was created, laws were changed to ease things on employers but the archaic union laws are the same.
[But I mean why can they do to face the systematic anti union marketing campaigns that the right has been putting out for the past decades?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0dlsp?context=5)|I think the AFL-CIO can spend more time and energy educating the public and working with law makers to help them realize that they are literally destroying the middle class.
[The law-makers and the powers that be KNOW that they're destroying the middle class. That's the plan. To have a world of obedient wage slaves. To counter this, I believe more people need to look into the IWW, and what they do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0duio?context=5)|Without the purchasing power of the middle class, the economy will continue to tank. 
[Wouldn't it also help if the unions were not strangling business by demanding wages and benefits above and beyond the value of the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0gfj1?context=5)|I dont think you can honestly say that all unions do that. Where I work, we actively concession with our employers to make things fair. We've done wage freezes and things like that. The extreme cases you hear on the news unfortunately make us all look bad.
[What do you think are some of the best practices (in terms of contracts\) that people who are not in unions don't know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc073jr?context=5)|It's not bravery at all. I think there is a lot of misinformation about unions out there so I hope I help some folks.
[Those are good. I think that overall, the value of transparency in the pay scale is a model that should be adopted more widely. Why shouldn't everyone know the pay range of everyone else in the company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07yiq?context=5)|I agree with that and if you work for a labor union, you can see the salaries in the LM2's. We used those in negotiations often.
[Do you think the U.S. will ever see a livable minimum wage? What obstacles do you see to this becoming a reality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bgnw?context=5)|I hope we will and the biggest obstacle is the relationship between corporations and congressmen. Politicians can and will be bought to keep the middle class down. 
[Do you think that unions foster a bad work ethic sometimes? I worked with a bunch if guys who had a mentality of 'it doesn't matter if I do a shitty job, the union won't let them fire me'. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0dogq?context=5)|No. I think people do that all on their own. I've seen people fired for not doing their job but I said in another comment, being a ""bare minimum"" worker is everyones right. If you're being to paid to do a job, you do not need to go above and beyond if you don't want to. I think it's a terrible attitude to take but i don't think people can be fired for doing the job they were hired to do and nothing more. 
[Does the employer *have* to give a reason to fire, or are they limited by providing reasons for termination?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0dzsc?context=5)|It depends on the contract and on the state.
 |Edit: forgot a word!
[Have you been keeping track of the BART strike situtaion in the Bay Area? If so, do the union's demands seem as unreasonably high to you as they do to me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0ba43?context=5)|I have been and quite honestly, they can't even agree on the average salary for these employees. It seems like neither side is going to win here.
[You didn't answer the second part of the question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0ggh9?context=5)|I apologize. My reply was referring to the fact that not living in SF, I cant even figure out what their actual demands are or what they are currently making. I haven't done alot of research, I just follow what I hear in the news. I think the union likely has a motive for not making more concessions but I really don't have any insight here.
[Legally what is the maximum amount of hours a person can work in one day?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc08plt?context=5)|24 as long as you are paid appropriately and given the legal number of breaks. 
[Why do unions support open borders immigration laws? It sounds like the union leadership selling out the workers. The more immigrant workers in the country the more competition for low wage jobs, the lower the pay will be. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0c92s?context=5)|Both of my unions didn't take a stance on that but I would imagine it's because they're hear already so we want to get them legal and represented. Thats just a guess.
[Follow up question:  How do you feel personally about legalizing illegal immigrants and/or open border laws, or how do you personally feel unions should act?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0dk9c?context=5)|On a personal level? I think we should legalize those that want to be here and pay taxes. I dont really have an opinion on unions and immigration.
[It would seem that this is one of, if not THE single most important issue facing unions and union workers today.  I'm surprised you don't have an opinion on how a sudden influx of millions of low-skilled workers would effect unionized workers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0du7x?context=5)|I said I have a personal opinion. Of course it will affect unions but it would be another group to represent if it happens. 
[*but it would be another group to represent if it happens.*  Aka more money for the leadership/political cronies, yes?  Doesn't matter that the rank and file, the workers, will inevitably get screwed over.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0e1xt?context=5)|No. Because our pay isn't tied to resenting a new group of workers. I don't get a bonus every time we represent someone else. 
[Sorry I missed the AMA. Wanted to thank you for taking the time and effort to have the event.  Is Labor Day even recognized outside of the United States?  It's a tragedy we lost all knowledge of May Day in just a couple generations. Instead of a celebration of workers solidarity and a struggle for workplace rights, we know have ""Labor Day"" that conflates workers with managers and owners! ""We're all on the same side!"" and ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" is the motto of Labor Day, effectively white-washing class tensions and rising inequality.  Surveys show Americans are less happy than a couple generations ago and less healthy as well. What has happened to the concept of the ""commons"" and the ""public good""? As Robert Reich asks in his new documentary *""Inequality for All""*, who is looking out for the working class?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bzvb?context=5)|The working class needs to look out for each other and that's what unions provide. 
[I believe that the FiCore fees are the same as Fair Share, but I could be mistaken. How about my first question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0dnb2?context=5)|I can't speak for UAW and how they use their funds. How do they not help with bargaining? Is your union rep not present at all during negotiations? I'm confused.
[Are there laws in place that make it illegal to withhold breaks for adults?  I'm already aware of minor labor laws requiring breaks, but are there any such laws in place federally?  Or for my state, Ohio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0fwdl?context=5)|[Link to www.dol.gov](http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/workhours/breaks.htm)  Those are the federal regulations. Your state may have stricter rules.
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc05tvv?context=5)|I emailed the mods to see what they want as proof but I'd rather not list it publicly. I have business cards and paystubs. I've also been a member of two unions in the time I've been working for them.
 |Follow up: I'm verified.
[What do you do in the union(s\) that you are answering labor laws questions? If I was an impound lot worker I wouldn't do an AMA on parking laws.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0ff8a?context=5)|I've done a few things at labor unions. When I started I worked with contracts. I was the front line to answer questions and deal with situations as they came up between employees and employers.  Also, I am formally educated from an accredited university in labor relations which involved understanding the law.
[Also, what is your opinion on the Central State Teamsters pension plans? 40% funded and 24 billion behind in funds. Now they want the PBCG to take the responsibility of covering what they haven't planned for.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0ff8a?context=5)|I dont have an opinion on the Teamsters pension plans.

[How do you feel about employ owned businesses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0ddw9?context=5)|Whatever works for them! I don't think unions are needed everywhere. i think employment contracts should be standard across the world. You should have a clear expectations of duties and what not to do. I also believe there need to be steps and procedures for promotion and discipline outlined in these contracts.
[Even though it was a couple years ago, what do you think of the union co-option (mainly SEIU\) of the Occupy movement? I love and support unions, but I was utterly disgusted by the union ""support"" and ultimate takeover of Occupy which I feel eventually led to its demise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0g469?context=5)|I dont think SEIU had much to do with OWS demise. I was in support of the movement as a private citizen and even I thought they handled it badly. Having a movement with no leader and no real focus was the issue.
 |I dont think SEIU should've gotten involved but thats just my personal opinion as well. 
[I work as a contractor,overseas,12 hour days,seven days a week.Our first forty hours we get,uplift and hazardous duty pay.Our next 44 hours we get paid overtime straight,which is just our hourly pay.How is this legal?  I work for a large defense contractor in Afghanistan.Let me say my hourly is 21.00.My first forty hours are paid my hourly wage (21.00\) plus 35 per cent for uplift-which is 7.00 more and hour, plus another 35 per cent for hazardous duty which is 7.00 more an hour.  So my first forty hours I am paid 35.00 per hour.  My next 44 hours I am paid 21.00 dollars an hour-this is called overtime straight.Just wondering how is this legal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0aw3v?context=5)|Can you break that down for me a bit more?

Can you shed some light on these alleged abuses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0fjal?context=5)|I spoke about it somewhere else in this thread. They is no regard for safety in alot of these places and there is also a disregard for break times. Those are just scratching the surface of the indignities low wage workers face. 
[What do you do? Work in the union office or are you a blue collar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0g8lj?context=5)|I work in a union office and was a member of two different unions as a staff member. My current position is not unionized.
[I work with unions around the country that use my companies  dues tracking and receipt writing program. What system are you using. If you prefer a pm is fine. I am just wondering if. We have met or talked. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0gfy2?context=5)|Im sure we haven't met because I've never worked in the dues area.

Im gonna be honest... the money isn't that good. I also think power of the years corrupted union leaders in a lot of way and it gave us a bad rep.
[If the money isn't that good you guys should form a union. Unionize the union workers! Un-ception!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0gp2m?context=5)|Actually, I've been a union member twice while working at labor unions. We are paid according with what our union can afford. it is also easy for us to make sure we aren't getting low balled because wage reporting is required for labor unions via an LM2.
[You're an employee of the union, of course the money isn't that good. I honestly can't think of a circumstance in this country today, that would dictate the need for a labor union.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0fgtg?context=5)|Then you're not watching the news.
[I am frustrated for not being able to be a part of the union in my area.  There is simply not enough union jobs but tons of non-union work is available.  In this regard I am frustrated that unions are of no help for me.  It was my understanding unions were put in place for workers like myself, and yet it appears the unions in my industry are very much full of nepotism.  Though I would love to be a member I do not see why I should support them.  I don't really know what my question is.  Just that the whole thing I find very frustrating.  Being a union rep do you have any advice for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0dl5r?context=5)|Sure. If you want it bad enough and if you're in a unionized industry... talk to your coworkers and then talk to a union rep. It's not easy to get represented but it's worth it. You should support them because hopefully the more powerful we become, the more we can add union jobs and represent new workers. 
[Do you mind PMs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09o0b?context=5)|Nope. Go for it. 
[Have you heard about the UK intern @ a bank in Britain (I think\) working 3 days straight and dying as a result?  I first saw the story linked on Reddit, but I'm sure you can find it with a little investigation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bdmq?context=5)|I heard about it but I think it was Bank of America. I dont know enough to comment on it.
[I was fired for making a mistake on something i was not instructed on. do i have any rights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0dbaz?context=5)|It depends on the text of the contract. If you are in a union, talk to your union rep (not your steward) if not, seek legal advice.
[With the fact that our country (USA\) has pretty extensive labor laws, why do we need unions? It seems to me that it results in many entry level positions being paid considerably more than they're worth. With the increased wage, it would seem to me, that as the head of..say a manufacturing company, that it would be more cost effective to outsource the labor to other countries. By outsourcing these jobs, there are less jobs available, so in turn there's less money being injected back into our economy. So I guess my question for you is, why do we need unions in present day America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0f3u5?context=5)|Awesome question! Labor law doesn't even come CLOSE to covering everything. OSHA laws cover general situations but do not always cover specific issues that might come up in the work place. FMLA is also great but it does not mean you will get paid for maternity leave or family leave. Also, if you are fired form a non-union job in an at-will state then that's it. As long it wasn't because of a federally protected reason, you're out of luck. With a union, you are usually entitled to a grievance or arbitration at no cost to you if you feel you were unjustly fired.
 |My feeling is that if you can make 14 billion by outsourcing jobs then thats you're right but I believe is it in the best interest of our country to say, make 10 billion and put money back into the american workforce.
[Hierarchal structures was one of the many issues that occupy stood against. No ""real"" focus? Occupy encompassed many important issues that needed, and still need, dealt with. Single issue activism is archaic, intersectionality is where it's at. But, I don't mean to derail your AMA ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0gcbu?context=5)|We can discuss via PM if you're interested but I didn't mean they had no causes. I think they had too many and it made it hard to get anything done. 
[Do US unions celebrate May 1st (which, you know, commemorates an event that happened in the US\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0e701?context=5)|Not that I know of. 
[Wow you hit almost all the bullet points. Although you forgot to mention the part where no union member can ever be fired for any reason. And the $26/hr thing is a little too obvious. Maybe tone it down to 18 or 20 so it's a little more believable. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0f8zh?context=5)|Union members can be fired for not doing their job. You're making an exaggerated statement. 
[How do you think states legalizing marijuana will affect laws surrounding drug test, or people losing there job due to testing positive for marijuana.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bz2d?context=5)|Less people will lose their jobs over an archaic law. However, think about this. Pot stays in your system for a while. There's no way to tell if you smoked 2 hours ago or 2 days ago so how can you tell if a nurse or doctor was high while treating you? I think there will need to be a serious discussion about how to deal with this on a collective bargaining end.  
[This needs to be answered or OP is dodging the most critical issue regarding unions...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0figj?context=5)|I'm not dodging. I said it in another comment that I have zero experience with public unions. I've never been a member of one nor have I worked for one. I know what I hear from my friends who work in them which is obviously biased and the reason I couldn't responsibly answer the question. 
[No question, but thank you for having the lady-balls to do this ama. Unions are, at least where I'm from, a very divisive issue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0h1v7?context=5)|Hah! I wasn't gonna reply anymore but I love the phrase lady-balls. It is a divisive issue but I strongly believe in what they once stood for and will hopefully stand for again. 
[Unions kill jobs. Just look at all of the people who lost jobs when hostess went out of business because of union demands. The time for unions has passed, they now do more harm than good. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc06u1v?context=5)|That is a completely unsupported statement. I know plenty of unions that protect their members and work hard / make concessions to avoid things like Hostess. The union agreed to 100 million in concessions. What more did you want to see them do? Unions are needed more than ever right now. Benefits are being slashed, hours are being expanded while pay is plummeting. 
[Why are you guys so against ""Right to Work"" that is the only reason I have a job right now. I just want to know what is so bad about ""Right to Work"" that you guys are so adamantly against it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0fs1l?context=5)|How is right to work the only reason you have a job? Can you explain further because I think you are confused on what that means.

Before we start, I just want to say that I’m not particularly proud of how I handled myself at these first few internships. The reason I’m sharing my story is that I hope it can be an encouragement to others. Especially a younger audience that may be doubting their career path.

Do you guys know any websites that can help me learn the basics and get into it before college. But yet the way they teach it isn't extremely dull where ill end up losing interest before i can even put it to work? I've been reading, and it said math isn't to important.

My concern is my Math grades. Would it be worth retaking the classes (primarily Math 126), would it be better to focus on getting higher grades this year?

I recently started a part-time position with a small company whose employees work remotely. I had been working with them for 4 months as an unpaid intern, and was looking forward to finally getting paid.

After dragging me along about this potential position for a couple months, we finally had a skype meeting about me taking over as content manager and social media manager. We agreed on an amount that we both thought could work (me and the founder - there are only 7 people in this company total). It was a bit confusing because we were talking about part-time, 20 hours a week, but also discussed the salary in full-time terms since there was a possibility for the position to become full time in the future.

So, 2 months later I check my bank account, and see my two deposits from them are half of what we agreed to for my wage. I asked the founder about it, and he claimed that that was the correct amount, and he was sorry for any misunderstanding, but that was what I would be paid. I was flabbergasted, because I am POSITIVE that is not what we agreed to - I would never have accepted the position. 

I went back through my emails and have nothing in writing. On top of all this, I've been working well over my allotted 20 hours for them because they are giving me a lot to do and I enjoy the work. Now I just feel angry and frustrated and don't know what to do - do I argue with him more about it? Just quit immediately? I also really can't tell if he is sincerely confused or is trying to rip me off.

To make things even weirder - they are flying me out to a company meeting in a few weeks. It's in a cool area I'd like to visit, so I want to go before I do anything drastic. Then again, I feel like I should bring up this pay issue ASAP if I want any chance of resolving it (we discussed the issue originally a few days ago). 

I've been out of school for three years, and have previous experience with content writing and marketing. The pay they are offering me now is less than what I got for my first internship out of college. I don't know what to do because I love the company and enjoy the work, but the pay isn't acceptable for me. Any advice?"

I attend a relatively large university for my state. As of this August, I am completing my last round of classes online, as I have moved out of state. The school is not a major research university, and I have not had any success asking for advice or guidance from the PhD's there.

I would like some advice on how to find and participate in research in my field that isn't sponsored by my university. The town I am currently in does have a major research university, and they are doing research in several areas in which I am interested. Their website makes it quite clear they give preference to applicants with research experience, of which I have none.

If it helps, I think I am a good candidate otherwise. I have a 3.94 GPA, have completed a minor in Mathematics with a 4.0, belong to several nationally recognized honor societies (including Pi Mu Epsilon), was a Senator in the SGA, was the secretary of our campus' CS Club, and I accepted and worked a CS internship over the summer, after which the company decided to keep me on as a remote worker. 

From what I have read on my own, my best option might be to write a paper for a conference, like something sponsored by the IEEE. Without the guidance of professor/mentor, I am at a loss of how to start this process, or if there are other options that are better. Any advice would be much appreciated.

[Did you quit? Why? Best and worst thing about working for Disney? Was it hard to be nice to EVERYONE? Best behind the scenes story?  And what is your favorite Disney Movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nb2g?context=5)|The best thing about working for Disney was probably getting to learn the secret ins and outs of how things worked behind the scenes.  The worst part was that sometimes I was a little bored.  If you're working outdoors as a character during the summer you spend 20 minutes meeting and greeting people, then a long time inside cooling off (can't remember exactly how long--I want to say 40 mins-1 hour).  So that's a lot of break time!   It was hard to be nice to everyone some days, but it was made way easier because (the majority of the time) no one could see my face.  So if I felt snarky with some guests I didn't have to smile to them, talk to them nicely, etc.  That was easier on me than regular social interaction would have been for me (believe it or not I'm an introvert!).  I think that any employee who has face-to-face guest contact would have had a way harder time than I did being ""on"" or nice all the time.  I will say, though, that the vast majority of the people I knew who worked for Disney in that capacity were extroverts and the niceness came naturally to them.   I was working at Chef Mickey's (one of my favorite places--I really liked doing character dining shifts) one night--I was ""friends with"" Dale.  It was the end of the evening, so the majority of the guests had left the restaurant.  There was an older girl there--maybe about 6--who LOVED Dale, and her family was finishing up.  She said, ""Dale!  You're my biggest fan!  Can I have your autograph?!""  I thought it was a cute slip of the tongue--so did the adults at the table--so I hugged her, etc, and then signaled that I would be back in a moment.  I knew there was a printer close by backstage that had a piece of computer paper in it.  I went back and grabbed one, then signaled that I wanted her autograph too.  I signed half the paper for her, and she signed the other for me.  She was really excited!  I still have the piece of paper she signed :)  One more story because it's really hard to pick just one!  I had covered the lunch shift for the people in Toon Town, and the other characters that were working with me were all full time and good friends.  They asked me if I would come with them and ""make some backstage magic.""  I said sure!  So we randomly picked an office in the tunnel--I'm not even sure who worked there or what they did--and just caused trouble in it.  It was GREAT!  The cast members were so excited!  We pretended to steal stuff off of their desks, wrote all over their marker boards, made pretend phone calls, etc.  The group must have done this before because one guy said, ""I've been bringing my camera to work every day in case you ever came back!""  He took a picture of me on his work phone with my feet up on his desk.  It's cool to make good memories for guests, but it's also really special to make another cast member's day!
[I was there in 2005 and there was a group who would do this back them. I wonder if it was the same group. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nvg1?context=5)|Could be!  They were great--I ended up working with them a lot!
[I heard that there is a secret jail at Disneyland where they detain people who are too drunk to be in public or are tripping on drugs.  Any truth to the rumor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nrpu?context=5)|I don't know a whole lot about this, but I do know they have ways to hold people.  Once I was backstage at EPCOT and saw what looked like holding cells.  I also saw the place where the drug/bomb-sniffing dogs that they have for security reasons.  They were cute!
 |What is actually more interesting to me is the room they have near Guest Relations in the Magic Kingdom.  I never saw it, but was told by a reliable source that they have a room where they take irate guests.  It's decorated nicely but has absolutely nothing Disney-related in it--because they don't want to enrage you further, I guess.  The psychology of that is interesting to me!
[Have you ever been assaulted? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0n9lb?context=5)|I was never assaulted by a guest, but I was assaulted (sexually) backstage by another cast member.  
[How did that go down? Was it a supervisor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0npiy?context=5)|It happened during my first week there while I was training in a crowded dressing room.  I don't actually know who the guy was--I mean, it happened really quickly and afterward I couldn't recall his name.
 |I reported it, but I don't think anything came of it.

Edit: grammar ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0o5lt?context=5)|The worst part was that the person who helped me fill out the report said something like, ""Well, what I've found is that theatre people have less boundaries than people do normally.""  As if that excused what happened.  I was younger then and (obviously) vulnerable.  I did say something back about how that was irrelevant, but it REALLY boils my blood to think about it now.
[Edit- also which housing area did you live in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nl3k?context=5)|Characters are all done by height.  I mainly played Chip and Dale and Figment.
 |My Disney height is weird--I'm 5'4, which means I'm too tall/too short for a lot of characters.  I'm honestly not super sure why they hired me because I don't fit an in-demand height range!
[What height are the Disney princesses? :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0x7d3?context=5)|When I was there it started at 5'4 and ended somewhere around 5'9. 
[Were you face or fur?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0n9rd?context=5)|Fur!  I did show my face in the Magic Kingdom afternoon parade and in the Christmas tree lighting show, but never played a face character.
[Is it true that Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse broke up because Donald Duck said he had a three way with Minnie and Goofy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nlxq?context=5)|I assume you're kidding, but cast members in Entertainment joke about this CONSTANTLY--well, they joke that Max, Goofy's son, looks like a combination of Minnie and Goofy.  So they say that Minnie and Goofy had a baby and it was Max.  Some people who played Minnie even used to be like ""Goofy can you zip me up?"" and try to act all sexy about it (there's nothing sexy about it in actuality because you look ridiculous under the costume) or grind up on each other.  It might have been funny the first time by the 100th time you hear/see that it's just stupid.
[You know, I was born in Orlando. I live a bit north now (Jax area...not going to say exactly because, obvious\). But I always thought it would be nice to work there. I used to go there every weekend when my dad worked there in the early days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0q105?context=5)|The working conditions are largely very good.  They work hard to make sure you feel safe at all times, etc.  The costumes I wore were always clean.  The rules are also very clear, so if you follow them it's easy to keep your job.
[So how are the working conditions? What would you say is the hardest work you've had to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0q105?context=5)|Depending on the job, though, it can be quite hot and will most likely have some thankless aspects (like every job I've ever had).  If you're an extroverted, generally positive person that will most definitely help.
[If I ever did move back to Orlando, I would not mind giving it a shot. (For the record, I've never had a job :P\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0q105?context=5)|It's probably the hardest work I've ever had to do physically simply because of the heat+costume (which have no air conditioning)+moving, though getting carts in from an asphalt covered grocery store parking lot in 90+ heat/humidity is a close second.  :)  
[Ever been inside Club 33? what is it like inside?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0pt5l?context=5)|I haven't been inside Club 33!  There was an AMA of someone who has been a longtime member, though--here's a link: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rz72/iama_club_33_member_by_request/) 
[What's the pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nt2u?context=5)|Really low.  I believe I made 6-something an hour--but remember that was in 2006-2007.  Entertainment cast members (in the college program made more an hour than those that worked in other areas of the park.
 |If you're full time/part time (and not in the college program), you make slightly more an hour, but it's still dismal pay.  People I knew who were shorter and had more in-demand characters in their height range could make significantly more by picking up shifts.  If there were less than a certain number of hours between your shifts you got ""turn-around"" pay, which I believe was either time and a half or double time.  But, in general, no one there is in it for the money.
 |I should also note that people who do face characters get more an hour as well--something hotly contested among cast members.
[What kind of freebies do you get?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0pqbr?context=5)|When I was working there (things might have changed since then), I could get into the parks free any time.  I got what was called a Blue Pass that allowed me to get me+3 guests into the parks (one day park hopper tickets) 6 times per calendar year.  I also got a Christmas season bonus pack of coupons that allowed me to get myself +3 people in an additional day.  We also got 1 admission for the same number of people to a water park.
 |We got 10% off certain quick service food, but that was extremely limited.  We could get a significant amount off of a full service dining restaurant (I want to say 20-40%) a limited amount of times a year, plus some extras for the Christmas season.
 |The Christmas season coupon pack also included 6 coupons for free popcorn and sodas, and some coupons for discounts on merchandise.  I also got a cast member Christmas gift--a sort of cheap silver frame that said something like ""Thanks for making dreams come true"" in it.
 |There were few true freebies aside from the park entrances, and, let's face it, if you or you and your family went to the parks you were going to spend a fair amount on food, souvenirs, etc.
 |People who were higher up in the company had what I believe was called a silver pass that allowed them to take themselves +3 people into the parks as much as they wanted.
 |Also--there were blackout dates on the passes for everyone that included the busiest days of the year, like Christmas Eve/Day, New Year's Eve, etc.  So if I wasn't scheduled to work on one of those days I wouldn't be allowed into the parks at all for free--and I definitely couldn't bring any guests.
 |In addition to freebies/discounts, they also gave cast members the opportunity to purchase exclusive merchandise at Company D--a small store that sold things like key chains, sweatshirts/tee-shirts, and some cast member only pins for trading.  There was also a store adjacent to the employee parking lot for the Magic Kingdom that sold discounted merchandise that guests didn't buy.  Next to that was a trailer that sold merchandise that was damaged in some way and (no lie) things that guests either lost or left behind.  There were designer sunglasses, expensive jewelry, cameras, strollers, etc--all that were unclaimed by guests. 
[Is it true that when someone yells ""Andy is coming!"" You all have to fall to the ground and play dead? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0polj?context=5)|I've seen pictures of that on Reddit but never heard of it while I was working there.  I've also read that they had to stop doing that because people were saying it too much :(
 |I was never scheduled to play any of the Toy Story characters myself (though Jessie and Bullseye were in my height range), nor did I know anyone who did--so I can't speak from personal experience in that regard.
[Thanks for the response :\) I've heard its a myth. Maybe someone else will chime in!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0pqup?context=5)|I suppose I can also add that laying on the ground is definitely not strictly allowed according to the rules we're told in training.  So it's also possible that enough people did it that managers found out and put a stop to it!
[When I was there everyone went to the clubs at Pleasure Island (PI\) two nights a week. Cast members didn't have a cover those nights. There was also a place called Jungle Jim's (I think\) and the piano bar on the boardwalk. I have heard that the PI clubs were closed and turned into restaurants and stuff like that. Were they still open when you were there? And if not is there still a place where all the crazy cp's go to get drunk and dance it off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0oagg?context=5)|That's right!  I'm not much of a partier myself, but I went to the Adventurer's Club a couple of times.  Everything was open when I was there, but they had (I believe) announced the closing.
 |I don't think there's a place where CP's party now...the last time I was there (I was a guest) PI was a ghost town.  I think you can rent the spaces for private functions, though.
[Random, but is it true that all the cast members have to share underwear for the costumes?  I'm not sure if that's an urban legend or not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0sl5p?context=5)|Not at all--you wear your own underwear--they don't provide it.  Basically they give you shorts and a tee-shirt for under the costume and that's it.
[Also, is it true that the ""face characters"" are a little crazy?  I had a friend who swore by this, as you get a lot of women who are obsessed with Disney Princesses and what not whose life goal is to *be* Ariel or whoever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0sl5p?context=5)|Sure, there were some face characters that were a little ""crazy"" if by that you mean obsessed with themselves as princesses.  But I would say that there are some people in just about every department there that are a little ""crazy"" in that their life dream is to work for Disney.  There was definitely a caste system within the cast members, though.  People generally ate lunch with their own--and most face characters ate with each other and not with the fur characters.  On the other hand, I knew some really nice people who played face characters too.  It just depends on the person!
[This might seem like kind of an abstract question, but since working there, do you at all feel like you've contributed at all to the Disney legacy? For some reason, I have always had this ideal that when you're employed by Disney in any capacity really that you're essentially making magic happen for children (and adults that are still children at heart, I suppose\). Did you feel that at all while working there or was it mostly just ""another job"" for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0rzlc?context=5)|This is an interesting question!
 |I wouldn't say that it was just another job for me because I felt like I had a responsibility to do it to the best of my ability and was emotionally invested in that.  However, I would say that the Company is so big now that I definitely felt like we were treated like cogs in a wheel.  I felt very replaceable, which was true, but it still doesn't feel good to be treated like that.  I think this is something that a lot of hourly employees felt.  It didn't so much matter to those of us doing an internship, but it makes me sad for people who worked full time.  
[I am currently a student and majoring in theatre. I am hoping to go into performance, but working for Disney as a face character has always been something I considered. How hard was it for you to get a job with Disney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nxc1?context=5)|When I was auditioning it was less difficult than it is now, I believe--at least if you go through the College Program.  Now the competition for the internship is higher because it's paid and more kids who are graduating can't find jobs right away.
 |It depends a lot on your height--if you're really short (I would say 5'2 and below) or quite tall (6'0 and up) then you'll have an easier time.  If you want to be a face character then anywhere between 5'4-5'9 is good (if you're a girl)--they changed those height ranges while I was there, so I can't be 100% positive on those numbers.  But slightly taller than average was preferred when I was there.
 |When you audition (or at least when I did), we had to do an animation exercise ""Pretend you're eating your favorite snack at the parks!"" and also learn a simple musical theatre-style dance combination.  If you showed some dance ability then you got to learn a harder combination.  There were also some puppetry auditions, but I'm not sure what they did with you in those or how they picked people--I did the harder dance one instead.
 |So it's pretty much about if you can communicate through movement--and it's good to have an extra skill on top.  Bear in mind that everyone does fur, including face characters.  So it's possible that they'd hire you to do fur, then you could be pulled to do a face audition (you put on wig/makeup and read from a script) afterward.
[I started going regularly to WDW in 2010 and have had an annual pass ever since.  I've probably seen the daytime parade at least 50 times in MK.  I'm am almost positive every now and then Alice is actually a guy in a wig and dress.  Once I noticed she (he?\) had an Adam's apple and totally the face of a guy.  Is this something common?  I mean, every meet and greet character where they speak obviously they match up gender to the gender of the character, but does this happen a lot on the parade characters?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc10245?context=5)|Nope-that's never true!  Face characters are always the right sex-fur characters it varies.  
[Did it spoil the magic of characters to you when you visit DL because you were once one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0puik?context=5)|I haven't been to Disneyland yet, but I've been back to Disney World several times since working there.
 |In some ways some of the magic is spoiled.  Interestingly enough it didn't ruin anything to see the costumes all hanging in racks or the characters' heads all lined up--it's more the screwing around that went on backstage that disillusioned me a little bit.
 |There are some aspects that are more fun now that I've worked there, though.  I've visited some of my friends who worked full time while they're on set, and it's a lot of fun to meet them in character.  I also like looking for familiar faces in the parades/shows, and I enjoy seeing them.  I have a greater appreciation for how hard the cast members--at least most of them--work.  
[I hope so too! I have never been to the 4 parks and I hope to head out there mid-late January! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0ph4g?context=5)|Have fun!  As I recall that's not a super-crowded time, which will be nice!

[Best part about working at Disney ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0os7q?context=5)|Learning the ins and outs of the ""behind the scenes"" stuff (How do the parade floats coordinate the music with speakers in the streets?  Where do employees eat?  What do the tunnels look like?)--but I also liked making kids/adults I met/performed for happy.
[So who were you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0vec0?context=5)|Mostly Chip and Dale, but also Figment and one of the penguins from Mary Poppins!
 |I was also an animator in the Magic Kingdom afternoon parade.
[When you went through traditions, did you feel like you were joining a cult? I sure as hell did.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0zjnx?context=5)|Ha!   To an extent, yes.  Disney definitely tries to sell you on how working for them is different/special.  It made me a little sad to see people just drinking it all in and not thinking critically about what they were hearing.
 |I don't think we're typical employees-let's put it that way. 
[Do employees really call it Mouschwitz? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc12d9k?context=5)|I never heard that term used, but it used to be awful to be a character working at the restaurant Crystal Palace in the Magic Kingdom.   The workers called that place crystal prison. 
[Have you had the opportunity to go inside Cinderella's castle?  My best friend and his wife (die hard Disney fans\) are dying for the chance to get in there but have no clue who/how to start.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0xxku?context=5)|I assume you mean the hotel suite they built inside the castle?  I was there when they were building it,  but I've never seen it in person.  I imagine that someday you might be able to pay a lot to stay there, but right now you can't.
 |They could look in to having breakfast or dinner in the restaurant there, though!   Perhaps that's better than nothing!

[I was there about 15 years ago and we were able to take a tour of the tunnels. It was very cool. Not sure if they still offer that. (It was an extra cost.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nrep?context=5)|As far as I know they still do that!  They only show you the nice parts of the tunnels though :p!
[Does disney really have an underground ciry of tunnels and if so how often does the avg employee use them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nacl?context=5)|Yes, in Disney World!  They run under every part of the park except for where Toon Town was.  The average employee uses them on a daily basis.  I can't think of anyone who worked there who didn't go in the tunnel at some point.  It's where the employee cafeteria is (the Mousecateria), some breakrooms, where the Entertainment case members get their costumes, places to clock in, etc.  There's even a (tiny) barber shop!
 |The tunnels aren't very nice, though--they're just all cement floors, etc.  They are also stinky in some places!  They're a lot bigger than I imagined--you can drive a truck the size of a small u-haul into them.  I saw armored trucks, for example, picking up flats of money--they fit very easily.
[My parents used to work there. So every time we would go past an entrance to the tunnels they would point them out. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0rrbx?context=5)|:)

I currently attend Temple University and commute there because I managed to land an internship before college and wanted to continue working at the internship while going to college. Obviously. So I chose a university close enough to me so I could commute and it still be cheap for tuition and all. Even though it has only been a week into classes, I'm starting to learn that I would rather a different setting for my college rather than North Philadelphia and possibly one that has a better reputation for engineering.

My question is: 

What would look better on a job application after graduation? An internship for the next 4 years along with a degree at a lesser known college for engineering or just taking the 2 years I will have at the internship and getting a degree at a better known engineering college? I would also like to attend grad school either in Pennsylvania or California if that would weigh into any of your responses.

Thanks so much for any help you guys can give me, :)"

After countless applications and dozens of interviews, I just can't seem to land any kind of development job.

At first I was super enthusiastic about every single interview and spent lots of time reviewing frequently asked concepts and browsing this subreddit. But I just can't keep it up anymore, rejection after rejection is really getting to me and now, every time I pick up ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" or open Eclipse my heart aches with disappointment and grief. I've become afraid of anything related to CS. I can only think of my failure in all those interviews whenever I'm reminded of CS careers.

After realizing that the biggest factor for my failure is my lack of actual development experience, I've tried doing some of my own projects in android, iphone and even BB10 ffs. But my motivation to keep at it is decreasing and my financial debt is increasing. 

At this point I'm considering trying to get a job at McDonald's for basic necessities and forget that I ever had a degree in CS.

I wish I can just get some kind of positive feedback. Even a ""would you like to work as an intern instead?"" would be fine.

Sorry if I sound like I'm just ranting but this is such an important point in my life and its really getting to me. Seeing all your good friends from school move on with their lives and enjoying California with a developer's salary certainly doesn't help.

Should I consider completely switching fields? Or going back to school for another degree? I want to just get some kind of foothold into the industry. What should I do?"

I'm in my first year of my teaching program, and my university starts field experience in three weeks. We do a 2 day a week placement in one high school this year, with a full internship next fall. 

I found out today that my placement will be at a Catholic high school.   I am bisexual, but in a relationship with a man (I'm a lady), have many queer friends and family, and am quite atheist. The Catholic school system in my city is not extremely religious, but does have morning prayers and Christian ethics courses. 

Someone else who had been placed at the school brought this up in class with our professor today, and he explained that it could be a good opportunity to learn about other school environments and acceptance of other beliefs, and if someone had serious conflicts he would be open to trying to find a solution. We did not have any input into which schools we were placed at. 

So, r/teachers, my question to you is: 

1. Should I talk to my professor about feeling uncomfortable in this situation, or try to make the best of this opportunity,

2. Any tips on field experience as a whole?

3. any tips or advice on going into a school with different values than your own?

Thanks :) "

I've taken only one theoretical computer science class, Data Structures and Algorithms. I originally intended on doing research in computer science and I'm beginning to realize that my university has done absolutely nothing for preparing me for this.

When I came in as a freshman, my major was declared as ""computer science"", and the course descriptions were highly glorified. After my freshman year ended, my advisor strong armed me into changing my major to ""applied computer science"", saying that it would make everything easier for the university and that they would really only be offering the courses for that major anyway.

I have a little bit of [outside work](https://github.com/evanandrewrose) and I worked an internship as a software engineer this past summer, but I feel like I lack the theoretical and mathematical background to pursue career in research. I feel that I would have been much better off if I had just taught myself computer science and majored in mathematics.

So now I'm thinking I could get a BSc in math from a reputable university and then follow it up with research in computer science. Does this sound like a respectable path to begin venturing on? I'm slightly worried because I already feel like I have wasted ~$20,000 on a degree that wasn't what I expected at all and would hate to dig myself deeper."

It was an orange drive with the company's name (Moxie) and logo on it. It was the kind you flip out to reveal the actual USB drive, which is lined with rubber, and has a metal clip casing.


I'm offering $50 to whoever returns the drive or can help me get in contact with whoever has it, so long as my work is still on it. I won't even be mad if you took it, I just need it back please!

But I find the computer science education I've received has been horrendous. So, I would like to get my foot in the door of teaching.

Should I start as a TA and try to work up in middle/high school classrooms? Try to be a private tutor? Start writing tutorials on basic CS concepts, and hope I learn something from them or they catch on?

Basically, research starts spring of sophomore year and continues over the summer. A PhD can be earned in around 7 years total (4 years for a BS plus some research and 3 years to finish up the PhD). As of right now I think I want to do some form of research, whether it be in industry or academia. My biggest problems are that I have never done any research before and I'm unsure if I will like it or be good at it and also a fear that I will end up overqualified/over-specialized for general software engineering if I finish the program and feel burnt out on research. I am reasonably sure I can handle miserable workloads. 

As of right now I'm leaning towards Computer Graphics as a specialty, but I'm not 100% sure. Am I better off working in industry for a few years and paying off my undergraduate loans before making the decision to go back for more school? If I go that root, should I be looking for internships or for research opportunities over this coming summer?

I'm planning on talking with my adviser tomorrow to help make the decision. My school has a graduate program ranked around the top 50, so I don't think that's an issue. My GPA now is a 4.0, but that probably doesn't mean much because freshmen classes weren't that hard."

If so, does anyone have any advice for learning to identify personal goals and maximizing the satisfaction from attaining them?  Additionally, does anyone else also feel they are an acutely passive person and have any advice on managing their life under such a condition?

Thanks.

---

I'm not sure if I'm framing this the best way, but I've noticed that I seem to possess no intrinsic agency.  I am perfectly capable of reacting to suggestions and tasks that are asked of me, but I can't think of anything I've endeavored for in my life that I set out to do for myself.

It may be a subtle distinction, but the best way I can describe the issue would be the difference between deciding and choosing.  A choice is something given to a passive entity, while a decision is made by an agentive entity.  I think I am capable of choosing from options when I am presented with them, though I don't always understand how I make them.  I don't think I'm capable of making decisions, though.

Functionally, I don't think this lack of agency has had a significant detrimental impact on me; I am reasonably functional in my daily activities.  I graduated with a Bachelor's degree a few years ago, I've held steady employment in an internship and more recently a full-time research assistantship, and I just returned to school for a Master's program.  However, I don't feel like the decisions to go to school or work were mine.  If you asked me, ""Why did you go to school?""  I would answer, ""Because my parents and to some extent my larger social structure expected me to.""  It wasn't a decision between going to school or work or not, it was a choice of which schools and jobs to apply for.  In fact, I imagine that being able to execute tasks and fulfill the expectations that are asked of me, without being distracted or interrupted by personal goals or desires, has, in some ways, probably made me a more valuable asset to my superiors.

That said, I can't identify any desires, personal goals, or motivations outside of possibly being motivated to learn about and practice skills related to the academic field of my graduate studies.  I'm uncertain if this is really a desire or not, though.  I could easily be convinced that this is just another form of fulfilling extrinsic expectations.  In fact, the sensation of spontaneous, self-generated desire seems so foreign to me that I'm not sure if I could detect it in myself.  That may relate more to my alexithymia than a lack of agency—though the two conditions may be related in some way.

For a child, this passivity never seemed an issue to me, and actually seems typical in retrospect.  Now that I am a largely autonomous adult, it seems abnormal.  The one way in which I've recently wondered if this passivity/lack of agency may be affecting me detrimentally is in my overall happiness and satisfaction with life.  I don't ever seem to find satisfaction in attaining goals that are given to me, and those seem to be the only kinds of goals that I have.  When I graduated from my alma mater, and when I matriculated in my current Master's program, I did not feel happy or satisfied.  Any satisfaction that I can truthfully say I derived from my undergraduate program were from what I learned in my courses, not from fulfilling degree requirements.

I have faced some tribulations in my life including a major depressive episode, and a bout with testicular cancer, but I have overcome both of those maladies, and I've been concentrating on this issue of not being able to find satisfaction that seems to coincide with accomplishing personal goals.  I guess in an abstract way, maybe I desire happiness, but I can't even tell if the goal, ""You should be happy"" is too, itself, a goal imposed by my parents and my therapist or other extrinsic entity.  Thus, I fear that personal satisfaction may be unattainable."

I am getting an engineering degree from a college with a fairly high ranked program within the next one and a half years.  I expect to graduate with a decent, but not mindblowing GPA (3.3-3.5).  

My work experience will include one year of internships and one year working as an student assistant for an environmental lab (basically working as a test engineer).  At the second job, I've worked with companies from four different continents.  I've had to program, automate and build testing assemblies, correspond with customers, and have done some design work for fixtures in CATIA. 

I have a lot of tech experience along with my more traditional engineering background.  Along with engineering specific programs (Catia, PLC programming software, DAQ software, MATLAB), I've used R for statistical analysis, done a large amount of digital media work (started on Apple programs, but have switched to Windows variants), and have done programming in HTML/SSL, Javascript, C++, Ruby, VBA, MATLAB, and SQL.

I am planning on getting a job in one of the following cities:  

* Kansas City, MO
* Chattanooga, TN
* Springfield, VT
* Omaha, NE
* Minneapolis, MN
* Seattle, WA
* Chicago, IL
* Austin, TX

I do not know how relevant that information is, but I've seen posts in the subreddit asking for more information in these types of threads, so I wanted to give an overview of what I'm looking for, which fields I am interested in, what my background is, and where I am looking for jobs.  "
1lrczg,6,2013-09-04,"I rip myself apart instead of loving myself, even though I'd like to believe I have a pretty good life.",Giantsfan5634,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1lrczg/i_rip_myself_apart_instead_of_loving_myself_even/,"I want to think I'm doing well for myself. I'm a 20 year-old college senior, just started the new semester today. I'm a teacher's assistant for an introductory Journalism course (my minor), and may very well be a teacher's assistant for an intro sociology (my major) course as well. I'm also doing an internship as a mentor/tutor in a local high school while taking four other classes. I'm also wrapping up my requirements to graduate out of my school's Honors College. I've been told by every teacher I've had that I'm an excellent writer, which always sticks with me. I consider that one of my biggest strengths, and hope to use my way with words in my career.

Sunday is my six-month ""anniversary"" (that word works for years, IDK about months) with my amazing girlfriend. We're in the same major, share a lot of similar interests, and love spending time together. She makes me happy beyond words, and I like to think I do the same for her.

I'm fairly tall (6'2"") and thin (165 lbs.). I'd like to think I'm not an unattractive guy. All of my friends are constantly telling me that I'm funny and generous and all these other awesome superlatives. I was voted friendliest in my graduating class back in high school and have a wide circle of friends who support me while I (hopefully) support them.

I've held down a job at a local chain restaurant for more than four years. It's not the best but I've had a steady income since my senior year of high school. I'm in the process of paying off the loan for my own car. I have a wide variety of hobbies, I'm always trying to learn new things, I plan my future well in advance and believe I'm set up for success. 

My life is pretty goddamn good on the whole.

Well, I suppose I could have picked a different major. I mean, where's the challenge? Not that it isn't interesting, but...I see people majoring in engineering, nursing, and pharmacy. And I'm doing...sociology. Maybe I'm just taking the easy way out to say I got a degree. 

Sure, I'm a good writer. But there are plenty of others out there...I'm not THAT unique. Plenty of people can string words together, how special is that? I don't have any talents that set me apart from anyone else.

In fact, what do I REALLY do? I spend a few minutes every day playing my guitar, and I try to tell myself I can be a successful musician. But how can I be? Writing isn't a unique talent, plenty of people can write music. But I'm not good enough at guitar to make my own music, and I don't spend enough time trying because I'm unmotivated.

I play basketball for fun all the time. Like, ALL the time. How much better have I gotten in the last year, though? I'm still too scared to drive into the lane, I suck at defense, I can barely dribble, and I can't pass. Nobody wants me on their team unless they're awful and want someone to shoot for them every possession.

Selfishness. There's something I'm great at. My girlfriend is great to me, and I sit and sulk all the time when she isn't constantly fawning over me. I'm pitiful. Can't even be grateful for what she's done for me; I just poke at the negatives in my mind. She notices, too. How long can that go on before she gets sick of it? She has so many better options walking around campus every day. I don't deserve to be in a room with her, let alone a relationship. 

I have no muscle- I'm just doughy. 165 pounds of bone, skin, and fat from a high metabolism and not enough activity. Sure, I play basketball a lot. And run when my allergies don't fuck me up. And do my best to eat all the right things. But I don't have the willpower to stick with them, and give up time and time again. There's going to come a day when I'm fat and out of shape and too fucking lazy to change anything.

How the hell can I achieve any of my goals without any motivation? I know what I want to do, but I won't do it. I just tell everyone I will so I sound important in front of them, then go home and find a way to avoid stepping out of my comfort zone. I won't follow up on anything.

This is how I think. I CAN'T keep my motivation to my own health. I WON'T get the job I want. I DON'T deserve to be with my girlfriend. I have no fucking confidence- in my mind I'm overweight, weak (mentally and physically), unintelligent, untalented, and lazy. I know I'm not actually any of these things, but I've spent years convincing myself otherwise. I talk myself out of doing things, saying things, BEING things. Just to prove to myself that I'm right. That I can't, won't, and don't. 

I don't write this seeking sympathy, pity, or a ""eureka!"" post to cure whatever mental disease I've contracted between my ears. I want a physical manifestation of my struggle, so I can look at it and read it and understand it. Force myself to, even though I don't want to. And so I can tell someone and let others hear what my problem is, because I CAN'T tell anyone in person. I WON'T do it. Even though I should."
1lr7vz,0,2013-09-04,A Long Story for Those Willing; Please help me achieve my goal of landing a career in Finance. Low GPA at a Top Public University. Double Major Econ/Stats. Well rounded with a strong story.,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1lr7vz/a_long_story_for_those_willing_please_help_me/,"[Here's my resume.](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3LF3wRXuh8EXzkwNGpiME1rRlE/edit?usp=sharing)  

If you hate Lord of the Rings, and don't feel like reading 1,000 words, here's the gist of what I'm posting: What can I do to better my chances at breaking into Finance with a low GPA?

**Speak 'Finance' and Enter**.

I can't see myself doing anything other than Finance. I'm going to relay some information in the hope that someone may have some words of wisdom or may be able to advise the best course of action, given my situation.  

If you decide to read this, thank you.

**Mistake #1... ~~and #2~~:** I applied to The University of Virginia last year. *Wait, why is that a mistake?*. Well it wouldn't have been, had I applied to the highly regarded McIntre School of Commerce. I had a pretty good chance too, based on their incoming averages for applicants and my extracurriculars. But I didn't apply to McIntre, and that's where Mistake 2 comes in. I made the decision based on somebody else. *Who?* My current girlfriend and highschool sweetheart of 4.5 years. *You idiot*. Yes, yes, let me hear the ""Never bring your highschool girlfriend to college, it doesn't work"" spiel for the 1,000th time. Or the preferred, ""You should never make a life decision based on someone else."" While I agree with that, my girlfriend and I have a stellar relationship and I'm about to ask her to marry me, so it wasn't necessarily a mistake after all—moreso a solicited wrench, thrust into my works.  

*So wait, why didn't you apply to McIntre again?* Well I wanted to be with my girlfriend. If I had applied and not gotten accepted, I would've had to have waited another year—a year that I now wish I had—to reapply.  
*Why not apply to both?* That would have been great... if they allowed it. They don't. So I couldn't. Thus, the predicament.

**""The Hiccup""**: With all the stress that comes with trying to appease a girlfriend, weighing my options, and hoping I would be accepted to *either* school (the College of A&amp;S or McIntre), my dam began to creak. I applied to the University in March, and around that time, the river was released. What followed was a year of unending physiological agony in the form of severe hypochondria. To put it shortly, I visited the hospital nearly every week in August, and probably around a total of ten or so times over the course of three months. I've been to the doctor's office more times than I can count, and generally, I had a pretty terrible time upon arrival to U.Va (I forgot to mention: I got accepted). I still have nerve issues like muscle spasms and twitching limbs, and couldn't eat right for half of that year.

So from that March (2012) to this March/April (2013), I struggled. After many hours of therapy, tens of pounds of weight lifted, and hundreds of down and up dogs in Yoga class, I started mending. I still have small relapses and struggle with it, but I have  a level head at this point, and can't claim it to be impeding my ability to do well anymore (in all honesty, I could before).

*I bet your GPA suffered during all of that*. You're damn right. Not only did I have to acclimate myself to the difficulty of one of the best public schools in the country, I had to acclimate myself to the perpetual thought of death at any moment. As you can imagine, it was hard to concentrate on my classes. It was hard to concentrate on anything other than the aneurysm forming in my brain, or my heart stopping, or sometimes both.

**Where I stand now:** So I'm a fourth year now, at the University of Virginia, standing on nothing short of an abysmal 2.2 GPA. I'm currently a declared Statistics major, and I'm set to double major in Economics and Statistics, and hopefully graduate in May of next year (2014). I may end up having to walk in May, and take an extra class or two in the summer to fully complete my degree. (I have to retake several classes).

**The Plan (""Get the Ring to Mordor"")**: If I do stellar these next two semesters, I can get my GPA up to the high 2's. It's pretty much impossible at this point to break 3.0. Realistically, I'll probably bring it up to around a 2.6 or 2.7.

If someone told you they wanted to go into Finance with a 2.6, you would laugh. *One does not simply get into high Finance with a 2.6*. Well I'm going to do it, dammit:  

I'm a strong test taker, and I think I can smash the GMAT.  
I'm also planning on taking the first CFA exam. *What is that going to get you?* I don't know, man! I'm trying everything!  
 I'm also planning on finishing up Spanish and French, of which I'm already conversational in.   
I think I'm competent at writing a decent essay.   
I have extensive computer skills (I build computers in my free time), and programming experience (I plan on acquiring more experience).  
 I've been told by numerous people that I'm pretty charismatic, and I've always had an easy time networking (I buddied up with the former VP at my Community College and got a recommendation for my UVa application.)   
I have a really arbitrary ""Banking"" (Teller) internship at a Credit Union (it's something right?).   
And I have a strong track record prior to U.Va.   
I think if I can demonstrate that this past third year was a fluke in performance by doing really well my last year, and showing my first two years and my last year, and explain the health problems in between, I might be able to scoot around the elephant that is my GPA.  
&lt;s&gt;I'm also pretty cool and play guitar, piano, and write fiction in my spare time.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;  

**Calling All Sams:** If none of you have watched Lord of the Rings, these analogies are really going to confuse things. I'm reaching out to all of you Sams... I need someone to carry me to the top of Mount Doom. I need some advice. I need some support. I need help. I have to do this. I am willing to do whatever it takes.   
What can I possibly do to appear a stronger candidate for the field of Finance, and for a decently ranked graduate business school?

**'And he lives happily ever after, till the end of his days.'  
TL;DR: I need a sword, a bow, and an axe to help me get to Mt. Doom. Any takers?**

I have 4 years experience in leadership positions that have included military, wilderness expedition guiding, project development, school clubs, student government, and community service.

As far as work, I am seeking a company that employs self motivated and hard working individuals,cultivates growth, has a good value system, and that can allow me to accomplish a healthy life/work balance.

I feel versatile. I enjoy working with people, technology, and development. I am curious as to how I should go about making the transition from KY college girl to real world living a successful one. Which cities might be right for what I'm looking for, should I use a recruiter or head hunter, and do you have any general advice for me? 
I am seeking a non-profit, a sales, or engineering position.

Also, thanks so much for all the work you do on your amazing show!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32fre?context=5)|Oh we've all been told the question. It's the further question that it opens up, and the resulting answer that's the real secret.
[Do you have all the possible 'alarm' answers queued in? Or does someone with fast fingers type it in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc320by?context=5)|They're all pre-programmed in - it takes a few minutes to set them up, so we can only add in new ones if we have enough time in the show -eg. Victoria Coren and the Aztec March Hare.
[Why won't the BBC air QI on BBC America? Will there ever be a QI dvd set so I can watch the show legally in America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31qyn?context=5)|Actually certain series of QI are now available on Hulu in the US and Netlfix in the UK: keep an eye on www.qi.com for further developments.
[I'm guessing this has to do with photo/video/audio copyrights and such?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc324ru?context=5)|Yup. It's as frustrating for us as it it for you guys that all of QI isn't available to watch, but we're working on it; the main problem is the images behind the panellists.
[Can't you just release the raw recordings as Podcasts in audio only?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32nwc?context=5)|We're working on that as well.
[Do you guys really work behind the scenes even while they are filming the episodes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31zn6?context=5)|Yes, we are behind the scenes, there's a special Elves' booth that we occupy from where we watch the recording through a window (we're not allowed into the control gallery because we shout at the TV like it's a football match). We mostly make notes on how the recording is panning out and check things that the panellists say. If there's time to correct anything they say before they move on, we message Stephen on his screen.
[Are there topics you prefer not to talk about on the show, either because they are too touchy, or because they are not good enough for a panel show/comedy programme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31zn6?context=5)|We look at each fact's sources individually so it depends, but after a while you get to know which sources to trust and which need backing up. Our most senior researchers have a spidey-sense for that sort of thing. The trick is to not assume something is trustworthy just because when you Google it it comes up in a load of news articles - because usually they're copying each other.  Aside from things you're not allowed to talk about on BBC Two, we don't really steer clear of anything, QI works best when it's an open and inquisitive look at anything and everything.
[DO you reckon you will make it to Z?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31s12?context=5)|We will start on the numbers. Once we have finished them, we will get started on symbols.
[, thanks for all your hard work on the show, you deserve a lot more credit than you get. What's been your favourite part of making the shows all these years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31vf5?context=5)|Sometimes we get biscuits.
[What does Stephen Fry smell like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3216f?context=5)|Faintly of raspberries.
[What is your average day like at work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32e1f?context=5)|We all get in to the office appallingly late and then spend most of the day writing an illicit sitcom based around QI. Occasionally we get a phone call informing us of the Chief Gnome's imminent arrival, whereupon we grab the heaviest books we can find and get researching until he goes away. The show gets written in these five minutes bursts.
[On the rare occasion that you get something wrong, how hard do you take it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc322kw?context=5)|Usually the elf responsible endures days of abuse from fellow researchers and a healthy dose of Dobby-esque self-flagellation.
[Does Stephen Fry actually need the answer cards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32eur?context=5)|Stephen does possess an impossible amount of knowledge for a human. But it's fun to give him an extra leg-up over the panellists, so we equip him with the cards, an autocue, an information screen embedded into his desk, and we also shout at him through an earpiece.
[What was the most obscure question that was actually answered by a panelist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc326eh?context=5)|Back in C series Rory McGrath demonstrated a knowledge of Latin bird names that blew our notes apart.
[How many elves work on QI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31qwf?context=5)|We have five elves working all-year round in the QI office manning the website and writing the books (the collective noun is 'a mischief of elves'). The number increases to about 12 in the run-up to recording season, and drops around Christmas when we're doing...other things.
[Be honest, how much of your job simply involves reading Wikipedia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc326ou?context=5)|I personally use Wikipedia quite a lot as a jumping off point, but not as a primary source for QI facts.  Wikipedia has an unfair reputation for being unreliable, and although the references themselves are often not up to scratch, a lot of the QI information I've discovered on Wikipedia has turned out to be correct, after being verified by different sources.
 |The brilliant thing about Wikipedia is that it covers everything, and it's all linked together - so you can get completely lost and go for a walk for hours just by clicking on anything that looks interesting - and that's a great way to find QI facts.
[What is the airspeed velocity of a unladen, European swallow? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3219f?context=5)|Unladen with what? 
[How exactly do you become a QI Elf?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31r8l?context=5)|If you're interested in being a QI elf, the best way is to start researching now - and post up your findings on the [QI Talkboards]( http://old.qi.com/talk/) (currently under renovation). We have someone who trawls the forums picking up on interesting posts, and many of our researchers started their new life at QI doing this.
 |We have a real mix of people here, so we don't look for any specific qualifications or backgrounds - it's all about a genuine enthusiasm and the ability to spot a glimmer of interestingness in a heap of the seemingly dull.
 |For starters you should read the 'Working as a QI Researcher' section on [this page]( http://qi.com/job-hunting), and the [QI Philosophy]( http://qi.com/qi-philosophy) and [Manifesto]( http://qi.com/manifesto).
 |There are some non-research or part-time-research-based jobs as well, since we're expanding online and into other avenues - including IT, website design, databasing, and media management. We're not always hiring, but we're very happy to receive any applications/CVs etc and keep them on file, in case we get in touch in the future. Send them to jobs@qi.com!
 |There's also some general information about jobs in media on our website [here.]( http://qi.com/job-hunting)

[How exactly do you go about picking the theme of an episode. Do you have a bulk of research beforehand on the relevant subject or do you get given the subject and have find questions that could be asked? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc325hs?context=5)|We're warming up for the next series at the moment, so most of our time is spent turning up great facts and then getting angry because nothing begins with L.
 |Anything that does fit gets put into a bit database and then sorted into a thing called a conflatus (we don't know what that means). Then we look at what we've got and try to divide it up into episode-sized themes. Once that's done, episodes get allocated a 'curator' ie. a senior elf who takes charge of that show and writes up the script.
 |Then we go back to meetings to discuss the questions, re-write the questions to meet our annual double-entendre quota, and then skew the show to make Alan look a ridiculous as possible. If we can find an excuse to dress Stephen up too then that's a bonus.
[But Pliny the Elder was a Roman.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc33vzl?context=5)|Oops sorry. I'm clearly getting chucked off my Classics course next year.
 |Pliny is the patron saint of QI, and our go-to guy for hilarious ancient wisdom, but I would pick Aristotle out of the Greeks. 
[How much recorded footage is taken and condensed down to make one episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc323lk?context=5)|Each recording lasts around two hours. This is cut down in the edit to 45 minutes for QI XL and then ruthlessly chopped again to 30 minutes.
 |Some material in the script won't be recorded at all as time is extremely tight.
[Have you ever been stumped on a subject?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc36dn2?context=5)|One of my fellow elves recently asked me the question ""Why is yoghurt?"" It's sent me into a bit of an existential crisis.
[How come that Alan Davies is in every episode, and when did it get decided that he should be?  Is he more or less Mr. Fry's co-host?  Oh, and tell Steven I said hi, and Denmark loves him :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc36qnq?context=5)|He got his foot stuck in a hole under the set in the first episode, and we haven't been able to free him yet.
[Can I please come work with you? What is the hiring process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31smm?context=5)|We've had a lot of questions about jobs at QI so we'll put up a thorough response at the top of this thread at the end.
[For years, my favorite thing to do is research. I once spent a week learning the life cycle of jellyfish simply out of curiosity. It is my *dream* to do this for a living!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31smm?context=5)|Edit: There's a link to the answer of this question up the top now!
[Stephen mentioned that sometimes while filming he is going through a depressive episode. Have that ever been an obstacle? Did you ever have to reschedule an episode or reshoot because he wasn't feeling well?  How/when did you come up with the genius alarm? Is Rory the only person in QI history to ever receive that title?  Is general ignorance gone for good?  Why was the funniest bit in QI history cut from the episode?  For which other QI inventions is Head Science Elf Will Bowen responsible for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc320zw?context=5)|To answer some of your questions: Rory is indeed the only person who's earned himself the genius alarm, although we have had other tailored alarms for other guests e.g. the well-deserved Luvvie alarm for John Sessions. General Ignorance isn't gone, we've just interspersed it throughout episodes, rather than having it as a round at the end, so now you never know when we've planted a trap. It gives us more opportunity to catch out unsuspecting panellists that way. The glorious Acropolis moment you're talking about was never going to be cut from the series - we just found that it fitted better into the outtakes episode that we did for the E series, rather than the Engineering episode for which it was originally filmed. Don't worry - we knew it was unmissable comedy gold as soon as it happened! If anything on QI ever involves clever props, explosions, safety goggles or the accidental destruction of bits of the set, it will have been masterminded by Will Bowen. Who, incidentally, is a genius of immeasurable proportions and refuses to own a mobile phone. You can check at the top of this feed now for information on working or volunteering for QI. We welcome contributions from all curious minds. 
[Do the Elves have a pub quiz team? (Or better yet, write a pub quiz?!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3486b?context=5)|We have been known to turn up to the odd pub quiz in London. Our arrival is usually met with an awed hush - which is swiftly punctured when they realise that we're actually pretty useless at general knowledge, and we have an annoying habit of debunking all the questions and making inappropriate klaxon noises.
[Have you ever come across a fact which you'd like to have included in a show, but which was either too complicated or simply too far fetched to be believed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31zq4?context=5)|Cutting a fact because it's too long-winded or requires too much of a run up is the last the we want to do if it's ultimately interesting, but sometimes it does happen. What we did start to do in the J series was touch upon a topic (e.g. different theories on the subtext of Alice in Wonderland) and elaborate on qi.com.
 |Now that our shiny new website is nearly up and running, we'll hopefully be able to do this more - so far we've already begun to post a list of references for the show material, plus some of Stephen's notes, and the most exciting part of all, the INFOCLOUD.
[Has Stephen ever given you a sock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc369rb?context=5)|WE ARE FREE ELVES.
[I love the show here in Australia. Thanks for such a great show. Cant wait for the new season.  One thing always intrigued me though..  Who is the baby in the opening credits? does he/she hold any significance?.. Or is it a random stock photo of a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc34l4q?context=5)|The baby in the opening credits is one of QI creator John Lloyd's daughters. He is almost certain he knows which (of two) it is. The other child in the opening credits is John Lloyd's son.
[Who chooses the buzzer sounds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3242l?context=5)|The episode curator puts ideas in their script as a jumping-off point, and they're done on the day of recording, usually chosen by QI creator John Lloyd. If we can't find exactly the sound we're looking for we're sometimes able to record it in the studio. 
[How many men and how many women on the team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc388mu?context=5)|The number of people on the entire team fluctuates from month to month, but in the office full time there are 3 boys, 2 girls, and the company is run by Mr and Mrs Lloyd.

Amongst our ranks are mathematicians, historians, scientists, quiz champions, publishers, an astronomer, a theatrical engineer, a Private Eye hack, an ex-accountant, an ex-commodity broker, an ex-chef, an ex-zoo-keeper,  two ex-Scottish parliamentary researchers (one of them's still Scottish though), an ex-Latin tutor, and one reclusive researcher who submits his work over the internet, and whom no-one has ever actually met. We think he may have originally run Charlie's Angels. 
[Can you tell me about the episode John Hodgman ended up on (and winning!\) He felt like such a last-minute addition, wedged in as a third guest on one side of the set.  Was he a surprise? Did he just show up and hit it off with Stephen at the pub the night before filming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35efd?context=5)|I think he was in the UK at the time we were recording, and we wanted to have him on but we'd already booked up all the guests, so we just gouged an extra space into the set for him...

As in every piece. I'm aware that this would cause some inconvenience in playrooms across the world, but I think it's the most brilliant toy/genuinely useful tool/supremely creative material there is.
 |The fact that manufacturing and technology development companies across the world use it in prototyping, and yet the very same product is one of the most successful toys &amp; educational tools worldwide demonstrates that it breaks down the barriers between imagination/ingenuity/creativity and the realisation of those things into tangible entities more effectively than almost anything else. It has almost boundless potential, and yes the skill required to master it is negligible - in particular the Technic/Robotics area of Lego is an absolute masterpiece of seamless compatibility and a genius example of complexity-through-simplicity, albeit also a slightly scary IKEA-esque conformity.
 |I reckon that if you could give everyone a limitless supply of LEGO there would be a massive upswing in creativity being put to practical use.
 |Edit: spelling corrections.
[What's your method for going about finding a fact? I honestly don't know where I'd start!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35mtj?context=5)|We all have different preferences for methods of research; we have a sizeable library in the office, plus memberships to other libraries in London. There's not really a place to start when it comes to QI research, you just dive in - pick up the most obscure book you can find and start reading.
 |We also have an extensive network of shady contacts in Museum basements, so they're always useful for getting into places that people aren't usually allowed, and we sometimes get their opinion on facts as well. I've recently taken to accosting academic guests of our radio show after recordings and insisting they give me all their contact details so I can probe their brains for QI nuggets.

[On the show, Stephen Fry sounds like he's just speaking from a vast repository of information in his brain half the time.

1lvdge,2,2013-09-06,I have to choose two elective courses for this coming semester. Help me choose?,Dongface,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lvdge/i_have_to_choose_two_elective_courses_for_this/,"For my next semester, I have a choice of three elective modules, of which I must choose two.

The module synopses are here:

1. [Web Information Processing](http://www.nuim.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&amp;MODE=VIEW&amp;MODULE_CODE=CS230&amp;YEAR=2014)
1. [Media Programming](http://www.nuim.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&amp;MODE=VIEW&amp;MODULE_CODE=CS270&amp;YEAR=2014)
1. [Mobile Application Development](http://www.nuim.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&amp;MODE=VIEW&amp;MODULE_CODE=CS385&amp;YEAR=2014)

I spent the summer working at an internship, building a web app in Java with Play 2, so I'm instantly drawn to the web-based choice, but reading the synopsis, it seems a bit outdated. Would I be right in thinking that?

Media programming would be basically new to me, but I think I'd like a module that heavily focuses on algorithmic programming.

Lastly, with the popularity of mobile devices, the mobile app module seems like a no-brainer in terms of careers options, especially paired with a decent web programming course.

Of those three modules, which ones seem the most forward-facing and useful?

**EDIT 09/09/13:** Thanks for all the advice. I've found out that I can register for only two modules, but I can attend all three. I reckon I'll register for the web dev and mobile dev modules, and just attend the medai programming module."
1luhfo,0,2013-09-06,What are all of Snowden's leaks so far? And why are they significant?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1luhfo/what_are_all_of_snowdens_leaks_so_far_and_why_are/,"I want to get mad, because I've had it. 

At the same time it seems so hopeless. Many people of the first world that want change are kept preoccupied by underpaid jobs or the exact things that has compromised our security, i.e., computers, phones, social media, etc. 

We're in too deep, is what I think. Hey, the quicksand they started throwing under our feets? Now that's up to our necks; sinking us only deeper until it's probably too late anyways. Right?

Occupy movement failed, AFAIK due to lack of leadership and specific goals of the movement. The people all had their own ideas of what needed to be done. Everyone just self-serving in masses. 

What are we waiting for anyway? I feel like we're at the cinemas watching each turn of event as Snowden's leaks are dramatically revealed, one-by-one. Obama and the league of millionaires (no offense to all the cool millionaires out there) plotting to take over the world. Little do you know, it's already been taken over.

Sorry for the rant. Where was I?

So, what are we waiting for? The next big reveal from Snowden? I feel like it's gonna revolve around our security and privacy being compromised again. Where is Snowden anyway? Are we gonna wait until he's captured, or dead? What if we suddenly never hear from him again? 

We must be waiting for the war! Yes! Congress loves the idea and we're off to Syria. But since the people outcried beforehand to not go to war, we'll get pissed and THEN we'll do something about it!

...

What the *fuck* are we doing?

...

Nothing. Stay calm and carry on. It's all we know how to do anyway. Right? Reading all this isn't gonna change anything, because it does not lead to action. There is no action because the right motivation is not present.  

You wanna stand outside for hours to ""protest""? Nope. 

You gonna fight for your rights on a march down to DC? Hell naw.

Write a letter to your Reps! That will get their attentions and through reading your letters (vicariously through the hot interns, mind you) will feel the passion and genuine concern in your writing and, in turn, will have a change of heart to just say ""NO"" (in a firm voice). Write a letter? Serious question: what is writing a letter gonna accomplish exactly? And it's for sure going to be read by the specific person I am writing to right? Because I would like *them* to know *my* opinion in hopes to encourage a change of mind.

Why do they even have the job still? What's the point of appointing Representatives if they don't represent hardly any of us. Except for some shit minorities out there, which btw.. *Fuck* you, you *fucking cunts*!

...

I don't know. Well, we can certainly discuss our state of disapproval and disappointment but that's only lead us back to [this](http://www.reddit.com/). Maybe some of [this](http://www.eyebleach.me/). Was it called [the box](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=reddit+the+box)? How about some [waffles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=carrots)? 

Where were we?

Right.

I want to get mad, because I've had it. 

What are we gonna do? Let's get mad together! Where/when? Oh wait I can't; already made plans. How about we just discuss realistically logical goals and steps to achieve those said goals online? At this point what can be done? Should we just assimilate and accept it as the ""norm"" now? We're certainly not far from that idea. Maybe we can dissolve the evil corporations and corrupt officials? How about we just get rid of all of them, since they've so useless thus far?

Anywho.. I was mad but I just got done venting so not really mad anymore. I think I'll just head to bed. 

In case I don't see ya: good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

TL;DR: Please provide description of Snowden's leaks up to date, in ELI5-style."
1lu4rl,3,2013-09-06,Accepting an internship after graduating?,daytimeninja,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lu4rl/accepting_an_internship_after_graduating/,"So I currently have a phone interview scheduled for a high-profile tech company, and while I'm obviously still far away from actually securing an internship there, I'm curious as to if it would even be worth doing so.

The company would most likely pay for my relocation, as well as a stipend.  It's also in the area I really would like land a full-time job/move to once I graduate.

My question is, and this may be a silly one, but do companies ""look down"" at an internship post graduation?  Ideally I'd hope to land a job, but this is a very reputable and global company, and would no doubt be a huge beneficiary for my career."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[When you had escaped, did you know of North Korea's international reputation? Or had you been censored into believing it was a good place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2nj94?context=5)|Yes, I thought North Korea is the strongest country under the leader of Kim Jung Il and a good place to live because I had n't known much about outside of the country. And I believed the famine and economic recession was because of US empire and its allies repression to overthrow North Korea. 
[Do people in North Korea have any sort of understanding of the how the rest of the world views them? Even if it's a small group of people who know about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lapa?context=5)|Cadre members, high-ranking party officials, and wealthy North Koreans who have access to the internet know about the outside world. The majority of North Koreans do not. However, some South Korean soap operas making their way to North Korea because of the black market. North Koreans are now more aware of the wealth in South Korea. 
[Did you know anyone before you left who remembered the era before the war? I imagine the Japanese occupation was just as oppressive for most people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2my6s?context=5)|I heard about the era before the war from grandmother, who was born in Seoul and worked as a babysitter for a baby born to a Japanese mother and Korean father. The Japanese mom went back to her home country and my grandmother had to take the baby to the father in North Korea. The father was rich and owned factories in North Korea. The level of oppression depends on your position. and she was lucky.  
[Have you ever seen a public execution(s\)? How many? In your opinion have the police increased or decreased public executions in the past five years or so? Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2n574?context=5)|Yes, I saw two public executions. One when I was 9 (western age). A policeman shot thieves/rapists without any due process. They were taken outside and shot. They were then tied on a pole and the policeman shot them nine times-- head, chest, stomach, and legs. I saw a similar execution when was 19 (western age). The policemen told us to be careful. 
[Was there any historical events/knowledge did you not know happen or existed untill you escaped? For instance, moon landing etc, ancient Egypt, the Romans..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lb2z?context=5)|No I never knew about the moon landing. I did learn a bit about the Egyptians and the Romans. I had a basic world history course, and learned about the opium war involving Britain and China. 
[How did your educational experience in the UK compare with your educational experience in NK?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2l0no?context=5)|In one word: free. In the UK, I was freer to express myself and think my own thoughts. In North Korea, I did not study at university but I went to college for 1.5 years and everyday I had to form in a line with other students (military-style) and march from the gate to the classroom. I felt like I was doing military service in North Korea. In the UK, I felt like I was finding myself. 
[Hi thanks for doing this. Does religion as the rest of us might know it, ie Christianity, Islam , Buddhism , Judaism feature in North Korean life in any way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lox0?context=5)|The state is religion. Pyongyang has a few church/temples but they're just for show. Freedom of religion is not allowed, and many missionaries are persecuted. If North Koreans meet Christians in China, they're seriously punished upon return. Smuggling Bibles risks imprisonment and torture. 
[In your opinion, what percentage of people in North Korea actually believe that the Kim family are God like figures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2muq3?context=5)|I don't have a percentage because I didn't live in every region, and there are big differences. The mass starvation of the 1990s undermined the cult of personality. Many of those who worshipped the regime died because they thought they would be cared for. Those who survived knew how to operate without the Kims, and the grassroots market began to thrive. People began to make money and enjoyed it. 
[In NK do the citizens genuinely believe that their government is great, or do the citizens have doubts but don't voice them in fear of the consequences.  Did you tell your family you were planning to escape? And if so, how did they react?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2meea?context=5)|I did not let my family know, and I haven't spoken to them since. 
[What are Weddings like in North Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2ku6u?context=5)|All weddings in North Korea take place at home (not in a church or city hall). There are no wedding vows or exchanging of rings. Photos are taken, people gather, and there's food shared by visitors. It's more like a party and celebration than a formal ritual. The wife brings many household items (dishes, blankets, kitchen stuff and sometimes TV, appliances like a sewing machine) in order to display status to attendees. 
[Do you think that the North Korean government will fall in the near future (10-20 years\)? What do you see for the future of North Korea?  EDIT: forgot ""the""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2l05e?context=5)|I don't know when the North Korean goverment will collapse. However, I do hope their military first policy ends soon so normal citizens no longer starve. 
[What was the hardest part about adjusting to life outside of North Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2mlit?context=5)|Defectors face some forms of social discrimination in South Korea. It's a complex situation. I faced difficulties because I really had no skills and South Korea is very competetive society. I'm learning to become a reporter now so I can contribute. 
[What do you personally think are the biggest hurdles facing reunification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2l1pr?context=5)|I think building trust between North and South, and we need time to better understand each other. It cannot be solved in a short time with just a meeting or summit. Citizens from both countries need to meet each other, and the North Korean goverment has to help normal people live better, raise the standard of living. The Kim regime must understand this is not a threat to stability. 
[What is the best thing you discovered after leaving North Korea?  For example: food, culture, technology, freedoms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2re8n?context=5)|Food. 
[Can you tell us more about your escape? Why did you need to climb the embassy's wall in Beijing? Are all embassies protected by Chinese guards which makes it difficult for any North Koreans to seek asylum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2rcnb?context=5)|Yes, the do. The the height of the embassy wall was low (about 2meter). All embassies are guarded by Chinese guards. I waited for the guards to change, and jumped over the far right corner. 
[Hello! How did daily life work? Similar to the rest of the world? What did people do for recreation in their free time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2qse8?context=5)|My daily life included going to work in an office at 8:30am where we often also had to go pave the military roads. We worked at the office until 6pm, got off and came back home to have dinner (if i had food, but if I didn't have food I just skipped). My office had about fifteen workers, but some men didn't go to work, instead going to the market. they had to pay money not to go to work. Generally I would have chats with friends play poker if i had free time. If I lost, I had to buy food (rice cakes, etc.)
[What one thing amazed you the most in the ""free world""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2kwul?context=5)|Hhh many things, too many to talk about it, But I would say I didn't need worry somebody watch me 
[북한에서 살면서 하루에 음식을 얼마나 받았어요? 저는 북한 사람들이 항상 배가 고프다고 들었어요. 또 북한 육군에 입대 하지 않았어요?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2p8y9?context=5)|전혀 못 받았아요. 배급을 받았으면 굶지도 않았죠. 일은 다녔지만 배급은 못 받았고 그렇지만 여전히 일은 다녀야 했죠. 군에는 가지 않았어요. 못간다고 하더군요. 아버지가 성분이 않좋아서.  
[Where was your father from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2sihd?context=5)|I shouldn't talk about that. 
[Did you or your friends ever talk ill of the NK regime in private?  How much of the propaganda did you believe?  Do you ever miss any aspect of North korea?  Did you ever have good times in North Korea? I can't imagine how anybody could be happy, being watched all the time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2oc5o?context=5)|No, I never talked about problems of the regime serioucly.  I believed everything, to be honest. even never attempted to think differently about it.  I miss my sister. she is a family only alive in North Korea 
[Could you tell us a bit about NK's songbun system. How much does it still rule people's lives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2luvd?context=5)|When I was in North Korea, universities in Pyongyang (such as Kim Il Sung and Teachers University) do not admit certain students based on their family backgrounds. Having South Korean relatives, or people who are associated with the South Korean army, or relatives in Japan, or ancestors who owned land in North Korea during Japanese colonialism makes for bad blood. If records are not confirmed, they're also considered a bad family. People are victimized by a past they have no control over and North Korea's unforgiving bureaucracy. For many, this is worse than being dead. 
[By ""If records are not confirmed"" do you mean somebody has to have a stamp of approval ""This person has a good family"" and if not then the ""default"" is that they don't?  Its always really horrible for people to be blamed for things that they were not responsible for. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2mrft?context=5)|Well, here are example I can say, in my elder sister's class, there is a student in good grade, but she could not go to a university. she said "" because of my family background"" 
[What is the Kim Jong Un regime's biggest weakness? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lsw3?context=5)|Ignoring ordinary people. 
[What's something from ""The North"" that would surprise the people on the outside?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lkmy?context=5)|Positive: North Koreans work very hard (but they don't get rewarded enough). Negative: If Reddit users saw ordinary peoples' lives outside North Korea's decorated farm villages (shown to foreign visitors) they'd be shocked. Even in Pyongyang's suburbs, there are places with severe poverty. 
[Hey, thanks for the AMA! I've always been interested in what people go through after getting into China from North Korea. How did the German embassy react to you seeking their help? Did it seem like they had a lot of prior experience with NK defectors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lcqe?context=5)|They gave me food while I was there for three days in the embassy and asked me a few questions to confirm I was from North Korea. They then negotiated with Chinese chief policeman, and Embassy staff took me to the Phillipines in order to hand me over to South Korean Embassy staff.  I felt like the German Embassy was totally surprised.

 |30 years ago, two communists from France and Peru went to North Korea volunteerly, but they were sent to prison camp due to their decretive talks on the bed ""North Korea is not really socialist country, but it is more like a country under the control of Kim Il Sung""  and the Frenchman is dead after comming out the camp 15 years later. Their story was published in the report of Amnesty International.

1lxsee,1,2013-09-07,My story...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1lxsee/my_story/,"Hi there,

First of all, please excuse my English as it is my second language.
Brace yourselves, it's a long read.

Here's my story:

I'm 20 years old, male and not doing very well.
I suppose a bit of back-story is required...

So, basically the past 5 years have been terrible. It all started after dropping out of high-school, back when I was 15 years old. I had a great time in Elementary School (besides an open-heart surgery when I was 11 or so, but got out of it quite well with only a leaking valve) and the first 3 years of high-school. 

In my third year I was having some trouble (or at least I thought so back then) and became a somewhat rebellious teenager. At the time I wasn't too fond of my classmates, had a grudge against the system and felt a little depressed. However, I had an amazing mentor/counselor and History teacher. She was Asian, late 20's (I think) very nice and understanding and to this day still, by far the greatest person I've ever had the pleasure to meet. She gave me advice and like no other knew what I meant when talking about the problems I was dealing with. She let me change classes when I'd decided I wanted to follow a different school profile which is normally not possible (like economics), Suggesting that if I couldn't bring it up to go to school 5 days a week it was alright for me to skip a day (even though my parents wouldn't let me) and even visit me at home once to talk. 

Anyhow, the change of profile didn't work out as intended. Having entered an all girls class ultimately resulting in going back to my old class and   eventually refusing to go to school. After all these years this has been the worst mistake of my life and I still feel bad for letting her down like that without a chance to apologize. I haven't seen her since, miss her a lot and am obviously afraid to contact her again (I guess it would be kind of weird). I've mostly blamed myself for quitting school, but I've always felt my parents could have done a bit more. They never explained to me why it was so important or took the time to have a meaningful conversation with me. The only thing they did was scream at me and occasionally use force to get me out of bed for school.

The last quarter of the year I spend at some small school, doing nothing really besides attending. After that I went on to college starting an education where it was possible to enter without a degree. I quit about 3/4th of the year due to not finding a good internship and lack of interest. The year after that I took a few jobs at a couple of agencies, but because I couldn't always find work I was home quite a lot which resulted in my parents becoming agitated, which is understandable, but I hated the way they've dealt with it. Screaming, provoking, suggesting I'd kill myself by jumping in front of a train, those kind of things. I had no friends any more and suffered from loneliness the entire time. All the while thinking back on how it was before.

After that, at long last I got my high-school degree nevertheless. It was a horrible year with the worst classmates imaginable, but somehow I managed to go through with it. At the start of this year I've also developed some kind of social anxiety, agoraphobia or whatever you want to call it (I haven't told anyone about this yet, because I am ashamed of it). I felt out of place, my heart began to race, started sweating and shaking in social situations and often had a fight of flight response. After a while I became more afraid of the ""attack"" itself rather than anything else. The fear of fear more or less.

The year after I took another year of high-school in an adult class (the rest was around my age) to ensure I could start with the right education. My dream has always been to become a history teacher (I love history, explaining things and to be in a high-school environment) However, I had to quit because of travel time, social anxiety issues that left me extremely uncomfortable in class which in turn had a negative effect upon my concentration.

The rest of the year has been downright awful and I pretty much hit rock bottom. Unable to - or really had the motivation - to find work I fought a lot with my parents. My mother only works part-time, constantly screaming and doing all those things I've told before. She knew it didn't help, but she'd continue anyway. I even think she gets some sort of satisfaction from it. Even after asking multiple times to stop and be quiet in a polite way, to raising my voice to screaming and even after threatening to brake things in the house she still wouldn't stop. I normally then go for a bike ride or listen to music, but this one time it went wrong. She was uttering the most horrible insults and I hit her twice. She then called the police and I'd gone to jail for half a week, luckily acquitted afterwards. during my time in jail a social worker took advantage of my vulnerability by addressing the most personal issues and bribing me into telling her, otherwise she'd threaten to give negative advise to the judge.

While I regret my decision I'm still mad about the things she said to me and provoking me that much. I'm a very patient and quiet guy and it takes a lot to get under my skin like that. I would never hit anyone, especially not a woman, but I guess you'd have to know my mother to at least somewhat understand. Not only have I been in jail, I've read the statement of my parents they gave to the police and it's ten times worse than it really was. Like they're out to give me a criminal record. I couldn't visit home for a couple of weeks due to a restraining order and I basically had to live on the street. At least I had somewhere to sleep at a place (with a lot of junkies and whatnot). I could've stayed at relatives, but I didn't want them to go through the trouble of providing me shelter.

These were some of the worst weeks I've ever had. No computer, reasonable food, books, music, guitar etc. I started smoking and doing drugs for a while there, but quit as soon as I was aloud to go back home. 

Now I'll go into something that really bothers me. My parents accuse me of having autism (aspergers) and I disagree with them completely. The social worker agrees with them and forced me to have a few conversations with psychiatrists, again threatening me that if I wouldn't she'd advise to prolong the restraining order to the major. They both said at a first impression nothing seemed wrong with me and further investigation wasn't necessary. When I had a talk with the social worker later she claimed the exact opposite. Either she's lying to me or they both have been lying to my face. I've also noticed she has a way of changing someone's words, like she only hears what she wants to hear.

Anyway, I started an education again this year. It's not what I wanted, below my capabilities, not that interesting either and it'll take years to get to where I want to be. As it is I'm barely holding on. Living with my parents whom I despise (I can't afford to live on my own, because of school), following an education I don't want to, dealing with social anxiety issues and parents + a social worker who constantly want to label me for something I don't have. This bothers me a lot, it's insulting accusing someone with a disorder they don't have. They won't leave me alone, even though I can function properly without. 

The problems I'm having are different and a result of 5 horrendous years. They sometimes say every failure makes you stronger, but in my case it broke me. I was a normal and happy kid during elementary and high-school. Now I'm not the same any more, not being able to think positively.

I'm thinking back all the time how my life used to be, and how it would've been if I hadn't made that mistake 5 years ago to drop out of school. I even take bike rides a few times a week the exact same route as I used to go to high-school just to try and live in the past again. It reminds me of that Metallica song ""fade to black"". ""Things not what they used to be. Missing one inside of me""

I don't want therapy due to bad experiences with them in the past and I don't feel talking could make things better. Not for my depression or my social anxiety. I sort of know already what they'd say and I don't want to be dependent on medication. I also don't like what they do to your brain and the side effects they have (like ssri's or benzos)

So, that's basically my story. I have no idea why all of a sudden I felt the need to type and post it here. I've thought about suicide for a long time now. Hope was the only thing that kept me going, but it isn't really there at the moment. Suicide is harder than most people think. All of the things you still wanted to be a part of and realize you can't when you're no more and even then they're so far beyond your reach. I don't think it's worth it.

Some kind of miracle has to happen in the next few days to prevent me from taking my own life. All I know is the method I'll be choosing will be one of the most fatal. No attempt."
1lxee0,3,2013-09-07,"[NY] ex-boyfriend moved out, stole my bike, hasn't paid me 8 months rent.",legalthr0waway,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lxee0/ny_exboyfriend_moved_out_stole_my_bike_hasnt_paid/,"The short version: My boyfriend (19, M) and I (22, M) rented an apartment together from January to the end of August. From June through August, I was doing an internship in another state.  We both signed the lease, but I paid the rent in advance. He was supposed to pay me his half of the rent each month.  In August, we broke up (for a variety of reasons - he dropped out of school, didn't find a job, wouldn't pay rent, I wanted to date a girl, etc), and when I returned to our - now just mine - apartment at the end of August, I found the place a mess, and my bike missing. He admitted to taking my $700 bicycle in a text message.  I called the police, they suggested telling him he had two weeks to get me my bike back, and if he doesn't, I should go down to the courthouse, file a small-claims against him for the missing rent money and get him arrested for stealing my bike.
What should I do?

Longer version:
He and I met July 2012. We spent August together then went off to school - I went off to study abroad in Europe, he went to a small college in the middle of nowhere.  We keep talking online, he talks about how much he hates his school and wants to transfer to a school in the city where I go to school or just drop out and find a job in the city where I got to school, I tell him I'm planning on finding an apartment to live off campus.

By October, he's strongly considering moving in with me, we have the following exchange on skype: Me: ""Anyway, for finances, I want you to be as independent of me as possible. So, we'll keep separate accounts, we'll split food and rent down the middle, stuff like that. Obviously if you find yourself short on rent, I'll cover it, but as much as possible, we'll keep it separate."" Him: ""agreed""

In December, I'm still in Europe, but I have my friends at school looking for apartments for me. They find one I like, negotiate a significant decrease in rent for paying rent in advance.  I pseudo-sign the lease while abroad, pay the first month rent and security deposit, then pay the rest when I arrive back in the US. He and I sign the actual lease upon arriving.

First few months go well, he's dropped out of school and is looking for work, I'm studying. I get an internship in California for the summer, his job search continues to meet with failure, is unwilling to go back to school. Our relationship begins to deteriorate.  While in California, I finally get sick of his shit, decide to break up with him. I let him stay in the apartment until I get back. At this point, I don't care about him not paying me for rent, utilities, internet, food, his psychologist, or anything else. I just want him gone.

The day before I come back, I get a text from him.
&gt;Him: ""Uhm. I got a tiny bit of bad news.""

&gt;Me: ""okay, what is it?""

&gt;Him: ""Your bike is gone and I'm getting stalked.""

&gt;Me: ""What?""

&gt;Me: ""Why is my bike gone?""

He tells me some guy he hooked up with while I was in California stole my bike the day before, and that he called the police about it.  I called the police upon arriving back, find that he never talked to the police.
I try to talk to my ex, he keeps dodging my phone calls and replying cryptically. I call the police to file a report about my bike being stolen. I also contact university security to report it being stolen and to get the description of the bike from when I registered it with them (including serial number).  The police come over, suggest I send him the following text:

&gt;Me (advised to text by the police): ""I filed a police report, the police have advised me to ask you for my bike back or failing that to sue you in small claims court for $2600 in unpaid rent.""
Him: ""Wait. Sue me. Lmfao. Legalthr0waway you paid the rent full. I never signed ANYTHING that says I have to pay you. So good luck with that one. Ill try to contact the bike stealer. To be honest I actually KNOW this guy. Let him borrow the bike. He never gave it back. I didn't want to throw him under the bus. But since you're being the largest asshole on this side of the earth ill try to talk to him.""

&gt;Me: ""You loaned out my bike!?""

&gt;Him: ""What fucking part of I'm having lunch with my parents do you not fucking understand.""

&gt;Me: ""The police are in my driveway right now, I don't care about your lunch.""

&gt;Me: ""And Officer [blank] would like to speak with you.""

&gt;Him: ""That's cool. I'm not answering my phone until I am done with lunch, you arrogant ass.""

&gt;Him: ""Here's what happened. I loaned the bike to a guy named [blank]. Genuinely nice kid. You may hit him up on grindr eventually.  But he didn't have a car and needed a way to get to class for a couple days until he got one. I told him just use my bike. Make sure to return it and he never did.""

&gt;Him: ""This happened like a week and a half ago.""

&gt;Me: ""Well, how are you going to get it back for me?""

&gt;Him: Says he has no contact with the guy, describes him, blah, blah, blah

&gt;Me: ""Okay, so here's what's going to happen. You have two weeks, starting Monday, to get my bike back. If I do not have it by that time, I'm going down to the courthouse with the report Officer [blank] gave me, and I will ask for a warrant for your arrest for the bike, and a small claims judgement for the rent you didn't pay.  If I do have my bike back before then, then I don't care and I'll toss the report out and small claims stuff out.""

&gt;Me: ""So I don't care how you reach him, but you better reach him""

&gt;Him: ""You're going to get me arrested for a bike I don't even have? Seriously legalthr0waway?""

&gt;Me: ""I trusted you with that bike. You didn't get it back to me. It's that simple.""

&gt;Him: ""Plus you'd sue me. when you know I have NO money.""

&gt;Me: ""It's incentive to get me my bike.""

&gt;Him: ""After this if you contact me at all I'm getting a restraining order.

&gt;Me: ""I'm just doing what the police officer recommended I do.""

&gt;Him: ""Well there's no proof for an arrest and there's no signatures for me to be sued. GG.""


So, I have those text messages, I have him on skype promising to pay half the rent, I know he signed the lease (the copy of the lease stored in the apartment is missing, I'm calling my landlord to get another copy), I have the police officer's name, number, and case reference number, and I have the registration information of my bike.

If I show up to the courthouse with this next week, can I get him arrested? Can I sue him in small claims court? Will I win?  Any and all advice is welcome (and no, I don't have money for a real lawyer)."

Most members do about two hours a day of call time (cold calling rich people or past donors to max out). Weekends usually have one or two instate fundraisers. Recess weeks will usually have a day of national fundraising out of state. I have never met a member who enjoys fundraising but in order to compete against rich self-funders who believe strongly enough in something to drop 200mil of their own money into a race.

I never got an answer to this question, but I guess I might as well ask.  I know that when he was still around, Ron Paul's office was...weird.  Really weird.  It was very different from every other office, from my perspective, not in a good way, but then again I don't like him or his policies at all.  So, what about Rand?  Is his office peculiar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc33td4?context=5)|Haven't worked with their office directly so can't really say but their softball team was a little over zealous. I think it's fair to say that they believe they are the only sane inmates in the asylum. 
[1\) Would it be fair to say that senators care more about campaign donors than constituents, even if those campaign donors are not from their state? What percentage of campaign donors are not constituents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|Some do, most don't. People forget that the vast majority of contributions, say 90% are small dollar donations. i'm talking less than $25 bucks per donation. And almost all, say 99% of those small dollar donations are from in state. If you start to piss off the average donor by placating a couple of the rich guys, that money will dry up quickly. 
[2\) What do you see as the key to why senators seem to have a huge ability to self-enrich themselves when in office?  It is far greater than the 174,000 salary they get.  So where is the money coming from?  Endorsement deals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|Again, I don't agree with your premise. Most are rich before they ever get here, they either come from money or enriched themselves in the private sector.. You almost have to be in order to run a successful campaign as it takes seed money to get one off the ground and to be viable before small donations can pick up the tab. That said, some Senators who get here the hard way, can make a little extra on the side in speaking fees. conventions or foreign businesses will pay a senator to come speak about something but this doesn't happen until they are out of office. In office, their best bet for extra cash is to write a book. All of their finances are public record btw, you can look up their financial disclosures and see everything line by line.  Those that aren't rich when they get here, wont be rich until they leave but thats alright for them as they can make bank once the do. Most will lobby or sit on a corporate board.
[3\)  Since special interest campaign donations correlate directly to votes in the senate, are the special interests generally donating because the senator already has the position they like, or are they donating in an effort to convince them to take the position they like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|Not sure that they directly correlate, but most will only donate to those that are supportive already. That's the basis of campaigns, you support those who agree with your beliefs. Some will hedge their bets and donate to everyone because they will want their phone calls answered no matter who wins, but that's not as common as you would think. Also, national groups will donate to those that sit on committees relevant to their issues. ie Defense companies will donate to members of Armed Services. 
[4\) On a scale of 1 to 10 how much do senators understand the average issue they vote on?  I notice that they seem to generally be baffled about technology, science, and economics, is this just a case of having trouble articulating their understanding, or a lack on knowledge of the topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|This varies drastically from member to member. Most successful senators will narrow their focus to a small subset of issues and become experts in that field. other members will rely on their knowledge for guidance. For some issues, they will rely on trade groups or associations for their expertise. Thats why it's important that each side of an issue have their own experts. For instance, we need the EFF to come in and argue against the MPAA on how best to combat piracy. Technology, specifically the internet and communications infrastructure, is where there is the biggest shortfall and you are right to be worried about this. One of the biggest mistakes we made was shutting down the Office of Technology Assessment. OTA's sole job was to provide nonpartisan analysis of complex scientific or technological issues to congress so that they could better understand and legislate. Some of OTA's responsibility was given to CRS but for the most part, we have to rely on outside groups to provide this kind of information. 
[What is your major and school you went to? How did you get this job? How much do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32uug?context=5)|Political science at a state university. First non food service/construction/janitorial job was on a campaign, from there I applied for a job in dc. Didn't get it but moved here anyway. Applied to a position in the senate employment bulletin. Got that but then the member retired so I got a new job with a different member. Worked for three so far and have been in dc for 7 years. All our salaries are public, google legistorm if your curious. Starting out, you'll be lucky to make more than 25k/year. That's why you get so many rich kids because it's very difficult to work here without help. When I started, I tended bar 20/hrs a week to make rent.
 |I'll also say that no one has had a raise around here in the last three years and turnover is increasing because of it. 7 years of hill plus 2 years of campaign net you about 60k in salary. (As an FYI a starting associate in a lobby shop will net you 110k, can you say revolving door?) 
[I have an uncle who said when he lived in DC he had to eat peanut butter sandwiches for 3 weeks straight once. Ever been in a similar situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3fnsx?context=5)|It is very hard to live in this city on your own on a staff assistant's salary. $25,000/yr goes quickly when you live with the third highest cost of living in the country. Most hill staffers if they are unsupported by rich parents (which admittedly there are few of and this is a problem) live in a flop house with five or six others, work a second job, and eat rammen. Luckily there is a large and poor immigrant population in DC so you can eat pretty well if you speak spanish and don't mind a sketchy neighborhood. This is how i survived for my first three years.

The man has his reasons, his time as a pow had understandably lasting effects, but those effects have made him volatile and quick to judgement.  I once saw him go of on an intern for no other reason than he was wearing a black belt with brown shoes. 
[How much do they actually care about their constituents' opinions once elected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32drn?context=5)|More than anyone seems to think. The vast majority of these people don't go through the trouble of a long and grueling campaign for their own self interest. It's too much work and most of them are smart enough to make money in an easier way if that's their goal. Same can be said for staff. Their are exceptions of course, but the vast majority of people, on both sides of the aisle, are here because of a sense of public service an a genuine belief that they can improve their country. I know that sounds far fetched but the job is to demanding and thankless to do it for any other reason. 
[How, if at all, did the Edward Snowden ordeal impact your job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32xta?context=5)|My job, not so much directly. Indirectly, it is still very much an issue of discussion. Congress doesn't like to be made a fool of by the White House and many members believe they were misled by the NSA. The intel whence committee who has oversight will not let this go as they were largely unaware of the extent of these operations. This will be addressed this session. 
[What time will that be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc36l4b?context=5)|After 11 tonight or tomorrow morning. I'll keep answering as long as people are asking.

[Is being tough on drugs still seen as free political capital? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc349qb?context=5)|Generally yes but it varies from state to state. I assume you are referring to pot and not coke or heroin. Most members recognize that the tied is turning. Some have concerns that things could go horribly wrong if a transition is mishandled so they are being cautious. Everyone is watching CO and WA and the DoJ's response. I personally think it will be legalized in the next ten years, too costly to keep fighting against it. 
[Do senators and congresspeople look at their jobs as careers or as callings?  Cynically speaking, they often seem more interested in keeping their jobs than doing the work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32rmk?context=5)|I spoke a little about this up thread but the job is far too hard with far too little reward for most members to continue for self preservation alone. The vast majority believe that they can still make a difference and that's why they stay. Those that don't leave to lobby and make far more money doing so. 
[How often do representatives and senators speak to members of the opposite party? Is there hope for bipartisan compromise on any legislation in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc327sc?context=5)|Most daily. Several are friends but the pressure of being in state and the 24 hour news cycle have made it much more difficult. In the past, members moved to dc. They brought their families, they lived here, got to know one another. It made it much easier for them to work together because your relationship gave you some level of common ground. Outside of work, you realized the one issue you agreed on and worked towards a fix. Now members are wheels up on Thursday and don't get back to dc until Monday night. There simply isn't time for them to get to know each other, not when it's a story if an r and a d are seen having dinner together and are crucified for it by rush or shultz.
[Do you think that this lack of a personal connection between members plays a role in the current status quo? Or is it more related to a fear of a being seen in one's district or state with a member of the opposite party and getting flack for it in a re-election campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32lum?context=5)|I know he not popular around here but Senator Dodd summed this up pretty well in his last speech to the senate.

[What do Senators look for when interviewing?  How can one make up for the lack of DC experience?    Is there loan repayment in your office? If so, is it pretty good?    What are the typical employment options after working on the Hill?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc4j1n6?context=5)|Unless you want to be LD, Comm Dir, or CoS, the Senator won't be part of your interview process so what you are really asking is what does the office manager look for. This depends on how old you are and what you want to do but general advice is to be confident but don't pretend to know everything. Do your homework on the person you want to work for and their state. Be able to answer questions about issues they and their state care about. As for experience, if you are looking for an internship, being from the state or district is first. It's hard to get a staff ass job without interning somewhere first but campaign experience can help you there. LC's usually start as staff asses but some can jump that line by coming from a relevant NGO, think tank, or private sector job. ie work for a bank if you want to do banking policy. LA's are usually working on the hill already but it's not unheard of to hire someone with a higher degree. most offices will hire vets for defense or foreign policy gigs.
 |There is and it used to be generous but sequestration cut it in half. It covers about a third of my combined monthly student loan payments. Each office gets a total pot thats split among everyone who wants a cut. This is where nepotism can help you. If an office is full of rich kids with no loans, that pot can be quite generous. If your office is full of salt of the earth, hardworking, real folk, then it can be as little as $25/mo.
 |After the hill, it depends on what department you were in. Leg go to lobby if you're evil or advocacy if your not (these are exactly the same thing btw), press go to pr firms or consulting, admin goes to admin jobs pretty much anywhere. 
[What are the ratios of constituent calls regarding intervention in Syria, Against action vs in favor of action?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32doq?context=5)|I'd say 90-10 against but the reasons for opposition are far more varied. Some oppose because it's not our business, some because they don't think chemical weapons are bad idea, some don't trust the intelligence. But the vast majority are convinced that we are sending soldiers and invading Syria. Misinformation is the biggest driver in opposition to anything. Most of the people who call are against an issue because we have done a horrible job communicating what's true and what's myth. (The ACA is not government run healthcare, it's insurance reform)

Is there some small insight that a Redditor can provide that would help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc369l2?context=5)|Be firm but polite when you call your reps office. Rude or angry calls may make you feel better but in the end, the 22 year old staff assistant wont record them if you're a dick. Also, don't have a short attention span; if you have a position on a particular policy, keep expressing it until you get what you want. A lot of things are easily ignored because public pressure wanes after a few days.

If there was a simple solution we would have taken it. No secret that congress and the administration are always looking for the easy way out, but sometimes there isn't one.

Worst part, is watching your really good idea die on the senate floor.
 |Also, on a strictly personal level, I still get a high every time i walk in to the capitol. Feeling the worn marble under your feet, where countless others walked before you, gives you a real sense of history. You have to remind yourself to take a moment and realize how lucky you are to work in a place that is responsible for so much good in the world while also recognizing the potential exists to do so much harm. It still gets me.
[Congress gets an insane amount of days off...what do most congressmen do on their day off, and do you feel they deserve such a high amount of time off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc4mc7h?context=5)|Well to start, I don't agree with your premise. I assume by days off, you are referring to days congress is in recess. The vast majority of those days are not vacation days (in fact we have been trying to re-brand recess as 'district work periods' for ages) On a typical recess day, the senator is back in the state meeting with constituent groups, holding office hours, touring employer sites, and yes, fundraising. For instance, this last august recess, my boss visited every county in the state and had at least three events per day, seven days a week. By design, these have a local focus and it's like pulling teeth to get even the local paper to cover it. Our press office works very hard to make sure this is not the case, but unless you're there, it's unlikely you'll ever hear about this kind of work. In fact, a lot of businesses will ask you not to mention a business out of fear they will be branded a supporter by their customers.
 |I think on the whole, the workload of a senator is drastically underestimated by the public. Most, if not all, have a daily schedule that starts at around 7:00am and goes to about 9:00 pm, seven days a week. That time belongs to the office and we schedule every minute of it. His only real down time is taken up with travel, and if he's on a train or in a car, we fill it with phone calls. Now i will say that too much of his time is spent fundraising for the next campaign. Something like 20% of his awake hours are used for 'call time' and fundraisers and that steadily increases the closer you get to the end of cycle.
 |My guy has had a total of five days off this year that he was supposed to be 'off the grid' but even then he was still taking phone calls from the Chief of Staff. 
[Do you find yourself/others on the staff frequently working extremely long/odd hours or is there a balance between your work and private life?

Recess is a time to catch up with family friends as session is much more demanding. It also depends on if your particular issues are on the floor in a given week. Obviously foreign policy/nat security are hitting it hard right now. That said, there's always mail to respond to, briefs to write, meeting to take. I'll say I am expected to answer email no matter what time, day, or vacation I might be on. 
[Completely serious question.  How much corruption is there?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc34clz?context=5)|This may sound like a non-answer but it really depends on how you define it. In general, I'd say very little but that's not to say being a high dollar donor won't get your phone call answered. Quid-pro-quo is very rare because it's far too easy to get caught. Also, the earmark ban has gone a long way to stop those kind of transactions. An individual member can no longer add a budget line on his own so it's become too difficult to secure a contract for a buddy or donor. However, money in politics can still buy you a voice to make your case and for some members that might be enough to convince them to go their way. Either way, a member is only taking a call or meeting if that person represents a particular constituency in their state. 
[Thats interesting, outside looking in Quid-pro-quo seems the most fucking common thing ever, at least on issues that voters don't care about (which it seems to me, is like all of them\).  I mean everything from allowing TV commercials from big pharma, food subsidies, cotton subsidies, random ass subsidies, copyright extensions every time micky mouse is due to go into the public domain,  to allowing bonuses after the bailout seems like its Quid-pro-quo to me.  I guess my question is how are these things not quid-pro-quo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc35xq0?context=5)|Some might call those giveaways, others might call that good for business/economy. I'm not saying I agree with this but many people feel what's good for business is good for 'Mercia. They may argue that protecting Disney profits, protects the economy. Every policy is good for someone, Rs will argue that it trickles down D's will argue that that's bullshit. 
[I can see that to some policies, but, I'll take food subsidies and copyright extension.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain that no serious researcher has ever made a convincing case that copyright extension, or food subsidies, or cotton subsidies to Brazilian farmers, have been a good thing. You ask a libertarian economist, a Marxist economist and a main stream economist, you'll get the same answer when it comes to long copyright protection and food subsidies: that they both are terrible.  When you say every policy is good for someone, thats strikes me as favor trading, as protecting Disney profits is certainly good for Disney, but if a senator were to ask almost any economist, they'd tell you its bad for the American economy.  Do senators actually believe that arbitrarily protecting a certain industries profits is good for the economy? Do they ever ask economists or political scientists for their input? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc36i6p?context=5)|Not to simplify too much but if said business is in your state and employs a large number of constituents then they become a priority. It's one of the faults of geographical representation. I'm not saying it's right but on most issues the district or state comes before country. This is also way big business or defense contractors have a factory in every state. 
[As an average citizen what hope can you give to me that these people actually do care about my time and want to represent me the citizen? I know all we see is the bad in the media so that's why I'm asking if you could shed some light on the good.  There were control tower furlough for pilots occurring throughout the states for weeks. A three-day weekend was coming up for congress and that issue was passed/funded in hours. This just screams to me that it's something THEY cared about because it wasn't being touched before hand with such urgency. As opposed to something the people may care about.  I don't want to list the examples out, but I can if it helps. I'm not here to play the blame game I'm just curious as an average citizen and seeing situations like this occur where should I find hope and light in that this system is working to better my people and my community instead of their bottom line and buddies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc38n1q?context=5)|All I can say is that most members are good people trying to help in the best way they think is right. The problem is that everyone has a different opinion on what IS right. I've been around awhile and i really don't have a cynical view of the vast majority of members who I disagree with. They just believe in a system of values that run contrary to mine, but are no less dedicated to making this country a better place.
 |As for the FAA furloughs, that was unfortunate timing. A fix had been in the works long before that weekend. It was one of the problems with sequestration that most realized we had to fix before cuts went in to effect. Problem is other things took precedent on the legislative calendar and the fix was pushed back longer than anticipated. Basically one senator put a hold on the bill so we had to wait out the 30 hours of debate post cloture. This pushed the whole thing back despite the fact that an overwhelming majority believed that air traffic controllers are necessary, budget be damned. we were hindered by our own rules and everyone looked bad a s a result. (not to diminish the very real consequences of those directly effected.)

[Also, do you expect there is a career path you can/will take  that will cause your salary to significantly rise that doesn't have to do with lobbying?  Also also, did they just let you start bar tending after graduation, or did you have to become a barback first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc37v6k?context=5)|Honestly, not really. You can make money consulting. But that's just telling people how to lobby. I still have a sense of public service and still enjoy the work despite the negative approval and lack of benefits. I realized I wasn't going to be rich awhile ago, but I live a comfortable life and that's good enough for me. That may change if I have kids but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
[What are your general duties as a staffer for a senator? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32859?context=5)|I'll speak for dc because that's what I know. The state offices a re a different game.
 |DC staff are in three camps. Admin, press, and leg. Each have their hierarchy but admin keeps the office running from a practice side, press communicates the policy, and legislative creates the policy. All of this is done with input from the member but a good staff knows the member's position before he/she does.
 |For leg, I'd say 60% of their time is spent dealing directly with constituents. Not all of this is answering phones or mail, a lot of is meeting with various groups advocating for a specific policy. It's then the job to communicate that policy to the senator. This is what lobbying is. People tend to worry about this but it should serve some comfort that no staffer or member would take a meeting unless that group has a direct interest in their state. It's not worth their time or political capital to work an issue that is into important back home. 
[I realize you work in the Senate and not the House, but if you could wave a magic wand and accomplish one of these, which would you choose and why?  100% publicly financed campaigns.  House districts that are not gerrymandered (as close to 50/50 dem/gop districts as possible\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc354j9?context=5)|I can't have both? District lines are more difficult to fix because each state has their own process. Publicly financed campaigns also have issues as SCOTUS affirmed that donations are part of free speech. I do think donations play an important role in determining viability but the regulation (or lack there of) needs a drastic overhaul. Stricter regulation would have an effect across all federal offices so I guess that's my answer but the district map is why the house is a complete clusterfuck of radicals on both fringes. 
[Scotus hasn't struck down donation limits (yet\). They've said that the first amendment protects unlimited independent expenditures however.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc39tlh?context=5)|Exactly, and until they do, we should be placing strong limits on all forms of political donations, no matter the classification of the organization. 
[Do you feel your boss is in trouble in his/her next election cycle?  If so how do you plan your attack in order to win re-election?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc39r0y?context=5)|The benefit of the Senate is that they have a six year term. This usually translates to six years of job security post election. The house has it worse (at the staff level at least) as they never feel safe. Working in two year incriminates makes it very difficult to get settled. How do you buy a house or have kids with the fear that you may be out of a job in two years?
 |As for going in to cycle, an incumbent has to rely on their casework more than their policy positions. A senate office performs a lot of services for constituents in trouble with federal agencies. Their performance in helping individuals translates to votes and good will word of mouth. This is where the notion of 'congress sucks but my guy is one of the good ones' comes from. 
[In your opinion, what is the best way to get stuff moved or noticed by a Senator, like for example the opinion of the brewing circumstances in Syria? Is writing letters actually any good or is it all fruitless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc37msr?context=5)|Answered in more depth elsewhere but snail mailed letters of a personal nature and phone calls are your best bet. be polite, notify the staff ass that you are a constituent and ask that your response be recorded.

Advice?",[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1lzz9w/engineering_grad_student_beginning_my_job_search/,"I'm two semesters shy of a masters in engineering, and I'm about to begin looking in earnest for a full-time position. I go to a top 10 program, graduated undergrad with upwards of a 3.6 (from the same school), and I have a good deal of internship experience in my field...but I've had two semester-long design projects during graduate school that both went *very* badly. I ended up with A's in both classes, and I've had other, smaller-scale design projects that have gone much less disasterously, but I get the sense my performance on the longer-term projects is going to be much more important to employers. The thought of having to mention these projects in an interview or on my resume is a huge source of anxiety for me, and I was hoping I could get a clearer perspective on the issue from the community here.

First, how much trouble am I actually in? How much weight do employers put on this kind of stuff? Am I blowing this out of proportion?

Second, should I even put this stuff on my resume? I'd like to at least mention them, because I did learn a lot from both projects, but I'm afraid that's asking for trouble if and when I get interviewed.

Lastly, are there any general tips you could give me about how best to discuss bad project experiences in interviews?

So, I will summarize my situation. I kind of fucked up HS. Didn't completely fucked up: my city has 2 major universities, one is very good in the charts, one not very good. 

I didn't get the grades for the better one (not by far) but still I didn't make it, and I am going to the other.

Now, I want to maximize my future possibilities as much as possible, and since I am fortunate enough to not have to pay rent (staying at home) and not having to worry about paying for food, I don't want to just sit around and do nothing, I want to study, but I also want to get work experience, so hopefully after my bachelor's I will also have a few internships that I (hope) will make up for the worse university's reputation.

I know the market is competitive and even unpaid internships are hard to get, but I am ready to put a lot of effort into this.

How do I go about and do this?

I was thinking of e-mailing/showing up in person at HR of relevant companies in my degree and asking if any intern is needed. 

Is that a good idea?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

I tried to get an internship this summer and was rejected for interviews by each place I applied to with the exception of an LED assembler position.I asked my dad who is an electrical engineer if I should take the interview and he said to not do it, as it would be a waste of my time.

Well since I couldn't get an interview, my dad said he would teach me some stuff. It's been 3 months and he doesn't really teach me anything. Just stuff which I've already known because he thinks I'm a complete imbecile. He gives me projects which I do, sometimes I get stuck and don't know what to do. My dad prettyy much just shits on me about everything. About how I haven't learned anything all summer, and with only 2 weeks left until my senior year starts I too can say I haven't really learned anything. My dad really just says a lot of negative stuff about me, such as how I'm a lazy bum and shits all over me. I know he is trying to do this for my own good but it's disheartening for me when he complete shits all over me. I make a mistake and he will keep on harping me about it. I can't deal with it and it's pushed me further away from him as a son. I'd rather have him punch me in the face rather than him shitting all over me.

He has plenty of tools. Oscilloscopes, FPGA, I have programs like LabVIEW and Matlab. He doesn't teach me any of this stuff and I'm forced to learn it all on my own. I'm not even close to the sharpest crayon in the box, but I really need help learning this stuff on my own and he refuses to help me, then proceeds to shit on my when I get stuck.

When I try to do my own little side projects at home. I tend to get stuck many times and often times I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. However, when I'm a school I'm completely focused all the time and always know what to do.

In the end I still see this as my fault as I've practically wasted my whole summer doing absolutely nothing for 3 months.Is there anything I can do to learn as much as I can before I go back to school in 2 weeks? I want to try and get an internship after I graduate with a B.S. and get a job shortly after getting an internship."

I come from a family of business owners, there are probably about 10 people in my immediate and extended family that own businesses.

It seems like the problems that people have aren't unique to the field in which their business is in, but they are unique to the owner.

My dads biggest weakness is hiring the right people. There is a high turnover rate because he tries to make guy with a marketing degree do telesales, and an engineering intern build a lab he's not qualified to build.

I would not say that these are problems unique to industrial hygiene, they're unique to the owner.

My aunt runs a psychology office, and has no freaking clue about any mental illness other than cause and effect ones. By cause and effect I mean, ""this happened and you are this way now because of it"". Like PTSD. She has no idea about psychosis or anything like that and (thankfully) refuses to treat those people.

While this problem might be unique to a psychology business, I doubt it's a common problem. She is the root of the problem because she doesn't understand certain mental illnesses that as a psychologist she should understand.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that when running a business, the biggest roadblock you will ever have is yourself. It looks like the key to running a business is to not be egotistical and realize when you're doing something wrong and not repeat that mistake.

Probably easier said than done because nobody likes to admit they're doing something wrong, especially if they've been doing it for years. "

So I have been a long-time master race member.  I have been building gaming PC's for many years both for myself and friends.  I have converted peasants by offering to build their shrine and teaching them the ways of our Lord. I have happily done this for friends at no charge; how can you put a price on enlightenment?  

Now, I do not consider the donation of my time and knowledge to be a sacrifice.  It is our sacred duty to bring the light to those who are willing to seek it.  However, my most recent attempt at conversion resulted in a great loss on my part.  On to the main tale...

So my now ex-GF (not a bad breakup, will explain) was always a peasant gamer.  She has been a 360 gamer with this current generation of peasantry.  I had told her of the ways of Gaben, and she would occasionally begin to show signs of a desire to rise above her peasant past.  This brings me to my sacrifice.

I had a glorious shrine.  I built it roughly 5 years ago.  955BE OC'ed, 8GB DDR3-1600, 240GB SSD, aftermarket fan on the CPU, full tower case with added fans, and two Radeon 4890's in crossfire to provide the true power.  Top of the line when it was constructed.  I also have a Sager notebook with an i&amp;-3610QM, 8GB DDR3 ram, and a GTX 670m.  I bought the Sager to take with me when I traveled for an internship last summer. 

Recently I had to move across the country for grad school, which was the reason for the aforementioned breakup.  A few weeks prior I decided I would make a grand sacrifice.  This was the ultimate sacrifice and the decision was not an easy one.  After much deliberation, I gave my glorious shrine to my GF so she could begin her ascension.  I still have my Sager notebook that can handle anything I need to play, but the loss was a large one. 

I may build a new shrine in the future, but grad school has limited my available gaming time.  For now, I am content with gaming on the Sager.  I of course still use my gaming keyboard, mouse, and a proper 24"" monitor.  

What do you think /r/pcmasterrace?  Was this sacrifice worthy of Gaben's praise?  Have I done the master race proud?  Have I shown my true devotion to our Lord and Savior?"

I come seeking the advice of the masses. It seems more often these days that people are finding the right answer and getting the help they need from social outlets so here is my shot in the dark.

I just graduated college this last December and am staring down the massive debt that is student loans (about 60k). Thankfully, I was able to get an internship at a company that matured into a full time position but sadly in this economy it’s not quite enough to dig out of the abyss that is earning a 4 year college degree. I have plans/dreams like most other Americans. I want to pay off my credit card debt, get out of these personal loans, pay off that dreadful auto loan, live the American dream and buy a house but most importantly I want to put a ring on the love of my life’s finger.  When the cards fall it’s a sad day knowing that the hard earned money I have from this wonderful post bachelors degree job just isn't enough.

So, I ask you oh wise and benevolent Redditors, what sort of part time or side jobs would you recommend to someone who works a steady 8am to 4:30pm looking to bring in some extra income? I am not afraid of hard work either; I served in the US Air Force for 6 years so I am ready to make that sacrifice. I currently work in the IT industry as a Software Tester and there in lies my strengths but I want to put in the work to get out of debt so doing something like over night stock or loading garbage on the weekends is defiantly on my radar. 

TLDR; what would be the best part time job to search for so I can get out of debt faster?

Basic background:

* Junior in Computer Information Systems at a big university

* Many internship interviews later with various companies (Apparently I suck at interviewing), I've received an offer to work with one of the top non-profit organizations, very, very well known. 

* Honestly surprised I landed it considering it was only 1 phone interview and I don't think I spoke very well. 

Problems:

* Not sure which field to enter after college, somewhat interested in Systems Analyst or Big data/Business intelligence solutions, but really I have no clue. 

* This internship feels like the jack of all trades. According to the description I'll be doing help desk support calls, QA testing, Project Management, hardware and software upgrades. I hear knowing a little bit of everything is bad compared to being specialized in one sector. Also it's kind of unrelated to my major because I want to enter the business side of IT, not the technical after college. 

* Just started a help desk position last month at my university. Very chill, I get to sit around and do homework/do whatever for pretty much 95% of my shift. More administrative work than help desk, but I still do some phone tech support. Supervisors are some of the coolest guys I've met. 

* Internship pays more than the current uni job, but I'm assuming I will actually have to work (this is me just being a lazy bastard) **and I'm afraid of burning bridges considering I just started a month ago.** They only have 2 student workers, me (mainly mornings), and another guy who does afternoons. 

* I'm still waiting to hear back from another company that I interviewed with for a data related internship in the health care field. Had 2 interviews and he followed up asking for my references which I think is a good sign. Very relaxed office environment and small team, not a well known company.

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, but what would you guys recommend doing? This is a very great organization, but I'm not sure if it's worth doing the internship for 1 semester.

The thing is, in my country, I can follow two different  paths:

- One: the ""classical"" path: It's going to be 2 years of classes in a technical school, followed by a 3-months internship in a company. It is assumed that the internship is only part of the studies and will NOT lead to a job after it's over.

- Two: The experimental path, that is being tried inspired by the european models: I'll have the basic formation (about 3 months) in a technical school, but from then on I'll just be learning inside a real company, for one year and a half.

Things to consider about the ""new model"": 

- I'll be paid during that period of formation that happens inside the company. But not a lot precisely.. about $400 a month for a full time schedule. I can probably earn the same amount with the classical system plus a part time job.

- Although I can't know what company will be assigned to me, I know that the applicants with the best CV's  do their company time in Microsoft, which I guess it's a huge plus (and I'm fairly certain that, being bilingual and with 2 years of university I'll probably be in the top). However, I've also heard about a lot of people who end up stuck in companies not-related to CS, making powerpoints or learning COBOL for a whole year.

- The ""new system"" doesn't offer me any holidays, while in the old system I'll have 3 months of holidays in the summer + some more days during Christmas.

- In the end, both systems give you the same technical degree; no future employer is going to know which system I used to earn it. Although, I can probably add the name of the company where I studied in my CV as an internship or something like that.

What would you do in my position?"
1m4zp2,2,2013-09-10,Need advice on making major changes early in my career.,engcareeradvice,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1m4zp2/need_advice_on_making_major_changes_early_in_my/,"This is a throwaway because all of my coworkers are on reddit.

When I was in school, I interned for a big consumer products company (doing packaging design and engineering).  I did well there and really enjoyed it, but the economy wasn't doing so well when I graduated, and they were in a hiring freeze, so I didn't get a full time offer.  If they had been able to make me an offer, I would have taken it.  It's in the city I consider ""home"" and I really liked the work I was doing.

I had a couple of other offers, but none in the same city, and I picked one with a smaller company in another state.  I like the job and the city, but it's definitely different from what I thought I would be doing- more computer engineering and my degree is in mechanical.  I've been here for just over a year and a half; I've made a lot of friends, found stuff I like to do, generally gotten settled in pretty well.  

I'm happy where I am and wouldn't have gone looking for a new job, but my manager from when I was an intern at the first company just got in touch with me to let me know that his group will be hiring for a couple of positions soon and wanted to know if I'm interested.

So, I know I have a lot of decisions to make, but I'm looking for advice/insight on how this might affect my career.  Does it look bad to jump from one thing to another so early in my career?  I feel like I haven't even had a chance to do something resume-worthy at my current company and there is definitely a lot of room to grow, but the other job is more what I had my eye on the whole time I was in school and is more what I thought my career would be like.

tl;dr: Help me choose between two good job options, please!"

[What percentage of your readers vetting submissions are high schoolers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nz1t?context=5)|Our interns and readers are mainly college (and grad-school) grads, and, in the past three years, they've spanned an age range of some twenty-five years. The high schoolers (there have only been two in recent memory) have been some of the best.
[As a student writer in college with a growing portfolio of creative short stories, what are the best ways for me to improve my chances of publication (content aside\), be it a well-written cover letter, a correctly formatted submission, or a mailed (rather than e-mailed\) submission? In other words, what do you guys like to see?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5mu8o?context=5)|In all seriousness, content is king. The cover letter is very much secondary (keep it short and sweet). We only accept submissions via postal mail.
[Also, publications like The Paris Review can make (or break\) a young writer's career. How do you balance choosing submissions between emerging and established writers? Do you guys (like the New Yorker\) prefer established to emerging writers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5mu8o?context=5)|There's glory in discovering a new writer, but we've certainly never turned down good work from an established author.
[Yes! My quote is deemed a classic!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nwjw?context=5)|YOU are a classic, /u/Scramisaur.
[How do you (as readers\) define the difference between genres (poetry, fiction, CNF\)? Do you think the lines between genres can/should be defined? Have these lines always been well defined for you? Are these lines still extant for you (if they ever existed\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n4w6?context=5)|It has to do with whether they hit the return key.
[What trends in recent poetry and fiction do you find yourselves rejecting, not just as editors, but also as readers? In the recent Refinery29 story, Lorin says, “I would describe my look as ‘realistic.’ Low on whimsy. Low on flash. It may be coincidence, but that describes my taste in fiction and poetry, too."" Is that true for the rest of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n99w?context=5)|""I personally dislike speculative fiction, alternate realities, and so forth."" —Sadie.
 |""Suburban malaise."" —Justin.
 |""I kind of like suburban malaise, but I wish I'd said my look was Adlai Stevenson."" —Lorin.
 |""Oh, I also hate the obvious specter of childhood sexual abuse hanging over domestic stories."" —Sadie.
 |""I'll pass."" —Clare.
 |""Oh, and I hate magical-realist food fiction."" —Sadie.
 |""Actually, I hate bored narrators. You can say that about me."" —Clare.
[What is magical-realist food fiction? Is that like when a character eats way too much and is unrealistically slim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5q0o6?context=5)|""No, that's what we call 'every network sitcom.'"" —Sadie.
[I've only recently begun to get interested in The Paris Review, mainly because of your digital/social media presence, which I think is tremendous (great work, Justin\). Do you see this becoming more important in the future? Do you think you'll ever be ""online-only?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n5f0?context=5)|We'll never be online only.
 |Thank you for the compliment! We also like Justin. —All the editors except Justin.
[Which literary magazines and blogs do you read?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n42f?context=5)|A handful of our favorites: [Foxing Quarterly](http://www.foxingquarterly.com), [n+1](http://nplusonemag.com), [The White Review](http://www.thewhitereview.org) (founded by a former Paris Review intern), [The New York Review of Books](http://www.nybooks.com), [The Public Domain Review](http://publicdomainreview.org), [The New York Tyrant](http://www.nytyrant.com), to name just a few.
[What is the average number of words your staffers read before they determine if something is slush? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n658?context=5)|The salutation. (Anything that doesn't come from an agent is technically ""slush,"" which isn't a pejorative.)
 |If you mean, How much of a story do we read before we reject it, then, as a general rule: first five pages, last five pages.
[What is the average number of story submissions you receive during a given review period? How do you whittle down the number of entries into a manageable number and then settle on which to publish?  Do you as editors look for what is trending (in terms of genres and current fads, I doubt this\) or simply go for what you deem to be the best of submissions you receive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n6ix?context=5)|We receive somewhere in the ballpark of 15,000 submissions a year. (We're expecting that to double thanks to our AMA.) Our interns screen the unsolicited submissions (the ""slush"") and pass the good stuff along to the editors.
[Hemingway, Capote, Nabakov, Ellison, all greats who wrote for the common man and did not focus (too heavily\) on Manhattan and its insular sensibilities. Much of what I've seen recently in the Paris Review seems very esoteric and geared toward the Union Square lit scene. I'm concerned that it could be a bit of an echo chamber sometimes. How do you keep the common reader, that book lover from Decatur, interested in picking up your stories? How could you better serve them in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5pdb6?context=5)|""It's funny; I don't think of Nabokov as addressing himself to ""the common man."" But I'm not sure who that common man or woman is supposed to be.
 |""We publish what interests us. It's not clear to me who else's taste we could consult. In general, writing speaks to writing. Echoes are not necessarily to be avoided."" —Lorin.
[As a publishing/journalism industry hopeful, I'm curious about your career trajectories. How did you get where you are now? (&lt;I know Swung_by_Seraphim asked a similar question earlier, but wait, there's more!\) What were your entry-level jobs? Did you take unpaid internships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nc6s?context=5)|""Clare and I are both former (Paris Review) interns. That was our entry-level job."" —Stephen.
 |""My first job? I was an editorial assistant at a publishing house."" —Sadie.
 |""I was a part-time secretary at Publishers Weekly."" —Lorin.
 |""Advertising."" —Justin.
 |""This is my entry-level job."" —Hailey.
[In answering another question, you mentioned that publishing something from the slush pile is rare because literary agents are very active in representing new writers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oxhz?context=5)|A story, as such, might not be worth an agent's time, but it's often the best way for an agent to pick up a new writer.
[I was told that short stories aren't really worth an agent's time. Has the state of publishing changed that? How important is short fiction now versus the good ol' days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oxhz?context=5)|It depends which good ol' days you mean.  In the twenties and thirties, for example, short stories were the best way for a writer to assure a steady income—after Hollywood. That's changed over time; now most writers make their money in Hollywood or by teaching.
[, I'd like to say that I understand the need to digitize. While I love to collect the printed copies, the app is sleek, easy to use and classy as hell. But what I'm curious about, is the significant increase in The Paris Review's social media presence in the past year. Is this an attempt to appear more accessible? Target a younger audience? Establish a brand identity? Turn the spotlight around? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5na6b?context=5)|Glad you like the app!
 |At the end of the day, all of our efforts are directed toward finding new readers for the magazine—and putting out consistently excellent writing online, as well. We don't distinguish between media in that sense.
 |As a print quarterly, we face the obvious hurdle of coming out every three months, and our online presence (via the blog and via social media) is a way of both keeping in touch in the interim and showcasing work we believe in.
[Any truth to starting out as a CIA front?  If yes, has anyone written about those days?  If not, how did the rumor get started?  Either way, whats the best ""on assignment"" story that didn't wind up in the interviews?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oq17?context=5)|Carolyn Kellogg did a good job of laying out the facts in a [recent LA Times piece](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2012/05/salon-cia-paris-review-be-skeptical.html).
[After being drawn in by the whole CIA front concept, I began to enjoy the interviews in chronological order and am now a loyal print subscriber. Thanks for all the great work you do. Looking forward to the fall issue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oq17?context=5)|For a more imaginative take, check out Toby Barlow's [Babayaga](http://www.amazon.com/Babayaga-A-Novel-Toby-Barlow/dp/0374107874).
[Were there are any writers you passed on that you later regretted doing so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5msye?context=5)|There are writers we admire whose work, for one reason or another, didn't seem right for us. (That happens a fair amount and is always a drag.)
[What are your ""new artists to watch"" at the moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5mytz?context=5)|There are a few new writers—new to us—in our [new issue](http://www.theparisreview.org/current-issue): Ben Nugent, Andrew Martin, Bill Cotter, and Christine Smallwood (though we've long been admirers of her nonfiction). Ottessa Moshfegh won our Plimpton Prize last year, which is a $10,000 annual prize for new writers published in our pages.
[Can I get one of your rejection cards? Even they are legendary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nmum?context=5)|Submit something that starts with the closing of a car door. We'll go from there.

[What are your thoughts on New York as a literary center? Is it tough to afford living in the city as a writer or editor? Will publications with Manhattan offices, like the Paris Review, consider moving somewhere cheaper? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nzha?context=5)|It's tough, but we're a New York institution and aim to stay here for as long as we can.
[In your opinion, why is Carson McCullers read so infrequently?

[How, as editor, do you maintain the delicate balance of operating within the Plimptonian model while at the same time infusing The Paris Review with new energy? TPR is so much marked by tradition yet at the same time it must also reflect the times...The digitizing of the interviews, for example, was a brilliant decision on your behalf because it allows TPR's past to live within the modern framework of the digital age. Seems like a difficult task (which you do so well!\) and I am curious how you go about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5niuv?context=5)|The ""Plimptonian model"" was always about finding new writers and promoting the magazine with whatever tools came to hand.

In a world where much creative energy is spent making products into ""functional art""--I'm looking at Apple--why do you think entities like The Paris Review still exist?

&gt;[DATE]

&gt;Recruitment

&gt;[COPMANY]

&gt;My name is [MYDOGGEORGE] and I’m a senior at the [SCHOOL] and expect to graduate in May of 2014 with a BS in economics, BS in mathematics, BBA in finance, and minor in computer science. I am interested in pursuing the [POSITION] at [COPMANY] and I’ve enclosed my resume and background information below.

&gt;Over the course of my college career I’ve been enamored by financial markets. I’ve dedicated much of my course work to studying financial theory and I’ve devoted my free time to observing and trading financial markets.  My fundamental knowledge and technical skill allows me to make quick, educated decisions and my passion makes me highly motivated and inquisitive; I strongly feel my background will complement [COPMANY]’s training program perfectly. 

&gt;In the past two years I’ve held highly autonomous positions as an intern and web developer for my university’s college of medicine.  Through these positions I’ve worked with executives, deans, and department heads and I’ve gained the ability to work efficiently and competently in a fast paced, high pressure environment.  I started my first job at the age of 15 and I’ve held one ever since; I’m a dedicated, passionate, loyal employee and I take great pride in working to improve myself every day.

&gt;Over summer break I built a fully automated analysis platform that lets me back test and simulate a live trading environment.  My program is written in Python and uses Yahoo! as its primary data source; I collect minute data via Yahoo!’s API and 15 minute data via my live environment.  I’ve also built VBA macros that allow me to interface and view my data, back tests, and simulated portfolios.  My program has been operational for two months and my YTD return is 2%.

&gt;Over the past three years I’ve maintained a modest buy and hold portfolio where investment decisions are based on industry trends, company fundamentals, and portfolio management; my YTD return is 11%. Since late June I’ve actively paper traded via Market Watch and experienced YTD returns of 16%. 

&gt;Trading is in my blood and competition is my fuel; given my background in economics and finance and my quantitative and computational abilities I am a particularly good fit for a career at [COPMANY].  I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you and learn more about [COPMANY] at your earliest convenience. I can be reached at [PHONE] or via email at [EMAIL]. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;[NAME]

He would still be saving money, as I would be taking a massive paycut and focusing solely on creating/editing/curating content--with a per-word rather than an hourly rate, which is my preference; I would end up making more per hour and have the freedom to pursue other clients--but he has basically decided that if I won't do it he won't be paying someone else to do it, but he still wants it done (also refuses to hire me full-time or to hire a full-time marketer that isn't me, which is what he really needs to do and which I've told him several times).

I'm currently a Junior at a very good school for computer science (think top ten for CS and Engineering) with a 3.3 GPA that is considered above average. I'm currently a computer engineering major. My school prioritizes hardware for CompE, but I'm heavily interested in software. As a result, I've just got intro classes with C++ and Java with some hardware experience.

I'm currently on my last term for coop with a very unsatisfying company. I was hoping for a fulfilling software position, but I started early with a less than ideal company doing defense contracting. I love software, but I barely do software here. Now that I'm finishing my coop, I've really put myself out there and marketed myself to some competitive companies.

Right now, a very promising midsize software company is interested in me for an internship. However, they are reluctant to do summer-only internships for anyone that isn't extremely qualified. They have told me that they are really interested in me doing a Spring term with them so they can train me to do intense work in the Summer.

I think this is a very exciting idea. However, I'm already on my third term as a coop, and I'm already looking at 4.5-5 years in school as a result. If I take this internship in the Spring, then I will continue to work until next Fall before starting classes again. I'm afraid this will kill any academic momentum I have left, making school burnout a big issue for me. I'm just now getting to the point where I'm wanting to finish up my degree and get on with college.

**TL;DR I'm already finishing my third work term in my third year of college, and the company I'm extremely interested wants me to work two more semesters with them as soon as I finish this one. Is it worth taking a full year off school to work?**

I took everything said in that topic to heart, and within two weeks I had landed a psychology-related job in a nearby city that pays enough for me to live comfortably and is freaking FUN for me! Some advice that really helped me...

* Read ""The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter"" by Dr. Meg Jay. Someone suggested it to help me avoid my ""retail job fatigue."" It was both an interesting read and a perspective-changer for me. I'd suggest it to anyone who is struggling with a job hunt in the twenties.

* Look for work in your field. I was so busy looking at high paying jobs way out of my area of expertise that I completely missed a lot of good human services jobs. It's also much easier to interview for said positions when you have a wealth of knowledge from school to utilize.

* **CHECK CRAIGSLIST!** Less people use it, most areas have it, and your chances of getting a job are significantly higher there!

* Anything beats retail. Even if my job paid half as much I would still take it, as I'm getting training and experience that REALLY beefs up my resume. It also exposes you to networks and you can work your way to even better things.

* Find an internship, the earlier the better! I **wish** I had done this, as it would have made things much easier for me.

* However hopeless your situation seems--do not give up. Every dog has its day.

Again, I have to thank everyone for the input and support I received a month ago. Without you guys, I would still be working ~25 hours a week for pennies in a dead end job. To those reading this that are in the situation I was, definitely read the comments in that last thread. You'll land *something*, maybe even tomorrow!"

I live in Fairfield, CA with my retired parents, one of whom has dialysis treatments three times a week and the other has had two back surgeries in the past five years. I have social anxiety issues, I believe that I have Asperger's syndrome, and I have high blood pressure. I haven't held a steady paying job since my senior year of high school, when I interned at San Francisco Community Mental Health Service, doing data entry and filing. I have an AA degree from City College of San Francisco which is pretty much worthless now, especially since CCSF could go bye-bye in a year or two. I want to be a writer. In fact, I've already completed a novel manuscript and numerous poems. Until I can get published, however, I need at least a fucking part-time job. Unfortunately, my spotty job history has not done me any favors. Since getting that AA, the best that I could do was a gig writing pub trivia questions and another gig collecting restaurant menus for a website. How ridiculous is that? My parents hound me about my lack of employment, even playing the ""We could drop dead tomorrow. What's going to happen to you?"" card. I search for jobs every day online. Other than the military and Jelly Belly, there's nothing in Fairfield. I get so frustrated looking for work that there are days when I don't even want to go on Craigslist. Worse, I have a myriad of emotional problems. Last Christmas, I got so fed up with everything that I ran away from home. I desperately want to get hired. I can't afford to not have a paid gig, so right now volunteering and an unpaid internship are out of the question. I'm on food stamps as well. I could ask some of my 500+ friends on Facebook, but many of them I haven't seen in years. I can't just send them a message asking them to hook me up, especially if they live clear across the country. I just want a job so badly. I'm getting stressed and more stressed by the day. Not even having a part-time job doing data entry and filing is crippling me. I have so much potential and so much to offer to employers: good computer skills, an eagerness to learn, knowledge of a few foreign languages... I'm just scared that I'll never get a job."

This is a business I have been testing the validity of, and am in the process of coming up with a minimum viable product (basically a wordpress site with forms)

The idea is that college students need work experience and money, and small businesses need marketing work that they do not have the time, resources, or money to pay a professional for.

The result is my idea of a StudentFueled project - something like a short term paid internship.  A business submits a form of their basic needs and budget, and students submit proposals with ways they can accomplish these goals for said budget. The small business picks a winning proposal and hires the students.

I would make a percentage of the final payout to the students.

I have already ran a few of these projects, and they worked out quite well for everyone - but now need to get more students involved in this chicken &amp; egg scenario.

http://www.studentfueled.com

Let me know what you think of the business - the site has plenty of things to pick apart but the goal now is to get students to sign up and receive alerts when projects are posted.

Thanks,"

I got 2 job offers, and I am having trouble deciding between them. Here is a pros/cons list I made, I hope it can paint a picture of my situation:

**Job A**

* A remote position
* A bit higher pay
* Since it is a remote post, I am not required to relocate, and am able to keep expenses low
* I don't know much about the company, but from a brief interaction during the interview, it seems like a relaxed company, and have some challenging work (mostly contract works).

**Job B**

* On site-job
* The pay is a little bit lower
* I would have to relocate (but they would take care of the visa), and it would increase my expenses, but its nothing significant.
* I did an internship here for 6 months almost 2 years ago, and I know the people and the culture well. They are nice people, and I enjoy spending time with them. The work consists of mostly government contracts, but they are also working to get their own products on track.

Now, more about myself. I am currently single, with no real commitment to where I currently live. I live in Asia, if that matter.

As I see this is as my first job out of school, I would like to use the opportunity to learn as much as possible about the industry from the job, but I don't see myself staying in either company for more than 5 years. I don't see much in the way of moving up the corporate ladder, as both companies are rather small startups.

Where I live, the tech scene in basically doesn't exist, which is why I feel moving to where Job B is can be beneficial to my overall growth. On the other hand, I am pretty sure I would like to work on my own project with the intention of maybe growing it into something that can sustain my lifestyle, which can be helpful if I am working remotely with flexible hours.

Basically, I would to use my first job as a stepping stone to what I do in the future, and to find out what I would like to do in the future as well, maybe start my own company, maybe to travel the continents, I am not sure. I am hoping for advice and opinions from the experienced redditors, what would you do if you were in my position? Is there any angle that I am missing? Is there anything else that I should be considering?

I'd really like to live and work in the UK for a while (not sure how long, but at least 3-5 years, with the eventual intention of applying for naturalisation/citizenship). 

Can anyone who's moved from the US to the UK or knows about the process/visa/etc give me any advice? I've looked into the Tier 2 visa options, but if anyone has done this process and has advice to share, I'd really appreciate it.

Here's some info that might be relevant, and feel free to ask any questions as well:

Nationality: American citizen

Age: 21

Education: 

* Currently 4th year student at an American university; will graduate May 2014 with BA in Business and International Relations

* For my 3rd year (Oct 2012 - June 2013) of university, I studied at a well-known and highly regarded institution in the UK

Job history/skills: 

* Past: two 3-4 month internships with technology companies doing technology writing (basically writing ""how to"" guides for using the Company's product/code/database/tool/etc) with reliable references

* Current: Year-long internship (ending in May 2014) with a technology company creating technology documentation/best practices and sales strategy

Savings: a little over $30,000 [plus potential parental support :)]

Language skills: English and conversational Spanish

Criminal convictions: None

Are you willing to consider alternative destinations? No

Temporary or permanent? Permanent

Reason for moving: Really enjoyed living/studying in the UK last year and could realistically see me making a life there. Fit much better with the cultural/societal values and customs of the UK than the US (Several people thought I was joking when I told them I was American!). I also have a large network of friends and colleagues who live in the UK and could potentially help me find a job there. 

****************************************

What are my best options for living in London upon graduating university? As this is my last year at university, I'm investigating recruitment options with companies in the US and the UK. Will UK employers even consider me as an American/recent grad?

The company for which I'm currently interning also has offices in London,  and I do like the company, so I wouldn't mind staying with it. Would it be easiest look for jobs in London with this company or take a US job with the company and then try to get a transfer to London a bit later?

I do have the option of going to London in December this year for interviews, if that would help.

I'm also open to the option of completing a master's degree in the UK and looking for a job from there.

Thanks for reading!! Any advice is welcome!"

Almost 2 years ago I did an internship at company A where it was my first proper job that was in line with my career. I had tons of fun because I was doing real work on real systems

At the beginning of this year I felt like a new endeavour and went into a graduate position at company B

After 9 months of work, company A approaches me and offers up a 25% pay rise and a week of extra leave a year. I decide to leave and rejoin company A because:
 
* More pay
* more holidays 
* more relaxed dress code
* I had fun when i was there
* more international opportunities
* training and development was on par or better with company B

Ive been at company A for a week and I'm hating it. Even after the first few hours I was hating it. I had never had a boring day before i went back to company A, and now i realise how much more enthusiastic i was about the projects at company B. I still acknowledge that company A will put me in a better position to move sideways, upwards and overseas; but im unsure if pushing through boredom is worth the potential internal career development. It really took working at company B to realise how mundane the work at company A was.

Now, company B quite liked me. Before I left, my manager told me that the door was always open (in fact, he waged with me that i'd be back after 2 months). I want to move back, but I feel like i'm letting company A down AND grovelling back to company B after leaving them so early. 

Can anyone give me some advice? I don't want to hear how stupid I was for leaving in the first place, I just need some advice from people with similar experiences (or knowledge in the matter) and how it might affect my career in the future.

I'm currently learning Spanish and I would say that I'm doing very well. I would like to try living in a spanish-speaking country. However, I am also an engineering student and can't really do any study abroad opportunities during the school year both because of cost &amp; time.

I had an internship last summer and I plan on getting another one next summer, but I would really prefer it to be in a spanish-speaking country and that I would get paid for it (as opposed to the ""interships"" abroad that my university offers).

Is there any opportunities for this kind of thing? What's the best path I could follow to try to get an internship abroad (in a spanish-speaking country)? Also, do I need to get a work visa or something like that?

I am doing one, but things have become quite complicated. Initially, for about 3 months, I got very little work to do, primarily because another intern (who had been working there before me) got the bulk of the work. I wanted work but they were reluctant to give it to me because the other guy was familiar with it all, and it would have taken a long time to explain everything to me. I was hired as an IT procurement intern, but I did not do anything related to it at all. I became tired of the working culture; I had free time, lots of it, and whenever I did not have any work, I read some articles on CNN or NYT. No one, including my direct supervisors, ever objected on spot or even mentioned it to me but a few days later the VP of my department would come and tell me that 'I was demotivating the entire team with my attitude'. I honestly did not get it, I did not get much work, and when I was done with it, I still was supposed to pretend I was working. Anyway, I decided to put up with it. I now only read the articles during my lunch break. 

But then someone told the VP that I had a fight with a colleague. No such thing happened, we were merely discussing some economic theories and took opposing viewpoints. Both of us were equally surprised when the VP asked us about it. I was angry, but I didn't put up a show and swallowed it. 

The annoying stuff did not stop then. They brought up all kinds of stupid things. All employees have to complete a set amount of hours per week, which are tracked. Some days I would leave an hour earlier because I had excess hours on my account, and because there was no work assigned to me. Again, someone would tell me a few days later that I left early on that particular day. I would explain my situation but that person would reply saying that I am an intern and it doesn't matter and blah blah blah.

Well, I decided to quit my internship as soon as sixteen weeks were over. I've got 3 weeks left to that, but then yesterday the other intern left because his contract was over. Now they gave everything he was doing over to me, so now from doing nothing at all, I'm swamped with work. But, I have no motivation left to work, and frankly very little respect left for the corporate culture. I had rather study for the next couple of months, and work on a business plan (I want to be an entrepreneur). 

Moreover, my landlord told me that I have to leave at the end of this month (which coincides with the last week of my internship) because she is selling the place (we had a clause in our contract which allows this, if told a month in advance).

Reddit, how do I leave my internship without making them screw me over in their recommendation letter, or firing me when I tell them I want to leave due to issues with finding a new apartment nearby? 

TLDR: I hated my internship because of the working culture, and the fact that another intern (who started a few months before me) got all the work and I was left staring at my computer screen all day. After this went on for 3 months, I decided to quit after 16 weeks, but the other intern left, and now I got all his work. 

However, I now have some problems with my accommodation and I doubt I can find a new place nearby in the next couple of weeks. How do I politely leave my internship without pissing them off?"

1996-2001 = 2 jobs using databases, programming and general IT skills which I loved very much and paid very well. Dallas area.

2001-2003 = Out of work and struggling to get back into IT. Never made it back before breaking my neck in a 3 story fall in 2003. Moved to the Carolinas to heal up with my retired parents.

2004-2007 = Struggled to still return to IT without any success. Started community college and even contemplated getting into radiology tech due to lack of success. Still in the Carolinas.

2007-2011 = Finally decided on an Information Management B.A. after deciding Radiology was probably not a good fit, plus rumors of saturation in that job function as well. Graduated in 2011.

2011-2012. Internship programming for a local college turned into a job that lasted a year and finally allowed me to move out of my folks home.

2012-Present. The internship turned job laid me off leaving me searching again (yes, in the carolinas) for something computer related. I had been able to collect unemployment and searched and interviewed for a year with my only result being a stack of email rejection letters.  

Do I not have enough experience for even a Junior level computer job? I have been searching for everything from Help Desk at a data center to Junior  programmer to even IT Director. The last one did offer that they interviewed lots of people with more experience than I.

I had thought I could at least land something that would pay me a decent wage $15/hr or so while I gain more experience. I could have sought certifications to add to my degree while unemployed, but figured I had time later to do that once I figured out what job function I would end up in.

In the end, When my unemployment ran out all I found willing to hire me were a temp service for industrial work for $9 an hour and a call center for $8 an hour. I accepted the call center work, but I really need to make more cash than that. badly.

Is there that many people out of work with a Bachelor's or higher or more work experience that are beating me out? What gives? Advice?

Go.

So I was able to find a 2-day pass for Beyond Wonderland for only $120 (compared to $170). I live in the SoCal area, so I'll be taking a shuttle (since airfares are quite costly) to get to the Bay Area for Beyond Wonderland. I will be going with my friend whom I've known since the 2nd grade back in the Philippines, and I'll be meeting up with my other friend who goes to SCU, and who's also from the same school I was in from the Philippines. My birthday is on 9/23, so going to Beyond (28th to 29th) will be a really awesome way to celebrate it, and mind you, I'm not the type who celebrates. The only problem is that my mother, who is getting more unreasonably paranoid like everyday, won't allow me. You see, she lives in the Philippines and her point is that I came here to study and succeed, and going to these stuff wasn't part of the ""plan"". I never had problems with my studies, heck, I even graduated high school with honors. In fact, I'm applying for honors classes during the winter sem, and I even applied for an internship with Disney. I am doing all that I can to do well, and I think it's fair enough that I get some fun. Out of respect and being a good daughter that I am, I recently just asked her permission if I could go, she automatically said no. I tried to talk it out, she said she didn't want to get pissed so I'd rather shut up about it. She is paranoid with the fact that some crazy shit might happen to me, like someone might put some date-rape drug in my water bottle or something. Her reasons for me not going is really crazy and somewhat illogical. I understand that she just really cares for me, but by doing so, she is locking me up from all the fun that I could have. I know, she's in the Philippines, she's miles away, so I can just escape without her knowing, right? Nope. She can FaceTime me, or even ask my sister to check if I'm in my place. The worst part is that if I do some crazy shit, she threatens me that she will fly all the way here just to fetch me back to the Philippines. This is really crazy.

1m7qeg,3,2013-09-11,Engineering Major Questions.,HorseSteppin,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1m7qeg/engineering_major_questions/,"Hey /r/EngineeringStudents, hope all is well! I recently made the switch into the Engineering School on my campus. I am either pursuing Industrial or Mechanical Engineering and have a few questions. 

Before I go ahead - some useful info - 

-I don't switch in until Spring. 

-I started College Math at the algebra level (lowest) and I'm up to PreCalc II with A's in everything so far (Re-doing math from the beginning has helped me to get a firm grasp on the subject).

- I'm a sophomore. 

How can I start preparing for next semester now? I want to hit the ground running.
-Learn Physics? I feel this will be the hardest subject for me.
-Any other recommendations?

Internships - My school does not offer 6 month co-op programs but they do have summer internships and have given me a list of employers they work with. 

When can I start applying? Should I wait until next summer since I will have such little experience?

Miscellaneous - I'm taking a coding course this semester and find it interesting but challenging - should I continue to build this skill, will it be beneficial when applying in the future?

Thank you for your time!"
1m7nh2,0,2013-09-11,I'm not sure if I have a job offer...,wokeupsleepy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m7nh2/im_not_sure_if_i_have_a_job_offer/,"I'm transitioning into the field of software development and I'm not sure if I actually have an offer or not. About a month back, I applied for a position for a position as a software developer for a small company that was expanding. They were also looking for interns and based on my lack of professional experience and CS degree (I got a BS in an unrelated field but I taught myself), and I suggested that I may be better suited to be an intern. I'm really excited about the prospect of entering a field I find interesting so I didn't mind taking a pay cut, but I'm not sure if I actually have the offer or not.

There were essentially 4 stages of the application. I've completed a basic initial interview on the phone (stuff like ""what are your salary expectations?"" and ""will you need sponsorship to work here?""), a technical interview on the phone, and a coding assignment. After this, they stated that they qualified me for their internship position and told me the monthly pay. They said that if the pay was acceptable, I should let them know when I would be available for an in-person interview (which is currently scheduled for tomorrow).

My question is... basically, do I actually have an offer or not? This is my first time getting to such a stage in the interview process in the CS field and I know the process is different than in other industries. Should I expect to answer questions based on compensation or additional questions about code, algorithms, design, etc."
1mciu1,1,2013-09-13,Help dissecting a phone interview I had on Tuesday?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mciu1/help_dissecting_a_phone_interview_i_had_on_tuesday/,"So in a nutshell, I applied online for a summer internship for 2014 with a top-10 global tech company.

Long story short, I randomly got a call from someone within the company about 10 days after applying online.  It was completely unexpected, which I didn't mind, and it felt like it was more of a weed-out call than a true interview.  All-in-all, the call maybe lasted 10-15 minutes total.

A few days later, I get an email from someone within the company requesting a true phone interview.

Fast forward, I'm nervous as hell, and the interview starts.  They (the initial email contact and someone else) start out by asking about my prior projects, which I had no problem discussing.  Yadda yadda, we talk about stuff over my resume, which I'll skip because that doesn't really pertain to my questions.  I'll just say I think I did pretty good, maybe a 75% - 85% grade overall.  I didn't know some questions, which I politely apologized for and honestly said I didn't know. I didn't feel too bad, as I've still got 8 months of classes left anyhow.

So what I've really been thinking about (probably too much) are a few things that they said to me in the interview that lead to me thinking I've got a good chance at landing the job.  I'm sure some of you with more than 2 interviews under your belt could answer.

1. They spent a good amount of time towards the end of the interview explaining what the company was about, and what the department that I could potentially be working in was about. Normally I'd say it wasn't a big deal, but he did spend some time getting into details about how the particular department functioned, what I would be able to do, working on, working conditions, etc.  


2. At the end of the interview, they mentioned that I had applied for an internship position.  They then asked if I'd be willing to be hired straight as a full-time, recent grad, instead of the internship.  Of course I said yes.  


3. I applied for the job at location A.  They asked me if not being able to work at location A, but location B would be a deal breaker.


So after all that, am I crazy, vain, or right?  I doubt they'd hire me over two interviews, but I just want to make sure they just weren't blowing smoke up my ass.

1mcbm2,0,2013-09-13,"I don't know if I'm majoring in the right thing and I don't know what I want to do with my life. Please, I need some advice. What do I do?",StarDestinyGuy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mcbm2/i_dont_know_if_im_majoring_in_the_right_thing_and/,"This is going to be pretty long, but I want to explain as thoroughly as I can.

So, I'm a student at the University of Minnesota.  I started out in CLA (The College of Liberal Arts), because I didn't really know what I wanted to do.  At the beginning of college, I was interested in all of these fields (and still am):

- English
- Psychology
- Elementary Education
- Film Studies
- Biology
- Spanish
- Economics
- Marketing
- Management Information Systems (MIS)
- Finance
- Public and Nonprofit Management

Sometime during the end of my first year, I decided I wanted to go into the business school (CSOM).  This was based on countless hours of research into different majors, different careers, people's perspective on different degrees, employment statistics, articles about the best jobs, etc.

I decided going there that I'd want to major in one of the business degrees I posted above for these reasons:

- Marketing: I love psychology but I want something more practical for finding work.  I took an intro to marketing course and really enjoyed it.  I'm good with people and data.
- Management Information Systems: I'm really good with technology and I find it interesting.  I like keeping up to date on the newest and greatest things.  I'm good at helping other people understand technology.  I don't want to work in programming though; I know that.
- Finance: I'm really good with numbers.  I'm a very logical and analytical person.  I've always strongly enjoyed mathematics prior to calculus 2.  I enjoy following stocks and do fairly well with them in a simulation game I play.  Within finance, I think I'd enjoy a financial adviser/planner position the most, as I enjoy helping people.
- Public and Nonprofit Management: This is actually a dual degree, so I'd have to do it with something else.  There are numerous nonprofits that I support and I'd love to be working for a greater cause.  (and again, I enjoy helping people)

Anyways, I applied to CSOM.  I didn't get in.  To keep it short, I worked my ass of the following year, got my GPA up from a 3.5 to a 3.8, and was accepted.  

I'm currently a junior in CSOM and now once again I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing.  Should I be in business school?  Am I majoring in the right thing?

I succeed in almost all my classes at CSOM.  I've gotten a perfect 4.0 the past two semesters, which was largely made up of business classes.  One of the people I know in the career center there believes I will be excellent in almost any company.  One of my statistics professors told me I did the best in his class (around a 98.5%) out of any student he's ever had in 15 years of teaching and offered me a full-time job at his company as a Business Analyst.  Many good companies have reached out to me about their internships, saying I'd be a great fit.

So, I'm doing well in the school.  That's not the issue though.  The issue is just me thinking is this right?  Is it what I want?  What if I make the wrong choice?  Should I have gone into Elementary Education instead?  (my back-up plan if I didn't get in)

Looking at the other courses in my potential majors at CSOM, most sound interesting to me, but it's hard to know until I take them.  Based on my research, a lot of jobs in my fields sound like I'd enjoy them, but again, it's hard to know until I work there.

Honestly, I've done so much research, it's been like a full time job.  I've even complied a lot of what I've read into word documents and powerpoints for my own reference.  I've taken multiple personality tests which all say the same thing typically: education and business are good fields for me.  I spoke with a career coach who advised me based on everything to go into business now and then use my success down the road to pursue another degree and enter education if I still want to.

I just wish there was a clear way to know if I made the right decision.  Like with your schoolwork for example.  I mean, I know you won't love every class in your major and won't love every assignment right?  But I wish it was that easy.  Where it was you loved going to class every single day and loved doing your homework every single day if you were in the right field.  Then I could know for sure.

Even the jobs I've had haven't pushed me definitively in any direction.  I worked at an insurance company, which was okay, but it was mostly grunt work so I can't really base anything off of it.  It did help me decide that I don't want to work in insurance specifically.

I worked in education in multiple areas: a math teacher to adults seeking their GEDs, a teaching assistant at an elementary school for 4 5th grade teachers, and a children's summer program.  

Working with adults was enjoyable in that I loved seeing the spark go off in there eyes when they understood something and I felt really accomplished after hearing most of my students passed the test.  It was pretty frustrating working with my students who didn't care though.  Still, I enjoyed this job, as I felt like I really made a significant difference in some peoples' lives.

Working as a teaching assistant for 5th graders was fun in that it was lighthearted and little kids are fun to be around.  On the other hand, there's an incredible amount of paperwork involved (way more than I expected) and I miss having intellectual conversations with others...5th graders aren't great for that.  It also sometimes tired me out just working with the kids.  

Lastly, in terms of teaching summer classes, it varied greatly how much I liked it.  I taught Debate and Typing, both of which were fairly boring.  I taught Garage Band, which I hated because I wasn't interested in the software or area and most of my students weren't either.  I taught a gym class, which was pretty fun.  The one thing I truly loved and looked forward to every day was teaching a cooking class.  It was called Top Chef, and was basically like that show but with kids grades K-4.  I like cooking and I love those shows, so I loved this class.  The kids were super into it too.  It was just great.  So yeah, if I could find a full-time job teaching cooking competition classes to kids that paid well enough for me to get by, I think I'd do that.

Still, like I said, I don't know.  As far as I can tell, there's no clear answer to be found.  Research and data tell me I'm doing the right thing, but I'm unsure.

So please, any advice you can offer would help.  I don't know what to do."

My first day is this Tuesday and I'm wondering if I can expect to be drug tested anytime soon. I haven't smoked in weeks in preparation of getting a job, so I should pass, but I'm wondering if it's safe to start smoking again. Or, at what point should I be safe? I don't plan on going to work high. I have a condition that doesn't go well with alcohol, so I just smoke when my friends are drinking (or smoking) to not feel out of place. I'm not a stoner type, though the random throwaway I used for this may suggest otherwise.

Also, I was told to shave for the my interview, which I did. I usually keep my face well trimmed. Should I continue to shave for the time being, or would it be a bad idea to come in my first day with a short beard?"

:--|:--
[Hi, I always liked reading your comments during your father's campaign in 2008. Thanks for doing an AMA.  Moderate Republicans like your dad and Mitt Romney have lost in the last two elections to Obama. What do you think this means for Republicans in 2016 and beyond? Will primary voters decide that they need to nominate a (truly\) severely conservative candidate to contrast with the Democrats, or do you think they'll go with another blue state governor like Christie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oulh?context=5)|I want to ask you a question. What do you think the election would have looked like if Rick Santorum was our nominee last time?  The biggest problem with Republicans right now is our obsession with social issues: Abortion, birth control, marriage equality.  If we would lighten up on these issues, we would get a lot more independent voters, which is really the sweet spot to winning elections.  The idea that we are going to nominate a radical conservative who believes that being gay is a choice and there are citizens in this country that should have less rights because they love someone of the same gender will only lead to continued loss elections.   I hope Republicans choose someone more moderate in the next election cycle.  I will be curious to see what happens but I would be my entire career and everything I know about America that nominating an extreme conservative candidate would only end in failure.
[EDIT: I re-watched the interview. ""Weak"" is a better word than ""lazy"", but O'Reilly was still very patronizing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ocgh?context=5)|When I go on cable news shows as a general rule,  9 times out of 10 I know what the interviewer and the host thinks of me.  I can still go on shows with people that disagree with me.  I respect Bill but I think he's wrong about this generation.  I try to defend myself and us as a generation.
[*The last generation has fucked us royally.*  That can't be said enough.  *We have a horrible environment, climate change scares me every day and I thought my apartment was going to blow away during Hurricane Sandy. We're still dealing with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the aftereffects of that. I personally know what it's like to watch a brother go to war and be scared that he might die. We're dealing with debts from student loans. The average student how has to return living home because they can't afford an apartment on their own. We're dealing with the aftereffects of a horrible economy.*  What politics from the last generation do you think are to blame, generally speaking? It's common around here on reddit to blame Reaganomics and deregulation and so forth. Do you have a different take? Or is that an interpretation you subscribe to? Regardless, what's the way forward?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7p4li?context=5)|I'm not so focused on how we got here so much as how we can move forward.  I know there have been a lot of mistakes in the past and there are a lot of fingers to point and blame.  That is for other people to analyze.  
[I think you're an extremely refreshing and much-needed voice for the right.  That being said, the party you're in has a lot of modernizing to do, and the members seem to be willing to do almost anything to avoid updating many of their fallacious, anti-science beliefs.  Do you see that changing in the upcoming years? What would make republicans believe in climate change, for instance, if an overwhelming scientific consensus is not enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pj3o?context=5)|I saw a video on VICE a few days ago all about climate change.  And they interviewed the president of the Maldives, and they are literally disappearing because of climate change.  He might have to relocate his entire population because of climate change.  Anyone that does not believe in climate change at this point is unbelievably delusional and in my opinion, dangerous.  I have become more and more concerned about climate change ever since Hurricane Sandy.  I don't know exactly what the answer is (other than the obvious - recycle, lessen dependency on fossil fuels, etc) but America has got to wake up and I have absolutely no idea why it's so unpopular other than people are scared to face the harsh reality of what is happening to our environment.  Me, personally? Scares the shit out of me.  I spent the summer in NYC filming Raising McCain and it was literally the hottest summer of my life.  There were days I didn't think I could walk around outside and I grew up in the fucking desert.  It should not be this hot.  It's too hot NOW, in September in New York right now.  This is actually an issue I've become more passionate about in the past year and I'd like to do more as soon as I have time after I'm done promoting the show. 
[Meghan, I know you spent time working on SNL in college, any funny stories? Also, do you enjoy playing VIP poker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ocih?context=5)|Yes!  It was a fantastic experience, but I was a lowly intern.  I worked for Lorne Michaels' assistants, and my job really just consisted of escorting guests from the ground floor of Rockefeller center to the studio and getting Lorne's popcorn and beer.  My most memorable experience at SNL was being backstage when Ashlee Simpson was famously caught lip-synching and hearing her freak out backstage after realizing that she had been caught.  It was chaos.  Something I will never forget.
 |I will be grateful for the experience at SNL because it was a pivotal time in my life, and I think everyone should have an experience where they are treated like shit as an intern because it shows you what people go through just to go get you coffee.  I'm sure Ashlee Simpson hates that I always bring up her lip-synching in interviews too.
 |P.s. Will Forte was the nicest cast member to the interns, and to this day, I will be grateful to him for opening a door for me when I was carrying a crate of beer. 
[Greetings from Arizona!  I'm not a ""job creator,"" or a ""small business"" owner, or a member of the 1 percent.  I'm a ""job performer""...just a working stiff.  Most Republicans I've met (our Governor and a few Representatives\) don't seem to want to talk to me.  They want to talk to my boss.  Can you please tell your GOP friends that it might help them around election time if they treat working people as equally important as the mighty ""job creators?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oomo?context=5)|First of all, politicians (my father included) do town halls all the time. I know my father did one the weekend before last.  They are open forums, anyone can go to, so you have the opportunity to speak to politicians directly.  I am not a politician, but I respect what you're saying.  Unfortunately in this country money still does a lot of the talking.  But don't give up trying to have your voice heard.  It is an important one.
[I appreciate the reply.  It is partially about access, but also about message.  The Republican Party has exalted ""job creators"" to the point where working people feel unimportant.  We get a town hall.  The boss gets a meeting.  That's a problem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7p4os?context=5)|You're breaking my heart.  I hear stories like this all the time.  I'm telling you don't give up and voices get heard even when you don't think they do.  I'm telling you I've seen it.  Hang in there.  I know it's easy to get disillusioned with politics, it happens to me too. 
[Your father recently came out and spoke in favor of legalizing and taxing cannabis use in your home state of Arizona. What are your feelings on the whole idea of states pulling themselves out of deficits by these means and do you think with education and strict laws (keeping out of people who are 21's hands\) this could soon be a model for the whole country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oibr?context=5)|I'm a huge advocate for the legalization of marijuana.  I myself prefer marijuana to alcohol. And came out in support of it a while ago.  I'm glad my father is moving in the direction of supporting this issue.  Not only do I enjoy marijuana recreationally, I think it could be a big boost to the economy.  
[Hi Meghan!  I was fortunate enough to meet you with Michael Ian Black during you Book/Conversation Tour for ""America, You Sexy Bitch!""  I mentioned quickly during the signing how, as a Democrat, I really appreciate the way you've always approached and spoken about your Republican beliefs.  I think young Republicans can benefit from taking a page out of your book (pun intended\), especially due to your ability to understand, appreciate, and thoughtfully consider the views and opinions of others; which I've noticed is the biggest barrier of discussion when I'm confronted with some of my more conservative friends.  I know you receive a lot of backlash from members of your own party, has there ever been a time where you've been taken so far aback by a confrontation that you reconsidered your Republican affiliation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7onat?context=5)|I've never really reconsidered my Republican affiliation because on a very basic level I believe in small government, strong national defense, and the basic principles the party was founded on.  I believe that I can help reform the party from the inside out and I have a unique and fortunate platform that I have elected to use.  That being said, I spent the majority of my 20's being a controversial woman in the media.  I'm turning 29 in a month and I didn't expect my life to look like this.  The one thing that almost pushed me over the edge that sent me to therapy was Glenn Beck fake-vomiting on his show after a skin cancer PSA that I did (If you don't know the story google it).  It got a lot of media attention and it was humiliating to have my body discussed so publicly.  That's the only time I can ever really remember second-guessing what I was doing with my life and whether it was worth it.  But at the end of the day, fuck Glenn Beck.  I'm not going to let anyone turn me into a victim and I'm not going to let anyone silence me.  That's what's wrong with the media today, that women are too easily silenced. 
[You're President.  You're tired of ""Hail to the Chief.""  What song do you replace it with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7omke?context=5)|Hahaha! YES I am sick of that song.  In my experience in politics, maybe Guns n' Roses Welcome To the Jungle is a more accurate anthem for at least my experience on the campaign trail.  
[What do you think republicans need to do to gain the trust of the gay community? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7omc7?context=5)|How about trying to support them and not treat them like second-class citizens that are separate but equal?  
[As a fellow younger generation Republican, what is it we can do to help change the opinion most people have about the current state of the party?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7od8o?context=5)|First this is a heavy question and one I take home with me every night.  Part of the problem is the media's perception of Republicans.  Not that we haven't gotten the reputation we've gotten for valid reasons.  However there are a lot of socially moderate republicans out there but it's not as sexy or interesting for the media because radicals get the most attention and the most views on TV.  I would say to speak out, get involved, and for the love of God, use social media.  Don't give up on the party, I haven't.  I believe young people can change it from the inside out.  That being said, if the party continues its extreme trend and nominates someone like Rick Santorum in the next election, I myself would be open to voting for an independent candidate. 
[Hello Meghan, do you have any plans to become a Senator yourself? Also although I am a very liberal Democrat your dad is a total badass.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ompb?context=5)|First of all, thank you so much.  I think he's a badass as well.  He stayed out at my premiere party last night until midnight last night, so he still knows how to have a good time!
 |This is the thing about American politics.  We're not a dynasty for a reason.  Just because my father is a great politician does not mean I would make a good one.  America does not have royalty, and I don't think politics should reflect that.  I honestly think that I have made too many mistakes on the internet, I swear too much in my new show, I have too many tattoos, and I've had too many bad dates to ever run for office.  And honestly?  I don't want to ever have to lie in my life, and unfortunately to get elected in America sometimes you have to lie.  
[Do you think that the GOP has to choose a candidate in 2016 who is a bit like yourself, in support of gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana to give Republicans the best shot at winning the Presidency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pm5g?context=5)|Not only that, the candidate has to have some kind of comprehensive immigration reform plan.  Unless we come around on all the issues you just mentioned and that, we can say sayonara not just to the next election cycle but every election cycle that follows that.  This party has got to evolve or it will die.  I don't have all the answers, but I know that telling people to choose between their gay friends and taxes is a losing equation.
[If you had been President during the troubles in Northern Ireland would you have supported the I.R.A. or the British Government? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pm5g?context=5)|It's a good question but I'm not the best person to speak to that and I don't want to give you a bullshit answer.
[How often do you browse Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pm5g?context=5)|I browse reddit a few times a week, most of the time in bed before I go to sleep.
[What was your reaction when you heard when you're father was playing poker during the Foreign Relations Committee hearing regarding Syria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pm5g?context=5)|My first reaction was not surprised, he loves to gamble and he loves his poker app.  Secondly, people were tweeting me a lot of crazy stuff and I was taken aback a little that people had such a reaction.  
[Thanks for doing this AMA! From what I've read and heard, it seems like you and your father disagree on some issues, especially social ones. Have either of you changed the other's position on one of these issues?  Also, what are some things that you particularly like/dislike about being in the immediate family of a prominent politician such as your father, Sen. McCain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pyxx?context=5)|I can honestly say that my father turned me into a Republican.  I registered as independent when I was 18.  I thought it was a way to rebel (yea, that was my way of rebelling).  I even voted for John Kerry back in the day.  But going on the road with my dad when I was 22 right out of college and really understanding what the Republican party stood for (at least from his perspective) completely changed my worldview.  It's difficult though.  Because I live in New York City and I moved here when I was 18.  And a lot of times I felt like my personal life was not reconciling with my political life, which is why I decided to be so vocal about my support of gay marriage.  The things that I like are obviously that I get such a front-row seat to history.  I have the weirdest, craziest, most amazingly blessed life anyone could ever ask for, and I'm very very lucky.  The worst part is people really project onto you issues that they have with my dad, and they have an idea of what a politician's daughter should look, talk and act like.  It's been hard for me to come to terms with who I am and not just fall into some stupid mold.  
[Hi Meghan - What is your current Ring tone on your Cell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7p5ts?context=5)|A dog barking.  Because I cannot have a dog because I am irresponsible and I travel too much.  But I really want a dog, so I turn my phone into a dog and it annoys everyone. 
[Hey Meghan, so what type of person runs for public office? The question I am asking is why do politicians seem to fall in the trap of love affairs, lies, bribes, and just overall lack of ethics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7peu0?context=5)|At least in politics as far as I know, for whatever reason Americans really like ""all-American perfect candidates"" in one way or another.  And all I know is that in this world, repression breeds obsession.  And I think if you're sitting around all day trying to pretend to be a perfect person, you are probably going to start getting obsessed with things that you think you're not allowed to do (or are not allowed to do).  Ironically one of the most judgmental politicians I've ever met went on to have quite a few personal scandals of their own, and the irony was not lost on me.
[Then in the case of world leaders, why have there been so many CRAZY world leaders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7peu0?context=5)|Why are world leaders so crazy? Lord only knows. 
[What does Michael Ian Black smell like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ocvl?context=5)|We were on the road together for a month in an absolutely disgusting RV, and Michael only changes his clothes every few days (*that's not just a thing on the road, I think it's in his life as well.  I think he only owns four hoodies and he wears the same thing over and over again).   It is not so much that he smelled, it was just somewhere where everything smelled myself included.  But as a general rule, he doesn't smell bad.  But he doesn't smell manly.  He doesn't wear cologne.  He smells clean, like Downy fabric softener. 
[What do you think the most annoying aspect of social media is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oj10?context=5)|The most annoying aspect of social media is that every asshole conservative blogger can project onto me their insecurities about their life or what I represent to them.  My weight fluctuates like most American women, and every time I gain a few pounds, it's tweeted to me that I'm looking fatter.  That's a difficult thing about social media.  But I love the internet and I love social media and I'm so grateful I live in a time when I have the opportunity to let people get to know who I am and to connect with other people. 
[Hardest part of making this TV Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pngd?context=5)|Hardest part of making this TV show was how FUCKING HOT it has been this summer.  We filmed in an artist loft downtown (the artists were in Europe all summer) and we didn't have central air.  And the unit AC they brought in we had to turn off when filming because it was too loud for audio.  If I look sweaty on the show, it's because I am.  That was the hardest part.
[Are then any other Republicans in Hollywood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pngd?context=5)|Actually there are a lot of secret Republicans in hollywood.  They are afraid to be open about their political beliefs.  In my book ""America You Sexy Bitch"" I talk about an experience I had at a fancy LA party with an actor who I know to be Republican who got very concerned when I was talking to him about it at that party.  He just freaked out.  
[Favorite Type of Ice Cream?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pngd?context=5)|Mint chocolate chip.  The trashy kind of CVS in the box.

Sushi and beer next time you're in Denver?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ol05?context=5)|It depends how old you are because I do have an age capoff.  I don't date over 45.  Or younger than 29.  
[Perfect. I'm 30. It'll kick ass.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pra6?context=5)|Next time I'm in Denver, it's on like Donkey Kong.  Seriously, do you follow me on Twitter?
[Reading the Salon article that was tasked to critique your new show ended up being more of a personal attack on your public persona as well as you being a millennial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7opb9?context=5)|Listen, I put myself out there.  People are going to love this show, and people are going to hate this show.  I have absolutely no problem with constructive criticism, it's only going to make me grow and make the show better if we are successful.  This morning, reading some of the things that people said really upset me.  So much of it seems like angry people projecting things onto me personally.  I'm blonde, I'm a senator's daughter, yes you can google a lot of information about me.  It's unfair to say that I am not allowed to have the ambition and not allowed to use my voice and not allowed to question things the way I want to question them, simply because I grew up in the public eye or because someone personally does not like me.  When I get really angry I take it out on Twitter (even though it's not great and it makes my publicist cringe).  Other times I have good friends, family and honestly perspective.  SO what there's a dumb article?  One of the final episodes we just taped of Raising McCain that has really resonated with me had to do with 1 in 6 people in New York go hungry every day and one in five of them are children. I'm not going to give away too much about the episode, but I felt ignorant about how huge of an issue hunger still is in America. Those are real issues. Some asshole writing a mean article about me? Those aren't problems.  Those are #whitegirlproblems.

[Meghan, I read and really enjoyed both of your books and as a Brit it gave me an interesting perspective on US politics. Why do you think so few 'Millennials' are actively engaged in the political process in 'any way, shape or form'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7okwn?context=5)|Thank you so much for reading my books, I appreciate it.  I actually disagree with you.  I do speaking tours across the country all of the time, for going on 5 years I have spoke to 100's of college students and let me tell you, they are the scariest audience because they are the most engaged, well-researched and toughest.  College students have kept me on my toes and helped me come to terms with exactly what I believe in.  I disagree with you in that I have almost completely lost faith in the generations previously and have optimism for the future because of this generation.  Again I know it's cheezy but I believe we are the most engaged and most involved generation.  
[What is the worst thing you have almost-tweeted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ogd9?context=5)|Unfortunately I have poor impulse control especially when I am drinking.  And I normally tweet exactly when I am thinking.  I have stopped myself from tweeting ex-boyfriend's names who have screwed me over.  It's tempting because I have a lot of twitter followers, but ultimately I decided not to give them any attention.  
[What is on your playlist today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7odzz?context=5)|The Civil Wars (the band not the documentary, I am really sad they are broken up because they need to get back together I need more soundtracks to my breakups). I was listening to Rodriguez Hate Street Dialogue on my way over here.  Mr Little Jeans.  Gin Wigmore.  And ZZ Ward.

But in general I think that people who can't hang and have a beer are too uptight for people I want to surround myself with. 
[What is your favourite book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7of7j?context=5)|Oh man, that's a tough one.  I have so many.  I really love Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and Jack Kerouac's The Road.  I know these are kind of cliche answers but they are really good books.
[I keep waiting for a national politician that doesn't come across as an idiot. Any suggestions?

[Hi Ms. McCain! This sounds like it could be an interesting AMA!  I'm a PhD student in botany, and I am interested to know what you think about the state of science education and funding in America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pcw0?context=5)|This is something that I'd really like to delve into in the future, maybe on my show.

Your skin always looks perfect!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7osev?context=5)|Thank you so much! My only secret is that I drink like 5 gallons of water a day.  I drink water like a camel.  I use this Sonicare brush and I use Peter Thomas Roth products and his gentle cleansing pads.  I wear sunscreen every day, never go in the sun (I'm a vampire) and I try to moisturize every night.  A trick I picked up along the way is when you're going out for a big night of boozing, leave a bottle of water and cleansing wipes on your nightstand so you can get in bed and drink the water and take the makeup off your face with the makeup remover.  Make no mistake, I have blemishes, I just have a good makeup artist too (Suzie Moldavon).
[Favorite place to eat in Phoenix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7odtj?context=5)|Oh man! I love Phoenix!  I find myself going to Postino all the time with my girlfriends, they have really yummy bruschetta.  But if you want the best Mexican food in the entire world, go to the Tee Pee on Indian School Road.  When I fly home from New York, sometimes i will stop there on my way home to pick up a burrito and a cheese crisp.  
[What ""Blue"" state do you feel the Republicans have to win in order to secure the Presidency? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7p3eu?context=5)|Ohio!  That's where it happens.  That in my opinion is the ultimate battleground state.  Obviously I would like Republicans to win over as many blue states as possible, but obviously I don't see California going anytime soon.  What I think is interesting is that my home state is slowly going purple.  There are a lot more independent and democratic voters in Arizona than ever before.  Times really are changing. 
[I guess 36dd. Now I ask. Am I correct? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ouva?context=5)|You're a few D's off...

If you don't mind, I'd like to leave my exact bra size to a specific few, but you guess pretty close.

There's something about a giant duck that reminds me of the Penguin's boat in Batman.  I used to ride horses as a child.  Maybe I could wrangle tiny horses.  I hope I never encounter this scenario.

I've had two internships. One within the electrical power industry and another at a Fortune 500 semiconductor company. After the last internship, I realized I'd like to be on more of the business side of things. To further this interest, I've started taking a Computational Investing class for free that's hosted by Georgia Tech and trying to get accepted into an angel investing class on my campus.

Starting to think I may be constricting my options because I'm getting a higher degree. I'll lose ~$3,000 total in the two years of my schooling due to loans. I'm still in first semester but have commitments such as lease, loans, etc. At this point I'm thinking I need to finish what I've started, as employers may not like to see me backing out of something I've committed to. Thoughts? I know it is normal to freak-out about things at such a young age - no one has their life figured out. But some external advice helps. Thanks. "

The job itself is doing IT support, which I'm comfortable doing but I don't feel like there's a lot of things for me to learn here, I was hoping I would get launched into a slightly better pay job and hopefully be learning new things. I'm sure I'll be learning new things in regards to IT support, but I don't know if I want to be trapped in the IT Support role my entire life.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How are songs chosen? Is it random, or is there a intention in the way/reason they are played in a particular order?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70v62?context=5)|There is almost always intention with the order of songs. What that intent is varies by format. A top 40 station is current, so it won't want to play an ""older"" song (more than a year old) back to back with another. The station will want to surround it a more current songs. Other things taken into consideration are tempo, genre, artist separation, mood, lyrics/message, when it played last, how long has it been since it played in this hour, and there could be dozens of other variables. It really varies by format as well as by program director.
[Why do radio stations insist on playing the same songs over and over and over again? How does the radio station benefit from it? (For example, Lorde - Royals is consistently played at least three times an hour on some stations\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc711zm?context=5)|3 times an hour on one station? Are you sure? Tell me what station if it's in the US, because I can almost guarantee you that isn't the case. Radio stations do research to find the most popular and familiar songs right now among its target listeners. They don't want to experiment much with unfamiliar music, because the average person gives a station about 3 seconds before it goes to the next station. If that person doesn't hear something that immediately reminds them how much they love that song, they are likely to move onto the next station. Radio can't do anything to get people to turn the radio on, but they can do something about avoiding someone from tuning out once they get there. Is it a dangerous mentality? Maybe. But, it has been proven time and time again to garner ratings, and that's the final objective.
[What are the criteria for a song to make it onto the radio? How do radio stations measure feedback for these new songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc711zm?context=5)|Second question: Stations, depending on market size, might conduct testing with groups of people in their markets. They might do online music testing using their listener database, or even survey companies who have local email lists of people in the target demographic. Phone and email response is usuallly ignored because it is such a small piece of the population. If 30 people call a station about a song, so what? That station could have 200,000 listeners (in a med-large market). 30 mean nothing. Since it's a mass media, they'd prefer to go online where they can get a sample of several hundred people in their target demographic to provide input.
[What's your prediction for the future of AM radio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70zy5?context=5)|It's over. People under 45 don't go to the AM band (generally), and as each year passes there are that many fewer people available to listen. Radio owners are scrambling right now to protect their big AM stations by adding an FM simulcast to them in hopes of appealing to a younger audience. The verdict on that is still out in most cases, although there are exceptions in markets like San Francisco and Washington, DC.
[I'm 32 and I hate listening to music on the radio.  Radio is ok for weather, news or sports.  But the music I want to listen to just isn't played on the radio.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g30u?context=5)|I don't know what you mean by your question. Do you mean that young people won't be listening to FM radio? If so, I don't think so. I think radio has a real challenge to stop putting on host-less all-music formats that have no personality or content on them. Like you allude to, music is available everywhere. Radio needs to step up and start creating unique content that isn't available elsewhere.
[Do you think that in 20 - 30 years FM radio will be where AM radio is now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g30u?context=5)|Radio is working on this with success in some places, and will hopefully step up the pace on it.
[The fact that a radio executive with 15 years experience doesn't understand that people listen to music channels to hear music is the reason people keep wondering when radio will die.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7nd6x?context=5)| 
[I work in radio myself.  I understand it brings in money, but it does nothing but ruin the reputation of radio as a medium. Plus, those ad spots could be used to help local businesses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70w51?context=5)|Sadly, they work. And if they work, ad agencies will continue to use them. Radio has done a poor job of helping advertisers make better commercials, and agencies do a generally poor job of creating good commercials. They create EFFECTIVE commercials, but often times at the sacrifice of the radio station.
 |As you said, ""it brings in the money,"" and many radio managers don't care enough to stand up against it. Or, they've been shot down by GMs who up against an impossible sales goal and can't really concern themselves with big picture thinking when it's the 28th of the month and they're only at 85% of budget.
[How do I get my song on a local radio station? Can I use my $200 condenser mics and home studio? I have written many songs and contributed hooks to breakout artists.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc71i80?context=5)|Depends on what size of a city you're in. It's much easier to walk into a radio station and talk to the program director in Casper, WY than it is in Chicago.
 |The short answer, however, is marketing. Email the song, mail a CD, email it again, drop it off at the station, make a phone call, email again. The big record labels spam the hell out of program directors on a daily basis.
 |Also, be sure to submit your song to Mediabase and BDS. They monitor radio stations, so this will help you get credit if your song does get airplay.
[Thank you! I didn't realize the big shots spammed, but I knew the likes of Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, might have dinner/lunch with an owner at least at the start of their careers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc73viq?context=5)|Yes, labels love sending out their stuff over and over. Like everyone else, program directors are extremely busy. It takes effort to get their attention. It's so easy to get data on local sales, digital downloads, etc., so radio program directors have enough data to do their jobs without the ""help"" of labels. So, labels and indie artists need to fight through the clutter.
[How much have ad sales fallen fur to the Internet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zicx?context=5)|I have not seen any specific reports/studies about how much money has moved from radio to Internet, but it is clearly a fact. National radio groups are having much more success monetizing their online platforms due to the large reach; they can get money from the national advertisers who truly budget money for online. The smaller local and regional groups are still having a very tough time getting some of that money for the opposite reason -- less reach.
 |The bigger talk in radio is about the amount of money going to mobile (versus internet). Radio has generally done a good job embracing mobile as a platform to be available for fans, however monetizing mobile is still an uphill struggle for radio.
 |My opinion is that radio needs to stop trying to get radio sales people to sell their online/mobile assets, and instead hire college graduates who understand those platforms and get them out there selling it. It's much easier to buy something from someone who actually understands it.
[Regarding audio: What's the difference between mobile and internet? Are you talking about apps for radio stations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc71dxy?context=5)|Good question. Internet I'm thinking of web browsing from a computer, versus mobile which I think of as using the internet from a mobile device. I know they are both ""internet"", but hopefully that provides clarification to how I'm using the terms.
[I'm a twenty year old aspiring radio producer/broadcaster with a decent amount of experience under my belt and I'll be moving to London this Saturday to study radio production!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70t9i?context=5)|Luckily, in London (and much of Europe) there are many more radio jobs still in existence compared to the US, which means you have more opportunity.
[What are your best tips in respect to breaking into the industry at a high level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70t9i?context=5)|Breaking in at a high level? Very few do it. You usually need to break in at a low level. Walk into radio stations, tell them you want an internship, and ALWAYS be in the building offering to help. Seriously, it's the truth.
[How are ratings calculated (is the system equivalent to Nielsen ratings on TV\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zvcp?context=5)|Ratings are measured electronically in larger markets, and are measured by listener recall in interviews with ratings companies in smaller markets. Nielsen is actually in the process of trying to acquire Arbitron, radio's largest ratings service.
[At least at the stations I have listened to, there seems to be much turnover in the airstaff and I frequently read about people being fired.  What are the primary reasons for the high turnover? Is it ratings, cost, or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zvcp?context=5)|The primary reason for turnover in 2013 is typically cost, but ratings can very much play into it. Not knowing the market, station, or other specifics, it's tough for me to make an educated guess. However, most cuts in recent history are strictly cost-based.
[How does a company like I Heart Radio make their money?  I use it all the time, there is very little (if any commercials\)...I have never given them a dime...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zpdm?context=5)|IHeartRadio is owned by Clear Channel and all of their radio stations are there. They've also done deals with competitors, like Cumulus, so they carry those stations, too.
 |In comparison to terrestrial radio, it does not run many ads, however internet advertising is sold by thousands of impressions.
 |Example: An advertiser might pay $5 per 1,000 impressions (their ad playing 1,000 times). When you consider that millions of people stream Clear Channel (and Cumulus) stations, it really comes down to scale.
 |Like I mentioned on another post on this topic, the large, national companies are the ones having the most success monetizing internet because they have that large scale reach.
[Music has been a large part of my life since I was a young kid. My father being a DJ at a roller hockey ring. I was raised listening to EDM (electronic dance music\) with over 100+ genres of EDM.. Dubstep, Drum and base, electro, etc. I am confused as to why no one has released a strictly EDM music station. Now don't get me wrong, there are a few. BPM on XM radio for example. But let me explain, the ""beats"" played on all these stations are not up to par or up to date with any ""real"" EDM followers.When a rap star or pop star comes out with a new hit single, you better bet you're gunna hear that damn song 15 times a day for the next month... These EDM stations are replaying the same boring out dated stuff multiple times a day. I find myself asking, did the DJ just give up?  Now let's throw out a hypothetical. If i started my own station, and played only the ""top"" tracks in the EDM scene. it would be a huge hit. I speak for hundreds of people I know, if there was a station that played good EDM, it would be the main station of today's youth. EDM is the music choice of the new generation. Why is no one tending to our needs?  I understand the regulations for a radio station are quite complex , but this is a nation, a generation, looking for music with no luck. And unless I play good EDM from my phone, there is no way I'm finding it on the radio.  Why has no one does this? What would need to be done to start ones own radio station?  Would you be interested in something like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc8owgd?context=5)|Boston has an EDM station, but I'm not sure about it's success.  EDM has a very PASSIONATE fan base, but it's not a LARGE fan base. Remember that radio is MASS appeal, and needs to appeal to as many people as it can get away with. In most markets of the US, EDM does not have a large enough fan base to justify using an FM signal on it. MANY markets have EDM stations on an HD radio channel. If the fan base was that big, HD radio would be selling a lot more radios.  EDM, just like Americana, has a passionate niche following in most of the country, which is why it's not on a terrestrial station.  Remember, radio owners are ALWAYS looking for the next big thing, so you can be sure all sorts of formats are being tested all the time.
[Hello! I was wondering what career options there are for a graduate with Visual Communications/Design and Marketing Management degrees, but a very strong interest (not experience\) in writing?  I am also really good at finding ""good music"" that should be on the radio, but isn't.  Are there online radio stations that would be open to someone to select new music to feature? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc9m5vv?context=5)|If you have an interest in writing, copywriting is a huge opportunity. Most commercials on the radio suck. Period. Radio needs people to write better commercials.
 |""Good music"" is subjective, and most radio stations are well aware of what's out there. Trust me... my radio colleagues and I are always talking about music that is ""unknown""... sometimes we're talking about a song two years before it ever makes it on the radio. Radio truly is filled with music geeks, but radio is still a business. We have to give listeners what they want, and we do research to ask them what they want. It would be dangerous to start flooding a station with a bunch of unfamiliar music just to try and be a trailblazer. People want to hear music they know. The kind of people that like to discover music are far and few between, and unfortunately don't justify a large enough % of the population to start playing too much unfamiliar music.
[Why is Sirius/XM raping my butt? And why am I enjoying it? Serious, all I want is Howard Stern. It's bullshit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zzoo?context=5)|I am not sure why Sirius/XM is raping your butt, nor am I sure how. It doesn't use the standard long, solid antenna.
 |People have talked about them offering a la carte, but truthfully, access to 150 channels for $12 or $16/month is really cheap. I doubt they'll ever go that route.
[Why are morning programs so annoying?  I'd rather they just play music.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g3m9?context=5)|It sounds like you might be in a smaller market where morning shows don't get to test their content. They simply wait for ratings, and if ratings are good then they keep doing what they're doing. Large and major markets will test content before and after using it to get a feel for what people like and don't like.
[Also, do early morning DJs not realize how unfunny and annoying they are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g3m9?context=5)|There is also a subset of the listening audience (like you) who just want music. The truth is that radio will not survive by ""just playing music"" because ""just music"" is available everywhere. Radio needs to create content. Period.
[I'm talking about people like JohnBoy and Billy and Marconi the Night Ninja.  They aren't funny.  They never were.  But yet they try so hard to be.  If I'm driving and I hear their voice I turn off the radio immediately.  Seems like radio stations would want their listeners to do the opposite.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7pewl?context=5)|JohnBoy and Billy is an extremely successful show, so while you turn it off, don't let that lead you to believe others are the same. They are in a market where ratings are measured electronically (meaning ACTUAL listening is being tracked). They would not be on the air in that market if they didn't actually have a lot of listeners.
[Do you still have the 'faith' in terrestrial radio? If I were in radio still, I wouldn't at all be worried about satellite radio. It's the digital/cellular/internetz that poses more 'threat' because the cost of entry is insignificant comparatively to satellite or the purchase that comes with a license. I just don't ever see radio going away. It's too cheap, too efficient. Too local. Too immediate. Someone will always find a way to make money with it. Maybe not (and probably not\) the big players, who are constantly trying to squeeze a few extra bucks out of it, at the cost of the very things that I think make it perpetually viable. What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc72n67?context=5)|I have a lot of faith in terrestrial radio if it remains local and therefore relevant. Terrestrial radio stations are extremely expensive to operate, which is the real competitive challenge. But the owners and stations that focus on delivering results to local businesses will forever thrive. Period. If you sell something that works, people will keep buying it. Business 101.
[I live in Europe, and listen almost exclusively to publicly funded public service radio, with absolutely no advertisements at all. The image I have to commercial radio in America is that there's an ad every five minutes, and that in an hour of radio you might get half-an-hour of actual radio content? Is my view of commercial radio even remotely correct in tersm of the number of ads?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc754x1?context=5)|The average music radio station in the US runs 12 minutes of commercials per hour max, and usually in two clumps of six minutes each on opposite sides of the hour.
 |The average talk station runs about 18 minutes of commercials per hour, divided into 5-6 breaks. 
[I'm curious how most radio stations get their music...I'm thinking more older stations before the internet, specifically would stations buy full albums (like vinyl records\), or merely singles.  Did they even use vinyl or did they use cassettes or 8 tracks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc72jy6?context=5)|They used (past tense) vinyl. They would get their music from the record labels. The mailbox would be full with music on a daily basis. In larger cities, the record labels would personally drop the music off to the radio station. Also, before the huge record labels got so huge, local artists had better chances of getting radio play so they could walk in off the street and submit their music. Then, radio ratings came around and quickly taught radio the sad truth... the average person wants to hear the biggest songs, period. The average person doesn't care about a song just because it's local. If it's not a great song, people will let you know... quickly.
[Thanks! You didn't exactly answer whether they would use full albums or just singles though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc73hu3?context=5)|Typically singles. That was so program directors could make sure the DJ wouldn't play some unknown album cut instead of the hit song listeners were expecting.
[Interesting...For some non single hits (thinking of Zeppelin in particular\), would the directors make their own tapes or something so they would specifically play what they wanted them to or no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc73xei?context=5)|Well, there were of course exceptions to the rule. Sometimes a non-single would get airplay and they'd use the album. But as a practice, the single was what was kept in the studio (when available).
[So from what I gather from you, the DJ's don't really have much of a say into what gets played?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc74mkn?context=5)|No, they have not for several decades. Once ratings services started asking people what stations they listened to, it quickly became evident that stations that set an expectation of what a listener would get were the ones with the most listeners. Stations that were free form, and therefore had no clear expectation set for listeners, had much smaller listener groups. Those listeners also listened for much less time to those stations. Then, formats were born and DJs were no longer disk jockeys... they were then hosts or talent or on-air personalities. They were not jockeying disks... whatever that means anyway.
[Fascinating. How do the producers decide what's a ""good"" song?  Great AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc75ljx?context=5)|Research. 
[Why isn't there sat TV for vehicles yet?

As you can hear by listening to SIRI, they already have the bitrate/compression on audio-only channels (radio) turned way down and the fidelity is awful.
 |I don't doubt they're working on it, but this is all my own speculation/assumption. I am definitely an audio person.
[I'm a Communication major and curious how the job market is right now in radio. I do have a few questions.  Many internships for radio stations are promotional things where you have to go to events, sit under a tent and pass out flyers. Just wondering if these internships eventually lead to jobs higher up.  If I'm looking to get into talk radio (shock jock\) type work, do I still go the internship route?  I'm not going to rudely ask your salary, but is it a hefty amount for the amount of work you do?  What is your opinion on Communication as a major. Many discourage me telling me its a bullshit major, but I enjoy it.  Is the Satellite radio industry a lot more relaxing to work for rather than a local FM station?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc75545?context=5)|It depends on the size of the market, and the needs of the radio station. From my experience, interns come in and do what they're told and that's it. Sounds ideal, but you need to let it be known that you want a job. Be visible, be available, be around, let it be known what you want. Program Directors want to hire people who are hungry and passionate about radio. Just because you had an internship won't guarantee you a job. It's your foot in the door, but you need to make sure the right people know what you'd like to do. Even if they can't help at that station, they can help with others. Radio people are very well networked and connected to each other. It's a small, incestuous business.  Radio compensation is fair. Low-level executives and middle managers are paid fairly, but not excessively. Considering it is a job is very enjoyable, the compensation along with perks make it very fair. I likely won't get filthy rich in this industry, but I'll live a life I'm extremely grateful for.  It depends on your goal. You don't need to be a Comm major to get into radio. If you're asking this question based on wanting to do radio, I'd say pick a major that relates to the type of job in radio you want. Want to be a manager? Get a business degree. Want to do talk radio? Get a degree in history, political science, social science, etc. Essentially get versed in the exact thing(s) you want to do.
 |You'll probably want to create a podcast and just start doing shows. It's cheap (maybe free). See if you can build a following on one of the popular sites for podcasts like blogtalkradio.com. Build a following, get good at doing the kind of show you like doing, an then start making demos out of it. Who knows... you may find that podcasting is more enjoyable for ""shock"" content since you don't have to edit yourself.  In the sense of not worrying about ratings, yes. In the sense that satellite radio really has a limited number of employees for 150 stations, no. 
[Question about talk radio. taking their comments at face value, there are many ""liberal"" (for shorthand purposes\) talk shows that say they get great ratings, some that beat out ""conservative"" shows on a regular basis. yet there are 600 stations that carry limbaugh, 400+ for hannity, 200+ for levin, savage, beck and less than 30 that carry bill press, thom hartmann (on commercial radio, he does a pacifica radio commercial free simulcast\), stephanie miller, ed schultz, norman goldman, and mike malloy. even in heavily ""liberal"" cities there isn't one second of ""liberal"" radio.  So i have multiple questions. 1\) why aren't the radio conglomerates giving the alternative voice a chance, understandably not on the legacy main stick where they are compelled to carry those big conservative voices, but on the other lower powered station in these markets? 2\) why were these stations that were the ""liberal"" stations flipping to sports all of a sudden (and if they have worse ratings than before the flip why they haven't flipped back\)? and 3\) is it really that much harder to sell ads for ""liberal"" shows than ""conservative"" shows even if the audiences are about the same size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc75ull?context=5)|The truth is the big companies really did try liberal talk radio. I worked for a one of them. The ratings just didn't come to be in nearly all cases. Without ratings you don't get regional or national advertising money. And considerthat many small business owners are conservative, so that shrinks your opportunity at local advertising money. No ratings and no revenue means no radio station.  I'm sorry you didn't like my comment on AM radio. You are an exception to the rule. I see ratings for a couple dozen large markets and was simply stating the truth... AM radio is primarily consumed by people 45 and older. In some cases, the under 45 audience to an AM station is less than 20%.

So, they get to run a bunch of ads, and the sales rep is getting pennies compared to what they'd get if a normal advertiser ran that many commercials.

It's pretty tough. You need to wait for an FCC auction (happens every 2-5 years) to bid on frequencies that they've made available. In most cases the bidding gets very expensive, and not worth it. If you plan smart, and don't mind moving, you can find some small city/community frequencies that sometimes sell for $2,500. You then have the cost of building the station (transmitter, studio, etc.), but if you're frugal you can get that all done for about $50,000 assuming you run into no legal issues.

A successful morning show really does have a full day. They often also spend their days going to meet clients (schmoozing) and working with charities.
[Reception and signal strength.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc735ec?context=5)|It won't. It will only get worse. The FCC is handing out more and more licenses as time goes on. They're doing this in the name of ""more voices is better."" The downside is that there is a lot more noise on the dial, so other stations won't be able to improve their power output.

They want to remind people that they are THE station that plays 30 minutes of non-stop music, so that tomorrow on their drive home from work when they keep hitting commercials on other stations, they'll hopefully remember ""this station plays 30 minutes of music, let's check them out."" That's a VERY, dumbed down version of this answer, but that's essentially the point.
 |Also, most radio markets are rated based on recall meaning people have to keep track of what they REMEMBER listening to. There are tactics (like saying 30 minutes of non stop music) that stations HOPE will cause someone to write down that they listened to said station for 30 minutes, even if it was only 15.
 |But, mostly, it's to remind you what they're known for. It's absolutely no different than the fact that Coke puts their logo on every can. Why? You bought the case, and took it home. Do they need to remind you on every can that it's a Coke? No... but it's branding. The more we see/hear/are exposed to something, the more likely we are to recall it.
[How are royalties allocated to artists/labels to which you air on the radio and what equipment if any is used to police this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7475d?context=5)|ASCAP, BMI and SESAC collect licensing fees from radio stations. The total number of how much a station pays is a percentage of revenue. So, the more successful a station is, the more money it pays in licensing fees to those three bodies. Also, a few times a year either or all of those entities will request a full report of all songs played over a specific period of time (that the license organization determines). They use that data from across the country to determine how to allocate to licensing money to the songwriters.

[Will Rock n Roll radio make a comeback anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7nf3t?context=5)|Are you referring to the original rock and roll, like from the 50s/60s? If so, no. It targets an audience that advertisers don't want to spend money acquiring. Advertisers want to reach people under 55 years old, and in general people don't listen to music that came out before they were born. Are there exceptions? Of course, but I'm speaking generally.

I'm still trying to get a job in the industry, any idea's or suggestions to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc78880?context=5)|It depends on what kind of job you want. Are you wanting to be on the air? If so, see if that station would let you use a studio to put together a demo then start mailing it out to stations. You're more likely to get a start on the air in a small market. Chicago is the 3rd largest market (out of over 300 markets), so getting an on-air job there will be nearly impossible without prior experience. Go to smaller markets around you to look for entry level opportunities.

1mbaed,3,2013-09-13,Is it appropriate to ask a recruiter how many positions are being filled?,jafrawr,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1mbaed/is_it_appropriate_to_ask_a_recruiter_how_many/,"I have a networking dinner and interview event coming up with a company where I previously interned. The information I've received from HR points to this event playing out the same as the intern event I attended two years ago. There were 30 or so prospective interns at the event and around 10 were hired.

This event is for a full-time position within the company. When the recruiter calls to follow up with specific details, would it be appropriate for me to ask how many people they are looking to hire?"
1mae28,1,2013-09-12,Help dissecting a recent phone interview I had?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mae28/help_dissecting_a_recent_phone_interview_i_had/,"So in a nutshell, I applied online for a summer internship for 2014 with a top-10 global tech company.

Long story short, I randomly got a call from someone within the company about 10 days after applying online.  It was completely unexpected, which I didn't mind, and it felt like it was more of a weed-out call than a true interview.  All-in-all, the call maybe lasted 10-15 minutes total.

A few days later, I get an email from someone within the company requesting a true phone interview.

Fast forward, I'm nervous as hell, and the interview starts.  They (the initial email contact and someone else) start out by asking about my prior projects, which I had no problem discussing.  Yadda yadda, we talk about stuff over my resume, which I'll skip because that doesn't really pertain to my questions.  I'll just say I think I did pretty good, maybe a 75% - 85% grade overall.  I didn't know some questions, which I politely apologized for and honestly said I didn't know. I didn't feel too bad, as I've still got 8 months of classes left anyhow.

So what I've really been thinking about (probably too much) are a few things that they said to me in the interview that lead to me thinking I've got a good chance at landing the job.  I'm sure some of you with more than 2 interviews under your belt could answer.

1. They spent a good amount of time towards the end of the interview explaining what the company was about, and what the department that I could potentially be working in was about. Normally I'd say it wasn't a big deal, but he did spend some time getting into details about how the particular department functioned, what I would be able to do, working on, working conditions, etc.  


2. At the end of the interview, they mentioned that I had applied for an internship position.  They then asked if I'd be willing to be hired straight as a full-time, recent grad, instead of the internship.  Of course I said yes.  


3. I applied for the job at location A.  They asked me if not being able to work at location A, but location B would be a deal breaker.


So after all that, am I crazy, vain, or right?  I doubt they'd hire me over two interviews, but I just want to make sure they just weren't blowing smoke up my ass.

1ma8lp,6,2013-09-12,Want to get serious about internships this year. All advice would be helpful.,Lt-D,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ma8lp/want_to_get_serious_about_internships_this_year/,"&gt;A little about my situation:

I'm going into year 4 out of 5 in my Comp Sci BS. So far I haven't done any internships and don't have any solo side projects that I have done. 

Now, my school has a lot of career fairs and I actually went last year to one and got two interviews. However, one was very demoralizing (Interview spat out logic questions at me while only typing and never looking at me and then subtly insulted a certification I held). The other was more an informational interview and didn't have any technical questions. That went very well. 

However, I moved along in the process and was supposed to fill out a form listing experience I've had with various technologies including virtual machines, etc. I chickened out and never replied. Overall I found it to be an unpleasant experience at the very best.

Now, coming in to my fourth year I'd like to be fully prepared and present myself in the best way possible. I do have some school-related group projects that are semi-completed that I could show off. I know I need lots of preparation in order to be successful at finding an internship. I'd like to be a little selective too in that I want an internship somewhere in the San Franciso Bay Area. Also, I don't currently have a car and probably will not have one during the summer. That was another reason why I chickened out on the application process I started last year. The job ended up being on a military base and I don't have a driver's license at the moment. 

&gt;What I could use help on (questions are in bold):

I plan on preparing for potential interviews by doing the following:
   * buying interview appropriate clothes
   * practicing questions on Big Interview
   * Attending career workshops and resume critiques
**Is there any site or book you recommend for practice technical interviewing questions?**
**What can I do in between now and June 2014 to enhance my skills and my resume?**

I don't really have a set subfield in mind to focus on in the coming two academic years. Up until now I have been floating along taking the required courses. I have more of an idea of what I don't like than what I do. **How important is it to have focused knowledge in a subfield? How did you find your specialization/do you have any advice on how I would find mine?**

**Should I look into doing a solo project to build my portfolio?** I've tried starting such projects before but I find I run out of steam and get bored with the project quickly. One of the most fun parts of software development for me is exchanging ideas and implementing them on a team with others. I know side projects are beneficial to ones resume but I don't know if I'll reap the benefits of such a venture if I end up having to lie to interviewers about how I enjoyed the project and in the meantime if I have to push myself just to do it. I'm worried it will end up feeling contrived. 

I don't have anyone right now that could be a good reference for me either for my technical skills or for my work ethic. I've had a TA or two that knew me fairly well and other students of course. No one you could call a supervisor though. **How important are references for an initial internship position? What, if anything, should I be doing to make up my deficit in this area?**

**Lastly, do you have any additional advice or thoughts for me?** Comments on any or all of my questions would be greatly appreciated."

I just finished my junior year in college as a computer networking major.  My school gives us semesters off to do internships in our junior and senior years.  Currently, I'm doing a co-op at Cisco, and I'm wondering if it will be really beneficial to take a year off and continue working there.  If I do, I have a good chance of getting a co-op with TAC, and a much better chance of landing a job after I graduate.  

Or would be better if I got my degree sooner?"
1meb0q,6,2013-09-14,"Physics major, managed to get an interview for a Jr. Developer position, how can I really nail the interview?",Ziberzaba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1meb0q/physics_major_managed_to_get_an_interview_for_a/,"So I just graduated last spring with a BS in physics and minor in ME.  I scored a semester long internship at a tech company in the algorithm development group; that I was able to extend to 2 full years while finishing up college.  Towards the end of that internship I realized that there had not been a single day where I wished that I was somewhere else.  I decided that this is what I wanted to do.  I have learned some basic programming skills in a handful of languages: Python, MATLAB, SQL, and a very small amount of java and C/C++ from my internship and on my own in the last year.  
  
I recently applied for a junior development position and managed to get an interview for next week.  However I feel like I may not be able to stand up against CS majors who may have also applied for this position.  I feel that if in the interview I am asked any highly specific technical questions I may not be able to answer them as well as those CS majors.  I'm really excited about entering the field, and find what the company does to be extremely interesting.  
  
Yet I am worried.  I have never interviewed with a company that desires such a specific skill set.  What can I do to prepare myself for the interview?  What kinds of questions should I expect?  How can I fully express to them that my physics degree and what I learned at my internship will compare to someone who majored in CS?  Thanks in advance for your help and replies."
1me454,10,2013-09-14,How much equity is fair equity?,kacxdak,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1me454/how_much_equity_is_fair_equity/,"I'm recently joining a start up that I find fairly interesting. It's about to do a local alpha launch soon, and I brought up equity distribution to the table. I got an offer from the CEO which I know to be a low offer, but I'm not sure as to what would be a fair offer in the end. Any suggestions?

A little bit of background:

* I'm a student, so I'll be working part time, around 20 hours a week, but I fit in 35+ if the need rises
* I'm one of 2 backend coders
* During the summers I can make approx $30k pre-tax with internships and whatnot
* The team is of 8 people (2 co founders [one of which is majority], 2 front end, 1 integration, and 2 backenders)
* The CEO thinks all employees should have equal distribution in the beginning
* The company's current worth is $0
* We are going to go for series A funding in the upcomming 30 - 40 days

Lets assume there are 20mil shares to go around. Here are my thoughts:

1. Until we have investors, we should save around 15 mill for them. (right now the 2 co founders are funding it)
2. There should be stock differentiation between employees
3. The two co founders should each have around 5-10% ownership
4. Each of the current employees should be receiving around 0.5 - 1% per annum (until we have funding after which salary can be decided) which would be given at a monthly rate

Any views which seem unfair? Any suggestions for what would be a more fair offer?

[What's the dumbest effect a producer/director ever asked you to create?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87bz6?context=5)|We were asked to reproduce a practical effect for a trailer for Snow White.  They loved the practical effect, and so I said just recreate that, it would be cheaper, but they didn't want to. They wanted to do it CG.  So we tried, and they didn't like it as much, so we eventually recreated our own version of the same practical effect, but they ended up just going with the original.  Huge waste of time and money.
[Can you give an example of VFX that's so good no one knows it's actually VFX?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8756t?context=5)|Well, I would wager a guess that many people who saw Life of Pi have no idea that the tiger is CG most of the time, or that the ocean isn't actually there.  Let me think on this a little, though, and get back to you.  i like this question.
[Buddy, everybody knew that fuckin' tiger was CG.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8agvd?context=5)|Buddy, no they didn't.  I'm not talking about the CG geeks.  I'm talking about the average movie goer.
[Can you point us a time frame where your job can be seen in Narnia or in X-Men with some details of what was your part and how did you performerd? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87db9?context=5)|I was a VFX producer on Narnia, and X-Men: First Class...I was a VFX coordinator on X-Men: X-Men United, so I was involved in the project management.  For Narnia, the company I worked for did some matte paintings and simple comps scattered throughout.  For First Class, we did Emma Frost, Angel's wings, and Mystique's transformations, among other things.  On United, our major sequences were the opening Night Crawler bamf sequence, and the interior of Cerebro.
[I'm looking to get into the film industry after art school. What advice can you give me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86q9i?context=5)|Well, it depends on what you want to do.  My general advice would be to have very specific goals.  If you want to be a filmmaker, then you need to make films.  If you want to be an animator, then always be animating.  The doers are the ones who make, not the ones who wait for someone to pay them to do.
[I'm curious, is the technique for reconstructing the scenery behind the obvious cgi used because it helps create the realism for the main subject in the shot? I know 5-10 years ago it was blatantly obvious that there was CGI on top of a live action shot. Was it easier to make the live action shot look less 'live' so that it created a better backdrop for the heavy action in the foreground? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8cpvz?context=5)|No, aerial photography is expensive and you can't always get exactly the shot you want.  If you build the plate in post, then you can get exactly the shot you want and make sure your framing is exactly right for the action.
[Hi Tim, can you tell us a little bit about the tools you use? What are the most common software programs you use, and for what purposes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87aae?context=5)|Hi, yes my day job was a VFX producer, but I also taught myself to comp and matte paint.  If I could go back and take a different path it would be as a matte painter.  I use After Effects for comp and motion graphics, because it's what I had at the time, and I still like it.  I use Photo Shop for painting.  But I'm also a filmmaker, so I use Final Cut for editing...Final Draft for writing...Movie Magig for budgeting and scheduling live action.  As a VFX Producer, yes it was a lot of spreadsheets.
[Which 90s or early 2000 movie do you think was far ahead of it's time as far as VFX goes? Best movie ever as far as VFX goes (relative to it's time\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87104?context=5)|Hm...Well, T2 is probably the most ground breaking film from the 90s...My favorite VFX film of all time is Blade Runner.  The stuff Trumball and his team did in that film still holds up.
[I'd argue Jurassic Park was the most groundbreaking ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc88yhs?context=5)|Yeah, JP was, but T2 was the first film to have completely digital comps.
[It's been two hours, Tim. Please come back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8ajxo?context=5)|Sorry, I had a kid issue...Resolved, and all is good.
 |My first job in VFX was as a Production Assistant at Cinesite Hollywood...I dug it.  From that position you get to see a lot of what's going on.  I could have gone the artist route, but my older brother was an artist and I wanted to blaze my own trail, so I stuck with the production path.  It taught me a lot about the business side of things that helped me way more when I decided to make my own movies than sitting at the box would have.
 |Well, my VFX artist experience is all lower end, because I would do it on the side, but I comped a green screen shot for a biopic on Billy Graham that was something like 6000+ frames.  Armie Hammer played the young Billy Graham, and the shot was this long speech with him walking around in front of a baddly lit GS.  For a quick shot it would have been fine, but 6000 frames is a long time for your edges to have to hold up.  It turned out...sort of eh.
[What was your favorite part about working on X-Men?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86tnu?context=5)|Just being a part of such a cool franchise with such diehard fans.
[What is the best thing aspiring filmmakers can do to better themselves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86uiy?context=5)|Watch lots of films...not just films you like.  And make films, don't just talk about making films.  Get out there and do it.
[Many times when VFX guys make a film, there's a lot of emphasis on, of course, the VFX. Is this movie sort of a showcase for your talent? Also how did you get started in VFX? Where would you suggest someone get started today, with so much different software? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8791i?context=5)|Well, my last feature had very little VFX, because I didn't want to be labeled just a visual guy...I wanted to prove I could tell a story with relying on visual gimmicks.  It's called Sick Boy, check it out if you like indie stuff.  With this one, though we need to pull out some bigger visuals, so yeah it will hopefully showcase those tents, but we also want to showcase our filmmaking and story telling skills and show the VFX guys can do more than make pretty pictures.  As far as getting into the industry, things are different now.  There is a lot more recruiting right out of school, schools that weren't around 10 years ago. The key is to get in somewhere and make yourself invaluable, have a good attitude, and never stop learning.  Even I you get in as a PA, just get in.  Oh, and you should be prepared to have to chase jobs outside the US.
[Why did you decide to make your own movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86jn4?context=5)|I've always wanted to make my own films, because I genuinely love the medium and the craft.  VFX was my way in.  I love VFX, but love everything else about filmmaking, too. It's my favorite thing in the world...next to my wife and two beautiful kids.
[What is the one effect that you worked on that you are the most proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87a6l?context=5)|Actually, this may sound silly, but I am most proid of the work we did for the first Alvin and the Chipmunks.  Our client was not the most easy to deal with, and they made things very difficult for us at every step of the way.  We produced 45 minutes of amazing animation for that film even though they recast the voices 12 weeks from delivery, and then forced us to change our head models 9 weeks from delivery...which f'd our rigs and forced us to re-animate a lot of facial stuff...but we did it.  My team was awesome.  The crap part of a deal like that is, we designed the characters, the animators brought them to life, the movie makes $600+ million, and the facility that did all the work gets nothing as far as royalties.  Justin long still gets a check for the three days he showed up on that one.  That's what's wrong with this industry and our side of it.
[What is the most ridiculous shot/effect you have ever done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87a6l?context=5)|The most ridiculous effect was adding hair to Mel Gibson's balding dome in What Women Want...Apparently women didn't want a Mel Gibson with thin hair.
[What will be the most incredible effect in your new movie, the one people will be talking about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87a6l?context=5)|I think the most incredible effect we are planning for PRETERNATURAL is a creature transformation to rival the transformation in American Werewolf in London, which in my opinion hasn't yet been topped.
[What are the current plans for a VFX Union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86qk5?context=5)|That's a difficult question to answer.  I don't think a union solves everything.  The facilities have to get together, too.
[How long was the education for your path? i wish i could just move to california and become succesful.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87ei6?context=5)|My education was actually in Architecture.  My filmmaking education was the muti-plex and video store.
[Do you think this new project will do the same thing as the mermaid mockumentary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc874xu?context=5)|No...Mainly for the simple fact that we're not making a mockumentary.  We wanna make something that takes the subject matter very seriously.  That's one of the biggest differences with our film versus some of the other faux docs out there that deal with monsters, like Troll Hunter.  We want to make a scary movie, so there will be very little humor or tongue and cheek stuff.
[What do you think is the role if vfx in future cinema? Say 30 years from now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc875ct?context=5)|It will continue to be a major tool.  I mean, there isn't a film made now that doesn't have some sort of visual effects element to it.  That wasn't the case even 15 years ago.  A big VFX show then was 100 shots.  It's an amazing tool, but unfortunately, it's bred a crop of lazy filmmakers who don't feel the urgency to figure things out ahead of time...and just sort of shop around in post to figure things out.
[On a scale of one to Skyline how bad will the film be?  Nah I'm just messing with ya. good luck.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8c825?context=5)|With skyline being really bad?  Hopefully not nearly that bad.
[As someone who is majoring in film but doesn't know what aspect to really focus on, how did you know you wanted to do VFX?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87thq?context=5)|Well, I didn't.  I wanted to tell stories by way of moving pictures...I wanted to make movies, so I was a fan of everything that went into making movies.  I always had a love and respect for effects, so when the opportunity came up to get in that way, I took it.  The problem is, it can be hard to move around within the industry once you're in, and I didn't know that people who worked in post weren't though of the same as people who worked on set.
[What is your and other professionals opinion of the program blender? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc89tfl?context=5)|I think Blender is a great tool, and that more people should be using it.
[Can you elaborate a little on the day to day tasks of a VFX producer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8b6h1?context=5)|Eating crap and having to pretend like you like it.  Wanting to say no, but being told I can't.  Feeling horrible that people are working so hard and being powerless to really do anything about it.
[1\) How did the company go bankrupt? Life of Pi was awesome!  2\) Are you more scared or excited striking out like this and making your own movie?  3\) I love the movies you worked on and this new one sounds really cool. Keep up the good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87z6e?context=5)|1) The reason for R&amp;H's bankruptcy is very complicated, but shrinking price points for the work they did, along with increased international competition, and the fact that they were the largest privately owned facility of their kind that didn't have huge government incentives backing them up are the major reasons.  They just didn't have deep enough pockets to weather the down time. 2) Excited for sure. 3) Thanks!
[When and where did you get your big start in VFX for movies?  Where would the best place to go if you want to intern on a movie or big movie studio, and still keep the job after your done? (Depending if you are actually a good worker\)  I am a self taught VFX artist myself (Still training\), if its not too much to ask, could I have constructive criticism on my latest work? Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc880nl?context=5)|I'll get back to you...it just might be a bit later.  With two kids under three it's hard to stay seated for very long.  Hang tight, although a few of your questions I've answered in other threads.  As for your work, there is some promise there.  I would study photography and lighting if you can.  Keep at it.
[As a sophmore in college, I would like to know, where would be the best place to go for movies after I graduate?  P.S. This is my most latest work; only took a half hour to make, uploaded it 3 days ago..and it has almost 18000 views...I am disappointed to be honest, but what do you think of my sillyness? haha Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc880nl?context=5)|The best place to go after college and intern is the place that's offering you a spot.  What you do once you're there is up to you.  If you make yourself invaluable, they'll keep you around.
[Is there any place that I could go to to find some tricks of the trade? What do you suggest is the best learning source to become a better VFX artist? I dig through a lot of YouTube tutorials but a vast majority of them are done by people who have just learned it themselves and aren't very experienced. Any suggestions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc892kh?context=5)|Just keep doing it.  That's the best way to learn.  The biggest difference between a seasoned pro and a newbie (assuming they have the same artistic talent) is technique.  The only way you will hone your technique is by doing it.
[Did you happen to see The Hobbit in 48fps? How would you feel if that became the new standard? How would it impact the jobs of the VFX department?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8axm4?context=5)|I saw a little bit of it, and I hate it.  Movies aren't supposed to look like real life.  They're supposed to look like movies.
[I actually agree about the fake part. The Hobbit was the first big attempt at 48fps, and hopefully film makers can better wrap their abilities around the format with future films. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8h9ke?context=5)|We'll see.
[Hey Tim, I'm a guy going to school for a random computer science degree but recently decided I'm going to pursue more education in the VFX field after I get my current degree. What if any is your opinion of Gnomon, and do you think its worth the money to go there? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8a6t8?context=5)|I've answered similar questions, but my opinion is that if the talent is in you, it doesn't matter where you go to school.
[Would you say it is technology or know how that makes one film look better than another?  Did special effects become cheaper in the last x years and if so by what factor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8fo39?context=5)|It's story and vision that makes for a good movie.  There are plenty of good movies with less than spectacular technical elements.  Yes VFX have become cheaper.  Probably by a factor 50%.  Which is why facilities are having such a hard time.

[Hey I'm really excited for you that you get to do your own movie! However, if you remember the movies skyline and AVP Requiem, they bombed and were made by two guys that used to do VFX. What are you going to do differently to make sure that doesn't happen to your film too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8gd4z?context=5)|Well, those guys are much more interested in playing Joe Hollywood than telling interesting and compelling stories.  Story is key with me.  The VFX are just something that I can bring to a budget that you don't usually see.
[Now that you are working for yourself, do you use an agent?  Also, do you think you would prefer crowd-funding on every project to the current financing model for many American films?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8bzde?context=5)|No agent, and I don't think crowd funding is the way to go across the board.  This one hasn't been successful yet, and may not be like most of them.  It all depends on the project.

They do fun stuff, but it's missing a level of finish that the top level VFX folks are doing.  I don't want to assume that if pushed they couldn't match it, but they don't have to doing what they do.  The techniques are the same, though.
[How is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8ba0m?context=5)|It's fair to middling...
[As a special effects technician (mostly in live theatre\) I am curious what the relationships are like between your department and say the makeup crew or the effects or set dec crew? To what extent do you divi up the work and/or what animosity exists between you? Some would think you would make perfect enemies, the effects guys of course wanting to blow up something for real, or get the shot by creativity vs 'doing it in post'. Or do you think you should work together to get the best of both? How.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87qtr?context=5)|I think they should work together, or more specifically, that the filmmakers should have a clear vision of what they are looking to get out of a specific shot.  But that is rarely the case anymore.  Because you can do so much after the fact these days, more and more filmmakers are pushing off decisions that are necessary to make adequate use of a practical solution.  Which pushes more to the post guys, but it's not the decision of the VFX guys to do that.  We're always saying, ""Man, why didn't they just shoot this.  It would have been so much better.""  But the practical guys get upset because stuff that traditionally fell on them is now gone.
 |CG should pick up where traditional photographic techniques can't go.  I think Guillermo del Toro said that.  And I agree.
[Hey Tim,  I'm not sure how much you've been involved in the hiring process in your work as a producer, but I'm curious to hear you're take on a bias I (as well as other professionals I know\) have noticed against artists moving from commercials to film VFX work. I'm a lighting specialist based in New York with about 5 years experience. I've worked in very high end commercial studios (MPC, The Mill, ect\), but for the life of me I can't manage to get a gig on a movie. I have a very good reel with a good amount of high end photoreal work, and I'm willing to relocate for project durations. I realize New York has a limited film market (and what's here is typically comp work\) but I feel like I should have had better luck in finding film work or even hearing back from most of the companies. I have close friends who work in feature compositing who have agreed with me and who claim to observe a snobbish approach a lot of film people have to commercial artists compared to film. Again, I have no problem in finding photoreal commercial lighting work and I'm almost constantly booked. Have you noticed this yourself in your career? What are your opinions on it? Do you have any advice to working toward getting into the film market for someone in my position? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8grls?context=5)|I have never experienced a bias against commercial artists.  In fact my experience is that they move around often.  If there is an issue, it's likely due to your current location and the number of readily available local lighters.  If there's a line of quality people right out front, you're likely to go with one of them over importing someone.  Make sense?
[How do you feel about the greater Austin,Texas area film/vfx scene? Do you feel like it is growing? Could it support larger big-budget features?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc886bk?context=5)|I think there is enough talent to support it, but there isn't enough infrastructure yet.  You need a big pipe and a lot of render power to meet the expectations of the big clients.  They don't care if you're an upstart, they just want their shots right now.

[Hey Tim. Narnia was one of my favorite films ever. I watched all the bonus material on the extended DVD set about how the creatures and backgrounds were created. I think you were probably interviewed at some point, and I lurked around on the R&amp;H website for a while and even wrote a school paper on matte painting, which I didn't fully understand anyway. Thanks for your work on that and other awesome movies.  What is your favorite monster or fairy tale story? also have you read American Gods?  EDIT: also what is it like to work with Ang Lee? He seems like a super cool guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8gcva?context=5)|Thanks...I was at a small studio for NARNIA, though.  My favorite monster story is probably Frankenstein, and yes, I've read American Gods.

Fast forward to college and I started in my local community college at their electronic communications program. Turns out it was more for news broadcasting and tv production which is not where I waned to go with film. Any advice on going the education route? I have heard many times its more about what you know and who you know as well as what your resume looks like than a 2 or 4 year degree.  Is that true? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc892xk?context=5)|Yes.  I didn't get a film degree, and when I got my first job I was working alongside guys with USC and NYU film degrees...I've left many of them behind.  You get out of this what you put in.  If you want to be a writer, then write.  If you want to be a carpenter, you gotta swing that hammer.  If you want to be a filmmaker, you make films.  If you want to be a doctor...Well, you should go to school if you want to be a doctor.
[What do you think about VFX artists like freddiew and CorridorDigital who use YouTube to make a living doing VFX skits. Do you think that's a viable avenue for filmmakers and VFX artists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc895q8?context=5)|I think it is if that's what you want to be doing.  Once you start making money with something like that, you can get yourself stuck doing stuff like that.
[As someone who works in the film industry, what is the best way for someone with few connections to get started to work in the industry? Aside from making more connections.

The Internet is a great stage for people these days to get their stuff looked at.
[I'm a huge fan of the X-Men movies, and you mentioned earlier that you did work on the Nightcrawler BAMFing scene.  That was legitimately one of the coolest display of powers in any super hero movie to date, so huge props to you on that one!!  As for a question, when you are working on doing FX for a movie, is there any creative input on the part of you or your team?  Or is it more that the people in charge of the movie have exactly what they want it to look like in mind, and just ask you to do the actual effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87s0w?context=5)|Well, rarely anymore do the people in charge have a clear idea of what they want, so they lean on the VFX guys to figure it out...But just as rare anymore except for in a few cases do the VFX guys get treated like true creative collaborators.  It's frustrating.

[Do you get distracted by VFX in movies? Are you able to immerse yourself in it properly, or do you find yourself constantly thinking, 'I know how they did that', and examining the technique?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc881ge?context=5)|Yes, especially when all the movie has going for it is the visuals...like Transformers.

 |The big thing is being a vendor.  As long as VFX is treated like a vendor and not allowed to share in the profits their work brings in they will continue to struggle.  Do you think anyone went to see Transformers because of Shia Lebouff?  Or however you sat his name...no, they went for the big ass robots.  The guys who make the big ass robots in your big ass robot movie should be treated like headlining, above the line talent is.
[If I understand correctly, a possible solution to compete against cheaper/less expensive vfx houses is to become a famous vfx house (from a final audience point of view\).  So, in the end, you're ""blaming"" the people that manage the vfx business right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8edgt?context=5)|No, that's not what I'm saying.  The post VFX model started as a client vendor situation, but our contribution to the final product has increased such that we need to be treated like above the line talent.  If they are selling tickets for the film based on the work the VFX facilities have done, then the facility should be cut in on the profits regardless of how big the movie is.  But the VFX facilities have this sort of battered wife mentality...they're afraid to leave their abuser, because what if there's no one else out there...truth is their aren't that many clients.
[*an unreliable documentary about fairies.*  Why do you call it ""unreliable""? Serious question, though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87y49?context=5)|It's a play on the literary term unreliable narrator, where you have a first person perspective on a story being given by someone who can't necessarily be trusted.  We'll be presenting the story as true, but since it's a documentary being told by a couple of ex VFX guys about monsters, you might want to be skeptical about what we're going to be showing you.

But I got serious about it my senior year of high school, which is when I started writing screen plays and reading whatever I could get my hands on about making movies.  I went to school for architecture, though, 'cause I thought it was silly to pursue an actual career in the industry.
[So it'll still be in a first person perspective, but from multiple people instead of one narrator?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8efst?context=5)|Well, a documentary has a perspective.  We will have interviews from others, but it's the filmmaker's perspective and agenda that shapes the story.  That's our first person narrator angle.
[Would you ever go back to working for another vfx house or do you want to focus on your own films from now on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8kb9g?context=5)|I want to focus on my own projects as much as I can, but I have a family, so, I'll do what I need to do to make sure they are provided for.  If that means chasing down another facility job, I'll do it. Mic I have to go down the street to Best Buy, and they'll hire me, I'll do that.

1mgogp,6,2013-09-15,Career fair pitch,sparrowaim7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mgogp/career_fair_pitch/,"I've been to a few workshops dealing with how to work a career fair and have been introduced to things such as how you should present yourself, etc. It seems like having a 20-second pitch, in which you introduce yourself and what you're interested in and what you're looking for is a good strategy that employers/recruiters/company representatives are expecting.

Many seem to craft their pitch so as to include what they're interested in, e.g., ""Hi, my name is *p*. I saw your website and noticed that you were looking for summer interns with skills or experience in data mining/big data/artificial intelligence/*q*. &lt;etc&gt;""

I don't really have any experience or a particular skillset that I can tailor to any one company, so I'd like to be able to say that I am a CS junior looking for _any_ summer internship available in _any_ team doing _any_ kind of work. (Of course I won't phrase it exactly like this, throwing gratuitous any's, but the idea is that I just would like any kind of internship doing some form of programming). 

Is it adequate or appropriate to present myself in this manner, i.e., with no specific interest in any one CS discipline other than programming?"

My school counselor has told me that with where I stand academically, I should easily be able to get into any school in Wisconsin. He also recommended that I go to Madison for college because it would be easier to get internships and looks better on work applications. The only downside is the cost. My parents are not rich, and will hardly be able to help pay for my tuition. The cost for one year at Madison is about $24,000 according to their website. is it worth putting myself over $95,000 in debt for a degree from Madison, or would it be better to go to a smaller, less prestigious school like UW-Whitewater?"

After the internship ended, I felt that I would probably be more satisfied in a technology-focused company (e.g. Microsoft, Intel, Apple, etc.), where I can be more creating and use newer technologies. 


My main concern is that as this was my only internship so far, and it being from a financial company, it would not weigh as heavily as say a candidate with an internship from a technology-focused company. Do companies consider this when recruiting?


Also, do you feel that one internship is too early to decide if software development in a financial industry is right or wrong for me? I'm sure there are other opportunities that I haven't yet discovered; I just could not see myself developing enterprise web apps for the next 5-10 years. If you have any input on any past experience, and any advice on where to go from here, I'm eager to hear it.

1meujb,123,2013-09-14,Just landed a great sales job in NYC. Here's what I did to have a successful job hunt!,neverenough22,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1meujb/just_landed_a_great_sales_job_in_nyc_heres_what_i/,"I'd been trying to move back to NYC after having done an internship here a few years ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't get so much as a call because I was living in Ohio. Well, I sold my car, packed two suitcases and got a sublet for a couple months and, about 3 weeks later, I was employed! I'm working for a great company that should yield some fantastic income and it's something I never even knew I'd be interested in.

Enough about me. Here's what I did over the past few weeks to land a job:

RESUME:
•Personalize each resume you send with company name and position. I kept a general resume and would just change out the company name, position and any skills they mention in the description. Save each one as a PDF with your name, desired position and company and throw it in a folder on your desktop. It takes seconds but why not make sure it's not just a vague, half-assed resume?

•Make sure that there are NO spelling or grammatical errors on your resume. None. Take it to your friend with the English degree. Take it to your university's writing center. I work with several recruiters now who said they can spot a typo within 3 seconds-- and guess what happens to that resume?

•Create a section that lists skills and abilities. Why? Resume searching software pulls keywords!

•Your friend, the graphic designer? Throw him $20 and a case of beer and have them create a great layout, something you can edit. Do you know how many boring, ugly resumes come through?

•If your GPA is above a 3.0, throw it on the resume. Also, add what year and month you graduated. A recruiter mentioned that they like to see it-- and if they don't see it they sometimes view it as a red flag that you didn't graduate or are hiding something.

THE COVER LETTER

•I hated writing these. But write a few drafts. Trim them, omit things and get them down to a reasonable length. Try to throw in the keywords that you see mentioned in the description so anyone scanning your cover letter will pick them up. Keep it concise.

•I had several versions of these because I was considering different roles. I had one for sales, one for corporate advertising/marketing, one for advertising agency and one general one for anything that didn't quite fit the others. If you're applying to very different roles, just have different cover letters, drop in the company name and position and BOOM-- personalized cover letter.

•At the end, don't simply just say ""Let me know if you want to talk"". Offer a time or date when you can come in. Tell them that you'll call them this week to ensure they received the cover letter-- and then CALL THEM FOR REAL. Ask for an interview, even if it's just a phone or Skype interview. Why offer all of this info to them with no call to action?

THE HUNT

•Update your LinkedIn profile. This is now maybe just as important as showing up to an interview because it's what recruiters look at all day long (Source: I work with a team of recruiters and interviewed with another recruiting agency) Recommend people you believe in and write them reviews. Request or hope that they do the same. Join professional groups that have to do with your industry, geographic area or education. Make sure that your LinkedIn profile has your most recent resume and credentials listed! And that photo? Better be professional looking.

•I set aside times of the day to hunt. I started beating myself up after a while when I didn't get up at 7AM and work until 7PM. But what I found is that the timeframe of 1PM-8PM was my sweet spot, so that's what I did. It IS important to keep business hours though so that you can go into an interview at a moment's notice!

•Check out LinkedIn, Indeed, Craigslist and any industry-related search sites. I found Monster and Careerbuilder to be useless.

•See a job you want? Throw down a few bucks and Fed Ex your resume, cover letter and portfolio to the hiring manager. Makes a bigger impression than just another PDF file they delete from their inbox.

•Reach out to hiring managers and HR people on LinkedIn. Ask for interviews!

•Find the name and number of the person doing the hiring? Call them. Ask for interviews! (Seeing a pattern?)

•This is perhaps one of the most valuable tips: try to find a good staffing agency or recruiter that specializes in your field. Why? They're paid to place people, unlike that HR lady you keep bombarding with your resume. Do your homework, but this was incredibly important in me getting interviews, freelance work and, eventually, my job.

THE INTERVIEW:
•For the love of God, don't be late.

•You're not late? Good. What are you wearing? It should match the company culture to the best of your knowledge. Applying to an account firm? Suit up. Applying to be a graphic designer at a boutique agency? Slim chinos and a button down. When in doubt, dress up. 

•On appearance: be clean, well-groomed. Your clothes don't need to be Versace and Armani, but try to look current and put together. If you need to, go drop $50 at H&amp;M and get something a little snazzier than the pleated pants and too-big shirt you bought at Kohls six years ago.

•Also on appearance: nonverbal communication is important. Sit upright, don't slouch. Give a firm handshake, not a dead fish. Make eye contact. Smile. Smile. Smile. (Not too much, you don't want them to think you're too weird!)

•Prepare for the interview. Before you go in, research what the company does. Bring up any (positive) headlines you've seen in the news about them. 

•When they say ""Do you have any questions?""-- ASK QUESTIONS! ""What's your favorite part about working here?"" ""What kind of additional projects could I take on?"" ""What does the perfect candidate look like?"" Whatever their answers are, relate it to you and your experience. If they say they want a proactive accountant, mention how you took it upon yourself to find some billing issue at your last job. Whatever it is, relate their answer to you. Make it so YOU are the solution.

•Create a 30/60/90 Day Plan and present it to the interviewer after you've interviewed once or twice and base it on the info you gather from the interview. Basically, you just write out what you plan to do in the first 30, 60 and 90 days if you're hired. Do you know how impressed the people interviewing me were when I did this? This alone might've gotten me the job.

•If you feel comfortable that you're probably being considered for the job, ask for it! You don't have to say ""Give me the job"", but approach it as ""I'm really excited about this position. If you could present me with an offer, I'd be thrilled to join your team!""

•I've gotten mixed reactions on this one when I mention it to others, but it's ALWAYS worked for me. At the very end of the interview, I say something to the effect of ""You know, I'm great with criticism. Is there anything about me, the interview or my experience that you have any concern over?"" Don't pry, but let them think for a moment. Maybe they'll come back and say ""You're a bit junior for this position and I don't know if you have the experience in CSS or Java that we need..."" Counter that. ""I understand your concern, but I would point out that I am currently learning CSS and Java and that I learned HTML in three days. I may not be a senior programmer, but I learn these languages quickly."" Boom. I don't like to let them walk out with a doubt in their mind about me and it's possibly the last time you'll get to fight for the position before they pass you over!

•Ask for their card. If they don't give you one, ask for the person's e-mail address at reception. Or just address a thank you card with the person's name and company as soon as you leave. Mail it immediately. Come home and write that e-mail (if you didn't send it snail mail) right away. I've been told by recruiters that this separates the ""Maybes"" from the ""Likely New Employees"".

•Consider not taking the job. I know, it's crazy-- but I turned down two really decent offers because I wasn't excited about them. Yes, I moved to NYC without a job and then turned down jobs. Crazy? Maybe. But look-- you'll be spending 40+ hours a week at this place. You are interviewing THEM in a sense, too. If you're not into it, write an e-mail after thinking on it and just say that you value their time and feel that you should no longer be considered a candidate. 

•Go on EVERY interview you're offered. You're overqualified? Go. You're underqualified? Go. You're not interested really? Go. It might seem like you're wasting the other person's time-- and perhaps you are. But it's GREAT for experience. Try out your new questions you've developed. Ask for feedback. Worst case scenario is that you walk away with a new contact, more interview experience and no anxiety next time. I walked into my current position's interview with no expectations and was thrilled when I received the offer. You never know!

ENCOURAGEMENT:
•I had a rule when I was job hunting. If I got a rejection letter or was denied a role, I did 3 positive things like apply to another job, contact a hiring manager or follow up on an application. It keeps you moving forward.

•Eat healthy. Go to the gym. Look and feel your best when you go in for the interview!


I realize this is a wall of text, but let me just put this out here: I have a liberal arts degree from a state college with a decent but not exemplary GPA. I moved to a new city without a job and took a huge risk. But what made me successful, I believe, is that I learned HOW to job hunt and gained some great skills and insight on how to do it. I made it my job to learn how and constantly improve. 

PM me if you have any questions and I'd be happy to answer them!

Any suggestions?,Hiker828,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mip2i/im_not_sure_which_career_would_be_best_for_me_any/,"I'm a 20-year-old male, and all through high school I did well academically (I was my class salutatorian). After graduation, I decided to go to community college and take all the basic classes I needed in order to save money and give me more time to decide on a major. I am in my last year at the school, and I am still unsure of what career would be best for me. I *really* need to be applying to universities right now, but I'm afraid to do so when I still can't decide on a career.

I have thought about several different majors - Business, Communications, Political Science, Psychology, Computer Science - But I'm not sure which one would be the best for me. I want to get a degree in something that I can actually find a job in. I think if I can figure out what kind of work I would enjoy doing, it would be easier for me to decide on a major.

Here is some information about me as a person. Maybe it help with suggestions on what I would enjoy doing as a job:

* I'm more of a creative person. While I do well in math, I really struggle with it. Same with science. I enjoy writing/editing.

* I have experience with recording software and using a sound/lighting board for venues. I used to record albums for my musician friends.

* I'm *okay* with public speaking if I am prepared and familiar with the subject matter of my presentation. It's not my favorite thing to do, but it doesn't bother me too much to get up in front of people and speak (in most cases).

* Personally, I'm kind of a shy/reserved person. If I don't know you, it will take me a little while before I am comfortable around you. Once I get to know you, I'm more open and expressive.

* I have an interest in computers, but not a lot of experience with many programs. I think programming might be interesting, but it might be challenging for me as I know nothing about it. I have a little bit of graphic design experience, and once I get used to database programs like Excel and Access I don't think I'd have a problem using them.

* I did an internship with my city over the summer. I worked on several big projects, such as writing legal policies and recording/editing videos for the city's television channel.

* I am willing to relocate. In fact, I would prefer to move to another state once I finish college. I'd love to move to a city with over 200,000 residents.

* I've done quite a lot of domestic volunteer work, and also some foreign volunteer work as well. I love traveling, and wouldn't mind a job that involved a lot of travel.

* I'd prefer a ""white collar"" job over one that involves a lot of manual labor (by that, I mean things like construction work, plumbing, welding, etc.)

* If you have any questions that would help you get a better idea on what I would be good at, feel free to ask!

I used sokanu.com to try to give me some career ideas, and this is the site's top 20 list of careers that would be best for me, based on my answers to the site's career assessment test:

1. Statistician
2. Database Administrator
3. Computer Programmer
4. Historian
5. Cartographer
6. Web Developer
7. Web Designer
8. Information Research Scientist
9. Proofreader
10. Multimedia Animator
11. Economist
12. Audio/Video Equipment Technician
13. Computer Repair Technician
14. Actuary
15. Biomedical Engineer
16. Correspondent
17. Journalist
18. Environmental Engineer
19. Phonetics Engineer
20. Editor

Do you think any of these careers (or any other careers) would be particularly suited for me? I'd appreciate any feedback!"

I feel that I'd have a better-looking resume if I waited to apply for a second internship (first was at a well-known financial company) during the next year. 

I would have a hopefully higher GPA (3.5 now), and more side projects (none notable currently, beside a team project from class). 

My concern is that if I applied now, I would fail the resume screening in the fall, with fear that I will be considered a ""fall applicant"" and be passed over in the spring. Another concern is that these companies will be more picky in the spring. 

Any advice/suggestions?

So with that in mind, I have been practicing using Python with the goal of creating a Django web app (should I continue with learning Django?). 
 
Are there any distinctions or any specific factors that would classify a developer as a software or web developer, or furthermore, a back-end and front-end developer?


To be even more specific, here are the things I want to eventually work in:

* Developing with high level languages (e.g. Python, Java, C++)
* Working on the functionality of applications (and not GUI or design-related work)
* Ultimately, problem-solving, and using code to carry out a specific purpose. 

To add some background, I currently have a year left of school (and so I'm actively trying to build up my portfolio to help land a second internship). I don't yet have any notable side projects, so it just seemed to me that a good way to show my passion is to create a web app with a limited interface but strong/useful backend functionality.

So with that said, some advice/guidance will be far appreciated. What should I focus on, and what should I do next?"

Now those 2 months are drawing to a close, despite doing 2 peoples jobs (one on maternity leave, one on secondment) on top of my own gigantic project which is at a level of complexity 2 pay grades higher than mine.  Giving every bit of effort I can and never saying no when people pile work onto my already ridiculous workload to demonstrate my commitment and abilities. 

I today got swindled out of a 12 month internship with a pay rise by someone with no work experience because their degree is slightly more relevant to the role.

On top of that I get rejected for another job in there today which I was recommended for by 5 different people but rejected for by the recruitment place with absolutely no fucking reason and my impending unemployment means I have to tell my buddy I can't afford to move out with him which completely fucks him over because he can hardly afford the place on his own and I feel completely responsible for that.

And it turns out my GTA V copy is delayed in the mail so I'm not even getting that glimmer of fucking justice, a game I've been looking forward to for years won't be delivered on time like most other peoples.

Wednesday I have to go to the doctors to get my liver test results back, and the fact they've retested me for something doesn't bode well at all. And today at lunch a fucking filling falls out of my tooth, I'm only recently back in this town so I don't have a fucking dentist and all the dentists are full except the private ones so I have to choose between spending half my last paycheck on a filling or just let my tooth rot.

Every time I get a little bit ahead I end up further back down no matter how much effort I put into it, I don't come from a rich or educated family and I've put in so much effort and time and never let up a little bit trying to better my situation yet people with privileged backgrounds get ahead without trying.

Four interns struggle with the problem. 

So as part of our companys upgrade to windows 7 we are trying to phase out all of our old Dell D series laptops and replace them with E series. (Yes before you all go into a tizzy we still use many Dell D620s because they are the most reliable laptop we have ever had the pleasure of working with.) 

So as part of this upgrade we need to provide new docking stations, the kind that also function as monitor stands. Now at the time none of us realized that the ~~ 9 year old~~ faithfull external monitors that alot of people were using are were the old three prong mounting bracket, while the new docking stations were 2 prong. 

So one intern was changing a customers dock out for them and got to the monitor part. They spent about 10 mins out at the customers desk working on it before deciding to go for help. So they lugged this monitor and docking ststion all the back to our lab and asked the other 3 interns. So the four interns struggle to man handle this monitor into place with no avail. So they ask a full time tech to come take a look, the full time tech struggles with it for a good 10 minutes before asking the department boss to come take a crack at it. The boss struggles for another 10 minutes and gives up.

So at this point it has been about 2 hours from the begining of the original dock install and no one can attach the monitor. It is at this point that intern number one, realizes the error of our ways. He points out the prong difference and we all dismiss him saying something along the lines of ""That shouldn't affect this."" Needless to say we struggled for at least another hour before realizing that intern number 1 was right.

On my own time, I learned a lot about web development with Django and JavaScript, and I was able to land a solid internship over this past summer. Although personal projects are pretty cool to build, I find myself not liking the computer science major much at all. Studying things behind the practice of coding in a class environment is just not that interesting to me, and it seems like every day in my CS classes are kind of a drag. It's impacting my ability to do well in school.

The problem now is...what should I major in now?
I still absolutely love doing math, if that helps with an answer."
1mh5r3,1,2013-09-15,"How to ask for a much-deserved raise? I'm shy and have difficulty being forward about things like these, so any help will be much appreciated.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mh5r3/how_to_ask_for_a_muchdeserved_raise_im_shy_and/,"I know this question's been asked many, many times before, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to post my case. Please bear with me, this can get a little whiny.

I work for a wholesale apparel company as a production assistant. Initially my manager was handling everything himself, realized that he needed an assistant, and that's where I came in--when I started to learn the ropes, he began to push his responsibilities on me and I was expected to do some of his work in addition to my own (he claims that it was to ""make me stronger"" and give me experience). Later another manager was hired, which made things better, kind of, but I still have a lot on my plate. I kept my mouth shut because I thought I'd be rewarded in due time. But during the past couple of months I've been stressed out of my mind, and my body is showing it--hair falling out, skin problems, packed on some extra pounds, etc.

Initially I got this job through a friend, who told me that I would be making $500 a week, which was a lot better than what I was making as a part-timer. Art history majors aren't exactly marketable... so I was grateful for whatever I got. Once I go in for an interview, the owner tells me I'll be given $400. And I accepted instead of fighting, because I'm dumb and naive and really needed a job (and thought I'd be denied the position if I said otherwise).

I've gotten two ""raises"" since then and I've been working there for almost six months--finally got to the amount I was originally told I would receive ($500 weekly) but after doing calculations I realized I'm making $10/hour. No benefits, and federal/state taxes aren't taken out. It was only recently that I started getting paid overtime (er, twice), and even then the higher-ups were hesitant to pay me even though I'm working AT LEAST ten hours daily with barely any break time (they provide lunch, but since I work in a high-paced atmosphere I get maybe five minutes in between hours to check my phone, my personal e-mail, etc.).

My friend usually got raises with me since we started working around the same time... but recently the owner told him that we'd both be getting raises. That was two weeks ago, and my friend is shocked that I still haven't gotten one (the owner told him not to tell me, so he didn't bring up the subject until recently). My friend decides to casually ask whether my salary has been increased along with his, so as to not tread on toes--and the owner denies ever saying that I would get a raise. 

My friend is much younger than me, and decided to work instead of going to college. I am a college graduate with internships and job experience under my belt (not that my resume is relevant to my current work, but still). He works in sales, directly under the owners. I work in a different department, and since my first manager quit I'm preparing for the amount of work he's left behind until someone new comes in to take his place (they're also hesitant about hiring someone new, though, even though the owners each bought million-dollar homes for themselves). I come to work on time and leave late. My friend works hard, but he's a little less punctual, and takes breaks accordingly. Sometimes it gets to a point where he has nothing to do, and helps me out a bit with MY work because I have so much shit to do.

Now, I know it would be better to find a new job, but I'm kind of trapped--I have to pay rent, student loans, eat--and since my costs are greater than my income, I have a credit card bill that's bigger than my savings and checking account combined. I'd have less than a month to find a new position, but I'm scared that the job market will be just as scarce as it was before I entered this terrible company.

So, Redditors... how to ask for a raise? I'm very hardworking but not the most aggressive person. I don't hate my job, and I actually like the people I work with (I hate the bosses, though). The only reason why I've decided to do this is because I realized that there is absolutely NO ONE who will stand up and do the job for me. I'm sick of not being able to pay bills and having my youth sucked out of me... I'm only 23, but I'm tired and exhausted and depressed all the time.

I'm reluctant to throw my manager under the bus (about how he pushed his tasks onto me earlier on), even though I really want to, and bring my co-worker/friend into the equation. He says I should do whatever it takes to get what I deserve, but...  conscience. Also, I don't want to hurt his reputation. Should I wait and see if they'll realize my worth, or should I address this problem ASAP?

Please help. And sorry for the deluge of text.

TL;DR My company treats me like crap (AKA like an unpaid intern), but I don't know what to do about it."

I've always had VERY low self confidence and thus I haven't applied to any big names in Silicon Valley. It is my dream, however. I usually program the following languages: (C, C++, PHP, C#, Java, JS, Python, Ruby) and I'm learning Clojure in my spare time. My github is mostly filled with little AI toy projects from my undergrad work.

I got out of college and decided to work at a small start-up as a web developer. Because our prototype was in PHP, we've done the whole project in PHP. I'm afraid that if I continue working for this company, I won't be able to get a job at one of my ""dream"" companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook)

My question is, if I have a year of professional PHP experience, 2 internships, a research assistantship and a B.S. in CS, will I still be able to get into one of these big tech companies or have I ""missed the boat""? 

If I HAVE missed the boat, should I go back to school and get a master's degree? I really love machine learning and would love to study it for 2 years. I feel like going back to school might ""reset"" my marketability to these large companies. Is this a good course of action?"

[Why is season 8 of dexter carp?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5tv1?context=5)|Couple of reasons.  they broke the code with the audience.  it's so important to keep the rules in place when doing a show like that. also... i'm not there anymore!
[Hey Clyde! I was wondering what you thought about the Dexter/Hannah love story that has seemed to become the main focus of the show. Do you like it? Dislike it? Does it seem forced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6i6y?context=5)|Gotta say, it feels a bit forced to me.  i know what they're going for.  not sure it works as well as it could have.
[I just finished season 3 and I keep telling my buddies how Dexter would slice up heisenburg so quick, but I am about to get into Season 4 which people just nut their pants about... really disappointed I know all the big suprises going forward but you guys put together one hell of a show!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca79qy?context=5)|Even though you know the big reveals, the show is still amazing. you'll love it. 
[I read somewhere that John Lithgow was told the whole Trinity arc before  he was even hired in order to get him to agree to the part. Had Lithgow turned down the part, do you think you would have recast the part of Trinity or would you have rewritten the Season 4 plot completely?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6tgl?context=5)|I personally pitched the whole trinity story arc to john lithgow in a conference room at his agent's office.  i talked for an hour.  no notes. when i finished, he stood up dramatically (as he does) and said 'i'll do it!' i said he had some conflicts in timing.  he said 'forget that stuff. i'm in!' that's how it happened.
[Hey, next time you run into Scott Buck, could you do this for us?: Link to imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccacuhk?context=5)|I'm so not engaging on this one!
[One thing on the minds of a lot of Dexter fans is how low the quality of the show dipped when you stepped down as show runner.  With many particularly viewing seasons 6 and 8 as particularly atrocious, Since you were so invested in the first half of the show, what is your opinion on the direction the show has taken, and if you were show runner again what would your vision have been for post-season 4 Dexter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5zed?context=5)|I agree the show has slipped.  i had a great idea for the end of dexter that i never got to pitch.  too much to go into now.  also, you have to see the final episode before i can comment on it.
[Doakes was a great character and was truly missed on the show..Was there ever any talk about keeping him around and how hard was it to kill him off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca75u5?context=5)|Doakes, played by erik king, was a terrific character and a truly great guy. just saw him at comicon in august.  it was a tough decision to kill him off.  but this is the big leagues; and we wanted the audience to know we meant business.  it's a tough world out there and there are casualties. james doakes was a casualty of the fact that he was on to dexter and had to be dealt with.
[Any regret not saving the Bay Harbor Butcher FBI pursuit for later in the series?  It would undoubtedly have been a significantly better way for this series to go out...you know, with actual tension.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccacb3u?context=5)|No regrets.  you always have to tell your best story as soon as you can and not save anything.  you just have to trust that you'll come up with something better down the line.
[As a film major I will take that as a lesson thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccaf38k?context=5)|Well, i disagree with my friend vince.  i'm all for getting the best stuff out there quickly, then just doing better and better.
[If you know how Buck and crew end Dexter... could you at least tell us if it is an ending you are satisfied with for a character you brought to life so well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6j44?context=5)|The ending that buck and crew came up with is satisfying to me and i think will be satisfying to the viewer as well.  it's pretty powerful.
[What's your opinion - compared with season 1-4 - on the evolution of Debra's character and the confusing and complicated relationship she has with his brother Dexter? (Sorry if there are spelling mistakes, English is not my native language\) Thank you anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca8buz?context=5)|I think that the whole debra storyline was inevitable.  the writers just couldn't keep her in the dark any longer. that said, i wasn't thrilled with her whole downward spiral into near insanity.  but it's all about choices and those were the choices they made.  but the way, your english is perfect.
[Love Dexter. Which was your favorite episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca744a?context=5)|I have two favorite episodes:  the trinity thanksgiving episode. and the final episode where dexter kills trinity and comes home to that horrific discovery.
[Do you think Quinn is kind of a one dimensional character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabsol?context=5)|Sadly, i kind of agree.
[But his character has so much to do!  Like this season. He didn't want to become sergeant.  Then Angel convinced him to try to be sergeant. Then he tried to become sergeant.  Then the black woman who's only job on the show was to become sergeant over Quinn became sergeant over Quinn. Then she or the subplot completely disappeared and were never heard from again.  You call that one dimensional? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccapmw4?context=5)|Appreciate the irony.
[How would you have solved this problem? To me it feels that something has gone wrong with the way this character was used, especially in season 6-7. Now they seem to be flashing him out, giving him redeeming qualities but it feels a bit late. Doing this earlier would he have become a more satisfying character? Using him to his function (teased in S5\) would have made a change? And one more question: Did you have any idea or goal of what to achieve in the future with this character when he first appeared in season 3? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccafuap?context=5)|I created the quinn character.  originally he was going to be a new foil for dexter, after drakes.  and a love interest for deb.  part of it worked.  part didn't.  again, it's not bricklaying.  it's always a moving target.
[What the hell happened? Do they even care about good story anymore, or just putting out the first thing that comes to their heads?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5yow?context=5)|If you're asking about dexter, the mix in the writing room changed significantly.  it's still a really hard job to put out a good tv show.
[I guess, but I mean, that treadmill scene? Come on.  Edit: But otherwise, props to your input for the first four seasons, they were fantastic :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca652u?context=5)|Thanks so much.  didn't really know we had such a hit on our hands. it all kind of blew up in a really great way.  right show for the right time i guess.
[Would you say antiheroes have become more prevalent on TV and if so why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5vyu?context=5)|Yes antiheroes are definitely more prevalent on tv.  not just dexter, breaking bad, tony soprano, mad men.  characters with deep flaws are more interesting to watch, to write... and are more like us.
[Can you comment on why you, Daniel Cerone, and Melissa Rosenberg all left Dexter when you did (I think Daniel left after season 2\)?  How much creative control did you have over Dexter? How much creative control did Showtime have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca9iub?context=5)|Daniel left after season 2 because he had an offer to run a show on cbs. melissa left because she had written ALL of the 'twilight' movies and it was time for her to move on. i left because i was shooting and living in l.a. and my family was in the east.  it was time to be with my wife and daughter. i had significant creative control on dexter.  but i also had partners and showtime.  as i said below:  best idea wins.  not about ego.  about results.
[Hello Clyde! I'm a huge fan of Dexter. Season 4 is one of the most entertaining and devastating collection of episodes in the history of television, and I believe that it was a huge part of forming what people are now calling ""the golden age of television."" So thank you so much for your influence!  My question is, as I'm sure many would like to know, if you were still the show runner for the final season of Dexter, how would it be different from the actual final season? Would it be the same? And if you could safely answer this, how would your version of Dexter end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca63e7?context=5)|Thanks so much for the kind words.  i agree about the fourth season. actually, the writers guild and variety magazine came up with a list of the 101 best written tv shows OF ALL TIME and dexter was on the list. can't comment on the last episode just yet as it's airing this sunday.
[I saw you comment on the very end of Dexter. Could you please set our minds at ease and let us know that none of the ""leaks"" are legit?  Did you ever do controlled leaks to throw fans off?  How the hell did you keep Rita's death a secret from everyone else on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6ypm?context=5)|Not sure what the leaks are that are out there. never did controlled leaks.  i respect the fans too much. as for rita's death.  i wrote a false ending for the crew and cast, so it wouldn't be leaked.  the real ending only was in my computer until we were ready to shoot.  the network and others had to actually come to my office and read it on my monitor.
[Well, one states Quinn becomes the new Dexter, one states Matthews has known everything all along, kills Dexter, and raises Harrison and Harrsion sees a ghost Dexter at the end, and one states that for reasons as of yet unknown, Dexter kills  Deb.  Did  you actually shoot the false ending or was it enough that it was written in the script?  Would you ever consider doing a screen play for a movie, or is it just too hard to tell your amazing stories in such a limited time?  Thank you so much for the responses!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca75ds?context=5)|Can't comment on the leaks.  but they're basically bs. we never shot the false ending. i've done several screenplays.  mostly uncredited production rewrites on scripts before they start shooting.  talking with my agent now about the screen version of 'unthinkable'. thanks so much.
[Now you have left me with a tough decision, lol. Read *Unthinkable* or hold out for the movie and go in blind...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7jme?context=5)|Definitely read unthinkable.  the movie is years away and i wouldn't want to deprive you of the pleasure of reading a great book!
[Done. Will pick it up tonight after work. Can't wait.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7nqd?context=5)|Thanks so much.  if your store doesn't have it. you can always get it from amazon.
[When the current writers state that they have had the end for Dexter ""in mind"" since the beginning, Is that an end thought up by the writers at the start and followed by current writers? Or what does that mean exactly? Was there an outline of the story arc from the beginning at all, but of course could be stretched or shortened due to not knowing the amount of seasons?(to your knowledge of course\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7iqq?context=5)|When we started the show, we didn't know how it was going to end. when i left after four years, we still didn't know how it was going to end. so there was no outline or arc that charted the course they're taking now.
[I hope you're still answering questions. Thanks for your work on Dexter. Seasons 1-4 are my favorite ever seasons of TV.  Wikipedia says you joined Dexter mid-way through season 1. Is this correct? You wrote episode 2 'Crocodile', so I couldn't understand how that could be true. I thought you were writer and showrunner for the entire first season except for the pilot.  Did you enjoy working on Dexter? I assume it was exhausting, so is that why you left?  What work did you do as a 'consultant' on Dexter? How involved have you been with the show since you took that role? Did you only have this role for season 5, or do you still have that job?  Daniel Cerone was credited as the second-top writer on the show, after yourself, for seasons 1-3, but did he actually work on season 3 (the Prado season\)? I ask because there were reports that he left the show after season 2, and he didn't write any episodes that season.  Does John Goldwyn still work on the show? He's still credited as Executive Producer along with Colleton, but since season 6 we haven't seen him do any interviews or Comic-Con panels, while Colleton still does.  Was Lundy ever actually suspicious of Dexter, or was that just Dexter/us being paranoid?  When you made the decision to kill Rita off, did you have future seasons in mind? Were you trying to envision storylines for future seasons, and believed that Dexter would be better off on his own again? Or, was killing Rita about making the best and most dramatic season 4 you possibly could?  While writing season 4, did you know that it would be your last season on the show? If not, did you have any vague plans for what would happen in season 5?  Thanks again for one of the best TV series ever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccaaxee?context=5)|Okay, that's a lot of questions. i'll answer a few. wikipedia is wrong.  i was showrunner on all episodes of the first four seasons.  i love working on the show.  yeah, it was exhausting.  but it was an amazing ride.  cerone did not work on 3.  goldwyn was involved til the end.  the thing about killing rita was showing to dexter that what he does, what he can't help doing, has consequences.  and that he can never really have a normal life.  i knew near the very end of 4 that i was leaving for sure.
[If you were still showrunner of Dexter, what other themes would you have explored?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca871p?context=5)|I would want to go deeper on dexter discovering his own humanity.  or realizing that he'll never be fully humanized; and what's the psychological cost of that?
[What do you do in a ""writer's block""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca63ft?context=5)|Because i have to keep writing to make a living, i'm blessed with not having writers block. i know now that often not writing is part of writing and i just go with it.
[ also what are the greatest difference between a good idea for a script and for a book? I'm not talking about writing, that part is obviously very distinct, but the ""raw story"" itself. Like what would make a story ""good for a show"" but not for a book and the other way around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca63ft?context=5)|As for difference in ideas for book or series:  a series has to have what we call 'legs'. how can it sustain audience interest for many years. a book, even 'unthinkable' is often conceived for the reader to enjoy in one sitting.
[What kind of research did you guys do for the Dexter character? I was a social worker and have some experience with very disturbed sociopaths, and you got his psychopathology pretty bang on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7hqa?context=5)|Thanks.  there are several serial killer books out there.  i read a few.  my staff read them all. also, dexter is based on a novel called 'darkly dreaming dexter' and jeff lindsay, the writer, gave us a pretty solid template.
[Do you remember which books you used?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7kq8?context=5)|No.  sorry, it was a long time ago. i can tell you this, though, they were disturbing as hell. 
[If you were asked to do ""one more season"" of Dexter as the *real* ""final season"" for maybe Netflix or something like that - maybe a movie, would you do it (and possibly get most of the original team back together\)?  Link to www.reddit.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabig3?context=5)|Thanks for asking. but that ship has sailed for me.  i've moved on creatively with my books and other stuff i have in the works.
[:(  What if they uhm, they gave you a lot of...uh...money?  Or uh.  ***ANYTHING, PLEASE DO SOMETHING. SAVE US.***  *i've moved on creatively with my books.*  What if you write a Dexter book with permission of everyone (lol @ this happening\) that would be titled ""How It Should Have Ended: Dexter"" which takes place right after season 4 and details the true ending of the show?  EDIT 2: What about a mini-season that takes place right after season 4 that wraps everything up as the true final season, even if it is only like 6 episodes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccaep5g?context=5)|They offered me a ton of money.  it wasn't about that.  i wanted to be with my wife and daughter in the east.  no regrets.
[What are some shows / writers that have influenced you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6oj3?context=5)|Well, it really goes back to the original golden age.  so, paddy chayefsky, rod serling, reginald rose.  and then steven bochco, david milch, damon lindelhof, vince gilligan.  so many good writers out there.
 |In books, it'd be dashiell hammett, raymond chandler, michael connelly, dennnis lehane, lee child.
 |X-files, hill street, sopranos, all in the family, simpsons, breaking bad, lost (yes, lost), so many.
[How do you think Dexter would have been had Deb discovered Dexter and Lumen at the end of season five instead of the end of season six? What would you have done if maybe upon Deb's discovery, Lumen may have shot Deb that instant ala Todd from 'Breaking Bad'? Should things have been set in a running train like motion after your season instead of stalling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7i5t?context=5)|It's always a challenge to know how fast to go, how much story to eat up. hard for me to comment further as i didn't do the seasons you're referring to.

[Clyde, thanks for taking the time to do an AMA.  I’m just going to get this right out of the way, and I’m sure what’s on a lot of people’s minds – what happened to Dexter after you left?  Lazy writing (no computer having a password, no house having a security system. Dexter being able to hack into someone’s computer by using a 2-way spyware program. Harrison’s epic fail fall on the treadmill\)  Not grounding Dexter (emotionally or otherwise\) after the season 4. Elevating him to “superhero” status.  Formulaic and predictable writing (People called the ending to season 6, two episodes in\)  Never resolving story arcs that were started (Quinn’s suspicions, Deb “loving” Dexter\)  Short-lived, pointless story-arcs that had undeserving endings (Sirko’s death in season 7, Louis’s death in season 7\)  Useless characters (Masuka’s daughter\) that don’t belong in a final season.  No sense of impending doom or closure for a final season. Writers trying to cram in points/characters they never had a chance to explore (Dexter having a mother figure in Vogel\)  A general dumbing down of the show (especially characters like Quinn and Batista\)  What are your thoughts on the above? How much of Dexter going downhill so fast has to do with switching show runners from you to Chip, and then to Scott? How much say did MCH have, if any? Do you think it was a mistake to give season 2 a “series finale” feeling? Is Showtime to blame at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccajiiz?context=5)|First of all, i agree with most of what you have to say above. it could be argued, that my leaving had a deleterious effect on the show. but i would never say that, though others have.  mch is the sort of actor and man who trusts the writers and goes about his work brilliantly and professionally.  showtime was part of every big story decision that was made.  
[What do you think made Dexter a sociopath? His mother's death? Harry constantly telling him he was permanently damaged? Something else? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabv3x?context=5)|It's a big salad of what you mentioned.  remember, he watched his mother being murdered, then say in her blood in that container for days. how can you ever get away from that?
[Season 9?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5xyj?context=5)|Season 8 is the last season of dexter.  final episode this sunday night. it will have been the longest running scripted one hour show in cable history.  some of it was actually great.  john lithgow year for example. very proud of that.
[Introducing an insane central plot dynamic that blindsides people (like, say, a woman suddenly realizing she's been in love with her foster brother her whole life\)  OR.

[So, is there anything you like or were surprised by that you hadn't thought of in the seasons of Dexter that you didn't handle?  Favorite non-Trinity story in the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccac358?context=5)|Favorite non-trinity moment is the last episode of the first season. that was amazing. the way the show ends this sunday night is pretty cool. not what i would have done, but cool nonetheless.
[Do you have a process that differs when you write different genres?!  Mysteries as opposed to say comedies? I won't reveal anything but the plot and resolution of Unthinkable was insanely satisfying. Do you have to work backwards, outline differently? Very curious. Thanks ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6ia8?context=5)|It's kind of the same for both.  first of all i outline the hell out of everything.  usually i know the ending and work backward from there. that's how it's been for everything i've written.  with 'unthinkable' i was lucky enough to know the very beginning and the very ending at the same time.  then the tough stuff came: filling it in!
[Hello Mr. Phillips. Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. Can you share one behind-the-scenes humorous story regarding Dexter or Deb? Something ad-lib and off the cuff? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccac9vn?context=5)|The thing i love about working with michael and jennifer is that they'll be doing some really heavy, demanding scene.  we'll then be relighting and they'll come over and hang and tell jokes and screw around.  then when the set is ready for them, they go back to the heavy demanding stuff without missing a beat.  i really respect that.

[Television is a really collaborative medium. but as the showrunner, you must have a lot of power to make final decisions. do you find your strength to be pushing your own ideas through, or working with others to get their ideas in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7qwa?context=5)|It's always 'best idea wins'.  so, it's not about ego, it's about the final product.  it's my responsibility to make it the best it can be, no matter whose ideas come to the fore.  when i'm doing a book like 'unthinkable', i have final say on everything.  but i still listen to my writer friends and to my editor.

Thank you for giving us those seasons.  I just have a small question. When you wrote that last scene of the season 4 finale with Harrison in it, did you have plans (even vague ones\) about making Harrison a major character at one point and maybe even introducing him to Dexter's dark world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabvs6?context=5)|Thanks for your kind words. we toyed with a couple of things for harrison.  but it never got past thw 'what if' stage.  really, it never went beyond just yakking about it.
[Hello Clyde Love Nurse Jackie gotta catch up on the last season before the new one starts.  Is watching Dexter this last year been as frustrating to you as for most of the fans?  If you tell the writers something to change what would be?  What is your current favorite shows on TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca8mlq?context=5)|You'll love last season of nurse jackie. yeah, it's frustrating watching dexter. but i made the choice to leave and i appreciate how hard everyone's working. about changing something on the show: it would be about keeping the code more intact.  it's a covenant with the audience. my new favorite show is 'ray donovan'.  just love it.

[Correct me if i'm wrong but you wrote 4 episodes of Dexter than Produced another 44 episodes. Did you actually have a lot of creative input being a producer (executive producer and consultant according to imdb\)?

[Dexter Seasons 1-4 were pretty awesome, 5 was ok, and 6-8 have just been abysmal.  What was the point of having a Subplot with Quinn getting passed over for a promotion only to never have that character on TV again? Why did LaGuerta get a bench?  Why did Dexter park next to the Brain Surgeon when he was following him and then literally stand outside a coffee shop staring at him for an hour?  Do you think James Remar despises what his role has become (The ""Say out loud what Dexter is doing role\)  Honestly Clyde, I'm so angry about how my favorite show turned into my least favorite show that I'm going to sell my DVD's, cancel showtime, and boycott everything Scott Buck does for the rest of his life.

I decided to go back to school for another bachelor's degree in CS. My first bachelor degree is in Japanese studies. That turned out to be fruitless. 

Here are the two programs I am considering. I live in New York (Staten Island), and would like to be able to commute to school, as well as keep the cost down. So I am considering these two CUNY programs:

[CCNY Grove School of Engineering](http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/compsci/)

or

[City Tech](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/academics/deptsites/cst/btech.aspx)

I'm heavily leaning towards CCNY's program for its ABET accreditation and course selection. It looks like a more well rounded and Computer Science specific major. The only issue is: they are currently imposing many requirements to even begin the major, and even though I am currently finishing them up now, they won't let me apply for the school while I am finishing the requirements, so I will lose a whole semester of potential work. 

This isn't the worst thing in the world. I may be able to even get an internship with my friend doing Python and Django work, so that would be fine. But I would really like to start on this degree.

So, does anyone else know of a good, low-cost, yet reputable school where I can get a good CS education? I really want to go in to some AI courses so those are a plus, and the better the school is at placement in internships the better. 

I appreciate any help or insight anyone can give. 

Thanks.  "

**Victim Rate Skyrockets**

As the number of night victims continues to climb, the town council has **mandated** the upgrade of wooden planks to metal ones used to board up ALL housing entrances. Housing entrances include doors, windows, pet screen doors and any semblance of holes that enable entrance into your home. We emphasize that this upgrade is mandatory effective September 16th, 2013. The deadline to perform this mandatory upgrade is Friday, September 20th and any house found with any trace of wooden boards during the daily twilight sweep will be marked with the scarlet X. Members of the household will be quarantined in the town lock-up for 100 days and 99 nights. The mandatory metal planks can be found at any convenience store near your house. The old wooden planks must be left out by the night of Friday September 20th for Special Removal Services to pick up. The town council has also issued a reminder to strengthen the salt circles around your house. P&amp;G's Lunascence 1-Gallon Salt Gels are highly recommended over the regular crystal salts. These too can be found at any convenience store in Crescentville. 
***

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

Effective September 16th 2013, curfew time is changed from 6 P.M. (1800 hours) to 5 P.M. (1700 hours). The sirens will begin at five o'clock sharp and end precisely after half an hour. Begin bolting your locks and boarding up the entrances *before* the sirens end. Anyone caught outside your houses after the sirens have stopped and the entrances have been boarded MUST contact Crescentville's Special Night Armed Forces immediately. The precinct will dispatch cruisers to your rescue right away. But we urge you to please abide to curfew times. Be *inside* a building at least 15 minutes before the sirens begin. Start the Bolt and Board procedure early. The earlier you are locked away inside a building, the safer you are. In this battle against the night people, precaution is key.

**JOB LISTING:**

1. Special Night Armed Forces Intern - With the increasing number of night people hauntings, the SNAF is recruiting interns for vigorous training against these entities. Capable candidates will be hired right away. Pay is negotiable and adjustable to your qualifications. Any able bodies welcome. Individuals with previous military and combat experience will be placed in high priority. 
Any interested candidates should report to the Special Night Armed Forces headquarters on Tomken and Kennedy Drive anytime in the day. Memorize SNAF Mission Statement and Risk Oath before reporting to HQ. 

2. Science Center Student Researchers - In the midst of the night crisis, teams in the Science Center are urgently trying to construct a temporary machine that emit sun rays to counteract the night. We urge any students with appropriate qualifications to come forth and offer assistance with the creation of the Solar Machine. Apply on the Scientific Developments section of the Crescentville Website. 
***

Our deepest condolences to all the families of night victims, including Mayor Ernest Willower, whose daughter Jennifer Willower is included in this week's victim count. The weekly mass memorial will be held in Crescentville Cemetery on Saturday mornings as usual. Visitation hours are from noon to 4 P.M. (1600 hours). The cemetery MUST be evacuated before night falls. Mourn your loved ones, but let them be a reminder to be ever vigilant in these dark times. Evening soccer practice and any kind of outdoor activities after dark are canceled for the rest of the year as winter approaches. This winter will be a harsh one, with longer nights and colder winds, conditions in which the night people thrive. Children are more susceptible to the night people. Keep them inside throughout the winter. 

Until the next issue, be safe and be well. "

Last year, I interned at a NPR affiliate radio station producing, editing and writing stories for air. Over the course of my one-year internship, I had about 18 pieces that made it on the radio. I also interned at another nationally syndicated radio show (recently ranked in the Top 100 iTunes podcast) at the same time. I edited interviews with big named celebrities and eventually got to produce interviews and fill in as a producer a couple times. 

I thought I produced some good work and submitted some of my radio pieces for awards. This year, I ended up winning 4 journalism awards, one of them being a national award from the Associated Press.

After winning these awards and having 2 years of internship experience, I thought I would be able to find an entry-level job. The only job I landed after my internships was a position as a writers' assistant in reality tv. The only reason I got it was because I knew someone who worked at the company. I worked there for 6 months and was laid-off this past summer when the show's production ended. 

Since then, I have applied to at least 10 jobs a day (no exaggeration) and only landed about four interviews, three of them being out of state. I produce radio pieces for practice and attend professional radio meet-ups to network and show off my work. I also have contacted almost every single one of my past employers asking for help. 

With every day passing, I can't help but feel more helpless. I'm not sure if I should continue on my career path as a radio journalist or if I should go back to school for computer programming or something lucrative. I feel like I've done everything I could and I don't know what to do next.

A little background which may or may not be relevant but maybe helps you understand where I'm coming from:  I've been coding off and on (mostly off) for about seven years -- I wrote a couple of programs in Perl in college to handle large data sets and process batches of gene files, then about a year and a half ago, I started slowly learning JavaScript and Ruby with the intent of getting out of science research and changing into development as a career field, but through all of this, I was more or less only doing very small things (I built [this](http://platespotting.herokuapp.com)!  Yes, I know it's silly.), no big involved projects.  About six months ago, I got into a competitive development internship where we were thrown headfirst into a production environment with an extant code base for a huge website (I helped build a homebrew CMS in Python/Django, with flecks of JS here and there).  It was definitely a learning experience, and I'm now in a position where the internship is over and am job-hunting/building my skills.  

So here's the thing -- from the very beginning, I was using a lot of tools that I'd never ever even knew existed, much less used before.  I became reasonably competent at operating most of them, but in the rush to develop my hard programming skills and pick up basic conceptual stuff (I majored in molecular biology, minored in math, so a lot of CS stuff is foreign to me), I never really got a grasp on *why* we used a lot of things.  I am fairly certain I used a Debian 6 Squeeze x64 base Vagrant box with some custom modifications.  I used VirtualBox to manage a few different virtual machines.  But... why?  

So, now, while I'm trying to build my overall skills and have unhindered time while I job hunt, I want to understand more about the why/when things like that are useful.  What circumstances would one want to build virtual machines for working on projects instead of just using the native environment?  When you do decide you want to use something like that, how do you know what environment you want to use, and what is specifically appealing about using something like Vagrant when VirtualBox seems to give you access to a virtual environment without another layer of abstraction?  I've got a lot to learn, but I think completely understanding what I have been working with and become somewhat familiar with is a good stepping stone.  Thanks for reading all of this and thanks in advance for your answers -- I am just knowledgeable enough to know that I know essentially nothing, so, really, any guidance y'all might have on things that an intermediate beginner would find useful for developing relevant skills would be welcomed.

**tl;dr: Why do we use Vagrant/VirtualBox/virtual environments in general?  How do you decide when/which to use for what kinds of projects?  Help a sister out.**  "

I am currently a pre-junior (our school operates on a five year timeline with three co-op cycles, hence why I call it a pre-junior instead of just junior, even though I am entering my third year this October) studying computer engineering. I did my first co-op (which are six month ""internships"", and I quote the internship because it's technically six months of full time work, though no full-time benefits) at a webDev/eCommerce company. All of the work was programming-based, and though I initially chose CE for its hardware and software potentials, it's safe to say I fell in love with working with software. My second co-op I will be working on both hardware and software, so we will see how that goes.

I am currently thinking long-term (it's that time of my life :P) prospects, and the netsec discipline has been fascinated me for some time.

The questions I bring on the table pertains to co-ops/internships for netsec companies:

1. What is it like working for a network security company?

2. What type of knowledge/skills is absolutely necessary for employment for a netsec firm?

3. How much do you learn on the job?

4. How does a college student like me whom is interested in a co-op with these companies start networking? Get experience?

I do have a preference for companies - at that is small-to-midsized firms. Teams should be small, focused around talented people working together. Passion is very important to me, as you can say I find the passion and enthusiasm of people very contagious. It seems for the netsec industry, small-to-midsized firms shouldn't be an issue, as most firms *are* small to midsized. Would you consider antivirus companies like Norton to be a ""netsec"" company?

Thanks for the help.

1mmgd8,0,2013-09-18,Trouble with my major,JosephStylin,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mmgd8/trouble_with_my_major/,"Right now I'm a sophomore studying industrial engineering.  I originally intended to study mechanical, but I didn't make the cut.  Before college, the only two majors I was deciding between were engineering and cinematography.  Engineering because I had an interest in middle school which kind of diminished throughout highschool, and cinematography because I am actually interested in it.  The only reason I chose engineering was because it was more financially stable.  My first semester went pretty well, I managed a 3.4 with the effort I put in.  However, my effort level and motivation has significantly decreased since then, and the difficulty of my courses has increased.  In my spring semester I pledged a fraternity which ended up consuming a lot of time and I ended up being on the edge for many classes, failing to complete all of my homeworks, and holding myself to a much lower standard than my fall semester.  I also suffered from a general lack of motivation to get my shit done because after succeeding my first semester I thought I could just cruise through, which was a pretty dumb mistake.  But I also took my first college physics course and struggled pretty hard.  My main issue was that even when I did go to lecture I couldn't pay attention because I just didn't care.  I literally had 0 interest in what I was doing.  It was kind of like I was going to class for the grade and not for the education.  I'm still doing this now.  My spring semester I pulled a 2.1 GPA.  I was on the verge of getting a C in 4 classes and I got a C in all 4 of those class.

I had an internship over the summer where I worked in a manufacturing plant.  I honestly didn't really do that much because I wasn't motivated at all and due to a lack of interest, granted what I was doing was pretty menial and bitchwork.  

On to the point I'm looking for advice for.  I'm about 4 weeks into my 3rd semester and its starting to look like my spring semester all over again.  Everytime I go to class I can't pay attention because I legitimately hate it.  I hate all of my homework and I hate all of my curriculum.  I don't have an ounce of interest in what I'm doing.  The only motivation I have is to get a degree so I can make money and not be a failure but at this point my hatred for my course work is overriding that motivation.  I'm still trying to get all my work done, but I'm taking every shortcut I can and missing out on a lot of information which basically ends up setting me back when exams come around the corner and I find out I don't really know anything, and then I get stressed as fuck and hate my life.  Now exams are rolling around and they won't stop.  My spring semester I had an exam pretty much every week for about 2 months straight and it was awful, and now that shits about to start again and I'm not sure I can make it through without fucking up.  I know I need to get organized and get my shit together but at what cost.

I need to figure out soon whether or not I should continue down this path or make a life course change and go into cinematography where I won't have a guaranteed paycheck but at least I won't hate my life.  My main concern is that I feel like shit for wasting my parents money like this when I know its tight, but I also don't want to fuck up by making the wrong career choice and be depressed for the rest of my life.  I was a straight A student in highschool so the motivation for success was there at some point.  

Should I stick with it and stop being a pussy or reconsider how I'm choosing to live the rest of my life?  Honestly at this point I feel like some anonymous opinions will help me.  Obviously I'm going to talk with my parents at some point, I just want a level head before I discuss this with them.  I did briefly discuss it over the summer and I ended up deciding to give it another shot after my internship, but now that I'm back in the same situation I feel like I may have made a big mistake.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far.  Any input is appreciated.

tl;dr I'm a baby back bitch teenager that has the same life problem everyone else does "
1mm5dl,2,2013-09-17,[For hire] Computer Science student looking for work in field full-time,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1mm5dl/for_hire_computer_science_student_looking_for/,"I am a student in a Computer Science program who is hoping to put my knowledge to work. I take night and online classes, so that leaves me open for daytime schedules. For my other education, I have a Masters and Bachelors of Science in the Planning and Environmental Fields. In the long run, I hope to work in something technical that merges all the education together. I would like to get experience in the technical field though as that is my primary aim career-wise. I am also interested in cybersecurity.

For work experience, I have designed web pages for businesses freelance and also helped them with some IT stuff freelance as well. I have done government internships for cities and state. My last job was customer service for the State and now I am in need of work that is a better fit for my goals.
For my skills, I am gaining experience with Networking, Java, and Python. I also am learning a bit on SQL when I get time. I have been trained in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) in my past education and in internships.

Thank you for your time. I am reading through many of the job openings and noticed a few have passed so I am posting this now to see what is available so I can get to work soon."
1mm0o1,2,2013-09-17,CS Majors at UCF: I am a graduating high school student seeking advice,jgcoded,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/1mm0o1/cs_majors_at_ucf_i_am_a_graduating_high_school/,"I'm having a hard time choosing which university to attend in Florida. I want to major in Computer Science, and I want to do it at the best school that Florida has to offer Comp Sci-wise. After attaining a bachelors in Computer Science, I will go for a masters in Electrical Engineering.

I like UCF. I've visited the campus many many times, and I have talked to professors and students from the Harris engineering building. Even after talking with these people, I still hold a few questions:


* In your opinion, what sets Comp Sci at UCF apart from any other university?
* By attending UCF, how do you think you have kick-started your career in the CS world?
* What companies visit UCF? In which of these companies do students usually end up employed in? (Whether it be internship, part/full-time)
* What CS related clubs are available to students?
* For those that have graduated: how has graduating in Comp Sci as a knight benefited you over graduating from any other University?


Any other opinions on Computer Science @ UCF - or anything in general about UCF - would be great."

 |I like Nilsey from the Yogscast and Blame Society quite a lot. And Glove and Boots. And Numberphile.
[I listen to the calming music you make to help me fall asleep. It helps me get y grades up at school.  To the question, do you think that your music will be used for weird reasons like mine? Has it happened before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaf748?context=5)|I'm rarely surprised anymore. Yeah.

I choose to deal with it by circumventing the system. I am not a member of any Professional Rights Organizations. I hope that Creative Commons content will one day eclipse the existing copyright content. I basically have no hope to change the bad laws that have evolved over that last century, but I can choose not to participate in them.

So, I made my own... and now they added that in.  I think they're doing a great job!
[2\) What does your audio mastering process entail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaep6n?context=5)|Audio mastering process... yeah... I'm still learning a lot about that. But I love my multi-channel compressors and EQs.

There is always more that I can do to any piece of music, but at some point, you need to let it go and move on.

I've thought about this a lot, and I'm still not really sure. It would be a film, and involve Me, a Director, and another Composer.  
[What music do you generally listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaepzd?context=5)|For fun? I rarely do that. Probably Zimmer soundtracks or early music. Like REALLY early... like Obrecht.
[What software do you prefer to use when you work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaesov?context=5)|My framework is Logic X.

[Which piece that you have produced is your favorite (if you even have one\)?  Also, a massive thank you for livening up so many small productions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaeyja?context=5)|Ah!

Being from an art background, I feel credit for any kind of work is important!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaefyu?context=5)|There was a 10 minute video of a person cleaning a bathroom. Wish I could find that link. It was mesmerizing... and strange.
 |People use my work without crediting quite a lot. It is important to some extent... but having my music exist in another video is more important to me. Well... if it is a good video.

Or do you have real life instruments that you have to play and record?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaflg6?context=5)|Most everything is digital. I'd like to do real recordings, but there are deadlines.
[ of all, you're the man. You're great. My question is: why did you want to make royalty free music? Did it come out of wanting to provide something that wasn't there, for fun, or because you couldn't get a different music job but wanted something involving music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccag56m?context=5)|When I started, the state of music-suitable-for-films was horrible. So I found a need and filled it.
[What happens if you scare someone half to death twice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaehal?context=5)|They would be 3/4 more of the way to death. This is one of Zeno's paradoxes. You can scare people half to death forever, and they'll never actually die.
[Not unless we use the power of *infinite series!*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaf35i?context=5)|Your infinite series are all well and good in Maths, but we live in the real world where an infinite number of serial actions are not possible!

[Who is your biggest inspiration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaehut?context=5)|If this is ""from whom do you steal most often""... probably Holst.
[What was the hardest part about making it into a legitimate business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccahazm?context=5)|There was no hard part. It just evolved over time.

[What is the biggest video in which your music was used?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaeo8q?context=5)|I haven't a clue. How would I even find that info? If anyone knows of videos with more than 100,000,000 views - let me know.
[Last question, I promise! Im only a teenager and I composed this bit of music: Link to m.youtube.com what are your thoughts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccah25l?context=5)|Email me. Critiques take a lot of time. I don't have that time right now. Warning, I probably won't say nice things. You should see the critiques of the music I write. Brutal.

[Which piece are you most proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaegmw?context=5)|Hard to say. I did a piece in 2009 for a Sherlock Holmes production. On my site it is called Ghost Dance. I like that one quite a lot.
[Could you possibly help me with my machinima series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccaewjs?context=5)|Right now, I'm doing 2 short films, a TV pilot, and 5 video games. So - unless you have very very light requirements for scoring... I can't do much for a while. ...and some ringtones. ...plus accordion sing-along night at my bar.
[What piece of yours changed your life most radically? Was there a breakthrough in style, a piece that made significant money and allowed you more freedom in later works, or a particular piece that you just love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mlq82/i_am_kevin_macleod_the_composer_in_millions_of/ccafxwi?context=5)|My tools more than my compositions make the most difference.

[How does being a ratings expert change how you watch TV shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|Honestly it's sort of ruined TV for me, haha. I can tell from the get go which programs will be canceled in the broadcast season, sometimes without even viewing them. The researchers at the broadcast networks likely know this as well, but sometimes networks will throw things on air to either fill space or try to surprise themselves.
[What do you notice in TV shows as a ratings expert?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|Ratings boosts really vary for different shows. I'm sure there are studies out there, but it's really hard to pin down certain specific themes such as a pregnancy in danger that actually HELP shows. You'd have to watch every program and take notes on major and minor plot points. Generally anything you hear like that is based solely on opinion and sometimes used directionally.
[Do you see how different shows try to boost their ratings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|That being said, there are big stops networks will pull to boost ratings. A great example of that is having James Franco guest star on last night's season 2 premiere of Fox's The Mindy Project. They were looking for higher ratings, thinking that their viewer base were James Franco fans, that he is popular enough to help the show, etc. Mindy Show was actually down in the ratings for last night's episode so it clearly didn't work. Whether guest stars or other plots like that help a show depends on how its done and whether a show's audience appreciates it. You never really know until it works... or it doesn't :)
[House MD episodes with flavor of the week celebrities, that sort of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|A lot of decisions made in the television world aren't based on data. Lots of development people push things through to toot their own horns even after us nerds in research warn them against it, and then they wonder why their shows fail. Trust the nerds, damnit!
[A great question and answer. Do you know of any further examples you could share?  Also, are there shows optimised not for a specfic audience (pregnancy in danger / women\) but for a certain geographic reagon (e.g. westcoast\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbpn0q?context=5)|Not as much for regions - that wouldn't be very strategic because then you're only gearing it to a certain part of the country, thus lowering the possibility for higher ratings. I guess one could argue that for any demographic, but I think regional targeting would be a mistake on any network's part.
[I\) nobody bats an eye at extreme violence (think Hannibal\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccaz3lm?context=5)|I think it really has to do with desensitizing. Sure, people watch porn and have sex regularly, but it's not something that's been dealt with by the mainstream media. A good example of this is the MPAA, the ratings council for movies. They'll rate any sort of gory violence (think Saw) with an R, but it's hard to get any sort of overt instances of female sexuality into a movie without nabbing an NC-17 rating. This same phenomenon goes on in TV. When it's not being hammered home in mainstream media every day, the instinct to push it under the rug is reinforced.  I think over the past few seasons especially, broadcast TV has really been pushing its limits with violence - Hannibal is a great example, as is The Following. I couldn't believe some of the shots that were included in both of those shows.
[What ""bad word"" do you think will be censored less in the next 5 years??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccazgx5?context=5)|Gotta go with ""fuck"" on this one. Some shows just NEED that word for emphasis.
 |Fun fact: Breaking Bad is allowed ONE censored 'fuck' per season and they always use it well. If you're a fan, r/breakingbad has a great graphic floating around regarding the scenes it has been used in.
[Link to youtu.be , seems like they use 'fuck' a bunch of times on season one alone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbji9l?context=5)|Talk to my peeps over at r/breakingbad and give them your correction ;)
[With Netflix changing how a Television series is distributed, do you think this will effect the big 4 networks? Also do you think it will have any effect how a TV show is broadcast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccazqb6?context=5)|That's a great question. I think Netflix is changing the tv landscape by a huge margin.
 |1) Networks/distribution companies are working WITH Netflix to make the most out of their shows. When Netflix first became a ""thing,"" I remember a lot of backlash from executives thinking the site would hurt our business. Now its been embraced as something that can help. What happened with Breaking Bad this season is a perfect example of what I like to call the ""Netflix effect"" on certain shows. BB has had record ratings this year, and I attribute that majorly to people catching up on Netflix between seasons - if it hadn't been available so easily, I'm not sure if it would have recruited that many new viewers in its last season.
 |2) Netflix's proprietary shows (House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, etc) are showing up a LOT of programming on cable right now. Those two series are some of the best new programs of the past few years in my opinion.
 |To answer your questions: I don't know if it will effect the big 4 networks, as cable has already effected them so much that I think they're at a plateau. They know they have to start developing better shows or they'll be dead in the water. With the advent of DVRs, pirating of programs, Hulu, Netflix, etc., the push is really still toward the content. Content needs to be produced to show up on those platforms, and the fact of the matter is that the broadcast nets have the money to do it. If anything, I think it'll make their programming better as we now have more options for viewing and the competition is fierce.
 |In terms of how programs are broadcast, I haven't seen any change in that so far, but I know broadcast nets are amping up their summer offerings to complement viewing going on elsewhere (cable, Netflix).
[This. I know behibd closed doors you guys discuss what can and can't happen. What's the reason on this one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccaz7gw?context=5)|There's a certain amount of discussion behind closed doors, yes, but always about sex and not really about violence. The main issue is in my response to Hymen Annihilator (can't believe I just typed those two words together) - what an overarching bureaucratic entity (ie the MPAA) deems as 'acceptable.'
 |Fun fact: Cable TV is actually NOT regulated by the FCC, but is self-governed, so we can really show whatever we want. We don't because a) cable companies have some carriage rules we have to abide by or we run the risk of getting dropped if its persistant, and b) there are lots of interest groups that will inundate us and the cable companies with complaints - that's a major issue. They'll complain about sex but not violence, mostly because they are the sorts of groups that are EXTREMELY conservative socially but don't care about violence.
[In case you're a parent, do (or did\) you enforce the ratings in your home or is (was\) there the occasional ""Meh, gonna let that one slip""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccaznq1?context=5)|I'm not a parent yet, but I will say I don't remember ever having TV or movies censored when I was younger and I turned out just fine. Kids aren't even interested in things people censor them from until an age when their natural curiosity regarding sex and violence comes out anyway. I can sort of get behind the desensitization argument - if a child sees violence over and over again on television, they will be less fazed by it in the future - true. A child can see violence at school and at home as well.
 |I think a lot of problems regarding personal responsibility are blamed on the media, leading to censorship arguments. But, in my opinion, someone who has the capacity to kill/harm another person had that capacity in them regardless of what they've seen on TV or in the movies. 
[How has sex, violence, and drugs changed on TV over the last few decades?  Particularly from a ratings perspective.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0pc0?context=5)|In terms of how it's changed over the past few decades, I think in both television and film, viewers are more likely to accept anything. It has to do with desensitization to both sex and violence - we see it so much that we want more and more for it to continue being interesting to us.
[Do you go into things like what types of actors and actresses get ratings, and what kind of people to cast?  For instance zeeva on NCIS or something.  Do you see ratings play a role in people brought into shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0pc0?context=5)|Before we cast someone in a program or movie, we definitely look into casting. There are entire research firms that deal solely in actors, actresses and television personalities, and how the public sees them and whether or not they're interesting enough. A lot of casting has to do with budget as well. Some actors are more expensive than you'd think, and some are a lot cheaper than you'd think.
[I agree. Until I was around 12 I would gasp and instantly close any window that said anything like sex or gore...Let's say I've gone a complete 180 on one of those.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb420v?context=5)|Hahaha, haven't we all?
[I realize this probably isn't the focus of your thread, but if one wanted to get into entertainment agency/marketing related business, e.g. casting agency, what are the steps/qualifications needed? Is it mostly about knowing the right people and being lucky? Do you have to be in LA? Do you need a degree? How competitive is it to get a job in the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb3hbq?context=5)|I'd say LA, NYC, Chicago (in that order) are the cities you'd need to be in to be successful in casting. I have friends who are in the casting industry and they all started at the bottom through internships or mailrooms and worked their way up.
 |In terms of qualifications, a media degree isn't necessary but I'm positive it would be appreciated. I think experience in previous casting (college theatre, etc) would be extremely valuable as well.
 |Just keep in mind that not everyone knows the right people, sometimes it's just about being in the right place at the right time. Good luck!
[Do the major cable networks really regard Nielsen ratings that much when in today's world there's so many other ways to gauge popularity and success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0bnj?context=5)|Yes, most certainly. It is the #1 factor in deciding a show's fate. Per rating point, Nielsen ratings bring in way more revenue than online views (via network websites or purchased by ep through iTunes or Amazon), at least for now. Nielsen ratings also account for On Demand usage and, in some cases, network website viewing.
 |It's also interesting to think about all of those baby boomers/Gen X-ers over 35 or so who aren't viewing any programming online at all, and they represent a huge chunk of profitable television viewers.
[If you don't mind me asking what Masters program did you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Hey there! First of all, GREAT USERNAME! Jealous its yours and not mine!
[ do you think that it was necessary for getting where you are today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|And wow, it's great to see someone so interested in getting into the television research field! It's a great position to be in, as executives and programmers really take what comes from me and my department to heart and trust us to give them good information about our programming and the programming of competitive networks. We are the braintrust of the company.
[What else should I be doing to get into to the industry/make myself more competitive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|I am based out of NYC, and I got my MA in TV/radio/film at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University. I started directly after graduation from my state school undergrad, where I studied general communication. I don't think it was absolutely necessary to have gone to such a prestigious communications school, but it definitely helped me land my first job as it looks great on a resume. That being said, plenty of people I work with went to relatively unknown state schools and I am the only one in my department with an MA - I'm hoping that'll help me more in the future when I'm ready to rule the roost :)
[What's your favorite thing about your career so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|I think your experiences so far are a great foundation for getting into research; if you can, I'd definitely try to get an internship in some sort of research capacity. If you're not in a major city (NY, LA, Chicago, Miami, Orlando and Atlanta have research communities), most local TV stations in a mid-sized city have at least one research person you may be able to intern with. Also, check your area for research companies that are not part of a media company, i.e. third party vendors. A lot of them are not based in huge cities.
[What has been the most challenging?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|My favorite thing about my career so far, hmm... I love being an expert at something, and it feels great to be in a meeting and be expected to know everything. I'm a know it all by nature so that is extremely satisfying to me, haha :) Meeting celebs doesn't suck either! The most challenging is definitely dealing with the politics of a huge multinational company (which most cable and broadcast networks are owned by), but that happens in many industries.
[When networks are picking up shows, what's more important to them: Finding content they thing is actually good, or stuff they think will get big ratings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|When networks are picking up shows, it is definitely a blend of looking for what's good and what will rate, and yes, there is a LOT of discussion about every presentation tape, casting tape, and pilot that we see. A network has to have shows that rate in order to create shows they feel are good because those kinds of shows are expensive to make, and the higher ratings a network has, the more revenue they pull in through ad sales.
[I'm assuming they try to go for both, or somewhere in the middle, but is there a lot of discussion about this dichotomy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Recently, the president of my network axed a show everyone wanted green lit because they knew it could pull big numbers if edited and marketed correctly, but he denied it because he thought it was too low brow. I definitely respected him for that.
[Kind of going off that, some shows seem like such obvious flops (like Fox's new show Dad's\) that it's surprising they're even made.  What is the justification/thought process behind picking up shows like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Some shows are obvious flops, BUT - Dads actually did pretty well in the ratings even though it's not great. Always, ALWAYS assume that if a show is getting THAT much bad press, the network's PR team is probably behind it in some way, trying to get viewers to check out what is so bad about it, thus possibly getting them hooked and driving ratings.
[ even just what goes into deciding what to pick up in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Thanks so much for your question - totally happy to answer any others you have. Good luck in your endeavors! :)
[Wow, thank you for this detailed response! It's incredibly informative (and super interesting\). Thank you for taking the time to write that all out.  I actually do live near NYC, and that's where my internship was. I'll definitely look into research internships.  I didn't really know about the 3rd party research vendors, so I'll check those out as well.  I have another question: How do you go about the research? Is it working with focus groups, going over data from Nielsen etc? What does an average day for you look like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbv43w?context=5)|A little of all of the above! Nielsen ratings for the networks I'm responsible for, competitive Nielsen ratings and program scheduling, keeping up to date on everything going on in the TV world, estimating how we think upcoming programs may do, attending development screenings and discussions, focus groups, all of those and much more depending on the day!
[Do you use any advanced or proprietary models to interpret ratings? The kinds of analyses done by and for the public (ie. TVbythenumbers.com\) seem fairly primitive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|We can look at ratings literally any way we want. We have tools from not just Nielsen, but 4-5 other companies that push the Nielsen data out in different ways. I can get down to a very granular level and tell you what ONE viewer in the sample watches all day long. The public face of ratings is very simple because the process is very hard to understand.
[How much do total viewers matter vs. getting the right demos? Is it true that advertisers (and by extension networks\) are by and large unenthusiastic about shows that might draw large numbers in demos outside 18-49?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|Total viewers matter for different reasons than demos. In general, we look at the total viewer number for press stories, which is why you see the term 'total viewers' a lot in any sort of ratings article you see. Those numbers come from people like me. Demo ratings matter more to people at the network when touting a show's successes and deciding whether to keep it. We care more about getting to the demo we want because that's how we make our money. No one sells ads based on total viewer numbers, always on demos. 18-49 is the most popular demo, but advertisers care about a lot of different demos depending on their product.
[What's the feeling in the industry right now about the viability of serialized dramas? They're what gets the most prestige and where you find the most creative risks, but it seems like they're also seen as difficult to monetize - that they're more likely to be DVR'd or binge-watched on Netflix.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|The viability of serialized dramas is a mixed bag. On one hand, a good serialized drama or two is likely to put a network on the map (think AMC), but they are expensive to produce. They bring in a lot of ad dollars because of their high ratings, but some don't really repeat well. In terms of when they're viewed, they are still monetized as long as they're watched within the first 3 days on your DVR, as sales figures are based on those first 3 days. I myself am a drama viewer, so I hope they continue putting on really good series.
[As cable gets a bigger and bigger audience while the broadcast audience gets diluted, is there some double edged sword action happening where the cable networks now feel more pressure to make hit shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|We definitely feel the pressure to make hit shows, and its really hard to accept that not every show can be a hit. It's up to me as a researcher to keep executives and programmers level headed and try to always be realistic about a show so they don't get their hopes up if we know it won't do well. Sometimes we're wrong but the majority of the time we're not. There aren't very many surprise hits - we tend to know just from seeing ratings day in and day out and being pounded over the head with tv all day every day what's going to work and what's not. BUT - we still put things on the air that we're not overly confident in because you never know. I have been surprised by the ratings for very few shows in my career thus far.
[Do you interact much with creatives in your job? Any crazy stories about showbiz eccentrics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|I work with the development team a lot, who are the producers on the network side. They have to sell themselves and their shows, so if you listen to them, every show is the next Walking Dead. Showbiz eccentrics are less frequent in cable companies than they are at production companies - we may be in TV but we're still a corporation with guidelines and HR :)
[Why do networks cancel huge shows like Breaking Bad or House, even though they're still doing well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb4lpw?context=5)|There's a difference between being canceled and ending.
 |BB was not canceled, it's just ending. Sometimes from a creative/story standpoint, a show is just over. I actually think most programs tend to get better when they decide on an end date because every episode matters. 
[I was under the impression (from things I read\) that they wanted to do another season because they had some more stuff they wanted to put in, but AMC pulled the plug.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb4uro?context=5)|I think it was a budgeting issue - they wanted 6 seasons but AMC was concerned a full season would be too expensive so they compromised at a fifth season split into two sets of 8.
[Do the executives really think they will come up with another show that will give a better ROI(of airtime and pruduction costs\)?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbkg7j?context=5)|I don't know the specifics of the budget for that particular show, only that they wanted a full season 6 and they compromised on season 5 in 2 parts. 
[Why are there some really crap shows out there? And why does it seem to keep going down in quality year after year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1lp5?context=5)|Here here! I totally agree with you, friend.
[I swear, at this rate we will be a society (like in the movie Idiocracy\) which watches an ass farting for a whole hour and are entertained by it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1lp5?context=5)|That being said - networks will put on whatever rates, even when they don't particularly like a show. They have to put something on air (that they can afford - each episode of a show costs $) while they're looking for the best stuff.
[How about more science shows on the science channels and comedy (actual funny stuff and not just shock value bs\) on the comedy channels!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1lp5?context=5)|I think a big culprit is the huge amount of selection we now have. 
[Do you feel as though Nielson ratings are a fair assessment of a show's fate? I heard, somewhere, that there's only something like 5000 Nielson households in the US. Is that true? 5k out of 300mil cannot possibly be accurate. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb3dxj?context=5)|I think they're as fair as they can be, to be honest.
 |The sample is generally between 20,000-22,000 households.
[What do you think is the best show on TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb3uxw?context=5)|On right now? Gotta go with Breaking Bad. I've seen most modern drama series in their entireties and I have to say Breaking Bad is among the best ever.
 |Other quality drama programs on right now: Homeland, Game of Thrones, Bates Motel, House of Cards (Netflix). Mad Men is great but an acquired taste and, in my opinion, overrated in terms of awards. Walking Dead was great the first couple of seasons but in my opinion has kind of lost its storytelling luster. Dexter was a great show at one time but this final season has gone downhill.
 |On broadcast TV, I think Scandal is kind of soap-y but it's really well done. I really like The Following as well. There aren't really any hard hitting dramas on broadcast that I enjoy right now. Have seen a bit of Hannibal and want to check it out.
 |In terms of comedies, I'd go with New Girl, Parks &amp; Rec, Arrested Development. Modern Family's first few seasons were amazing, I wasn't as impressed with last season though. I was a huge 30 Rock fan and was sad to see it go.
[The networks all used to be pretty different- CourtTV was pretty different from Discovery which was different from Country Music TV which was different from MTV which was different from History. Now it seems like they're all airing COPS reruns and fake ""reality shows"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb270b?context=5)|In this sort of context, ""real"" is relative. Absolutely none of the reality shows on air right now have never asked one of their subjects to do something again one more time to get a good shot. It happens in every show.
[Is the American public that low that the networks get better ratings that way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb270b?context=5)|Some are obviously more factual than others. The lawsuit about Storage Wars isn't as cut and dry as one might think. Dave (YUUUP) was suing based on a perception that things weren't going his way. I believe they settled out of court.
[What are some reality shows that are real and which are fake. I know all those towing shows on TruTV are fake as is Storage Wars (which we found out was fake due to the lawsuit\). I'm assuming Discovery and National Geographic still air a lot of real stuff- I'm assuming Jungle Gold, Alaska State Troopers, etc are real? What about Shipping Wars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb270b?context=5)|Definite fakes on TRU, lots of fake on MTV but some is quite real. Bravo shows are partially directed/scripted (Real Housewives). TLC stuff is just awful, I'm sure some of that is scripted (the interviews in Honey Boo Boo are DEFINITELY scripted). The more jobs based stuff like on History, Discovery and Nat Geo are less likely to be scripted. Any reality show that has funny sound bites in an interview style has probably been scripted to some extent.

[If someone had a neilson box is there any way for you to pay said person to watch your network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0zpr?context=5)|That would be HIGHLY illegal and in breech of any network's Nielsen contract. Oprah once tweeted trying to get anyone with a Nielsen box to watch something on OWN and they reprimanded her for it by not even releasing ratings for the program she was begging viewers to watch.
[How do i get a neilsen box? I know thousands and thousands of people.  not one has a neilson box. how can you have a representative sample?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbk980?context=5)|Having a Nielsen box isn't something people always talk about and I believe there are confidentiality rules as well, so I'm not surprised you don't think any of them have one. Chances are, though, that someone you know has or has had a Nielsen box in their home at one time.
[Is there any sort of push to make tv less mundane?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1gg3?context=5)|Personally, I think we're in a great era of TV right now. Reality shows are kind of whatever to me, but the dramas that are on TV right now are heavy, well written, interesting and addictive.
 |I agree some genres are mundane. Don't worry, every network is pushing to find the next original and exciting thing at all times. Whether or not you or I find that exciting is a different story :)
[Whats the deal with dicks not being on tv?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbpoqv?context=5)|I wonder the same thing. Daily.
[Does your research indicate how the Al Jazeera America network (the one that's on Al Gore's old channel\) is doing?  I think they really dropped the ball when they cut off Internet access and went strictly cable. What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb8bf3?context=5)|Al Jazeera America took over Current TV (which was Al Gore's old channel) on your cable system, that is correct. I'm seeing about a 20% drop in ratings since they switched over, but the ratings are SO small (about 1% of what a network like USA would do). The smaller a rating is, the higher the standard deviation is, so that 20% should be taken with a grain of salt.
[As opposed to all the other networks' israel connections?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbkhcn?context=5)|Just as an FYI, that is not my personal view, of course. But Al Jazeera is a recognizable name from the Middle East, and while it may be fucked up, I do think that will influence how people view the channel. Middle Eastern countries strike a chord with people in the US that does not have the same influence over them as something from Israel.
[What is your take on AMAZON TV ? Do you see them as a serious player in the industry (or becoming a serious player\)?

I said the same thing about Netflix and they've done a great job with development and releasing really great original programming, so we'll see what Amazon TV has to offer!
[What the hell happen to NBC? Back in the 90s, they were the gold standard of premium television.

What necessary steps can NBC take to resume their prestige?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb4jxa?context=5)|It's really about developing new shows. I'm not privy to what exactly lead to their downfall, but I'm sure they got lazy with development because they had so many hit shows, but every show fades eventually. That was their big mistake.

[Okay, I have two questions here. 1\) Why was Lie to me cancelled, what was wrong with it?  2\) Same question but in regards to Breakout Kings.  Both were awesome Criminal shows. What gives?

If they're not there, they're just not there. Crime shows like that don't have the cult-ish sort of following something like Community has, so they don't have that to fall back on. Dramas like that are also more expensive to produce than a reality or comedy show, so there is less tolerance for low ratings.
[My question more was about how the system itself seems to over exaggerate just how many people are watching TV altogether. Isn't there some sort of bias towards TV watching considering that the samples taken are presumably from households that watch a lot of TV? Are these sorts of things taken into account when numbers like 10 million are decided upon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb35at?context=5)|The samples taken aren't necessarily from households that watch a lot of TV - and the sample rotates all the time, so a certain household may only be included for a couple of months. They rotate to keep the sample fresh and representative of the whole country and their television viewing habits.
[Agh,  That's unfortunate.  Nothing against reality TV but i much rather prefer something scripted. I have enough people around me to shake my head at lol.  Do you have a particular preference in the types of shows you watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbkz7g?context=5)|I am 100% a drama viewer. I prefer my TV to be heavy, tragic, funny and well told in terms of story and visuals. I like comedies as well, but only those that are filmed more like dramas (single cam, i.e. The Office, 30 Rock, New Girl, Parks &amp; Rec, Modern Family, Louie, Veep). I'm not a reality viewer at all, the only reality shows I ever follow are documentary style - Drugs Inc, Lock Up, Intervention, etc.
[Do networks factor how rabid a fanbase is for a show? For example, if the ratings aren't good but it has a devoted fanbase with lots of chatter on the Internet, does that help mitigate bad ratings to any major extent? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbleo7?context=5)|It's definitely considered in the grand scheme of things and whether to keep a show on air or not. I answered more in depth when someone asked about Community in another question so please look for that.
[Here's one that I've been wondering forever and would love to haev an insider's answer to. When it comes to Neilson et al, as far as I know we haven't gottent to the point where every single cable box is reporting on us, right? Therefore Neilson is an extrapolation. I don't know the numbers, but there's like 400M people in the USA and I'd be surprised if there's even 1M Neilson boxes. So TV charges advertisers based on a guess that could actually be COMPLETELY WRONG. With Hulu, Amazon, et al you know EXACTLY how many people are watching. But advertisers refuse to pay as much money for those ads. Or at least I've HEARD so far that if all TV went to Hulu it wouldn't be sustainable. (Even though it's MUCH MUCH harder to skip those ads than when watching it on a DVR in regular TV\) SO why is this? It seems backwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbj3a9?context=5)|Firstly, Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, etc are relatively new technologies. Their ratings reporting is completely proprietary, meaning only THEY can see their numbers. Their advertisers have no guarantee they aren't fudging them up at all. That's the first issue.
 |Regarding your Nielsen question, no, every cable box is not measured. Not everyone has cable/satellite, some get the broadcast stations for free over the air using a digital antenna - there would be no way to get those ratings if that were the case. It's also very 'big brother' (in an Orwellian sense, not in a CBS sense) to be tapping each and every person's cable box. Some people don't want anyone to know what they're watching.

So, for the first six months of this year, I, a 3rd year CS student, was doing an internship at the helpdesk of an investment firm. Since this was a quantitative investment firm, they needed a large IT infrastructure, and had a large group of software developers working there as well. 

I was obviously the least experienced member of all the helpdesk staff, so while I would handle most of the tech support requests from the accounting, portfolio management, and compliance teams with relative ease, tickets from the software developers tended to be a little bit beyond my scope, and would get assigned to the more experienced members. 

One morning, however, I see a ticket from one of the devs requesting an extra hard drive (he needed local copies of databases for a lot of his code), and to adjust his partitions so that C: would take up one drive, while D: would take up the extra one. Now, I had never done this before, but when I found out how intuitive Windows Disk Management looked, I figured I could tackle this ticket. Assigned it to myself, grabbed an HD from our supply closet, and strode bravely towards the dev group. 

I arrived and told Dev Guy I was there to get him all set up with the new drive. He seemed surprised. Surely they would've sent one of the full-timers to help with this. But alas, there stood the intern, fresh drive in hand. 

He shuts down, I crack open his PC case, pop in the drive, boot up. All good so far. He logs in, I open up Disk Management. New drive shows up, no partitions on it. Sweet. First things first, let's get rid of the D: partition on his original drive. 

Uh oh. 

The option to delete the partition is grayed out. 

Crap. 

I start thinking I may have gotten in a little over my head, but I wasn't about to back down without a fight. And unfortunately for my opponents, I have a black belt in Google-fu. Scan the search results, and boom. My answer. You can't delete a partition with a pagefile. 

So I get into advanced system settings, and see pagefiles in both C: and D: partitions. Pop the one from D: over to C:, and there it is: I can delete the D: partition. 

Nuke D:, extend C:, create a new D: on drive B. Dev Guy pulls his backup of D: off the networked storage location, and everything is running smoothly. There I was, a degree-less intern standing triumphant over the corpse of ticket from someone vastly more experienced than I was. It's hard to put into words how I felt. Dev Guy thanks me. I welcome him. 

I still really wish something had blown up behind me as I walked back to my desk. "

I'm 19, studying for a BSE in Computer Science. English is my native language, and I'm learning more French every day--I read/write/speak/understand at about a C1 level right now. I have a clean record, and alternative destinations...potentially.

I'm from Michigan, but I'm living in France right now as a study abroad student for one year. All my classes are in French; no real problems on that front actually. As I'm only in my 2nd year in my program, I don't know too well the theory side of my CS degree, but I've experience from a summer internship and years of personal projects in a variety of languages--embedded C++, C++ on the desktop, PHP and Ruby on the web side.

I know the situation with France and foreigners looking for employment--it ain't pretty. So, realistically, what are my options? Is this the last time I'll be in France for any long time? I've done a bit of research into gaining EU nationality (and most people around here seem to recommend Germany). But there's so much, and I would prefer to do so in a Francophone country. Is Belgium (Wallonie or Bruxelles) a possibility then?

Education in Europe: Master's degrees are standard. France also reduces the residency requirement for students having studied in an institution of higher education to 2 years--but even if I were to study fora master's in France, I worry getting another 2 years of employment (and the visa for it) would be near impossible.

Okay. I think that's everything--I've rewritten and rewritten and still have nothing but ramble. But I appreciate any help you guys can offer, even if that just means a ""good luck!"" :)"
1mspe3,1,2013-09-20,The Real Reason Why You Can't Get a Job in this Economy,Jkid,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mspe3/the_real_reason_why_you_cant_get_a_job_in_this/,"or the “Jobs Market Farce” 

After the housing crash of 2008 occurred, the jobs problem began. Why the housing boom occurred? Easy credit. Easy credit from banks from subprime loans because they knew they can profit from these loans as soon as the teaser rate expires and turns into a large interest rate. With easy credit from banks, businesses used them to fund their companies and the salaries of workers and their owners. Once the easy credit dried up, that when the problems began.

Usually, when the Great Recession of 2008 (or Artifical Great Depression of 2008) began, they tend to cut jobs and people have to make do with less. But in this year they figured out that it was more profitable to hire people who are willing to pay for no money (unpaid internships) or hire no people at all. If you combined that with an excess population who have BA and MAs in various degrees, and the need for constant rising profit margins in publicly owned corporations for executives and share owners and you have the situation that for every one job opening you have 650 people applying for a job. Not only college graduates but people who have been laid off or downsized in order to cut costs or gain more profit.

Then to make the job search more of a farce, they put in many hoops you have to jump through. Some of them include: Automatic Job resume scanners that reject your resume if you do not have enough buzzwords, Human Resource members that don’t call back, fake job postings just to collect resumes, multiple interviews,automatic rejection if you have no experience/not enough experience/not the right experience ,mandatory personality tests. Even if you do make it you will get punched in the face by three reasons: Internal candidates, Referrals by other employees (read: Connections via networking), people who look hot and have breasts (read: Females). This has turned into a job market into a job lottery. A lottery that if you don’t win before you’re homeless, you are screwed to lifetime unemployment! (How good is staying positive if you’re going to be homeless?!)

Besides, every human has a limit of bullshit they can take before offing themselves. And they need real help, as underfunded suicide hotlines, therapist that are wait-listed for months and meds won’t help if the root of the problem is the living environment.

Despite the growth in jobs boasted by your politicians: Most of the growth come from food and retail industries. They put you to work in 30 hour weeks, and those those weeks are flexible at the employers end making it impossible to get a second job. If you have a resume that has a B.A., you will be automatically rejected! Even if you do get in, they prefer people who speak Spanish. Which explains the the fact that these days, they tend to employ people who speak Spanish and english. They also offer no benefits or health care because companies are too cheap to offer health care despite record profits because they know Obamacare will be in force by October 1st and it’s expanded medicaid provision will pick up the slack.




To the employees who lost his or her jobs, you will going to hear what I call the “Jobs market Chorus”: Be an entrepreneur and start your business! Network! Temping! Go get new skills! Freelance! Flip some patties! Go to North Dakota in the oil fields! Drive a truck! Join the Military (read: Join the army and die)! Go move where the jobs are! Go teach English at Japan/China/Taiwan/Korea! I promise you that you will hear at least one of these knee-jerk advice in a week in your miserable job market.

The problem is that these type of advice are (for too many people) worthless. Some job hunters have authoritarian parents who want their college graduates to get a actual job. Some job hunters are homeless. Some job hunters have family obligations, or have medical condition (physical, developmental, or mental.) Also, some job seekers have little income or none! Another great reason: EVERYONE ELSE HAS THE SAME IDEA!

Another thing job hunters will hear is the feel-good message which consists of variations of two parts: “Oh don’t worry you’ll find one” and “Stay Positive”. This is before the following if you’re actually trying to network: “I can’t help you!” or “I don’t know anyone.”  Do you know which people say these things? People who are lucky to held their jobs this long or people who are employment advisors but are too lazy to actually help.

So for Congress the real job creation solution is similar to health care: Disappear Quickly! Either by suicide, jail by resorting to crime due to unemployment, or homeless. Because Congress is proudly too politically lazy to actually fix the problem.

Basically for you job seekers out there here’s what our uncaring and unsympathetic, and lazy society is telling you: YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN AND THE SOON AS YOU VANISH BY ANY REASON OUT OF OUR HAPPY LIVES, THE BETTER!"

But was I just disappointed by that one experience and I'd have loved the job under different circumstances?  I wish I knew.

Anyway.  The class I am stuck taking for this fall, the last one to complete my minor, is a programming languages theory class.  This is the best option I have of the fall classes - it's bleak.  I am not at all interested in this topic.  We're in week 3 and it already has gotten way too theoretical for my taste; I was never interested in theory, only application (this is also true for statistics - I fucking *hate* the pure math classes and love me some SAS).  

I feel like I am contemplating dropping this class just because it's boring and kind of hard and I'm lazy, not because I can't do it.  I would be disappointed in myself for quitting so close to finishing.  But I also have part-time jobs and five other classes and I would rather put effort toward my major classes than toward this one.  How important would that one line on a resume be?

I am currently an economics major. The math and statistics classes I have taken include calc 1 &amp; 2, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, R computing and STATA computing. I am also taking an upper division proof linear algebra class, and will take real analysis my next semester.

I took the GRE the other day and got these scores: 162 Q and 160 V. I haven't seen my essay scores yet, but hopefully I did well. I also might want to retake this and bump my quant score a bit...i'm not sure though.

As for my three recommenders, I have one from a biology professor who I did research for and also TAed as an undergrad. One from an economics professor who I am doing research with and got an A in his class. And the 3rd (hopefully, haven't asked yet) from another econ professor whose class I also took and got an A in/did research with. 

As for research, I have research experience in various fields, such as medicine, microbiology, and economics. I also worked in government and political organizations as well. 

However, my main concern lies with my GPA. it is around a 3.4 overall. My major GPA is definitely higher, not sure by how much though. Possibly 3.5/3.6. The main reason for this is because I was very ill my 1st two years of college (I'm a senior now) and my grades plummeted. I was actually a biology major with hopes of medical school, but those were dashed. I switched to economics and quickly fell in love with the field. 

I haven't written any statement of purpose yet and I feel there is not enough time to do so. I think I could make a very good essay if I apply next fall, but I also don't know what I would do for a year, possibly a research internship, etc.

I guess I just needed some advice on all of this, since the deadlines are coming up. For Public Health, apparently, SOPHAS takes 4 weeks to verify, so I would need to submit by late October/early November...

Ugh, thanks in advance."
1mussk,5,2013-09-21,Could use a bit of advice/perspective from you guys. Here's my story:,beullucks,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mussk/could_use_a_bit_of_adviceperspective_from_you/,"I go to a pretty good school, but not that big and not good enough that the jobs i want are coming to our school and asking for students/grads. 

Last year, i transferred to a very highly ranked school in LA, to pursue a degree in Math/Economics. When i got there, i was pretty lost. I had a good group of friends at my old school and i missed it, and on top of that the increased difficulty and competitiveness of the math classes was getting to me. I got okay grades, never anything less than a B- while i was there, but at the time it didn't feel right. My housing situation was bad (i was overpaying), and i wasn't doing well in my math class towards the end of my second quarter there. 

I decided that i would transfer back to my original school, with the idea that the smaller classes would help me get a better relationship with some of my professors (which it did), and the less rigorous course load would help keep my GPA pretty high (which it did). So now I'm back; last year i spent two quarters in LA and one back here. I got a 4.0 this last quarter back in 2 upper div major classes, and secured a summer internship that just ended a couple weeks ago, so that was good.

Lately I've been feeling really down about not being able to get through the tougher challenge. I feel like i should have taken a quarter off and got my head straight so i could make a more clear headed decision, not one that was based more off desperation. 

I'm starting to slightly consider transferring back, but the problem is it's about to be my senior year. If i stay here, I'll graduate on time with a high GPA (3.7+), note: this school is top 100 school. If i were to go back to LA, it'd be probably another 4 quarters (there) to finish, which means 5 total, cause i still will be here for fall. So I'd be about 2 quarters into a 5th year (not that bad); and thats if i pass all my classes etc. 

I'm going to be going to grad school, i believe for economics. So finishing on time, and with a high gpa sounds good for that because then i'll be on the same schedule as grad schools. But on the other hand, going back to LA to finish sounds good too because i know i'd never have the regret of not finishing it up and getting that experience. Plus the jobs straight out of college are much better with a degree from LA than here. I'm still getting email from my old department there with job openings that are all things i'd love to be doing, if i weren't going to grad school, while here our on campus recruitment is a joke, and our career center has no job postings that are in a field i'd be interested in. But none of that matters a whole lot if i end up at grad school anyway. 

I don't really know what to do, i guess i wanted to vent a little bit, but i'd also like to here your perspective on it. I know that while i was in LA, i really wasnt happy, but i feel like that was because of the bad situation i was in with housing (switched housing 3 times within 2 quarters, and then over paying just to find a place). If i were to go back, i think i might be able to move in with my mom and have my own room and free rent. But finishing up here would be quicker and would get me to grad school faster (but thats only if i get into a good program!).

Its all so frustrating and i hate dwelling on the what-ifs and what could have beens. I know that if i graduated from LA with a decent GPA, my job outlooks would be much better, but im not really planning on working straight out of college, but i definitely would if i didn't get into a grad program. Theres also something to be said about finishing up at LA because of its difficulty, it'd be something to be pretty proud of, while here graduating would be nothing too special, nobody really regards this school as any sort of challenge. 

TLDR: Transferred from worse to better school, then back to worse school after some personal problems that affected school work, now i'm back and sort of regret leaving and am considering going back. If i were to go back, it'd take longer to graduate, but i'd have a stronger name on my resume and a lot more job opportunities. But i'm applying to grad school, so do i even need to be concerned about that?

edit: i also feel like i gave up too quickly. i applied to come back after 1 quarter there because i was already having doubts about my future in LA, but i think that was too quick and then it was easy to just go back. "

I have done some reading about IT, again, and now I have rounded down to possibly 2 routes. Sysadmin or Network Administrator.
I read about getting as much experience in the field as I can and getting a few certs just to make sure I land an interview and increase my pay.
Even though, I have 2 possible routes, I'm still not sure if I want to do it. Growing up I mostly just deal with hardware side of things and I had a lot of fun in middle school helping teachers with computer related problems. I can be very lazy and I guess is why I'm hesitant.

Anyways, here is what I've been planning.
[Computer Systems Specialist] (http://www.broward.edu/academics/programs/Program%20Sheet%20Library/21491.pdf)
Thinking about doing this program and when I turn 18 I'll look for an internship. Try to really get a feel for what exactly I'm going to be doing in IT. Then, when I finish this program I could probably study for CCNA, or take the CCNA course to prepare for the test at college since I can be very lazy. I consider myself as Jack of All Trades and I guess at the end it comes down to me and keeping up with the technology advancements.

Oh yes, I've done some programming nothing serious because I just don't enjoy it. It helped me a lot with the way I think. I don't mind learning it. I just don't see myself doing it for a living. I'm thinking about picking a language and sticking with it soon. Back in 08 I started with C++ and got as far as making 1/4, maybe, 1/3 of a Tic Tac Toe game, but I just quit. I picked up Visual Basic last year, but I quit as well. I'm thinking about starting Python and hopefully sticking with it. Also, how are things in Europe as far IT goes? I'm hoping in the future I'll be able to move there.
[This] (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1mvu6q/im_starting_college_next_year_i_have_a_passion/) also helped me a lot just now and our story are pretty much the same. I guess as long as I'm not stuck answering phones for the rest of my life I'm good.

By the way I'll be meeting with an advisor soon as part of a requirement for one of my classes and just want to make sure I'm at least 80% sure how I'm gonna go about things.

I have some work experience where I was constantly treated badly because of my inability to sustain an ordinary conversation. Moreover, I understand that the only job I can get as a student is something directly connected to talking to people, as there are very few data entry positions etc.

* I can live in hope to take some paid internship or work in practice for an entire year after my second year, so I can support myself during my last year. Also, I can somewhat rely on my parents to send me some cash as they love me despite me being a total imbecile. 

* I considered some web ""jobs"" like completing surveys or one-time projects, but they pay very little and demand a lot of time and stress to actually find these projects. So if I do that it most likely will affect my studies.

I'm usually the one giving advice on here, but I'd love to hear some feedback on my ""situation"". I put it in quotes because it's a pretty great situation to be dealing with. Anyway this might be a bit lengthy so bear with me.

I entered Penn as a freshman in 2010, planning to studying Bioengineering. I loved the field, but I felt I wasn't gaining any real technical skills (except matlab, I was getting pretty handy with it). So after my freshman year, I decided to take a programming course to see if I liked it. I realized that bioengineering wasn't right for me, but it had already been 2 years!

I was like... ah fuck it. I'm switching to Computer Engineering. It was late, but I thought I would be able to catch up.

And I honestly haven't looked back. I've made some really cool projects, participated in a hardware hackathon, and I've learned a lot of amazing things. My junior year was really fulfilling because I learned to code better and work with on the hardware side as well. I then took my knowledge and applied it right away, something I had never done in bioengineering. This year, I was also accepted into a combined BSE/MSE program that would allow me to complete my Bachelors in CompE and Masters in EE by 2015.

I then got my first real engineering internship (the other ones in the past were BE research related). I did some work for an FPGA startup where I was working with the core technology team to test the FPGA. I ended up picking up Python when designing a new testing system as well as strengthening my RTL coding skills.

I then got an internship from July 2013- Jan 2014 to work in a medical device startup in Switzerland. The job here is basically working on wireless/low-power ECG monitors. Specifically I'm working with a new microcontroller and learning about optimizing serial communication and working with a new RTOS. 

After checking out this subreddit so many times, I learned that I should always be planning for the next internship. So while I've been here in Switzerland, I started harassing a medical device company in Boston that has been working with cool technology that I once read in a Nature article. I eventually harassed them enough to get me an interview with the Advanced Tech R&amp;D team, and I was later accepted for an intern position for next summer.

So at this point you're probably asking... what the fuck is your situation?

A NASA engineer contacted me via email and asked if I would be able to intern in the Spring of 2014. He had posted two new positions and thought that I would be a good match for them and encouraged me to apply. My problem is, I was planning on going back to school in the Spring to continue my studies. 

With my current track, I've already pushed my BSE/MSE grad date to the Spring of 2016. If I get this internship and take it, I would be pushing it back another semester. Is this worth it? I would be spending 6.5 years for my bachelors and masters, but I would have a bunch of really cool experience that would make my resume look really great. 

I also haven't decided if I want to continue schooling and get my PhD, or to go into industry after i get my MSE...

So sorry if this a shitty post, but I'd love to hear some thoughts on whether getting this internship experience is worth it if I'm pushing out my graduation date

Thanks"

 I want both work and life experience, I want to interact with people, and I crave something more than what I have now. I'm 21 years old and feel hungry to take on more challenges. I want to leave my comfort zone ( aka my room )

My question is, what type of job could I get to fulfill my desire for challenge? I feel as though my hours are very odd. I have a resume that I can share with anyone, it has some volunteer experience and internships with athletic teams. 

EDIT: I was thinking perhaps getting certified to become a trainer. I figured with relatively flexible hours, It will throw me into ""sales"" and ""people"" experience. two birds with one stone. I'm wondering if there is anything else I can do with my time. 

In the future, I am considering making a career in medicine. I was thinking physician assistant or Paramedic/ Firefighter. I want to become EMT- B certfied next year and try to get a part time job as an ER tech in the hospital. But I want something that I can sink my teeth into now.

However, I can arrange for many from my work. And maybe from my internship guide too(which was a professor at another US college/University at the time where I did my internship).

How do you think I will manage? Because there's just one guy in my college who is ready to give me recommendation. Others (in another department who taught me) have simply refused giving lame excuses(yes, this happens here) like he is already writing for others(no use trying to fight them because after that I would rather not have them write it for me). This has nothing to do with my performance in college and so, this is just college politics and the faculty members are mostly shoddy and autocratic. It's a government college here.

Problem is:

- Most universities need more than or at least 2 recommendations from college/university.
- But there's just one guy who has agreed.

How to handle this? Can I talk to the university I am applying to and ask them to consider my internship recommendation or recommendations from work instead?"

1n2blv,32,2013-09-24,My trip to New Orleans isn't... it isn't going like it should. I think I'm losing my mind.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n2blv/my_trip_to_new_orleans_isnt_it_isnt_going_like_it/,"I am wholly and utterly exhausted by the time I get off the plane.  I don't know how my boss does it - flying all over the country. It's probably one of the worst damn experiences of my life .  Flying from Washington State into Louisiana's Louis Armstrong International has no perks at all - I was squashed between a fat man who didn't realize deodorant had been invented, and a woman whose toddler was intent on tugging my hair every time I tried to doze off.

My best friend from childhood, though, is a sight for sore eyes.  The second we see each other, I forget how exhausted my eyes are or how smeared my makeup probably is.

""Lana!"" I exclaim, throwing my arms around her.

""Ash!  Jesus, it's been forever!"" she practically squeals, her short-cropped black curls pressing against my cheek.  ""Damn, girl, you've gotten pale as hell. You're gonna fry out here, you know.""

I shrug as I pull away, tossing my strawberry blonde hair over my very pale, very freckled shoulder.  Lana's mocha skin is as perfect and bronzed as ever.  ""I'm Irish, Lana.  The terrible downside of no skin cancer also means no skin pigment for people like me.""

""Whatever, let's get you settled in and then we're heading out,"" she says very matter-of-factly.  ""You need to experience some damn fine food, drinks, and men while you're here.""

""My research-"" I start to argue.

She puts a finger to my lips, her brown eyes narrowing.  ""No arguments.  Grab your bags, let's go.""

…

Lana and I met in Elementary and have been best friends since.  We were never apart - it was always Lana and Ashlin, or Ashlin and Lana.  We didn’t work as separate entities.  

When she graduated from High School, the free loving and gorgeous African Goddess got married to an older man and jet-setted across the globe while I suffered through college.  While I was taking unpaid internships and eating ramen noodles out of their packets on a dirty boarding house floor, she was rubbing elbows with celebs and having affairs on her trophy husband with those same celebs.

It was scandalous, it was crass, and it was certainly nothing I would have done with my life.  Looking at the photos on Facebook through those years, there were quite a few times I made some rude or hurtful comments.  But Lana was happy, and if Lana was happy, I was happy for her.

Lana's husband died this year, which didn't leave her too heartbroken.  She took his money, his estates, and began playing the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  She was evidently doing well on it.  I mean, she added two more houses (one of which was where we would be staying here in New Orleans) to her holdings.

On the other hand, I was working as an underpaid, overworked journalist while trying to write the next bestseller.  All I wanted was something to make me rich so I could stop working at The Guardian and do stuff I actually enjoyed.

…

""So what's the book about?"" she asks as she languidly drapes herself over the patio chair.  The live band playing at this outdoor club is loud and boisterous and utterly fabulous, but the late-evening heat and drone of mosquitoes has me uncomfortable.

""Huh?"" I ask, waving a hand in front of my face.  Damn bugs.

""The book!"" she repeats, louder this time.  Her mint julep looks close to spilling across the cobblestone floor.  ""The one you're working on!""

I shrug, not really sure what to say.  I hate when people ask me that. No one ever really cares.  I'm sure Lana does, but still… explanations seem silly out of context.  How can anyone understand without being in my head?

""I'm not sure yet,"" I admit, watching the grenadine in my drink swish around and discolor the clear liquor.  ""Something about the Civil War and its effects on New Orleans.  I definitely want to see how the sugar plantations functioned, hit a few tours.  Maybe stop in a few voodoo shops.""

""Ooo,"" she grins, sipping more of her drink.  ""I know a few places we can check out, but they're probably overly commercialized, giving jobs to 16 year olds who don't know shit about it.""

I shrug before swallowing the rest of my drink in one burning gulp.  ""I have to run to the restroom.  Watch my purse?""

Lana nods and waves me off and I teeter across the uneven ground toward the closest bathroom.  As I do, I pass a man who smells like something sweet and spicy and smoky.  I take a long whiff of it as I pass, heading into the ladies room.  It smells amazing at first, but it seems to cling to me and begins to make me nauseous the more I smell it.

I do my business and wash my hands, feeling the beginnings of a tipsy buzz starting in the base of my skull.  I don't think anything of it - after all, that was a main reason we came to an outdoor club was to get buzzed.

As I exit the bathroom, though, that heady, cloying scent I had smelled entering the restroom seems to suffocate me.  It is everywhere - like it has crawled up my nose and rooted itself into my sinus cavity. 

I stumble into a man, probably the one who smelled like sweet smoke, and muttered an apology.  The man doesn't even turn to me, just keeps watching the band playing with a glass of scotch in his hand.  He is wearing a light gray suit and a plume of dust rises up from it when I collide with him.

I quickly make my way back to the table, the sickly scent was beginning to lessen.  ""Did you see that?"" I ask Lana, who is on her phone's Facebook app, uploading pictures of us and commenting about how great the music is.

""See what?"" she asks distractedly. Tap tap tap tap, her fake nails are clicking against her phone screen in maddening, rapid-fire bursts.  It takes all my energy not to grab her phone and throw it.

""The guy I ran into,"" I murmur.  ""He's totally creepy and smells like an incense shop had an illegitimate love child with a hookah shop.""

She snorts.  ""Haven't done hookah in years - I wonder if they have a hookah bar nearb-""

""Lana! Seriously, just look at the guy!""

She rolls her eyes and turns, scanning the crowd.  ""Which guy? There's, like, a bajillion.""

""The creepy one by the women's bathroom!  He has a gray suit.""

""I see three guys, all gray wearers, and they are all near the ladies' room.  If you didn't notice, this place is packed and gray suits are, like, pickup wear of half of this town.""

I roll my eyes and turn around, scanning the crowd.  And for some dizzying moment, I can't remember what the man's face looked like.  I am drawing a completely blank.  I gape for a few moments, my eyes beginning to water as the sweet smoke stings my eyes again.

""Do you smell that?"" I ask, throat thick.

""I smell booze and sweat, babe,"" she sighs, back to tapping away on her phone.  ""Here, take a picture of me and try not to look peaked.  Jesus, did someone give you something in the bathroom, because you're acting like you're tripping balls,"" she jokes, leaning in close to me and giving the camera a fishy-kissy face.

I attempt a smile, which I am pretty sure turns out okay.

When the temporary blindness from the flash recedes, I am able to look at Lana's picture.  We look good - Lana all dark skinned and flawless, and me like some pale, dreamlike figure with red hair.  I am in the middle of asking Lana to tag me so I can use it for my profile picture when I see him in the picture, just a few paces behind us.

The sweet, smoky smelling man.  

He's practically right there, within arm's length of us, and despite how crowded the place is, there is no one between him and me.  He is still holding his glass in one hand, but the other is holding up four fingers.  His eyes are black and emotionless, but a large, freakish smile twists his mouth in a completely disproportionate way.  And he's looking right at the camera lens.

I feel the beginnings of dread clenching my heart. I turn around quickly but I don't see him - the crowd is back and he is melding into it.  When I look back at the photo, he is gone, as if he was never there.

Fuck it all, I think I'm losing my mind.

I only really came here because it was the only ABET accredited school in this area for my price range and a bunch of my friends are here. But in my first few weeks I have ran into a lot of issues, the CS program is the smallest major and also received the least attention from career services. According to my upper class men they don't even help CS students get internships (something you need  two of to graduate). All of the early programming courses only use Java. Finally it was announced today that we will be losing our ABET accreditation next year. 

I have been thinking of transferring to the university of mass Lowell. But want your advice if this is a good idea, or if I am simply over reacting.

Chapter 2.
Opening The Portal

I called my old social worker at the outreach place I use to go to in my home city sporadically to catch up, and through him learned that a good friend of mine (albeit one I used to ""use"" with) had been in jail for a few months for something minor. I was overjoyed because I thought that it was awesome that by fate we had both gone clean, even if he had no choice in the matter. 
I found him and started religiously sending letters and books every week. 

""R.L"" was an old friend and like myself, trustworthy even when he was strung out.
He was one of the few people I've ever met that I could have a really quick ""back and forth"" with because our brains were both really fast, buggy and filled with pop culture references and general snarkiness. 
He was as smart as fuck, funny as hell, a kick-ass writer and always pretty chipper despite having a horrible, abusive upbringing that involved moving from foster home to foster home, being sexually abused, burned with cigarettes, hooked on junk and turned out as a gay prostitute at 15 (even though he identified as straight). 
R.L was even more awesome for living through that hell and still being a person who had some love in him. 

R.L's release date came on fast and when he told me, I was ecstatic! We were both clean and I'd help him finally get his shit together. 
He had nowhere to go and despite the fact that I didn't have the room by any stretch of the imagination, I told him he was welcome to stay with us and I meant it.

I excitedly mentioned my friend coming to Larry in passing with no ulterior motive and Larry said ""he can stay with me if he wants"". 
Sweet! Lonely old guy, charismatic young punk looking to start fresh like I did, and avoidance of the whole ""guy on couch and I want to get laid, argggg fuck!” scenario. 
Everybody's happy! Great!

But…not great.

We had some wonderful time catching up, walking in the park, talking about our new found dreams, but after about 2 weeks past, I started getting a niggling feeling that he was using again. 

One early Saturday morning I was on my way to the clinic internship and decided to go say good morning to R.L before I left.
The door was ajar and I got goosebumps - the moment I saw R.L from the back I knew something was wrong. Larry was nowhere to be seen and R.L was reclined on the couch. I approached and saw he had half of a Mike's Hard Lemonade perfectly balanced on his chest. 

As you maybe already guessed, he was dead. 

Judging by the foam around his mouth and nose it was obvious to me it was a heroin overdose because I had seen them before and apparently it's a standard symptom of an opiate overdose (medulla suppression, involuntary breathing response stops, lining of lungs comes up in ""foam form"" blah blah blah.)
 
I still think it must have been a suicide because R.L was a seasoned user and any junkie knows never to mix junk and booze, or if you do, be careful.

Or maybe he thought his tolerance was higher than it was after being clean for awhile, which is a  common reason for O.Ds.

Regardless.

His skin was light grey, his eyes the palest China blue. 
I sat next to his body and took a long look at him, asked him why , expressed my anger and my sadness, told him that he was free now.  Eventually I called the cops and a coroner came within an hour, zipped him into a crinkly maroon body bag.

Before they left, one of them took R.L's cuff off his wrist and gave it to me like we give a dog's collar to the owner after euthanasia. Both touching and fucking heartbreaking.
If I hadn't have been there to tell them his full name, he would have been ""John Doe"". 

His birth certificate arrived in the mail the next day. I still carry it in my wallet to this day.

Understandably upset, I called the clinic and told them I wasn't going to make it. 
I sat in that apartment a long time waiting for Stoic to return from work.
Larry came back to the apartment hours later, visibly shaken. I didn’t have any words so I faced the wall struggling to find something to say.
He spoke first.

""I can't stay in this place anymore"" he said urgently, in a strained voice. 
""Ghosts! There's going to be ghosts! He died right there and now it's wide open and it's all your fault and now it's wide open! Wide open!""

""...Open?""  

He shrank and brought his arms up to his head like the sky was falling.

""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Fuck fuck fuck!"" He shouted, His eyes widened with fear. 
""They'll...hear...you!""

""Who will hear me, Larry?""

He leaned in conspiratorially and whispered 
""Them.  They know now.""

“Wait…who knows? What are you talking about?”

His eyes were wide and mad, rolling around in his head, his mouth agape and twisted into a grimace of horror that contorted is face into one of pure horror.  
He looked me straight in the eye and let out a long, ragged groan that chills me to think about.
Then before I could say anything further, as if answering a call I could not hear, he abruptly got up and walked away muttering to himself with his hands on his ears, swatting at things that weren't there. 

This was the first indication that he was a little...wonky. 
I figured he was just dealing with the death in his own way and respected his space.
 way and respected his space.

Part III is next: Women with stuff running out of all their orifices being stabbed and other delights."
1n0b5b,5,2013-09-23,Looking for guidance about presenting myself after some missed opportunities,cs-senior,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n0b5b/looking_for_guidance_about_presenting_myself/,"I am a nontraditional student at a great university for computer science, now entering my senior year. Overall I am very proud of what I have accomplished but am unsure of how to frame my accomplishments for a larger audience (ie interviewers). Looking for guidance with this as background:

At 30, I decided to pursue my computer science degree. Enrolled in community college for two years and did very well. Earned a 4.0, got involved in some on-campus research (with a CS component) and received campus-wide awards in physics in computer science. On the strength of these accomplishments I was accepted into a very selective CS program at my ideal university. 

Good stuff, but that was always to be just a means to get to the 4 year. I fully intended to pretend that the two years at community college never happened, given the stigma that might come attached. In order to do that, I knew that I would have to knock it out of the park for sophomore year: Maintain the GPA, get some projects under my belt and land a great internship. I was able to handle the first part, but due to a series of medical emergencies in my family, I was unable to make even an attempt on the resume builders.

I find myself in a strange position now as the career fairs approach. If I strike the community college period from my record, I have to lean strictly on academics. I fear that a great GPA may not be enough to land the interviews that I really desire, but my projects and awards come with baggage. The extra-curricular stuff is in association with my 2 year stint, and I don't know how that would be received. My personal portfolio has a few projects but they are older and not really fit for public consumption. I believe that I could put together a decent little personal project in the month that I have before the fairs, but would that be enough to really make a difference?

**TL;DR**ing it down to just some concrete questions:

1. **How do the larger companies view nontraditional students who may have attended a 2 year first?**
2. **On my resume, do I mention work I did at CC or just highlight the university academics?**
3. **I am 34 now, but appear quite young. Should I avoid mentioning anything that gives this away?**
4. **Should I be angling for an internship or full-time employment? If the later, how do I overcome not having had the former?**
5. **Would a small personal project be enough to change your advice about any of this?**

I am really aiming high for my employment. I do not worry that I will find myself unemployed, but I went for the degree to work on  interesting problems. Sitting across the table from the interviewer, I think I can deliver what they want. I just don't want to be culled before I get there."

Assuming the company is open to renegotiation how do I not sell myself short but also not look like a money grubbing whore? $20/hr is low end for my area on glass door which I honestly feel is completely reasonable for the job I'm doing anything more and I feel like I'd be milking the company and overpaid (not a bad thing for me but I don't see myself as the special cookie that deserves that)."

My situation is a bit unorthodox.,throwaway1090806,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1n4wu9/will_i_be_unhireable_my_situation_is_a_bit/,"Hey fellow engineers! I've been feeling a lot of anxiety lately over my hireability, and was wondering if I could get some advice.

I graduated from college with a degree in ECE in 2008 with a GPA of 3.2 - 3.3 (I don't really remember, but I did graduate with honors, which has a cutoff of 3.2). I had an internship with the Army in the summer of 2007, and decided to go work for a private defense contractor after graduation. I didn't really like it, and decided to change my career path, and took some post-bacc classes in premed with the intention of going to medical school (which seems stupid given my low GPA). I got A's and A-'s in the premed classes and did pretty ok on the MCAT, but didn't get into medical school unforch (waitlisted, probably because I applied pretty late.) 

I was intending on doing the post-bacc part-time while working full time (the program was designed to for working professionals), but about a month after I started the program I got laid off after working for about 1.5 years. I thought ok now is a good time to focus on getting into medicine, do the coursework and volunteering etc. Of course that didn't work out, and I thought that given I had spent the past three years trying for medicine that I would be unhireable, so my first attempt to get a job after all of this was to go back to my internship. They hired me back (a little too easily I would say), and I've been there since january of this year. However, now that sequestration has happened, and with very deep budget cuts looming in the future, I'm a worried about my job security at my current job, and wondering if anybody will hire me if I start looking for a job. What do?

Also another question: I want to become a better programmer because I think that would be a good skill that I can use no matter where my job takes me, as well as something I can put on my resume. What can I do? I have already taken a programming course in college, so I have a pretty good handle on the basics, but wouldn't mind brushing up again."
1n4uko,0,2013-09-25,Just moved to LA with no idea of how to land my first job. Would deeply appreciate any advice/wisdom.,SeekingYoAdvice,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1n4uko/just_moved_to_la_with_no_idea_of_how_to_land_my/,"I’ve been a great admirer of the beautiful and odd social experiment that is Reddit for the past year. That being said, up until now I have been a lurker in the most traditional sense. However, I find myself in great need of advice and can think of no better springboard than you fine folks. I am 25 years old and my life is kind of a mess.

I graduated from a respected college last year and had planned to move to Los Angeles a month or two after. Instead, my health quickly deteriorated and found out that I needed a gruesome surgical correction and spent the better part of this year bedridden and essentially immobile. I'm still in a huge amount of pain and my overall health is about what you’d expect after being immobile for that long.  	As of a month ago, I made it to central LA and am crashing at my friends place. but now I'm trying to find a job and it is proving to be uniquely difficult. I had a difficult/strange childhood which prevented me from working. I now find myself with a liberal arts degree and little practical experience. My resume consists of a smattering of internships and the odd summer job.  

However, I’m a creative, smart and hardworking guy. My life revolves around storytelling (with an emphasis on film) and I plan in the near future to try my hand at penning (or filming) reviews. I also have some video editing and music production study under my belt but these are all things I plan to improve on in my free time. But really, I just need a job to feed myself and pay rent. But as mentioned previously my resume is not impressive and the combination of high education and no consistent jobs isn’t impressing any employers. I’m not even getting callbacks for fast food employment. I’m a great interviewer but I haven’t been able to secure a single one. It’s embarrassing to admit it but I don't even know how to properly search for a job. I try to find places with hiring signs (can’t find many) and i scour Craigslist all day to no avail. 

I know this is getting pretty long so I’ll sum up. I would deeply appreciate ANY advice, I have been at this for over a month and things are starting to feel pretty bleak.     "

I'm in the top 10% of my high school. I have: 

- 4.2 weighted GPA, 3.8 unweighted. 
- 2000 SAT
- Planning on achieving a good score in SAT II Math and Physics (assume I earn 750 in both) 

::AP Courses with scores I achieved on exams: 
- AP Environmental Science (5)
- AP Calculus AB (5)
- AP Computer Science (4)
- AP Language and Composition (4)
::AP Courses in progress: 
- AP Physics
- AP Calculus BC

Some other things that I have done: 

- Won a hackathon competition in San Francisco. 100+ participants, and I was on a team with two others. 1st place. 
- Ran a small web development business during the summer of 2012
- This last summer, I had a paid summer internship at a cloud computing company (startup) 
based in san mateo, the co-founders both of which were Berkeley alumni
- I'm a self taught mobile software developer. Currently in the middle of developing a large scale iOS application (by myself) that I plan to put on the market. I plan on accomplishing this before November and writing about it in the personal statement (not 100% sure about 
completing it on time however). How much will its completion benefit me vs writing about its progress? 
- Started a ""Hackers @ ST"" club (ST is my high school) with a friend of mine, modeled after the well known ""Hackers @ Berkeley"" group. I am currently the vice president, where I am teaching 20 students programming. 

Assuming that I write a very well written personal statement, what are my chances of getting into UC Berkeley? It would be nice to assume that I DON'T get my iOS application project complete before then. Will I need to rely on that? It seems like a good hook. 

Any information will be helpful and much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

The internship is with a Fortune 500 oil and gas company, and the job entails data entry, Excel work, etc. Pretty basic stuff. Like I said, from what I have learned as a business student, my first instinct would be to wear a suit - if I'm overdressed, then it's not the end of the world, and it's surely a hell of a lot better than being underdressed.

But if there's a consensus here that a dress shirt and slacks would be more appropriate then maybe I should consider it. "
1n75uw,35,2013-09-26,Career Fair Tips! (Again!),erdero,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1n75uw/career_fair_tips_again/,"For the third year running, I'm posting some career fair tips for those of you who may be attending them soon.  I've been recruiting for my company for three years now, and these are all the things that have jumped out at me as things to do or avoid. These are really aimed at college career fairs, but most of it is universal.

* **Wear a suit / nice dress or skirt.** There was a surprising number of people there who looked like they just came from class, wearing whatever they were wearing, like a t-shirt and sweats.  If you've only got an hour between classes to go to the career fair, there's no shame in going to class in a suit, and you won't be the only one.  And when I say suit, that means black or blue, not tan. Don't do ""crazy"" or neon ties. If you want to stand out, make your resume stand out. Unique clothing can only negatively impact you. This year I saw some women wearing evening or party dresses. Please, wear work attire. If you don't *have* work attire, *get* work attire. That's the idea, isn't it?
* **Research the companies you want to work for.** If you come up to a recruiter and the first thing you say is ""What do you guys do?"" then you're going to have to fight your way out of the rejection pile. If you have a specific job posting or program you're looking for, that's perfect. It takes 30 seconds to step aside, take out your phone, and Google a company and what it has to offer.  If you're an aerospace engineer asking a video game company what they do, you're wasting your time, the recruiter's time, and anyone in line behind you's time.
* **Make eye contact.** There was very little behind me, but some people sure seemed to be looking for something. I want the impression that you're excited about what I'm telling you.
* **Points on resumes:** If there's something you really think the recruiter should see that's relevant, be sure to point it out, because we don't have time to go through the whole thing word-by-word. Before you talk to each recruiter, have one or two items on your resume that are relevant to the job, ready to point out. Also, use bullets, don't write paragraphs. Make sure everything's well-formatted and good-looking. Get someone, or even better, lots of people, to critique it for you. Make sure you keep it to a page. If you have so much stuff that there's just no way you can keep it to a page, make different resumes for different jobs (I have one for aero, one for general ME, etc).
* **List your objective.** Be as specific as you can be. If necessary, even print out different resumes with specialized objectives (CAUTION: Don't list the specific company. It can come off either as pandering or it gives away what you're doing). This gives the impression that you're excited about a certain field. A generic ""job in the mechanical engineering field"" is far too broad. I got a resume that just said ""Job.""
* **Be professional.** A few years ago, someone came up to me, put down a briefcase, handed me a seven-page resume (at least), patted me on the back and put his arm around me, and said ""get me a job."" ""What are you looking for?"" ""A job."" I was immediately looking for reasons to not give him a job.
* **List your GPA.** If you don't, I'll either ask or assume the worst.
If necessary, list your citizenship status. A lot of companies, including mine, can only hire US citizens or permanent residents due to government contracting. If you think I might have to ask, put it on the resume. It takes up practically zero room.
* **Ask questions.** What's the culture like where you work? What do you do on a daily basis? What benefits does the company have outside of work (sports, grad school, etc)? *Do you like it?* What *don't* you like about it?
* **Don't be nervous.** We're at the career fair because we want to find great people like you to work for us. You already know you'd be great, so just show us why.
* **Follow up.** If the recruiter gives you their contact information, and on the chance that resumes aren't already sorted into ""yes"" and ""no"" by the time the they leave, it's nice to send a follow-up ""Thank You"" email to whoever you talked to. If they were particularly impressed by an internship or project, re-highlight it to remind them (even the candidates we really like can run together after four hours).

1n738h,3,2013-09-26,"[Need Advice] I'm in a bit of a pickle, and I don't know what my best course of action is.",ZeroCool2390,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1n738h/need_advice_im_in_a_bit_of_a_pickle_and_i_dont/,"A little background first: I have been working at my current job a little over a year (started in July 2012). I live in a very expensive city, and have been saving little to no money each month. Most of my paycheck has gone towards rent, parking, and gas. I have alleviated this problem a little bit by leaving my car at a friend's house outside of the city, and commuting by train.

Moving on, the job itself has made me miserable (market research, for anyone wondering). My supervisor is dishonest, quick to judge, and there is little to no actual research done with each project I work on. It took me a few months to pick up on this, but according to a coworker who has been here for 5+ years, this is how it has always been done. Every day spent here feels like a waste of time, and that I could be learning so much more elsewhere, rather than sitting on Reddit for a part of the day, and listening to my supervisor pull data out of her ass for the rest of it. Therefore, I have decided to look for another job.

Thinking long term, I cannot afford the city I live in much longer, and rent prices continue to skyrocket. I also want to change my career path to something other than market research (considering marketing and advertising). I have been looking for jobs near another major city by my hometown, about 5 hours away from where I currently live. 

My problem is this: It seems as though I am in a terrible position to make a career switch. Many of the entry level positions I am looking at in marketing and advertising require skills and experience that I do not have. I have done some of my own research, and am considering getting AdWords certified to boost my resume a bit. I have also looked at internships, but the vast majority require candidates to be enrolled in a university program, whereas I graduated in 2012. 

I understand that the choice is ultimately mine, but I'd like to get some other opinions on the matter: If you were completely miserable at your current job, would it be worth quitting and moving back home for a bit to find something better? I am also keeping in mind the fact that if I do decide to quit, I risk being unemployed for much longer than anticipated. What, in your opinion, is the best course of action in this scenario? And for those of you in marketing or advertising, what advice do you have for someone with one year of work experience who is trying to make a career change and break into those industries?"
1n71ay,6,2013-09-26,CS student cannot find employment four months after graduation,heartqueen0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n71ay/cs_student_cannot_find_employment_four_months/,"I graduated in May, and I've had minor success with one company (invited to a second interview).  The main reason for this is my lack of internship or work experience.  I was an athlete through my second year of college, and I was not able to take courses in the summer afterwords. 

It's been a few months and only recruiting agencies are contacting me.  Will creating a website, hosting personal projects on it, and placing the url on my resume entice companies to pursue me?  

Also, could it be that my location has a lack of need for programmers?   I live in near a major city in Ohio where most jobs are Java / C# .NET positions.  Are these employers averse to hiring young programmers?

EDIT: Every recruiter I've spoken to has said they will contact me with jobs that have salaries in the range $35,000 - $40,000.  This seems much lower than the average.  At four months without employment, should I take anything that comes up to get experience, or is it worth finding a higher paying position? "

Also, I think I'm a little under-qualified for my position, because although I had some experience with C++ in school (took a class that spent a month covering it, and then another class in graphics where I spent a semester writing a ray tracer in it), I have a difficult time reading other people's code.

We're getting towards the end though, I have two carts left to do at one school and I'm done with that part of it. Eventually we have to go around and add them to the domain and add the printers and all the other fun stuff. 

But what should I ASK to see and work with? Obviously they aren't going to give me the log in details to all their servers because of student records and such, but they can sure show me some of it and let me work with it (heavily supervised, of course). I have worked with one tech that likes me enough to give me the credentials to log into most Windows 7 PCs in the county, but my supervisor doesn't know that. He has expressed to me that if I work with him more often that he would show me some of the server and database stuff he's assigned to, but chances are I'm not going to work with him THAT often, as there is a lot of ""bitch work"" for me to do. 

I have discussed with him that I would like to see more, and he knows I want to and respects that. He said after these carts are done in a couple weeks I would be getting into more interesting stuff. But is there anything I should ask to specifically see? "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Congratulations on your recent successes. My question is - at any point in time, did you not even feel a hint of suspicion for her age? While one can argue that some people mature early, I'm considering the limited perspective a 14 year old (grade 8-9\) would bring to a relationship with someone who is almost 6 years removed from high school. What was it about her that made you attracted to her? Was she simply attractive or was there more?  Sorry that's a lot of questions dude. Feel free to only answer the ones you feel are relevant. Edit: corrected original post because I assumed she was in grade 8, may have been grade 9?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgz15?context=5)|There were a few things that made me suspicious, but I was met with denials.  The initial attraction was physical.  As things progressed, the attention became nice.  At that point, I was living in an abusive household.  My stepfather was verbally and physically abusive to me, my sister, and mother.  He once spray my mother with lighter fluid and threatened...Anyway, it was nice to have some positive attention, and not be worried all the time.
[Oh, and a question... not sure if this has been answered yet, but I've read through most of the comments and haven't seen it. I imagine this young lady is an adult now. Have you had any contact with her? If so what did you talk about, and if not, what do you think you would say to her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfk943?context=5)|She sent me an apology a few times for a few years.  I have not heard from her in a long time.
 |I'm not really sure what I'd say.  I'd probably be, what we call in the shop, ""Jammed up"".  I feel like part of me would have angry things to say, and part would hope that this incident hasnt made her life anywhere near as hard as mine.
[Why didn't the involved girl come forward and admit to lying about her age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgxof?context=5)|She did.  In NY, the state takes over and presses the charges in cases like this.  I stated in the other S.O. related topic today...In NY, and some other states, she could show me an ID, that would scan (our id's have 3d barcodes), and I'd still be held responsible.  If I had met her in a bar, and say we had sex in the bathroom, I'm still responsible.  Even though she's in an environment that needs ID to enter, it's all on me.  
[Whoa. When I turned 18 the family lawyer, at a social occasion, gave me a reminder that when I went off to college that a statement made in good faith was the key to being clear on this. Different state of course.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccficpv?context=5)|I could only wish it was like this here.  I find it interesting to see the variations in the laws from place to place.  Even the age of consent variations is interesting.  It just seems silly to think, ""ok, in this box you can have sex with X person in whatever style you wish.  But in that box, if you do it, you go to jail.""  Where's the cohesion.
[Isn't it like, if you're underage you can't legally give consent? Like, consent doesn't count because you're a minor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfk214?context=5)|You are correct.
[At what level do you evolve? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgu01?context=5)|It would have to be 3.  At 3 you evolve into a child-napping predator.  Unless of course you can beat the state into submission and get your conviction overturned.  Then you evolve back into a human again!
[What are your thoughts on the sex offender registry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfhbio?context=5)|I think it needs reform.  If you forcefully hurt a woman, you should be there.  Maybe not forever.  But just long enough.  I also think certain crimes should be nowhere near that list, and that certain crimes should have exceptions.
[What has the dating scene been like for you since your conviction? Are you legally obligated to tell prospective partners about your history? If you aren't, would you anyway?  Really respect you coming on here to talk about this, it's easy to stigmatize this kind of thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgxpm?context=5)|Dating is on and off.  More on than off.  In 8 years since it's happened, maybe only 3 woman have totally freaked out and said horrible stuff.  A few mysteriously vanish, never to be heard from again.  But mostly, woman understand.  They were young too, and know what they did to entice older guys.  I've dated many woman with kids who were totally fine with them around me.  The kids loved me, and they were great.  I'm not obligated to tell anyone...Except the PD when I move.  I do tell 97% of the woman I meet.  I have told every woman that I've met, that I felt there was something special.  The unknowing 3%, simply don't know because I didn't think they're worth telling.
[Do you have to tell all your neighbors that you are a sex offender? If so what where some of the reactions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfhucx?context=5)|I do not have to.  The school district I live in will handle that for me.  They send out a letter to my neighbors.  My landlord is very well known where I live.  He owns 2 very lucrative beer distributors, so he knows many many people.  At first everyone is nervous.  But just like a cold, it spreads.  First one finds out, Hey, he's not so bad a guy...And they tell a neighbor, and that neighbor tells a neighbor.  Sure there's a few with a good immune system and don't give 2 flying shits what anyone has to say.  They let the TV and newspaper do the thinking for them.  Here's a good story.
 |Where I am now...Very very big house.  Landlord got divorced, wife left him the house.  I was renting a small studio, which was the original garage before the 3 car was built.  There was a huge mother daughter built upstairs of the 3 car, with a mom and 15 year old daughter.  I initially did not tell the landlord my situation.  But when the mom found out, she flipped the F out and stopped paying her rent till he evicted me.  I was served notice to leave, but she still would not pay till I was gone.  Finally the landlord said fuck it.  Pay me the rent, and you stay, I'll serve her tomorrow.  I did, and he did.  After he evicted her, he gave me her huge apartment for the same price I was paying for the studio.  And here I sit, 2 years later in this house, 1 year later in this apartment. 
[Woah... glad that worked out for you, but that's kinda fucked on his part.  I mean, it's not like she had the benefit of the full explanation you've given us here, ya know?  I'd probably be uncomfortable with a surprise like that too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfig1b?context=5)|I don't blame him.  We were not close at that point in time, and to be honest.  If I was in his situation, there's a good chance I may have acted similarly.  He's a smart man though, and was able to figure it out.  
[Did you get treated differently in jail, being a kiddy diddler and all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgyz2?context=5)|I initially signed into protective custody.  When I tell you the amount of little girl BS these men would do on the daily.  I couldn't take it.  I signed out of P.C., got a job in the kitchen, and told everyone I was there for street racing.
[Gotta say, street racing is an awesome cover. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfhe17?context=5)|I had enough material and knowledge to cover the story.  At the time I had a built up Cavalier Z24.  I had lots of pictures of it with me.  It was my pride at the time.  Motor swap, trans swap, the works.  Everyone thought it was cool because they thought it was a granny car.
[I heard it's not uncommon for prisoners to reach out to people on the outside to pull public records to check on what other people are in for. Were you ever worried about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfjnum?context=5)|It is true.  The WebCrims website will give you all that info if the person is still going to court.  It's all in your attitude and how you present yourself.  If you give someone a funny feeling, they're going to do a little digging.  I was a skinny white boy with a shit ton of car magazines, and pictures of a car I built that nobody had ever seen built up before.
[Did you have problems with the other inmates when they found out what you were convicted for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfh4yq?context=5)|In the holding cell at court, you're stored like cattle 20 deep in a 20x7 cell waiting to be called by the judge.  My legal aid came right to the cell and just spilled the beans.  When he left, I turned around to a not so nice site.  This big...named Country introduced me to his fist.
 |While in the kitchen, there was another sex offender, under cover working too.  He was a piece of shit though.  He sold crack to an old woman in exchange for a few nights with her underage granddaughter.  An officer who did not like that, whispered to the crew, ""one of you is a rapist"" and walked off.  The crew found out it was him, but I signed back into p.c. anyway in fear he might say something again.  I soon got sick of the nancy bullshit and signed back out, and into the kitchen again.  That.
[Can you ever appeal the level? Or perhaps slowly bring it down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfi7aj?context=5)|New York is very hard on your level.  I can hire an attorney and appeal my conviction, or I could go right to the criminal justice services and demand a re-level hearing with a lawyer.  In the end, I'm just going to save my money and move someplace I don't have to register, like North Carolina.  NY can suck it.
[VT - I have a friend in a similar situation and he lives in VT now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfjzku?context=5)|Yes from what I hear, all the upper north east states are not easy on sex offenders, but FAIR.  Maine has a step-down clause where your level slowly lowers!
[Did you lose any friends afterwards? Did your good friends come to visit you in jail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfj9oe?context=5)|I did, and good riddens to them.  Some people like to say mean things when you do something that's not in accord with what they want.  I was staying at a friends once, and his landlord said I had to leave...that night, now, GTFO type shit.  But my ""friend"" Brandon needed a ride to court the next morning.  He insisted I stay so i could drive him to court.  I insisted I didnt feel comfortable because the landlord lived in the house with him.  Now all of a sudden I'm a rapist pedophile blah blah.  Fuck him and everyone like him.  I'd rather it come out just like that because I don't want anyone in my life that would even fathom acting like that.  2 days before I was arrested, I had found a friend on Facebook from school I grew up with and lost contact with.  In jail I had no way of contacting her...But sure as shit within 3 days of being arrested, she surprise visited me.  First time I saw her in over 10 years.  Love you Kristen ;-)
[It sounds like you had a shitty experience with your lawyers- any advice you'd have for someone facing charges?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfh5w1?context=5)|NO LEGAL AID!  Get someone that has a stake in your livelihood!  Not some overloaded post grad school dweeb that needs to unload his work schedule.  Get someone that truly has the need to help people in their heart!
[How old did she look?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgv32?context=5)|That's a silly question to ask. A major point here is that you can not judge a woman by looks anymore.  We will leave it at, she looked old enough to be dating, and gave no indication of being so young.
[If you both lived with your parents, where did you have sex / hang out at ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfjybl?context=5)|Cars, neighborhood hangout spots, movie theater, the mall, friends houses.  There's plenty of places to go without having to hang out at home.
[If you could've changed the situation, what would you have done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfh2om?context=5)|Kept my dick in my pants?  How about that for starters lol.  I would definitely vet her id a little better.
[I am curious as to what the worst case scenario could have been if you had not cooperated as you did. The way you word this makes it seem that you were calm the whole time. Did you ever let out any anger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfipcq?context=5)|I was terrified through the entire ordeal.  I didn't have a lawyer or anyone on my side during questioning.  I was alone.  After I was released I was a very angry person.  To this day sometimes it gets out.  Maybe once every 2 months I'll have an outburst.  I was reckless upon release.  I didn't care who I screwed over for what.  As long as in the end, I came out on top.  I drove without a license and got arrested for that countless times.  I let out my anger on myself by letting my life go to shit, or at least take a downward spiral.  In NY, Rape 3 is an E Felony, which mandates 1-3 years upstate.  You only usually get the mandated sentences when you're a problem repeat offender.  Long Island jails are literally so overcrowded they have inmates sleeping in the jail gymnasium, and I shit you not, outside in a fucking circus tent on the jail property.  Suffolk County Jail, top right corner, the white pill looking thing is the tent.

My family was hurt.  My drug addicted step-father was the only one hurtful about the whole thing.  Whenever he'd get mad, or just be too fucked up to comprehend what he was saying, he'd throw some pretty hurtful terms around.  He can rot in hell.  :-D.
[Are you afraid of having to look for another job?  It seems that your résumé would get thrown away immediately w/o consideration because of your past. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfk79m?context=5)|No I usually find jobs pretty easily.  I have great references from previous employers.  I work hard, and always look to better my skills.  My resume is actually very nice.  I have 3 FAA internships I did right before this whole fiasco along with a bunch of other nice stuff.  The field I'm in is usually employed by people that lived an unsavory lifestyle at one time anyway, so unless I'm shooting to work for the MTA, or maybe a dealership, I'm good.  I've actually done high end dealership work before, and it's not for me.  The same problems day in and day out on the same vehicles.  I'm the foreman at a diesel repair shop now.  I touch everything from little forklifts to cranes that could lift our main building off it's foundation.  The work varies greatly and keeps my ADD in check :-)

How do you go about telling your story to someone you like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfh1h3?context=5)|I don't tell a prospective partner right away.  I prefer to let them see who I am for a few weeks.  The lifestyle I life, the people I associate with.  As I begin to feel something might be there, I get very anxious.  It builds and builds and builds.  Sometimes it comes to a point of an emotional breakdown, and I HAVE to spill it, no matter what's going on.  
[I don't have a question, but I wish you the very best of luck. You're very strong to have pulled through this far, and I do hope you continue to move onward and upward.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfh9tp?context=5)|Thank you for the comment.

1n5ajf,1,2013-09-25,"As an EE, how do you approach a software internship interview?",NotCloseToFour,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1n5ajf/as_an_ee_how_do_you_approach_a_software/,"TL;DR: Pretty much I am an EE interviewing for a software intern position.  I have some programming experience, but obviously not as much as someone whose degree is focused on computer science.  How can I prepare for this interview?  What are the common technical interview questions that are asked when interviewing for a position like this?  Any resources/cheat sheets to help learn some of the most basic, interviewed concepts?
-----------


Hi everyone,

My school recently held a huge career fair that had around 200 companies at it.  I applied to many different companies, all ranging in different markets and specializations, and I just scheduled an interview with a large, well-known hardware and software company that I would really like to work for.  This company was only recruiting for software positions at my university, so I applied to the position that they were recruiting for, as well as many other hardware and software positions on their website.

My background/interests really kind of lie at the intersection of hardware and software.  If I could go back and do it again, I would probably have gone the computer engineering route that my school offers, but I thought electrical engineering would be more broad (thus more applicable).  So at this point, I am taking most of my core EE courses (electronics, power systems, electromagnetics, signals and systems) and I plan on filling my technical electives with mostly computer related classes (digital logic design, computer architecture, HDLs, mixed signal electronics).  I am also in the process of completing a computer science minor (I have finished 2 of 5 classes).  What I hope to do when I graduate is kind of computers/embedded systems.  I like both the hardware and software aspects of devices.  I like playing around with microcontrollers like the Arduino, and building circuits as well as writing software.  I want to connect devices to the world/internet.

The predicament that I am in is that I have extremely limited software experience.  The two computer science classes I have taken this far have taught me the fundamentals of C++ as well as introduced me to data structures and algorithms.  I have also taught myself and played around with Python on my own time, as well as know how to program microcontrollers in assembly and C.  Pretty much, I have a decent amount of software experience, but probably no where near the amount needed for this position.

I guess what I would like to ask is how should I approach this interview.  I was thinking that I should really accentuate the fact that I am very interested in what the company does and the fact that I am willing to learn whatever it is that they would need me to.  Its not like I do not want a software position, it is just that I do not have all of the knowledge needed.  Are there any online resources/ cheat sheets on how to get up to speed on some of the more relevant computer science concepts that are asked most at interviews?  I am starting at a pretty good point where I know C++ very well.

BTW, I am trying to figure out why I received this interview in the first place.  Pretty much, I talked to them at the career fair and then submitted my resume online.  My resume mostly says everything that I already said plus I have a very high GPA (I have only had one class that I haven't gotten an A in).  Would that give out interviews based solely on my high GPA, or do they (hopefully) think that my resume is relevant enough to have a good shot at this position?  I am a junior if that matters.

Thank you for your help!"
1na6ub,2,2013-09-27,Dream interview in a few days and I'm getting anxious. Any tips?,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1na6ub/dream_interview_in_a_few_days_and_im_getting/,"I have an internship interview for a finance business analyst position at and it's starting to get to me. It's probably my dream position and would be amazing to get. I plan on studying up on the company some more, making résumé visuals, and going to the interview pre night presentation. The biggest problem at this point is psyching myself out. It's in a few days and in the early morning if that changes things. Some of the job responsibilities are things I've never done before as well such as strategic project valuation, should cost modeling, etc. should I find out what these things are and how to do them?

 Any advice for me? Thanks guys

So, Im in need of a second set of hands and I think I have my boss convinced to let me get an intern for a few months, with the possibility of hiring him on later as a junior admin.  I have a candidate picked out, he's ready to learn and I think I'll be able suck up any information I feed him.   What I dont know is, what should I start him out with?  Dude is going to be greener than green, no formal training, only home lab/playing around.


So far, Im thinking start him out with some simple terminology stuff, not necessarily how to do anything, but just so he's got a familiarization and concept of what does what. RAID levels, IP schemes, DHCP, DNS, AD, GP, various MS products, as we a 98% MS shop.  

Does anyone have any resources, preferably free, that will introduce a former HVAC tech and cop to the concepts of the corporate IT world?   My biggest goal is to get him to the point where he knows what to look for and how to find the answer.  6-step troubleshooting, some independance before he escalates to me."

[Have you ever turned away specimens that for whatever reason didn't make the cut?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeqlj?context=5)|I will turn away any human specimen with an unknown provenance (origin). Without knowing where they came from and documentation for proof, there’s no way to know they weren’t stolen or acquired on the black market, and i won’t accept them.
[What's your favorite bone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgep0o?context=5)|Heh heh heh.
[Does the Mütter risk legitimizing, trivializing, or glamorizing dermatillomania through the publicity it's granted to the young woman who sent you the jars? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeycj?context=5)|Good question! The reason I accepted the skin is it's a physical manifestation of a mental condition. It's very hard to get ""specimens"" that adequately illustrate mental disorders. I consider this a valuable teaching tool to educate the public about this condition. All I want to do is bring it to light, tell it like it is, and show what it can do, and it's all with her consent.  
[What item has affected you most profoundly on a personal level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf3zx?context=5)|We have a 3mm kidney stone extracted from yours truly. That was pretty darn personal. 
[I love your museum.  I took my pre-teen and a friend and must tell you that the wax models of the effects of Syphilis, and the skulls with the caries from Syphilis are WAY more effective safe sex education than any abstinence program. They were horrified.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfnp2?context=5)|No, we are fairly confident she did not die of Yellow Fever.

Did she die of yellow fever?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfnp2?context=5)|I also think the syphilis models are effective too, but that's one of the reasons I'm no longer allowed to give tours to schoolchildren. 
[So excited that you're here! Just visited for the first time a few months ago, and noticed that there isn't a lot of explanation of the medical conditions causing the deformities in some of the specimens on display. Is that by design (i.e., are you hoping visitors will research the info on their own time\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeixh?context=5)|Great question! Originally the labels were written for doctor or medical students who visited the museum. Now we get over 138,000 visitors through our doors, most of whom have no medical background. We are now in the process of rewriting these labels to provide more information. 
[What is your favorite item?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeaik?context=5)|Asking me my favorite item is like asking me my favorite child! Oh wait, I do have a favorite child. He's my only child.
[Is that jar of skin from this person, who posted on reddit a little while back that she peels her skin off and donates it to the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf48z?context=5)|That's her!

And he's really expensive, so be brief.
 |In terms of museum acquisition, we are very careful to make sure we have all the necessary provenance/paperwork/needed documentation. 
[Do you have any advice for a college grad trying to professionally enter the museum field in Philly or anywhere else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgejic?context=5)|It’s all about making connections. People don’t like working for free, but interning is really the best way to get a foot in the door. Work at a museum as an intern, make yourself indispensible, and just might find them making a position for you.
[I heard that you have the hips of your communications director.  Your CEO just had his knee replaced. Clearly, the Mütter exacts a terrible toll on its caretakers.

Has anyone willed you their own parts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeu4t?context=5)|We have a significant amount of primary donations. These are living individuals who have donated parts of their own body. For example, we have femoral heads from hip transplants, kidney stones, pieces of skin cancer, the picked skin in jars, and the aforementioned gallbladder.
 |We can't accept full body donations at this time, though we often get inquiries. 
[As a member of the Vidocq Society have you helped to solve any mysteries? What are you currently working on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgemcj?context=5)|I am a relatively new member to the Vidocq and I don’t think any of the cases I’ve consulted on have been solved.

[Your museum is one of the nicest things in Philly, thanks for doing what you do. How plausible would it be to take parts of your exhibit on tour (ala the human bodies exhibit\)?

We've explored and continue to explore the options. Needless to say, our collection poses unique challenges in terms of transport. And they get homesick! 
[I've always been fascinated by the fact that the dwarf skeleton on display belonged to a prostitute. The stories behind the specimens are just as intriguing as the specimens themselves.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf19u?context=5)|We don't actually know she was a prostitute. We know only that she gave birth in a brothel.
[What is your favorite item that is on display in the museum, as well what what's your favorite that isn't on display and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf19u?context=5)|My favorite item NOT on display is my husband's gallbladder. I'm working on preserving it. And you know what? That was the LAST time he insulted my cooking. 
[Why does the museum not allow photos? Why not just prohibit usage of flash?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfodx?context=5)|There have been too many complaints from the specimens.

What made you want to do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgffvd?context=5)|I started coming to the Mutter when I was seven years old. I grew up going to museums all over Philadelphia. I started out as an archeologist, moved to physical/forensic anthropology, did human rights work in Peru, and in 2004 I answered an ad for an assistant collections manager at the Mutter, and I've been here ever since.
 |What made me want to do it? Former director Gretchen Worden's joy and enthusiasm about the museum inspired me. You should look for clips of her on Letterman back in the day with items from the museum. 
[What's the ding-dong situation there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeyn0?context=5)|We are from Philly. We prefer Tastycakes.

[What other collections do you believe are up to the same high standards as the Mütter? Have you seen the bottled freaks at Kunstkamera in St Petersburg?

Last year, I enrolled in UCSB as a CS major. But because of my family's financial situation, I decided to transfer out of UCSB and attend a community college located in the middle of the Bay Area for a year and reapply to SB or a higher tier CS school. My grades at SB weren't bad, as my overall GPA was 3.7.  I have realized that most students apply for internships during their sophomore year and I am well aware that many tech companies come to individual universities to recruit students. I really doubt that many tech companies will come to recruit at my community college. I'm worried that I'll be at a huge disadvantage for applying to internships. Has anyone ever found an internship as a CC student?

1n8bfn,3,2013-09-27,[internship] CTO just asked me for code samples. What/how exactly do I send?,Ntopper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n8bfn/internship_cto_just_asked_me_for_code_samples/,"I applied for a limited admission night class that a local tech company offers. They told me I was overqualified, but I might make a good intern. A few days later the CTO emailed me asking for a resume and code samples. He told me that they are primarily looking for PHP, JS, HTML/CSS, iOS, and Android.   
   
I am pretty good with jquery. Not fluent, but I can write some good code with the documentation. However I am self thought in JS.   
   
I have a lot of code, and a lot of bad code from my learly projects. Here's some of my good code:   
   
I was given a 5000 line HTML document (for mobile phones) The document was full of check boxes each associated with a particular LI, and each LI represented a seminar at a convention.  The LI's were divided by by ""list-dividers"", each representing a particular time slot on a schedule. If a check box is checked, it's corresponding Li should be visible, and vice-versa. if no check-boxes on a particular time slot are checked, that time slot divider should not be invisible. And the states of the hidden or visible, and checked or unchecked boxes should be persistent between sessions, and it all needed to happen on the client side. Here's what I came up with:
   
     

//this global is used to enable or disable the block that usually occurs when any checkbox is changed. Disabling the block called in the handler prevents an infinite recursion of the set_visibility function.
ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER = true;

//here I iterate through every checkbox in the document, compair it's to the cookies saved, and update the states of the checkboxes and visibility of the corresponding list elements	   
function set_visibility() 
{

	ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER = false;//very important, avoids infinite recursion, as this function is called in the checkbox changed handler when this is true. 

	//for each checkbox
	$(""input[type='checkbox']"").each( function() 
	{

	        //get the id of the checkbox
	        _checkbox_id = $(this).attr(""id"").replace(""checkbox-mini-c"", """");//I dont want the checkbox-mini-c substring. 
	    
	        //get the state of the cookie associated with the checkbox, is it ""true""?
	        _cookie_state = (($.cookie( _checkbox_id)) == ""true"");// this parses the ""true"" string to a true boolean, or _cookie_state is false.
	   
                //get the class of the checkbox, to modify the visibility of the list devider
		_checkbox_class= $(this).attr(""class"");
 
	        //this sets the state of the checkbox, according to the value parsed from the cookie
	        $(this).prop('checked', _cookie_state);
        
	        //show or hide the LI
	        if (_cookie_state)
	        {
	       		$(""#l"" + _checkbox_id).show();
	        }
		else 
	    	{
	        	$(""#l"" + _checkbox_id).hide();
	    	}
 
                //here we modify the visibility of the list devider associated with the class of the checkbox
                if  ($('input.' + _checkbox_class + ':checkbox:checked').length &gt; 0)
	        {
	       		$(""#l"" + _checkbox_class).show();
	        }
		else 
	    	{
	        	$(""#l"" + _checkbox_class).hide();
	    	}     
 
		ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER = true;//now we enable the changed handler again, so it will respond to events by the user.
	
	})
}

$(document).ready(function() 
{

	//first we check all existing cookies and update the states of the checkboxes and list elements
	set_visibility(); 

	//when any checkbox is changed:   
	$(""input[type='checkbox']"").change( function() 

	{ 
		 //this is set to false withing the set visibility function, to avoid an infinite recursion 
		 if(ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER) 
		 {

		 	//get the relevent data about the checkbox, the ID and the state
		 	checkbox_state = $(this).is(':checked');
		 	class_id = $(this).attr(""id"").replace(""checkbox-mini-c"", """");//I dont want the checkbox-mini-c substring. 

		 	//now we save the cookie, refrenenced by the class number, (I got those from the checkbox ID's)
		 	//the value of the cookie is ""true"" or ""false""
		 	$.cookie( class_id,  checkbox_state);

		 	//and finaly we call the function that itterate through all the cookies and sets the visibility of the li's accordingly
		 	set_visibility(); 
	 	 }
	});



});    
    
Here it is in action:   
http://home.ite.sfcollege.edu/~nicholas.topper/clints_mobile_site_working_cookies/   
   
Is that what the CTO would be looking for? Should I put it on Github or something? Or do I just send the file as an attachment?    
   
I also have this website I made for a basic HTML/CSS class. I was restricted to XHTML 1.0 Strict:   
http://home.ite.sfcollege.edu/~nicholas.topper/final_project/

Is that relevant? and should I just link to it? Or again should I be putting it on github or sending a file?   
   
I also have big projects that I have done from start to finish, but the code is not pretty. I made a big windows 8 app in HTML/CSS/JQUERY from start to finish. It's called ""Molar Mass"" and has had some success in the app store. But the code is really messy. It's basically file with a bunch of weird functions that manipulate text fields and and make letters into numbers. It works beautiful, but I think it looks like spaghetti. But the app works great, and I'm proud of the final project. I'm just told that ""bad code &lt; No Code"". So I have enough to send him between those two projects? Or should I clean up that project and send it as well? 

I also have some python/webapp2 stuff but I'm afraid to send it, because viewing the source of that one compromises security, and again it's not great, ans I was just learning. Should I express somehow that I do know how server side code works? I am going to mention one semester of training in C# for .net in my resume.
   
I/m going to be away from my computer until Saturday but I was thinking about making some of my bad code presentable on Saturday before sending it. Unless what I posted above is enough.   
   
**TLDR: How much code should I send? Is bad code worse than no code? Should I put it on github or just attach files?**   
   
I'm going to be away from my computer for a day or two but before the end of the weekend I am going to send some code over.    
   
Thanks for the advice! 
   
Another question, I don't know if it's paid or unpaid. Are unpaid internships worth the time? "
1n81cq,2,2013-09-26,Relocating to a national lab,noitsthursday,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1n81cq/relocating_to_a_national_lab/,"Has anyone relocated during their PhD for research reasons, and how did it go? I know that internships are fairly common in engineering and computer science, while in other fields, like particle physics, students often do the majority of grad school away from their university, and I would like to hear about some of your experiences.

I am asking because my advisor offered me a chance to relocate to a national lab for two years while working on my PhD, and I am not sure if I want to take the offer. I realize that it is a great opportunity and could help propel my career forward, but I am not sure if I want to relocate in the middle of grad school. If I do take the offer, I would still be working for her because she has appointments at the national lab and my university, and I could incorporate all of my research so far, so it will not hamper my progress. Also, it would give me a chance to network, gain valuable experience and work with some highly talented individuals. But while I am excited about the research opportunities, I am hesitant about the more personal aspects of moving.

I can explain more if it helps, but the short of it is that I love the city that my university is in, and I have developed some surprisingly deep friendships (one in particular has the potential to become something more) that I do not want to run out on. In contrast, the national lab is in a suburb of a different city and mostly caters to families and people that commute into that city. As a result, the suburb is rather dull, and many of the advantages I currently have living near the heart of a city are absent.

If I turn down the offer, I will probably stay in the group doing similar experiments to the ones that I have been doing so far. I will still occasionally go to the national lab to do the experiments that we can only do there, but it would be only once every two months or so. I don’t want to pass up on an offer that could potentially help me out a lot in the long run, but at the same time, I don’t really want to move again.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did it go? Does anyone have any advice on how to approach deciding? I realize that ultimately I have to decide for myself, but I would like to hear about other peoples' experiences."

I'm looking for someone who'd be happy to do a series of ongoing little jobs around the site. The site is expanding and I can't handle it all by myself anymore.

The work will mostly involve things like:

- Taking documents (containing text, images, tables, etc.) and converting them in to web pages.
- Small code improvements and updates.
- Formatting/updating pages
- Fixing errors
- Small site-wide updates
- Intergrating scripts

Ideally, once you're familiar with how the website works, I'd like to assign you tasks and give you the freedom to find your own intuitive solutions. I'll try and give you as much creative freedom as I can.

This job would be perfect for anyone who has a working knowledge of HTML/CSS, and wants to earn some money on the side whilst they practice their skills. An interest in PHP would be a huge bonus, as well as a basic understanding of Photoshop. Javascript would be a minor bonus.

I'm meticulous when it comes to the structure and function of the website, so I'm looking for someone who's a bit of a perfectionist. I'm a pixel-perfect kind of guy. If that's not you, for your own sanity don't put yourself up for the job. I also want someone who is good at organising data - someone who can take information and display it in a usable way. But most of all, I want you to _enjoy_ front-end web development.

*Payment:* $500/month for two months, like an ""internship"". Then we'll see how things are going after that. I'm flexible.

*Hours:* I wouldn't expect you to spend longer than 1-2 hours a day on this stuff, so it would make an ideal part-time job from the comfort of your own home. You can spend longer on it if you enjoy the challenges though.

*Location:* Remote. We can just collaborate over Evernote.

Send me a message if you're interested. Tell me about yourself - how old you are, where you're from, what you like doing - all that kind of stuff. Write as if you're speaking to a friend. I'll get back to you if you sound like a good fit."
1nbr2o,69,2013-09-28,"Four years out from law school, I finally have a full-time, long-term, career-suitable job!",Self_Improving_JD,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1nbr2o/four_years_out_from_law_school_i_finally_have_a/,"**TL;DR** - I came out of law school right at the middle of the industry crash. After three years of doc review interspersed with unsatisfactory small firm/solo practitioner work (including one place that outright fired me before I could resign), I finally landed a great job at a newly-formed law firm. I'd say it was based maybe 15% on my professional skills, 20% on networking and making contacts, and 65% on just being there in the right place at the right time.

**The long version:**

2009: Graduated law school, passed the bar exam. I knew I wanted to do something international, as I can speak three languages. But I didn't know what. Just to keep some money coming in, I signed up for the document review contract attorney positions. I decided that in addition to the day job as a contract attorney, I would continue to network and try to get where I wanted to be: an actual legal practitioner in a law firm.

2010: I went to networking events for international law issues, and I met numerous lawyers. One lawyer, **Alcibiades**, needed help with their solo practice, which did the usual small-time firm stuff (tenancy cases, wills and estates, contracts), but occasionally had int'l law cases.

**Alcibiades**: This position was unpaid, and I worked for them for about a year, on and off, while I also did doc review. The work was in Antidumping/Countervailing Duties investigations. I suppose their practice never really took off, as they steadfastly said they couldn't afford to pay me. I took that as a sign that they would be a useful resume builder (so that I could at least show some substantive practice of law for that year instead of simple doc review) but a non-starter as far as law career was concerned.

2011: I got put on a big contract attorney project at $35/hour which ended up lasting a year. However, I was aware that an entire year with no substantive practice to my name could count against me if I ever wanted to leave the doc review industry (I did). So I asked Alcibiades whether they knew any other solos who needed help.

2012: **Beershabba**: It turns out that Alcibiades knew Beershabba from their time in gov't together, and I took a break from doc review to help Beershabba. They had a small practice that did some family law, landlord-tenant, contract, business, and wills and estates law, but their main draw was the fact that they focused on a language that I could speak. They also did some AD-CVD law (international trade law) and they wanted to expand into immigration law, especially investor immigrant cases. It turned out that they never made this switch - it's a hard task to branch into a completely new field of law, and it's even harder when you already have a full caseload of traffic court cases, landlord-tenant cases, and domestic separation/divorce cases vying for your attention.

Beershabba could only employ me for afternoon work, but they knew another lawyer out of state, **Caernilin**, who needed clerking work done remotely. I started doing morning work for Caernilin and then going to Beershabba's solo practice in the afternoons. Both positions paid me $20/hr.

The Beershabba placement was not a very good fit for me. The attorney's personality and problem solving approach were confusing to me, and I often made mistakes or performed work in a way that was incompatible with them. I wish I could say that I concluded my employment with them on amicable terms, but I didn't. Beershabba essentially fired me before I had a chance to resign, and went as far as to say that I was not allowed to put them down as a reference.

This experience was traumatic for me and for a few days I was in a state of mental shock. Fortunately, I contacted Caernilin and they were sympathetic, allowing me to use them as a reference and to use my time clerking for them remotely as a fill-in for the time I couldn't refer to Beershabba. Otherwise, I would have had a big, inexplicable time gap on my resume. Caernilin continued to send occasional AD/CVD work my way. However, at $20/hr, it was clear I couldn't stay with this for long.

**Dorselan**: was another solo practitioner who had a specialization in immigration law, with a focus on my ethnicity and language. I called them up on the recommendation of a family friend, and they turned out to be very friendly and supportive. After a few phone calls, we met in person and they offered me an immigration internship.

The law firm practice was still not a very good fit for me - perhaps the attorney's foreign training was the explanation. I helped to refer one relative to this attorney practice, and the client management didn't sync at all with my expectation or my relative's expectations. At numerous times, I found myself thinking ""Even if this client were not a blood relative of mine, I would be doing things much differently from Dorselan. Dorselan did do investor immigrant cases - I handled one such case and it was a month-long process to assemble the application.

The internship period ended, and Dorselan made me a full-time offer. Their rate would have annualized to $18/hr. I declined and resigned.

2013: I continued my networking and job applications, and returned to document review. I lucked out halfway through the year and found myself on a foreign language review, making a much higher rate (high $50s/hr, with time and a half overtime). I looked around at the other foreign-trained lawyers and wondered if I could stay here indefinitely, making this high rate basically for reading and clicking documents. It was tempting, and the pay was high enough that I wouldn't have to worry about anything ever again. But I was aware that the English-language reviews had fallen to about $30/hour, down from two years before. Oversupply of attorneys was only one part of the problem - predictive coding and adaptive algorithms was the other part. Simply put, given enough computing advances, the document review industry was in slow decline.

I sent out numerous job applications and continued networking. Ultimately, it was an unlikely source that brought me to my current (and hopefully final) workplace: Craigslist.

In May I sent in one of dozens of anonymous Craigslist applications. In June, the solo practitioner **Ermintrude** emailed back. My ethnic background and language ability was of interest. They set up a phone interview time, and then promptly broke it. In July I called them back up, professionally, and asked them if I could continue with my application. They apologized for the lack of response (later I learned they had hired somebody for the position but the new hire never showed up in the end). We went back and forth a few times and I stopped by their office in August. They made me an offer and I thought it was good enough, especially for a starting attorney at a starting firm. I accepted.

In September, I signed the papers to start at the new firm. I'm the second fully licensed attorney they have, and I speak all of the languages they need to process investor immigrant applications. Things have been great - the firm's founder has a personality that's a great fit with mine, and I've picked up all the training they have to give me like a sponge taking to water. I finished two applications in my first week (compared with Dorselan's month-and-a-half pace per application) and they said they were comfortable knowing they'd made the right choice in me.

Takeaway points:

* Hang in there. You may have the skills and the drive - and the job is out there, but it's not going to come to you.

* Keep learning things. We all need money to live, but if your resume only shows that you've taken jobs that pay for rote skills, it's going to be much harder to leave the rote skill industry.

* Stay flexible. I started off focusing on AD/CVD cases because they were international. But Dorselan convinced me that I could be an effective advocate for immigration clients too (even though they couldn't afford to pay me a liveable wage). I went from AD/CVD to general small firm practice, to immigration generally, to investor immigration specialization. None of this was planned, but I knew I had to keep my skills developing broadly so that I had something to offer.

* It bears repeating: hang in there! Job hunting is like dating. You're going to get rejected. You're going to get promising prospects that fizzle. You're going to get really bad mismatches. But the one good fit you find, none of that will matter.

Stay strong - we're facing difficult times, it's true. But all that means is we're ready for far greater challenges than our cushier forerunners.

Where should I start looking? Is it likely that I'll get one, being that I'm a freshman?

The biggest problem at this point is psyching myself out. It's in a few days and in the early morning if that changes things. Some of the job responsibilities are things I've never done before such as strategic project valuation, should cost modeling, etc. should I find out what these things are and how to do them?

 Any advice for me? Thanks guys

1nejel,2,2013-09-29,"My experience with job hunting, unemployment, and finances",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1nejel/my_experience_with_job_hunting_unemployment_and/,"I became unemployed a little over a year ago. I've actively looked for jobs and haven't been successful, yet. I don't have particularly great advice that hasn't been offered but just wanted to vent.

I got my undergraduate degree from a small state university in Business Administration and Non-Profit Management. My GPA started out a little rough, but I graduated with a 3.6 and a few internships under my belt. In hindsight, it seems totally obvious that I should have been job seeking throughout school, but it simply wasn't at the time. I planned on going to law school, anyways, so it wasn't terribly important at the time. My girlfriend (now wife) and I moved to a bigger city where I had a year off before graduate school. I looked everywhere for a job and didn't have any luck at all. It was embarrassing but at least I got into a top 20 law school so I could hang my hat on that.

In law school I lucked out and got a great gig my first summer which was right after the economic collapse. It was a 100 person firm job that paid $35/hr and I was so grateful. I worked my ass off and got a full-time job offer after my second summer. By the time I graduated, my wife was pregnant with our second daughter. After graduation I worked so hard to exceed expectations - and my direct supervisor was beyond happy with my work. I hated the area of law I practiced in but couldn't complain since I was so lucky to have a job, let alone one with benefits and that paid $75,000 a year. Well, my boss, god bless him, assigned me clients who weren't paying (likely because he wasn't getting paid if he did the work and since I was salaried he didn't care). I had absolutely no responsibility for collecting money and I was billing 7.5 hours a day at $200/hr but the firm simply wasn't making money off of me. They were very nice but told me they couldn't support my position anymore. So I was laid off on as good of terms as possible.

I applied to a number of different positions as soon as I was let go. I had one interview with a university and was a finalist for the job but didn't get it. I later found out the guy who got the job was promised it before he even applied. They still had to go through the charade though. I got a few non-lawyer call backs over the next few months and always became a finalist but didn't land anything. After about three months we simply couldn't afford daycare so I began staying home with the kids. My wife makes $40,000 a year (unemployment adds $10,000) and daycare for two kids under 2 years old is about $30,000 a year. We don't qualify for any assistance in my state so it is impossible to do anything other than stay home. For those who don't have young kids I don't expect you to understand, but I can't get ANY work done during the day. I look and apply for jobs in the evenings and weekends. Every interview I get can cost me upwards of $100 in gas, child care, and other expenses which has almost broken us.

Well, I've applied for 241 jobs since being laid off and had 15 interviews. Nothing has worked out. In the non-attorney positions, I've been told that I'm a flight risk, overqualified, and/or don't have enough experience. In EVERY interview, the interviewers have made comments that lawyers make a lot of money so why would I ever consider a position that paid $30,000 a year? For legal jobs, which are incredibly rare, there are often 150-200 applicants for one spot especially for state jobs. As a side note, entry level prosecutors get paid $21/hr where I live. Law firm hiring is almost entirely focused on current law students or associate attorneys currently working with 3-5 years of experience. I would go out on my own but I don't have the ability to pay for daycare. 

Networking is very difficult with kids. Simple things like getting lunch are ridiculously challenging to arrange aside from being expensive. I try to set something up in evenings when I can (when my wife is home), but professionals aren't real big on doing things outside of work hours. I have terrific references including two well known lawyers (a state Supreme Court justice and a high ranking government official) who have amazing things to say about me - along with my former bosses - but haven't been helpful beyond that despite a few requests for assistance. They do go above and beyond when I get an interview, however, and will reach out to the employer. I appreciate that.

I've tried applying to jobs across the board. I'm more than willing to take a job that covers the cost of child care but simply can't afford anything beyond that. 

I was actually recently a finalist for a position with the development branch of my alma mater (non-legal) and had great interviews except for the last one where I was lambasted for not making a donation to the university and told I'd have to make one if I wanted to be considered. I left, humiliated, but still made a donation with money I didn't have. Didn't get the job.

I've tried hard to be a good father, a good person, and not burden my wife with my stress but it's really hard. I've volunteered with a number of non-profits when I had the time and money to do it, I anonymously donated an organ, I've given $1,000's to various organizations, but I just can't seem to catch a break. I've tried all the obvious advice including countless resume reviews and revisions, follow-up calls and emails after applying, connecting with people in my network, etc. but nothing has worked. 

The worst is the embarrassment. You feel like a total loser, especially with an advanced degree. My brothers have subtly acted like I haven't been trying to find anything (living the high life off of my $10,000 a year in unemployment). I've heard over and over about all the different places where a law degree would be valuable with a strong implication that I've too narrowly limited myself. In most interviews there have been comments about my unemployment and ""What have you been doing with all your free time?"" I'm honest, but ""stay-at-home"" dad isn't very attractive to a lot of people. It's also really hard to see articles and associated comments about how lazy the unemployed are. The majority of the population has no sympathy for an unemployed lawyer and I respect that. A lot of people are much worse off than me. ""It's not my problem you decided to have kids you couldn't afford."" My wife making $40,000 a year does hurt at times since we don't qualify for any help at all but it doesn't even pay our bills ($1,200 mortgage, food, her student loans, $200 car payment, etc.). We can't afford health insurance which is rough. I have $135,000 in student loans which is a burden that hurts more than you can imagine. I'm hoping to take advantage of the public service loan forgiveness program if I can manage to get a non-profit job but it's been tough. I also feel like a terrible provider to my family. That's the worst. I know I need to have humility, but I wish I was a better husband and dad. The prospect of losing our house because I can't find a job is so rough.

I'm sorry. I've tried so hard to do everything right and I'm extremely energetic and personable on the the outside (especially in interviews), but on the inside it's horrendous. I've emailed employers after interviewing and losing out on a job and have received nothing but praise. They just had better applicants.

I don't really have a point. I just wish there was more understanding and empathy for job hunters. I don't want sympathy - I'm luckier than a lot of people - but it's hard being treating like I'm some lazy loser dependent on the government teat. If you're in a spot like I am, maybe it will help hearing that you're not alone."
1neg99,3,2013-09-29,Another CS undergrad soul seeking advice,Eep1337,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1neg99/another_cs_undergrad_soul_seeking_advice/,"So I am a CS undergrad at a state university. From the time I started on this journey up until this day, it appears that the wisdom of the ages is that success only comes to the CS folk who do lots of projects in their free time.

I am in my senior year of college for my BS in CS and I have only done a handful of projects at home for myself - things that are REALLY small/meaningless. I haven't tried to make any large or engaging project because I have never really had the inspiration. Likewise, I haven't hopped on any open source projects because nothing has really caught my eye.

However, I genuinely enjoy programming when I do do it for assignments and will often not stop working until a particular feature/project works. I also really enjoy the history and study of programming concepts that we have learned in the classes I have taken thus far.

I know that the industry is vastly different than that of the course work you see in school, and even though I feel like I made the right choice about this degree path, I still find myself trying to convince myself that I truly did make the right choice. Things I see on forums, things I hear from other developers etc...It makes it sound like the industry is cut throat, only the strong survive and green eared undergrads like myself have no chance of survival.

At the moment I am trying to grab myself an internship because I feel that having experience working somewhere will hopefully maybe make up for my lack of project portfolio outside of school. I know I am smart, I know I can learn fast, I often look at other students code (ones who spend their entire free time working on projects) and I am underwhelmed by the tricks and knowledge they use - stuff that anyone could look up on stack overflow.

I would really love to hear about anyone else who was maybe in a situation similar to mine and still managed to succeed - maybe you didn't have a huge portfolio but were just an amazing hard working individual.

1ndk9f,5,2013-09-29,"Not happy with current job, got a job offer for a very similar situation. Cant decide.",beGren,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ndk9f/not_happy_with_current_job_got_a_job_offer_for_a/,"**My current job** is for a small architecture firm working with my college classmate and her father. It is my first professional job. I've been with them for about 3 months. When I initially accepted the position I had other job offers but chose this one because it would be a small and intimate setting in which I could get a good variety of of tasks and experience; unlike the others in which pigeon holing is more common. Everything was great for the first few weeks and then the honeymoon ended. My boss started being highly critical of my work, nit-picking small mistakes I could not possibly have know to do correctly this early. I understand that imperfections cost him money so I stepped up my game and started focusing on taking my time to follow his given examples and get things right. That is about the time he became critical about how slowly I was getting work done. I threw it in to turbo and worked as quickly and correctly as I possibly could. It still has not been enough for him. About a month  of being chewed out for constantly making mistakes I realized he was taking out the stress of being the busiest his firm has been in 30 years out on me. So I let it slide for about another month until I woke up in the mornings dreading the day to come, hating mondays, and taking bathroom breaks so I wouldnt be seen holding back tears of frustration. Comments he would make range from, ""I am embarrassed  that we sent your drawings out.."" ""Lets go through this painful list of mistakes..."" ""Are you inventing things?"" ""You can't keep doing this, or it's just not going to work out"" The last one in particular made me feel like at any point in time I could be fired and I felt like more of a temp than someone who was making a career there. He does not treat his daughter this way, and she doesnt take his shit if he starts in on her. Then everything got really confusing. One day my coworker took the afternoon off and it was just my boss and I working. We had a nice afternoon and I actually stayed about 40 minutes extra just to chat with him. At this time he apologized to be for being short with me and said it was just because we were busy and how stressed he was from the client pressure. He even went so far as to tell me if I wanted to ""go work at one of those big corporate firms"" he would do what ever he could to help me out. (which I think was supposed to sound nice) From this point I thought, He knows he is doing it, It *is* because we are busy, it will end. The next two weeks Nothing changed. Although I am responsible for the work I do, I am not and architect (yet) and I dont know everything about buildings. I would come into his office to ask questions and he made comments like, ""what did you do in school the last five years, dont you know blah blah blah."" No one likes to feel like and idiot, so I stopped wanting to ask him questions and I wold cringe at the sound of his chair becoming empty to come check my progress. He would stand over my shoulder and watch me work and correct my process to be more like his.  

So this is the major reason I want to change jobs.  But in addition, I am not getting Health or Dental, no Retirement plan, I make about 16 and hour but I am on salary (just below average for this type of position). No overtime pay, but he supposedly does bonuses twice a year that are based on any overtime work.  We are using old software from 2004. And last but not least, I like to be in a social environment and it’s just the three of us.  

**The Job Offer** So I was just browsing some for hire ads and found an ad for an intern architect to which I replied. I was promptly offered and interview and went in this past Friday during my lunch to meet with them. They do a very similar project style to what I am doing now, but with newer software. This firm all around seemed to be more put together. But still small, including me the staff would be 4.  I was offered the position. I would receive a pay increase of about 80 cents per hour and a couple more days vacation after a year. Still no benefits or 401k.  I only met the president of the firm since the employees were out to lunch, but he seemed nice. 

The worst part about this whole thing is that after I secured the interview, everything at my current job got a little better. We finished a lot of the work that was stressing out my boss and he seemed to be more interested helping me learn.  Neither My boss nor his daughter knew I had the interview. Plus just knowing that I can get something else changed my psyche. 

**Dilemma** So the only real differences are a slight pay increase, newer software, and the possibility of a more understanding boss. I don’t want to quit right before things get better but I can’t tell if things are really going to change. When it gets down to it, I was really hoping for health insurance and other benefits and  I wont get that at either place.  I know I will be looking for a new job again sooner than later I suspect. Should I continue my job search and bide my time until I can find a job I truly want or Should I take this Job offer?

CS Major Graduating in 3 years now looking for a job.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ng3zc/advice_needed_cs_major_graduating_in_3_years_now/,"I am a Senior (credit wise) in college, but am only a 3rd year student. I had a lot of AP credits coming into college which freed me up from taking a lot of my general education requirements. I originally planned on going to medical school, but decided to switch to CS my second semester because the prospects of being in school for another 4+ years after college did not appeal to me. 

In my first two semesters I only took two CS classes. However, my third and four semesters consisted of almost all CS/Math classes. This semester (my second to last) I am doing the same. 

I have had 3 career related jobs. One in managing websites for the university. The second working with a CS professor on an Android application research project. The third with a medical professor on programming a data pipeline for use on the local university cluster. I still am holding all three of those jobs. I never did an internship, which worries the hell out of me. I needed to make money (one of the reasons I am graduating in three years is because of my financial situation) and felt that working over the summer was going to be better for me financially in the long run. I am now questioning that decision. 

Anyway, I decided to start searching for jobs early September. I applied to a larger company got a phone interview, then an online assessment, and finally an in person/on campus interview. I felt that I nailed every part. I connected with the interviewer and was able to explain my development projects well and in depth. I just heard back from them that they are moving on with other candidates. (sad day) As for a reason they said that because I am graduating in three years, I am ""a little light on programming"" and that I should reapply when I have a ""few more courses under my belt"". This worries me because I feel like I am starting to run out of time. I have only 1 and half semesters left before hitting the real world and what is the point of graduating in three years if it makes me less of a viable job candidate?

**tl;dr : Graduating in three years. Prospective employer cites this as reason for moving on with other candidates.**

 So on to my questions:

1. Does graduating in 3 years scare employers off?
2. Am I applying too early? They did say that I should try again after this semester, or during my final semester after I ""have a few more courses under my belt"".
3. What is the best course of action for me to follow in the future with other prospective employers? Should I wait a bit before applying for more jobs?

It's my first sort of experience ever and I've just graduated so I'm really eager to complete this internship and have something to show for. 

I won't go into detail about the company but I'm not happy with the way things are run and I wondered if it's similar for other people. I'm given work to do which is important so I guess that's a positive, it does get very choring and boring though.

However since day 1 things have been off. I wasn't told to bring my laptop but thankfully I did, fortunately it's a MacBook which everyone in the office has and which is also required. They said I would need Photoshop which I already had installed however when I asked what if I didn't, they said they would have given me a cracked version. They were distributing cracked versions of Word, Photoshop and other software in the office which is being used for professional work.

The second issue I have is the office environment. There are only 5 traditional chairs (4 legs and a backrest). Only other option is these shit plastic stools which are uncomfortable after a few hours. There are also some sofas but not suitable for working.

Finally it's not completely unpaid. I get paid for travel and lunch expenses and it's a base rate per day, way below a minimum wage though.

Should I get out ASAP or stick at it for 2 more months now and have something I can put down for experience?"

I also had before some internships in different companies, industries and countries. Yet, it took me some time to understand what are the key principles which will help me to succeed in the company ladder. Maybe you are lucky to have a boss to tell you this from the very beginning, I wasn’t. I needed to learn those hard lessons myself. I want to share my lessons with everyone who hasn’t started career yet or wants to improve it.

1. This is your life and your career, so you are the one responsible for it.

Once I joined the company I failed into the illusion that if I will do a good job people will appreciate it, especially my boss. Nothing more wrong. Once you are hired, you are like a product – you need to promote yourself, you need to take care of the endorsements from relevant parties, check opinions especially that negative ones and be sure that you have sufficient amount of all of the actions.

2. Be proactive

You don’t need to have your own business, to be an entrepreneur. In reality, entrepreneurship is a state of mindset which is highly wanted in the companies. Every time you will come to your boss or simple propose and EXECUTE some new idea, project which will help your department, organization, boss, etc. you will get enormous credit. You will get incremental recognition of amazingly motivated and committed employee. Of course,  you cannot forget about advertising – spend sufficient amount of time promoting your project even before you start.

3. Know yourself

Be aware what you are good at, what is driving you, what is your passion. Try to find as many projects as possible which you can do with passion, as those will be those truly successful ones. If you don’t think about what you bring to the table, then you don’t get a seat there. On the other hand don’t be embarrassed to say “NO”. It is better than not delivering on time or at all. People will rather understand “NO” then broken promise.

4. Develop your emotional intelligence and soft skills.

Soft skills include positive attitude, team work, ability to handle conflicts, interpersonal communication, negotiation. According to research for 61% of managers they are even more important than hard skills. Try to work on those skills, check available trainings, ask for feedback. The higher you will go on the corporate ladder the more you will need those skills.

5. Help your boss.

”You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” – Zig Ziglar, Secrets of Closing the Sale. This is especially true with your manager. The more supportive, helpful and open for feedbacks and his/her needs you will be the better chance for reward in promotion, salary increase or other opportunities. Managers are the closest to us and have the biggest influence, therefore, instead of thinking only how you can succeed think how you can help your boss succeed.

6. Find out what is hot

Companies are like Fashion Shows – each year you have new trends and collections. One year it is important to focus on market share, other year ROI or digital media spending. There is always some topic which is hot and trending, and this is the one you should focus. Don’t go to any other direction before you know everything about the new trend and you use it regularly. Don’t go against the crowd – if everyone is wearing red and blue you will simply look like weird wearing any other color…

7. Be the expert. Be well known!

Be the expert 9-5 and then go more mile – attend conferences, events, meetups or any other events to learn more and to connect with co-workers. You will be able to learn, develop relationships and have more to talk about at the office. Remember – people are hiring and promoting people not tables and numbers.

I enrolled in my local community college which has a joint program with a local 4 year university.  I love what I am doing, but I want to know where to go from where I am.  Their curriculum has programming, networking, and algorithms as the main requirements.  I am hoping to specialize in security as it captures my interests.  I am new to the programming world at 28 and a female (which I understand is viewed as a disadvantage in some places with affirmative action stereotypes) though I have no kids or anything so I can put lots of effort into the field now though again I may be viewed as ""older"" and not quite what some are used to.

I was told that I can't expect to get a technology job in my first year.  I am in school part time to accommodate work, though I lost my job a few weeks ago and am scrambling to find work and do okay in school.  I am really hoping to get something that can start me as a paid intern and progress to a full CS person.  Is this unrealistic?  I have posted my information a few places and decided I am indeed not ready for entry-level but I learn fast and will benefit from internship stuff.

So, here is what I am needing advice on:
1.  Where do I begin as a novice career-wise?
2.  Can I reasonably find a job in the field anytime soon, especially given the fact that I need to find a job ASAP?
3.  What can I do to appear as a better person to an employer?
4.  How can I avoid the ""older"" and ""affirmative action female"" stereotypes that may make things feel uncomfortable when looking for work?"
1neysk,1,2013-09-29,Is a Certificate in C/C++ worth my time? Seeking advice!,codyjamesp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1neysk/is_a_certificate_in_cc_worth_my_time_seeking/,"Hello Reddit!

Lets start with a little background... I am currently AD USAF, I have two years left and plan on majoring in Computer Science with the GI Bill when I get out. The reason I desire to get the certificate is for internship prospects while I am going to school. In your opinion, would an employer likely employ me part time or be more inclined to chose me for internship opportunities with a cert while pursuing the BSCS?

Also,
I would be getting the cert from UCSD extended campus. They have certs in Java, C#, C/C+=, Mobile Dev. ect. The reason I chose C/C++ is that in my understanding, it is the basis for most programming languages. I have heard that it will help you better understand how code works with the PC, thus I will become a better programmer in the long run. Should I possibly pick a different language?


THE CERT WILL BE FREE! It seems like a no-brainer, but the battle lies between getting more of the general education credits done or taking the time to complete the cert in order to be better prepared for internships. "
1neyb7,2,2013-09-29,Could you all help me rate my grad school chances?,TopspinTEC,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1neyb7/could_you_all_help_me_rate_my_grad_school_chances/,"So, I'm a senior and I took the GRE this weekend to get a 154V/169Q.   Haven't gotten the writing score yet, but I feel that I will get a 3.5-4.0 based on sample essays I've seen. I'd like to continue with Aerospace for a Ph.D., but I don't know how high or low to set my sights. Here are my ""stats"":

GRE: 154V/169Q

GPA: 3.915

Area of interest: Computational fluid-thermal-structure interaction. I'm including looking at programs of pure CFD or computational solid mechanics.

Internships: One this past summer for a gas turbine company, but I was applied to more of the manufacturing side of things.

Research: I've only just started this year, so by the application deadline I feel I won't have much to talk about. I'm dedicating 10 hours a week to it, so it's at least more than what some peers I have talked to do. Plus, the research is intended to give me a jump start on my Ph.D. if I continue on here.

Other relevant work experience: I was a math tutor in our math learning center for three years.  I'm using this as a major selling point in my personal statement to show that I'm not as bad at technical communication as my GRE Verbal indicates.

So where should I set my sights?  How much of a bottleneck is my GRE Verbal and very limited research going to be?"
1net6g,35,2013-09-29,How to prepare for a Google Intern interview?,PaperBagPancake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1net6g/how_to_prepare_for_a_google_intern_interview/,"So my boyfriend has an interview (Two technical interviews) with Google for an internship. This is his first interview for any internships, and it's with Google, so he's a bit nervous. He's in his third year of university, double majoring in honors computer science (software engineering) and math. He hasn't done any internships yet. He doesn't have much extra curricular projects done, so he doesn't have that going for him. But he's one of the top students at the school, with a major GPA of 12.9 (~99%). He's very knowledgeable and intelligent, and I believe he will do very well in his interviews.

At this point, since he has an interview already, how will his lack of extracurricular projects affect his chances?

Out of curiosity, how many people get interviews? I'm aware that google had 1500 positions for interns, with 40,000 applications for the summer of 2013. But I couldn't find out how many of that 40,000 got interviews. Basically, just wondering if it's fairly common for any decent student to get an interview, or if he's already doing well so far. Either way, he's happy to get the interview at all.

How can he prepare?
I actually purchased ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" for him a couple weeks ago, which he is now using to study before he gets the interview. I know it's more for a full job, but it won't hurt at all.

How can I help him prepare? I'm not in computer science, so I'm not familiar enough to help him in depth, but I'm doing my best to support him.

Thank you."
1nerwl,7,2013-09-29,Relocating from Seattle to Bay Area. Should my compensation change?,RelocatingProgrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nerwl/relocating_from_seattle_to_bay_area_should_my/,"I currently earn $105k at a large company in Seattle (actual Seattle, not Redmond).  I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering and 2 years of professional experience (if you include internships).

My company has a Bay Area office and I would like to move there.  I've asked my boss and he said it would be okay - he suggested I visit the Bay Area office for a few weeks before fully committing, to make sure I like it and if so to find a place to live, which sounds perfect.  I haven't asked about compensation.  I've only been with this company for 3 months so I'm shy about approaching the subject.

State income tax is around 10% in California, versus 0% in Washington, and of course rent is much higher there.  I've heard of other companies offering ""cost of living adjustments"" when employees switch offices but I'm not sure what to expect or how to approach it.  I've heard Microsoft offers a 20% adjustment from Redmond to Bay Area, and I've heard my company gives new hires the option to work in the bay area for 10% more (although my offer didn't include that clause).

I feel like a 20% adjustment would make up for both the difference in rent and taxation, but any less and I will be taking a financial hit.  If I don't get any adjustment at all I will still move, but probably begin considering other jobs very soon afterward.  Does anyone have any inside knowledge about similar situations?  I'd just like to know what I can expect and how to approach it."
1neovo,2,2013-09-29,Internship or Study Abroad?,alittlebirdiee,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1neovo/internship_or_study_abroad/,"Hey so I was wondering what would be a more beneficial way for me to spend this summer, studying abroad in an engineering program, or getting an internship.

Bit of background, I'm in my 3rd year of computer science engineering, looking to graduate in 4 years, and I have two internship experiences on my resume already. I'm really interested in seeing a new part of world (considering I've actually never traveled or even been on an airplane before) but also want to ensure I can still get a decent job after graduation (my GPA isn't too dandy). 

Thanks everyone and happy studying (:"
