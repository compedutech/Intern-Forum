What can I do to make my resume more stable?",bluesunshine,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dlhmd/ive_been_laid_off_4_times_in_the_last_5_years_and/,"I started working in IT in 2005 while I was still in college as an intern.  I didn't get the job when the internship was over and I moved on to a large company as a contractor.  After a year (and many attempts to sign on to be a full time employee) I was laid off.  I then went back to the place I interned at (I had a good relationship with the company) for a temporary position until I got a new job.

I got a job at a small company and the job was hell.  After six months I was micromanaged to the point of a nervous breakdown and left the company (the first time I've ever quit a job, ever).  During that time the economy tanked and the only choice I had was to take a temp job at a software company (which was an awesome place to work), and after more attempts to become a full time employee I was part of a mass layoff.  

Now I've been working at a large healthcare company as a contractor for a year and I have no room to grow.  I'm the lowest paid (mostly because I'm the youngest) on my team, I get less PTO then I did working at a grocery store in high school, I've been denied for raises, healthcare is abysmal (ironic isn't it?), and they don't want to promote me because they love my rock bottom salary.

Now that I'm looking for a new, full time job, it seems that HR departments are pegging me as a ""job hopper"".  I've had 2 phone interviews in the last week and they've told me that, ""Well it looks a little strange that you've only been with each company about a year or so"".  Most don't seem to understand that you have to pay dues when you're out of college, how much the economy has changed the job market, and how cut throat companies are when dealing with IT employees.   

So my question is, how should I spruce up my resume to make it look like I'm stable? Also, should I just tell HR flat out that I'm part of a rough market? I was thinking of putting ""temporary"" or ""contract"" next to my positions but I'm not sure how good that will look.  Here's a copy of my resume (I removed all the personal info for privacy and some of the formatting got jacked up, but all the info is there):

dls26,5,2010-10-01,Suggestions for finding and affording an internship?,IntershipsSuck,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dls26/suggestions_for_finding_and_affording_an/,"Hey Reddit - long time lurker first time poster.

So basically I want to know if anyone has any ideas about actually finding and affording internships. To graduate from my school every student in the college has to have at least one summer long internship. The problem is that to get credit for the internship you also have to pay something like $750 for the credit. 

The other problem is most companies that recruit from my school or want my skill set are located in DC or other really expensive areas. I would have to buy a car, pay for local housing, pay for food and all that on top of paying my rent over the summer at school (it's impossible to find subletters in the summer - there's too many places open and my house is a crap-shack). The internships do pay but it wouldn't cover the cost of living and keeping my place here and I'd also be loosing out on saving money over the summer through working a local job.

I'd get an internship at my school but they don't pay, are hard to get, and all my peers would have internships at big companies - Booz Allen, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, CIA and it puts me at a huge hiring disadvantage. 


Basically, I'm paying for school myself and a summer internship would cost me more money and I wouldn't be able to pay for school myself. Anyone have any ideas? It sucks being at a disadvantage to everyone else who seems to have school paid for them or in's at awesome companies. 

TL;DR: Need internship to graduate, can't afford one - suggestions?"
dmejh,0,2010-10-03,Laptop stolen - Advice on replacement,capitalh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dmejh/laptop_stolen_advice_on_replacement/,"Greetings,

Long time lurker, first time topic poster.  I was recently visiting the National Aquarium in Baltimore when my car was broken into and my Dell XPS was stolen (among other important things) from the vehicle's trunk.

As a result, I find myself far too analog in this digital world and hope that the fine fellows of reddit can lend some advice in rectifying this.  I am looking for a performance laptop with a good size screen, but can still be considered portable (15"" sounds about right to me).  I do not consider myself a gamer but I do like higher-end graphics and pretty displays.  I probably prefer Windows 7 on the laptop, but I do plan to have it dual boot with Ubuntu.  I have (or... had) a substantial library of music and videos, so the more storage the merrier.  The laptop is used both for these ""recreational"" purposes and as a primary work laptop- I am a researcher/EE phd candidate, so I have (once again... had) a few math programs I'd run such as Mathematica as well as engineering mainstays such as MATLAB.  I have a tendency to multitask like a maniac (Are they known for their multitasking abilities? Perhaps this was a poor simile) so a processor that can handle running a MATLAB code while I review research papers (read: browse reddit) would be fantastic.  I am including my old Dell specs below for reference.  

I figure Reddit knows this stuff as well as anyone, which is why I came to ask the community here first.  I really appreciate any advice you guys have to help me out! This situation SUCKS  

My old lappy specs follow:
15"" XPS purchased late 2008 with Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T8100 (2.1GHz/800Mhz FSB, 3MB Cache)
4GB Shared Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz (2 Dimms)
High Resolution, glossy widescreen 15.4 inch LED LCD (1440x900) &amp; 2.0 MP webcam (barely used the cam)
128MB NVIDIA® GeForce® 8400M GS
320GB 5400rpm SATA Hard Drive
OS: Vista
Stock DVD/RW drive
6 cell battery

P.S. Is it weird that the first thing I thought upon realizing my laptop, my internship laptop, my ONLY data backup, and my TI-89 from high school were stolen was that my personalized conky file is gone forever?  Don't worry, my attention then turned to the horror of the situation... but conky first.

  I'm currently a senior at a liberal arts college; my major is computer science.

I'll try and be as brief and to the point as I can be.

I got into computer science for my love of video games and technology but now realize that a liberal arts college probably wasn't the best place to go because a more specialized school would have given me a much better education (not that the one I'm getting now is bad).

Approaching graduation I'm not sure what to do about grad school because I don't know what I would like to specialize in.

I've had a full-time summer internship as a software engineer since summer of 2008 and got amazing experience there and a taste of the real world. However, I do not believe that is exactly what I would like to do every day in for my career. I was interesting and I learned a ton, but that exact atmosphere might not be my cup of tea.

Many video game design courses I found were part of undergraduate studies (would have been nice 4 years ago &gt;&lt;)...

I want to do something gaming related, so I'd like to maybe shadow people in the New England area who are in the industry or anyone else with a computer sciencey job to hone in on what I would like to do with my life.

I would also love to be something of a gaming journalist for a magazine, but feel like an English major w/ a Communications certificate would have been better suited for that.

Also, I am not so much a lazy person as I am an ""incubator,"" a term I found on reddit that means I procrastinate and think about what I have to do and them pump it out at the last minute with high efficiency. But there is no due date on life!

Any general advice? I have many paths rushing toward me and I'm sort of lost.

First time posting anything like this so any suggestions or questions would also be much appreciated.

Also, Deion Branch is back in New England. Rejoice ^_^

Thanks a lot!

I am currently working on a program which I developed during internships which involves both back-end work and GUI design. Looking at the code I've written that I have to keep coming back to has spawned a couple of questions I'd like to ask:

First: Should the GUI be separate from the program, or intertwined?  I.E. If an ""open"" button is clicked, should the event handler handle all of the file opening actions, or should it simply send a file path to a different method/class?

Second: How can I review my own code?  I have no idea if I am a good, average, or poor programmer.  Unfortunately my code was never reviewed during school beyond a grade for functionality.  "

Throwaway account here as my other account is my real name. I'm in the first semester of an MS program, in a field that I really enjoy. However, I'm finding that the school I'm at is not the greatest fit for me. I'm toying with the idea of changing back to the school that I did my undergrad work at for several reasons, specifically, the better reputation, proximity to family, friends that currently attend, and my love of the location.

However, I don't know the best route to take to pursue this. The new program would require me to obtain letters of recommendation. I feel like a letter of recommendation from my current advisor, who I also currently do research with, would carry a lot of weight in my application to the new program. However, I'm afraid that I would permanently burn a bridge with this professor if I expressed a desire to potentially leave this program, especially if I am not accepted to the new program.

As it stands right now, I believe that I can count on solid letters of recommendation from a supervisor from an internship, a supervisor from my first real industry experience, and a professor that worked with me during my capstone project as an undergrad. Do you guys think that I would lose out on too much if I proceeded with these guys, and did not broach the topic with my graduate professor unless I've heard positively from the program I'm applying to?

The other issue I see is a potential waste of a semester. Granted, this will not affect me too much in the long run, but it kinda sucks to put in the work only to lose out on the money, time, and studying that I invested. There's a possibility that I may be able to transfer some credit, but I'm not holding my breath.

Finally, does anyone know how university's feel about this kind of situation? I'd imagine that it reflects poorly on me as a student, but I've written a fairly convincing statement of purpose explaining exactly why I feel that this is right move for my situation.

Any advice on the issue is much appreciated.

Please advise",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/drlcb/female_redditors_my_gf_took_contraceptives_now/,"Disclaimer : I know this looks like it belongs in /r/relationships, but it's actually medical.

So the story is, we're together for almost 3 years. I'm 24, she's 22. Playing it safe, we decided that she will take the pill. After consulting the doctor, who decided everything was fine, she got her perscription, everything was fine for some time. After about a 1,5yr her sex drive went down, down to 0. We lived with it somewhat for a while, then last summer i got a 1yr internship 2000km from home. So we decide that's it's sensless for her to be on the pill during that time, and that it might help get her ""spunk"" back. 3 months pass, she visits me in my new place, sadly, nothing seems to change back :/

Things go bad between us, not only because of the lack of fun in bed, but because for some time now i feel more like a friend, than a SO. I finally make her realize and admit, that she doesn't feel for me anymore, but she still loves on me on some level and doesn't imagine herself without me. I still love her too, and give her another chance. She promises to change. I have my own theory.

I make her go see the gyno, and my suspitions are confirmed - because of the pill, her body stopped producing Estrogen altogether, and her hormonal balance is way off. Today she got a perscription for hormones(cyclo-progynova), and her first evaluation is in 3 months, but the whole curation may last up to a year. She feels really bad about this, saying ""i don't feel like a woman anymore"". I try to be as supportive as i possibly can from a 2000km distance.

My question is : any female redditors here that had the same/similar experience? How did it turn out for you?

**TL;DR** : my girlfriend took contraceptives, then stopped and her estrogen is gone. she feels like shit."
drsst,8,2010-10-15,"Reddit engineers, how did you get your first job? I've been doing everything I can, and I'm osing hope - thinking about completely giving up on this profession  ",stonefall090909090,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/drsst/reddit_engineers_how_did_you_get_your_first_job/,"
I'm going to be honest here because it is my first post, and I don't want anyone to think this is one of those 'I need a job' threads. I'm not here to find work, I'm just looking for some realistic advice - don't be afraid to pour on the negatives, I am tired of false hope.

Here's my story: I have completed 2 University degrees - Communications and Mechanical Engineering . I am not rich, and I have paid myself through everything in my life. After completing my first degree, I realized that there wasn't much work (reputable, career type work) available. So after working in the communications field a few years (with work that I found almost INSTANTLY without ever really trying), I got tired of the monotony and I decided to go back to school for my engineering degree. I saved up a lot of money and worked most of my way through. The problem now, is that I had to quit my job in my last year to complete my engineering degree on the 4 year pace and I can't seem to interest ANY employers in the field (I have however receieved calls from the non-engineering field recruiters). 

I'm very put off, simply because I was naive in believing everyone I  spoke to saying 'there are millions of jobs out there for engineers, just finish your degree"" etc etc. I took this as fact, and I put all my effort into my studies and not nearly as much as I 'should' have for looking for work/connections during my schooling. 

Now I am fed up. It been over 7 months, and I am getting nowhere. I've signed up for all the job sites, I've attended career fairs, I cold call human resources managers for interest/positions, I have had my resume reviewed by many different people in HR fields and I am free to move anywhere that speaks English in the world. I've applied to many graduate programs/paid internships and I don't get considered because my GPA is not over 3.0 (its 2.9 - which I am very happy with considering I worked almost the entire time I was in the program -even though it is apparently not good enough). The only reason I didn't have a better GPA, is because my University was extremely poorly managed, yet was widely considered the 'best' engineering program for all the Univeristies closeby. Many people would cheat, and the people who didn't saw lower marks (I even tattled on them a few times and the school did nothing). Turns out, after calling a few people, that the school's reputation was awful -notorious for breeding 'idiot engineers' and being one of the 'non-idiots' I can tell you 100% employers are right in not hiring these people. However, how do I convince a hiring manager I am not?  By the time I found out all this, I was in my 4th year and it was too late to transfer universities.

The more time I spend in the job mix, the more I realize i have ZERO qualifications to get hired in this field without significant connections. I have about 10-15 connections in the field and they have been helping by asking around etc, but none are powerful enough to actually hire. I'm sure eventually something will come up, but I am competely sick of waiting. 

I am extremely proud of having 2 degrees, since I really did my best to learn the material and enjoy the subjects, so I do not regret going to school in the slightest. What I do regret, is going into engineering instead of medicine, which I could have gotten into as well. I chose engineering for 2 reasons, because I was interested in it more than medicine, and because I was SURE I would NEVER have to spend extended periods of time looking for work. There is NOTHING I HATE MORE than looking for work when I am a qualified candidate. I feel as though my phone should be ringing off the hook with offers since I am qualified but I went with the all out effort to find work anyway because I wanted a REALLY good job in this field. I have not been slacking - I think I've put in more effort into finding work than I did studying during my program. I would understand if I had no education but I have 11 years of failure free post secondary education and no on employers seem to care. 

Anyway, I'm just wondering how long it took everyone else to find work in engineering, and whether it is really worth it to continue looking? Some of my friends who have engineering experience and many don't even like it that much. I was initially VERY excited when I finished my degree and I was hoping to make a difference. Now, I'm thinking about going back to my old degree's field, and giving up engineering for good. I'll never regret learning the material and going back to school, I'll just regret wasting all this time looking for work in a field that will not hire new members. 

TL; DR - Very tired of looking for work in engineering field. Probably going to throw my degree away and look for a different profession that actually hires new graduates."

I elected to post here versus at /r/depression because I don't know how deep my problems actually are, and I don't want to offend anyone.

None of this has affected my school work, a I am fringing on a 4.0 QPA with nearly 100% in most of my engineering / math classes.  The issue is that my state of well being is so dependent on my grades that a slight stumble can set me into a depression state that lasts for days.  

The issue is that other than grades and internships and such, I have absolutely nothing going on.  I go to class, eat, and then incubate in my dorm room.  I have almost no friends up here, and I hardly have any confidence to leave my room, even to eat.  I haven't had anything close to a girlfriend for almost three years, and most of the very few friends I have up here I knew from high school.  I consider myself adept at conversation, but I cannot approach people.

I am afraid that this feeling of loneliness will evolve into a permanent mental pattern.  I have difficulty projecting myself into a future dominated by a successful career and nothing else (in fact, I worry that my intellectual successes are slowly eroding, which is one of the chief causes of the classroom anxiety described above).  Needless to say, over the last month or so (more than ever), I have felt chronically fatigued and my motivation (other than the motivation to study) in most of my affairs has started to asymptotically level to 0.  On weekends, I leave the room to eat, and that's it.

Please no behaviorist bullshit like: you need to conquer your fears and step out of your comfort zone.  It doesn't work for me, I've really made an effort.  It feels like there is a psychological barrier that is blocking me from getting away from all of this.  "

I currently have one job offer for a software engineering role and have two second round interviews coming up with the big 4 for a consulting role where I will most likely get an offer.  

This past summer I did an SE internship in Silicon valley with a large software company. I currently have an offer from them and would be living and working in California where I would be starting off at 76k and a 10k relocation bonus. I may be able to negotiate to 80-85k.
 
This sounds great but I hated my job / company culture at my internship.  Most the engineers were introverted and I had no one to talk to at work.  Most the employees were older and had been working at the company for a while and were never excited about anything.  I also didn't like San Jose that much.

I had an office visit to a big 4 office in NYC and really liked the employees and atmosphere.  However, I am not sure if consulting would be any better.  I would most likely be making less starting at around 60k.  The cost of living in NYC is also a lot higher than California.  In Cali, I could continue to live like a college student and save up 40k in a year.   In NYC, I feel like I would be living paycheck to paycheck.  

Should I make the smart decision and go with the higher paying job where I would make 20k-30k more a year at the company I know I disliked?  Or should I take a risk and accept a Consulting position that pays less and I may dislike just as much?  Consulting would be about (20% travel) and working in forensics(enterprise stuff).  It sounds cool but I am not sure if it is. 


Ideally, I'd like to take a semester off to intern for a start-up before graduating to see how I like it but my dad may be loosing his construction job soon so my parents are pressuring me to graduate on time.

I am sure there a lot of people on reddit who have worked in both roles so give me your ideas.   Has anyone here worked in Penetration Testing or Forensics?  What do you think about it?  

**tldr: Choose high paying Software Engineering job at company I didnt like or go with a lower paying consulting job at Big 4 firm?**

dwgeu,8,2010-10-26,Another Question about IT work,burt0n,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dwgeu/another_question_about_it_work/,"Hey guys I was wondering if you would be able to help me figure out some stuff.  I am  about to complete a degree in Criminal Justice ( i know complete opposite), however I have always had a passion for computers also. I took a computer repair course back in high school (graduated in 05) and been fixing computers for family and friends ever since. I also helped at times testing hardware for a family friends small ebay business.
 

Here is the problem I want to try out IT work seeing as I really like working with computers. Plus the whole criminal justice field is not doing to well unless you want to move to the border in Texas or Arizona. My SO and I rather stay here in Orange County. Every job I have looked at for IT work requires some kind of degree or certs and will not even look at my resume seeing as I have no formal work experience. I have been applying and searching for jobs but they all require experience and it seems no companies will take you without any experience. So i am trying to find some kind of internship or volunteer work. If you guys have any ideas to gain experience for this let me know also please.


So I am looking at getting either an AA degree in Computer Information Systems or some kind of cert such as a the community college has a PC/Networking Hardware Cert. The thing is the AA degree they offer seems to have nothing to do with networking or hardware. The courses include: Access, Excel, Accounting, And word processing. So am i better off with AA in pretty much basic computer skills which i already have or going with an actual Cert. The cert courses include: Operating Systems, PC Hardware Configs, Intro Networking Hardware, Computer Desktop Support, Windows Server Administration. 


So which one do you guys think would be the best to help get my feet into IT/Network door? Eventually I might pursue a computer forensics cert in order to use both computers and criminal justice. 
 

Thanks for the help guys!"

Anyways if some of you could point me in the right direction that would be great!!"

If I can't get anywhere with my portfolio by just working 4 days a week, then perhaps I shouldn't bother going with graphics.   I might go part time if I decide to take my work and become very serious with it and have a clear/certain path in my life.  I don't know why, but your advices simply help me clear up my mind even though I should have been capable of coming up with them on my own.

This is probably not going to be as interesting as other posts you can find here, but I always felt that reddit could come up with some great advice, and I would appreciate even just a few regarding this matter(my first time posting ).  

I majored as an art student(3d animation), and I was pretty ok at it(best on my class, but my school was not as good compared to others - had to learn mostly everything on my own).  Because of some circumstances, I wasn't able to get a job right away, turned down some internships, and eventually had to work as a waiter to help support my parents.  Eventually, I was hired by a company(not related to my studies) that recruits international students, and I am now working full time as a tutor/assistant manager.  The job is easy, but I am not getting anything from it.  I hate dealing with the people at the company and   I am also sick of the kids and tutoring.  The pay is not bad ($40,000), and with the economy the way it is, I am thankful I have it.  
I've been trying to work on my portfolio(my old stuff is outdated, and must update my work) for years and get some stuff done so I could find either an internship or go back to school and get an MFA.  Unfortunately, I've procastinated too much on it, and after a day of work, I just don't want to do anything.
I was told that one of the reasons why I was not inclined to work on my portfolio or to find something better is because I just didn't have time and because I felt comfortable with my job.
Now some of the reasons why I don't want to change the way my life is  because the economy(feel lucky to have an easy job), the uncertainty that even after working on my portfolio maybe I won't be able to find a job(it's hard getting into this industry), and of course I hate change.
 
I know that some people might say that I should follow my dreams, but sometimes I find that type of mindset to be a bit unrealistic. 

Anyway, I have talked to my boss about it, and he has been supportive about it and even gave me fridays off(not much work on fridays anyways) so I could do something with my life, but he said that he still needs me at the company and doesn't want me to go part time.   I am considering just telling him that I want to work about 4 hours a day(tutoring only)instead so I can spend more time on my own work.  This means that I'll be paid only a fraction of what I was getting paid before.  I do have some money saved up, and I should be able to survive for a good 6-8 months or more.

Anyways, depending on the advice I get from you guys,  I will either keep the way things are or take a risk and focus on an uncertain future.

Thanks Reddit."
dxb78,2,2010-10-27,Girlfriend wants to get engaged now.,panzero0,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxb78/girlfriend_wants_to_get_engaged_now/,"TL;DR - I'm a 25 year old professional and she is a 22 y/o grad student with one semester of school left and a 15 week internship out of town. She wants to get engaged before her internship but I don't want to be engaged and alone for 15 weeks of our engagement.

First of all, I initially didn't want to get engaged for another year but she is pressuring me. I've somewhat given in to her pressure and we've looked at rings, yada yada yada. EDIT: We've been dating for just over a year

Secondly, her internship experience will be much better if it's out of town and her chances of getting a great job are a lot higher if she goes out of town. There are opportunities nearby but they suck and it won't look great on her resume.

I may have an unwarranted fear because my sister tried a long distance engagement and it didn't work out. 

Should I be celebrating time alone? She is normally the one that is so clingy, I just think it would be so strange to be committed to someone that is so intangible, so to speak.

EDIT: It'd be so much easier for us if we just waited until she was done with school. Why can't she wait?

Thanks"
dxhop,1,2010-10-27,Need CS Career Advice...,purplegui,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxhop/need_cs_career_advice/,"Hi all,

**Background:**
I am currently a senior CS major at a top-tier-ish public university and will graduate next June. I interned this past summer as a software engineer and the position has been extended into a PT position until the end of this calendar year. That, however, is also my first and only internship experience. I have limited research experience, as well (just starting).

What I gathered from my internship experience is this: I am not satisfied with sitting in a cube write code all day. I want to work on challenging problems. I don't want to write bitch code (perhaps part of being an intern?). Also, the experienced affirmed my belief that, in CS, experience trumps education (to a degree). If given the initial opportunity, 4 years of work experience trumps 4 years of college education.

**That said, here's my question:**
I'm now at a time where my decision would most likely affect how the rest of my life plays out.

Should I get a job after getting the B.S.? It seems to me this means getting a job that would be pure coding 24/7. That, of course, could be good or bad, depending on the projects I work on. I would also be able to be independent.

Should I go for an M.S.? An M.S. in Com Sci would give me some boost in salary, but would cost me another year or so of tuition and life. Is it worth it? Does it open that many more doors?

Lastly, the Ph.D. It requires a great amount of dedication. It requires around 4~6 years of my life. However, most colleges pay for your Ph.D. tuition. It doesn't give much of a salary boost compared to an M.S. However, it gives me the opportunity to do research and to teach, which I enjoy vastly.

So, reddit, I am really at a crossroads. I've given many thoughts to this subject and, with the grad school deadlines quickly approaching, I really can't delay this much longer. Your inputs are really appreciated.

Note: This is a throwaway. I don't know why I posted this under a throwaway, really. I'm a pussy?

*edit1:* My current research is in bioinformatics, if that matters."
dxz0p,5,2010-10-28,I would like some feedback from biomedical engineers- is it possible to go to grad school in biomedical engineering with decent (around a 3.1) GPA bachelors in electrical engineering?,chandrax,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/dxz0p/i_would_like_some_feedback_from_biomedical/,"I have one semester left (after this one) and am getting ready to start the grad school application process. Biomedical engineering is what I am interested in. I am passionate about electronics, micro-controllers, and electrical theory but even more than that I am passionate about using what I know to try to help people. 

So far the schools I am looking at are only the University of Madison Wisconsin (the brain-twitter research project was awesome), and Virginia Tech (I had an internship there). 

Is there another way to get into the R and D side of the biomedical industry? I am from Alaska where practically no biomedical engineering research goes on and there are no biomedical engineering companies. 

Last question: What should I do to prepare my background for grad school? Are basic biology classes a requirement (that would be worth extending by graduation date out for in order to get those classes under my belt) or would I be fine just applying with what I have? 

I'm a girl, if it makes any difference (it shouldn't but sometimes it can help one stand out from an application pile of mostly male candidates).

I'd really appreciate any comments, pieces of advice, stories, or even sammich requests (but only if you are prepared for one fitted with electrical gidgets!) :)"
