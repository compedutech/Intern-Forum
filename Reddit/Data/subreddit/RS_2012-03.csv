qd8j7,3,2012-03-01,Finishing my degree: bad idea to do an applications programming internship instead of faculty-recommended classes in systems programming and security?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qd8j7/finishing_my_degree_bad_idea_to_do_an/,"I have a year of lower-division college CS credits in object-oriented and procedural programming in Java and Python, conceptual foundations (binary representations, machine/assembly language basics, vocabulary), and another two quarters of advanced work in operating systems concepts, some really basic kernel programming, data structures in C and C++, and networking and security overview. I need one more quarter of upper-division CS work to graduate with a bachelor of science.

I was just offered a paid part-time internship at a local small business, doing applications programming in a high-level language, probably Ruby on Rails or PHP. I would be able to get the credits I need to finish my BS with this internship and just one more class (Analysis of Algorithms) and I'm really, really tempted. I'm feeling pretty damn burnt out on school lately, I've always enjoyed applications programming more than more hardware-aware work, and making money sounds obviously superior to not making money.

But I know that my faculty will strongly encourage me to stick with the default curriculum for the last quarter of a CS major, which is systems programming and security, and so I'm looking for feedback here about how much weight I should give that advice. It's the same story for both subjects -- useful and somewhat interesting stuff, I'm glad to know what I've already learned, but I just don't get excited about it. I do enjoy writing in C and C++ (notably unlike a lot of my classmates), and I found the academic exploration of networking protocol stacks fascinating, but kernel programming and network administration don't appeal to me as careers. To top it off, I feel like the professors that teach those two classes don't add much to the understanding I get from the textbooks, so if I change my mind later, I could very well get 95% of the benefit just by buying the book and teaching it to myself.

Am I making a mistake here? Is there something important I'm not considering? One side of my brain screams, ""no, you idiot, internship is obvious win"", but the other side says I don't have enough information about my future desires and what employers would prefer to see....I have decision fatigue, help me out."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Would you recommend a masters or doctorate for someone in your field? Do you have any insight into BME based startups?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8mjp?context=5)|Not really, my grad degree was worth $4k a year, not really a wise ROI. The flip side is it could lead you to a job opportunity, it could be up to you. For doctorate, it could be worth it, but your faculty adviser will pressure you to go into academia, which is very cut throat.  BME startups are where innovation is centered around. It is exciting, fast moving, and also high risk. 9 out of 10 will go bankrupt, 19 out of 20 will not make it to market, you're asked to go above and beyond the 9 to 5 engineering job. But I love it and will recommend a young engineer to try it out.
[How different is the day to day life of a biomedical engineer in comparison to say a mechanical or civil engineer? Do you Spend more of your time in an office or laboratory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7ocr?context=5)|All depends on where the project is or what needs to be done. So early on, we will try different stuff, in lab and playing with pig hearts and making stuff on the go. Then as it matures, it becomes more paper work and relying on vendors or manufacturing techs, so then becomes more office work. I'd say there's more time in lab than mech or civil engineer.
[How much money do you make per year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8jei?context=5)|After grad school, I started at 70k, and 8 years in, I'm making 110k right now. That plus bonus and stock options.
[PhD or MS? How does the bonus system work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa4yt?context=5)|MS, bonus basically is meeting the goal that is set by my supervisor. If I meet half the goals, I get 5k.
[You have pictures of the prototypes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7xuc?context=5)|You can google the word Corevalve and see a relative example of my prototype.[corevalve](http://cdn.medgadget.com/img/corevalve.jpg)
[What's your favorite device that's currently under clinical trials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7xuc?context=5)|That also is one of the most exciting device right now in the US. To do valve repair procedure without doing open heart surgery, faster recovery and less pain, there are draw backs though. Won't be as effective and could lead to stroke, so for now it's for an targeted patient population. There are two similar trials going on, one by Medtronic and another by Edwards.
[Was that EDMed out of Nitinol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa21l?context=5)|I think Corevalve was stainless steel and Sapien is NiTi.
[I'm also a biomedical engineer and am on my way to getting my masters next year. I was wondering if your company is looking for any interns this summer. How challenging is it do design these prototypes? Do you use SolidWorks? Do you test biocompatibilty in-vitro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8jee?context=5)|In general, the medical device industry is hiring, and job future looks good. The hardest part is breaking in, getting that first internship job or know someone to give you a chance, it's part of the issue with a regulated industry. I would warn about startups though, you could end up joining and company goes bankrupt in months.  Prototypes come in several flavors, (1) just a mock up (2) functional (3) pre-frozen design. I've made mock up and functional prototypes from homedepot and arts&amp;craft stuff. Some people can do it and some can't.  We use Solidworks, but not necessary in prototyping.  We test biocompatibility several ways, the most stringent is to grind it up and implant it in animals. The easiest is to put some cells on it and measure how many survived. But all the tests have to be done to satisfy regulatory requirements.
[What do you need to know to do prototyping?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa7jp?context=5)|Not much, maybe the difference between screwdriver and hammer? Some people can't prototype though, I think a good indicator is if he/she is confident (not necessarily good) about fixing a house.
[As someone who is currently an undergrad studing BME, what is the job availability for Bachelors, Masters, etc?  Also, are their any specific technologies or ideas in the industry that are quite interesting, but relatively unknown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8kx4?context=5)|It's a regulated industry, but I would suggest you look into internship, that'll give you best chance to get a job when you leave school, to have that connection. It's a small industry and everyone know everyone, so that connection matters more than being a MechE or EE.  I think it's interesting that as more drugs are taken off the market, more medical devices are being relied on to help these patients. There are always interesting ideas worked on by people, usually in areas of cardiovascular and orthopedic where there's the most money, but they usually keep it a secret. For many good reasons.
[In my biology and neuroscience classes I always used to drift off in my mind and imagine biomechanically enhanced superhuman warriors.   Do you think in the future humans will be able to be significantly enhanced mentally and physically via neurological/biochemical/mechanical implants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8ayf?context=5)|How far in the future? In our life time? Probably only in certain areas of physical implants. The biggest issue with implants is how it is biocompatible, deal with tissue growth, and how it is maintained. So take artificial hearts, most of the implantable ones only have a short term battery, so you won't die when changing the main battery that's hanging outside your body. Things that might happen might be prosthetic that can make you run faster and jump higher, that'll probably happen soon.
[What if I told you that our lifetime will not be limited?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9r6o?context=5)|Then.... I guess yes   ...?
[I'm currently getting my undergrad in mechanical with a concentration in biomechanics and I am pretty sure I'd be looking into a Masters or a PhD afterward.  My question is, which should I go for and should I first get a job with a company that would help compensate some of the costs or should I first get the advanced degree and then look for a better job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8pdm?context=5)|I did both, where I applied for jobs and grad schools. I ended up not finding a lot of job prospects, where I wished I did more internship while I was an undergrad. So grad school made sense for me. You should probably be aware that most BME grad schools are able to support the student's tuition and stipend, in return for research (which is great for your resume). I'd say the better reason to go to grad school is the thesis work, research exp, and industry connection. I don't have any comments on the course work, wouldn't want to offend the university professors :)
[Where'd you go to school, and how is the job market for BME's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8uqf?context=5)|I would say, it's not where you go to school, but what you did with it that counts. Where I went to school did nothing for me in terms of grad school and first job out of grad school. 1/3 of people I work with came from no-name schools.   Carnegie Mellon University. I guess I shouldn't have said the phrase, it means different things for different people.
[How long before replacing one's heart with a mechanical one is common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7vib?context=5)|Well, that's a tough question. Advancements are so swift but there has been so many failures. The last company that did this was Abiomed, and after 5 patients they stopped their trial. The hard part is not making an artificial heart that can pump but adjusting it to match the response of the body.  There are some studies done by universities by individuals, but it will be a good 20 years before it becomes common. Especially if you consider how long it takes to do clinical studies and prove it's efficacy to regulatory bodies.
[I'm just entering an undergrad degree of Biomedical Engineering. I'd like to ask you a personal question though. Are you content with the work that you do?   Might I also ask for some advice, to any student starting their degree in BioM, if it isnt too much trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w91md?context=5)|I'll just say this, someone I was in study group with in undergrad, is making sprinklers. There are people walking around with my implants in them, keeping them alive, yeah I'm pretty satisfied.  Advice: most of stuff you learn in school you'll never see again, but keep your GPA up and do internships. If you can't find one, see if your school is doing summer research, anything will get you somewhere.
[Could you not just use some sort of adaptive control scheme to handle the variation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9hx8?context=5)|Then those sensors will have to plug into all over the patients body, from kidneys, head, liver, etc etc. Just too invasive.
[But isn't very easy to modify pressure using turbine than with some kind of pump?  And is having two turbines a very good fail safe considering one can support the body by itself, especially as there seems to be room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wc4bn?context=5)|I think that person that was implanted died shortly afterwards.  Modifying pressure is pretty much the same, I don't think one is especially easier with another, it's adjusting the controller. one pump is for your lungs, another is for your body, so they are two devices. It's not backup of each other. Now your chance for failure just went up twice as likely.
[I am a medical student doing research now for a CT surgeon.  What devices type of devices do you work on?  What devices are considered hot items now to develop due to lack of market or inadequate devices? Things I am familiar with include artificial valves, grafts/artificial aorta, VADs, artificial hearts. Are there any other items that you are working on that are not being used at all?  Any technology developing stem cell grafts for MI or other heart damage? Some ideas might be artificial veins for CABG or new stent technology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9a3t?context=5)|The device I work on are cardiovascular device, something that is novel and not on market. The hot devices are usually the ones that follows the money. So things like cardiovascular, orthopedic, and things to keep patients out of hospitals. The devices that will become huge in the near future, the next gen, are TransAorticValveImplant/Heart sensors/Heart failure devices. I'm not an expert on stem cell grafts but definitely a lot of effort in research universities and private corporations.
[Are you assigned project individually or is usually a team effort?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w7vvr?context=5)|The projects are team effort, there are so much to do, ranging from design, testing, manufacturing, documentation, pre-clinical trials, regulatory approval submission, clinical trials.   If you break the projects down, to a piece of plastic piece, that'll be individual, but usually people are hired to do specific work. So there's a guy who's good at plastics, another good at welding, another good at testing, etc etc.
[Do you know what hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is? If so, with what you're doing, is there any way to fix it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8u08?context=5)|I know what it is, think of basically the heart becomes thicken and inflexible, so it is less efficient in pumping blood, and have to work harder, and it's a downward cycle. My work doesn't address it, but there are implantable heart pumps (Left Ventricular Assist Device [LVAD]) that are addressing it. So far it's been a bridge to transplant device, but the more it is used, the more doctors and engineers are able to convince regulatory and insurance that it's a device for a larger patient population.
[Do you think your company does a good job monitoring your devices once they're in use?  Do your practices exceed the FDA's limited requirements? Would you feel responsible if one of the devices you've designed hurt someone because of a design flaw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w98v7?context=5)|Mmm, I would say no. We do monitor but in general FDA does not necessarily require post-monitoring. FDA will require post-monitoring for a period of time when in clinical trial, but not when it goes on market. They've been considering it but there's a huge push back from the industry. Yeah, I would feel responsible. You can't walk away from it, especially since there are a number of required steps to diagnose and deal with the issue. The second worst thing that can happen to a product is someone dies and the way to fix is is impossible. The worst thing is nobody knows why it killed someone.  I will also mention, the category of cardiovascular disease, is very complex. Nobody has just 1 disease, usually it's a long and complex journey of how the heart is now sick. So the category of patients I deal with, end stage heart disease, usually have other causes of death that's not related to our product, and it's still has to be explained and justified.
[Have you seen this TED talk? What do you think about the rush to make some of these types of devices and give them wireless connectivity without fully exploring and understanding the inherent susceptibility of these systems and necessity for well thought out security to be designed into these devices from the beginning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w97mq?context=5)|Sure, just like someone can get a RFID tag reader, someone can get a medical implant RF communicator and hack it. Pacemakers have this ""wand"" that is waved over the device, to control and adjust the programming. Company rep and doctors does this all the time. This is nothing new, a ""rogue"" doctor could do the same, just use the device and reprogram it. Question is, why would you want to. Is the world out to get you? A bullet from a gun would be easier.
[How difficult is replicating the AV, SA and Purkinje systems? Do you think we'll ever see a fully self-contained artificial heart? Or, will we always rely on fail-safe externals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8unb?context=5)|Well, in a way, it is done already with the pacemaker. Where leads are placed near AV node and lead down to Purkinje system. There are some stem cells studies done, to see if it will regenerate, so maybe that would be the future.  I think it was around 2005, there was the Abiomed Abiocor totally artificial heart, the system was totally implantable with induction recharging system. It's in trial to be commercially available now.
[If cats always land on their feet, and toast always lands butter side up; if I strap a piece of buttered toast to the back of a cat, hold the cat upside-down in the air, then let go of it, will the cat spin in place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8ys9?context=5)|No.
[Please elaborate...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9hhe?context=5)|It won't spin in space.
[I'm an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student who would like to continue to a Masters in Biomedical Engineering. Our ME program is very much vanilla ME, but I'm working with a professor in our Biomedical/Osteopathic department to do research in pancreas cells for diabetes on the side.  I'd really like to work in research and design for prosthetic limbs/organs, and human augmentation in general.  Is there any advice you can offer on getting into the field from those initial conditions? I'm trying to find good co-op job(s) for my junior year; can you recommend any companies to look into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8yss?context=5)|I don't know of any large companies that does prosthetic limbs/organs, so most likely you'll be in a startup when you get out of school. Possibly relocation, if you're okay with that.  Sounds like it's in the areas of Tissue Engineering that you're interested in. If you check back, I'll have a few company names that are looking expanding and hiring. One misconception is that people think they need a biomedical degree, grad or undergrad, to do medtech, not true. Medtech has been around for 4 decades and oldest biomedical programs are about 20 years old. So if you'd like to try and apply to these companies, I wouldn't let a graduate degree stop you.
[I'm currently looking for a job, I've got a BME bachelors, and have been working for a couple years now (mostly contract work). I've heard that Southern California is like the haven for biomedical companies due to the high concentration of companies. Do you know of other places to look? Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9jom?context=5)|Yup, I would look in San Diego, San Francisco. If you're open to other states, I would say Boston, CT, NJ, and Minneapolis.
[I am receiving an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering (with a minor in CSE). I have market analysis experience, am currently participating in BIOMOD 2012 (International DNA Origami competition) and am doing clinical cancer image analysis. I have had past experience with various other things - and am currently a webmaster for 3 separate websites.  My current emphasis is on nanotechnology but it appears as though this is a field that is very slow moving due to regulations and so on. Could you give your interpretation of nanotechnology in Biomedical Engineering? If possible, could you tell me if, from your experience, I require a MS to specifically work in Nanotech? I have the opportunity to talk with a department head of Bio-nanotech for a huge company (Think P&amp;G) and so I will probably have a closer insight into this so feel free to skip over this specific question unless you know something specific that might be of use.  Other than that, could you give some company names worth looking into for employment after graduation? I would love to get my hands deep into nanotechnology with an undergraduate degree but everything I've heard is that I need a master's or even PHD? As an undergraduate, could you tell me what my workload would be like?  As one other thing, do your jobs typically vary? Like in one instance, are you doing specifically animal testing and in the next, doing laboratory work, or even in the next doing computer work or is it strictly to your specific qualities, so like in my case, I am very, very good in computers so I will probably be doing mostly cubicle coding work?  Also, did you have any time between getting an undergraduate and getting a graduate degree where you did work, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3waqb1?context=5)|I don't really see any business development around nanotech. Probably only for surface modification or Stainless steel NiTi metal mesh. I would probably do a Biomedical Engineering Masters and focus on biomaterials and biocehm. That would probably be worth focusing.  As for company names, I wouldn't even know where to start for nanotech. Maybe some kind of medical fabric company, but most of those are dying and leaving the country.  Yeah, every day is different, I would do a little of each. It really shifts things around.
[Sounds like you're mostly R&amp;D? Is that correct? I've been leaning towards going to that area myself. Quality/Validation/Regulatory doesn't interest me. How much of a salary difference is there between R&amp;D and the rest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wdo87?context=5)|Yeah, I'm more of early stage R&amp;D, it fits well with my creativity and knowledge base. Basically get a problem to solve and prove it in a patient. Of course, many steps in between those two points.  I think R&amp;D has the advantage here in terms of salary, but companies are always looking for good QA people to hire. But in terms of path to success, I think it's in R&amp;D and marketing.
[I'm a biomedical engineer in my sophomore year of college, and I feel like all the classes I'm taking now are really hard, even though I know the concepts already.   1) What did you do when you felt like things were difficult for you? 2) Are there more of any one gender where you work than the other? 3) Did you go to med school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w97rh?context=5)|I think I just stopped taking them, haha, it's good to ask seniors what classes to avoid. Yeah, more male than females, but it's 60/40, and trend is tipping. Nope, thought about med school but wasn't what I wanted to do.
[Is there a benefit to getting an MBA following a masters degree in BME? As far as getting into a product development or project management role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9y4h?context=5)|Yes and no. I think MBA is over-valued, isn't stopping me from considering it though. But a MBA fits in well with large medical companies, that does more marketing, operations, management.
[I'm graduating in the Spring (BS BME, Tissue Eng. &amp; Biomaterials) but am having a hard time finding somewhere to work. When you say you got a job through a recruiter, do you mean a recruiter from the company that hired you or a head hunter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9g5y?context=5)|I applied through Monster.com, where a recruiter found my resume, and gave it to a startup. Not a bad business, recruiting, haha.
[Any tips on finding a job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9g5y?context=5)|Believe it or not, Monster.com.
[I'm graduated last July with my bio engineering degree... I'm working retail now, any suggestions on how to find a job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9cyi?context=5)|Are you willing to relocate? Try looking for jobs in Boston/NJ/San Diego/SF/Minneapolis market.
[Where are most of the medical device companies located in the US? California and Minnesota?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9iy7?context=5)|And Boston, NJ, Miami, San Diego, San Francisco.
[Why are you keeping Dick Cheney alive??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9iab?context=5)|I find it creepy that he is flaunting it.
[Any advice for a senior in high school interested in this field and attending pre med in the fall? I want to do medicine but there are so many aspects of it that I'm worried I may pick the wrong field and be unable to find a job after grad school.   Also what medical teaching institutions do u highly respect or recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9ae0?context=5)|Mmm, well, if you are thinking about medical school, by aspect/field, do you mean specialty? If so, I wouldn't worry about it, because between now and college and med school, you'll have so much time to choose and find out what you want to do. But I would not pick pre-med as my major for medical school, consider engineer, down side is, it's usually tough to keep the GPA higher than 3.5.
[Follow up question... have you found your job to get harder or easier as time went on? Did your job get more or less rewarding as you went on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wchma?context=5)|I'm 33 with 8 yrs of experience, as a product manager. I still do design stuff but do more product management. My involvement with engineering is more early stage stuff, once it's going to manufacturing I try to stay out of it. It's sometimes high pressure, it's not for everyone, but I don't think it's unbearable. It's a clash of personalities and sometimes you're better off sitting back and letting it play out. I've learned tricks and trade to make my job easier, like I tell my friends, a well trained monkey can do 80% of my job.
[Are there any internships you could hook me up with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w8mco?context=5)|Sorry, we're not hiring interns this summer. Small startup with limited resources. Good luck with your search!
[I'm in college and thinking about either Materials with a specialization in Biomaterials or Biomedical. What is the job market like for BME?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9pja?context=5)|I don't know much about materials, except that there is no perfect material, so the search goes on, I bet the market is pretty good in that regard.   Job market is better than others, I would say. The downside is, it's very concentrated on certain cities, so if you're a biomedical engineer in Alaska, Hawaii, NDakota, you get the point, you're screwed.
[High school senior here looking to become a biomedical engineer - I'm by far a science/math person and molecular bio is my favorite. Do you think I'll have the opportunity to not learn about prostheses and implants and just concentrate on cellular/molecular/tissue work as a biomedical engineer? Or should I go for just a degree in biochemistry and see where that gets me? Any advice is more than welcome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9oml?context=5)|Hi, I think that when you consider your courses and major, you'll have a chance to see what classes are offered. Universities differ, some will offer one but not other, all depends on the Professor. But, at the end of the day, if you're passionate about something, you can always do research of volunteer for an institution that'll give you the leg up on competition, more than any course will.
[I'm a sophomore at Miami University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I want to work with prosthetics and improve upon the way that they interface with the human nervous system. Couple of questions: 1) What is the job market like for biomedical engineers? 2) What company do you work for? 3) Do you know of any company internships provided through your company or possibly others that maybe you interned at? 4) Any advice for an up-and-coming biomedical engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wcbp9?context=5)|Great school, job market is good, I currently work for a startup medical device company, sorry too small to offer internships (besides you want a big company that's around when you apply for a permanent job), talk to your Professors to network, and find out who's recruiting at your school.
[Awesome, thanks! and feel free to not answer this one if it's rude but what was your starting salary out of school and how much room is there for advancement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wd9ft?context=5)|70K out of school, lots of room for advancement. Good luck :)
[Cool, one of my friends is studying BME (Purdue). A lot of the stuff he's doing is really neat.  My question for you is, what made you decide BME over other engineering degrees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9j1n?context=5)|I was fascinated by medicine and I was an engineer, so I settle for the middle ground. Thank goodness I didn't go to medical school.
[What subjects did you need for you biomedical engineering course, and where did you go to university/ collage?  also what country did you study in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9pc2?context=5)|US, MechE for undergrad, Biomed for grad. I think biomed courses included biochemistry, hemodynamics, numerical methods for tissue, topics in prototyping. etc. Most were worthless.
[Thank you that is very useful, but i misspoke, when i said what subjects did you need, i meant to say (and should have included) what subjects did you need to have already studied before they let you take the course?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa89a?context=5)|Surprisingly, nothing, no requirement  oh, also in the US for both schools.
[How do you account for endocrine or nervous system induced signals necessary to change cardiac output in order for a human to adequately respond to its environment?   Obvious heart implant patients are not running marathons, but even some basal level of regulation seems necessary for daily activities for this to ever be considered a viable option.  Has biomedical engineering gotten to the point where we can place, lets say, beta 2 receptors on artificiality grafted cells on the devices surface which are competent for endogenous signaling and can translate that information to the artificial pump? Rather than placing sensors or something mechanical everywhere on the body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wagpb?context=5)|Answer is no. That's why artificial hearts and LVAD patients, have to be closely monitored and parameters of output adjusted. When I worked on artificial heart floor, we had to monitor the patient every hour, and if out of whack get a doctor to agree to changes, granted that was a long time ago.
[I mean no troll, but what is your stance on religion?  I ask because my ex's Mother oversees the installation of said valves, and she is a devout Catholic, giving no credit to science and all to god for the miracles he has given.  I mean, whatever you want to believe, but I find it hard to believe that people who work in a 'hard' science field, producing and installing artificial organ components can look past all of the work and ideas that go into the process.  Do you have any insight on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wjjod?context=5)|She oversees them? in what capacity? As a doctor, clinical coordinator, manufacturer? Well, as an atheist, I would say that these are imperfect implants with their faults and downside, if God wants to take credit for it, then go right ahead. But I usually find that arguing with people who doesn't listen to reason, is pretty pointless, I have a better time talking to a wall.
[Do you ever consult with top hospitals or those in private practice? If so which hospitals are you seeking to see the first to use these devices, and are you mainly consulting with cardiothoractic surgeons and cardiologists?   Secondly, what do expect insurance coverage for these devices to be for the average joe who needs a cardiovascular implant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wbe88?context=5)|I would say you should follow the doctors, see which doctors are most often on the news, they'll have experience using these devices and have support staff and systems in place. You need both Interventional Cardiologists and CT Surgeons. Afterall, when something goes wrong, CT surgeons will have to do the clean up and also can help with referral.  Can't really speak to the insurance coverage, I thought most are 80% covered.
[Are you my Uncle Tim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9jsj?context=5)|Nope, sorry, good luck finding your real dad.
[An executive from Boston Scientific came to talk to my BME class about the business end of the medical device industry.  He remarked that most of the stents were produced in Ireland at a cost of about 90 cents per stent.  They were then sold to hospitals under exclusive contracts for around $1200 per stent.  I understand that most of that cost is needed to fund clinical trials necessary for FDA approval, but do engineers in the industry see a problem with the business end of things.  Is there any support for nationalized healthcare at the cost of slowing research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9ng1?context=5)|Well, you're talking about a stent, which is a fabricated from a piece of NiTi tubing about a inch long. Made by a government subsidized Ireland (no longer the case) company, and made in bulk. There are more high end medical devices out there. I'm no economist or business major, but I would say that $1200 is well worth the price compared to open heart surgery.
[I'm a BME Master's student at a good school, and I currently plan to pursue a PhD. Do you know anything about the industry market for cellular and molecular engineering as opposed to medical device design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9cgs?context=5)|With tissue engineering and stem cell, it's going to be the next explosion segment. I would say you're on a right path I wished my organic chemistry and cell biology was good enough to be in that path.
[How much do you make in base and bonus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w94zi?context=5)|110k + 10k annual bonus + stocks.
[I am have a Biology degree and am considering a Bioengineering MSc, would there be industry jobs for people of my background, or would employers want someone with more of an engineering background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9zby?context=5)|As someone who hires, I think people look at what you did last as the best indicators, so if you did Bioengineering masters, that'll be the degree. There are plenty of people who are science background and does Biomedical engineering, I don't think it's an issue.
[Can an implanted device run off the bodies power supply or do they always need their own power source?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3we4br?context=5)|So far nothing that I know of can run off bodies source, through either kinetic, thermo, chemical, or electrical. It's just such a small amount of energy that can be generated. There is a company though, called Cardiomems, that puts pressure transducers, usually stays dorment, but when near an induction power source, would power up and transmit RF info about pressure, pretty cool.
[This may be outside of your expertise, i don't know, but i ams  a patient facing the possibility of another heart operation. How long do you think it will be before we can non-invasively replace one of a patient's valves in the united states?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9f4t?context=5)|Sorry to hear that. It's already here, look into Medtronic Corevalve and Edwards Sapien. But these devices are for older patients and I don't know if you'll fit into that category.
[What are your thoughts on the Da Vinci and valve replacements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3w9xby?context=5)|Well it is not really proved to be any better than a surgeon. I think the conclusion was that the most damage was done when going on bypass. It's also risky if there's an emergency, where the doctor will have convert to open heart surgery very quickly.
[I would like to know how the inventing process goes. If you have some novel idea for disease treatment, does it belong to your lab? Say if you make a discovery, what happens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qbb5u/iama_biomedical_engineer_inventing_and_making/c3wa9ub?context=5)|Well, it could be anything. Some times it's a doctor think of a way of doing something better. Or marketing report shows a unmet need in a segment. Or an entrepreneur would want to start a new company. So these would all eventually lead to a room of engineers and ask ""how would you solve this problem""

qe9xv,11,2012-03-02,I just realized that happiness is the exception not the rule for my life.,thewrongwire,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe9xv/i_just_realized_that_happiness_is_the_exception/,"First off, I'm not suicidal I don't think, so if it's wrong for me to post here I'm sorry, but I'm confused. I don't want to die...but death doesn't scare me. If I found out I had 24 hours to live, I think I would feel relieved. Like the burden of pressure to do something amazing with my life is lifted. I feel like Kirstin Dunst's character in Melancholia if anyone has seen it. I sometimes wish it would kind of just happen in a way out of my control. Like riding down the highway, I imagine a large truck smashing into my car...or if I'm flying I kind of hope for the plane crashing into the ground. 

I'm 27 and probably the most depressed I've been in my life. It seems silly though. I've read some of the other posts here...people have had challenging lives. Nothing bad has ever happened to me. The worst things are I've always been fat and I went bald. Shitty but nothing like what other people went through. For the past few months I've wondered: why am I so depressed all of a sudden? I had a few theories, but the more I thought about it the more I realized I've never been truly happy. I don't mean I'm sad 100% of the time. I have friends. I have fun. I lead a pretty normal life, I guess.

I can honestly list of the few periods of my life I was really happy (isn't that weird?):

* The moment I got my acceptance letter from a top 20 school to midway through 1st semester of college. I just felt like...the entire world was open to me. But now I realized I'm too stupid/lazy to accomplish anything.
* A summer internship where I roomed with my friend best and we lived without a care and the future seemed so bright. It was the best summer of my life.
* My last semester of college the moment I got a great job offer and had 4 more to choose from until about 6 months in and I realized I picked the wrong one :(
* Getting [and accepting] a really high paying job at a prestigious company last year despite thinking I bombed the interview. I was pretty happy for about 4 months, but I think it just because I was so busy moving, meeting new people, working that depression seemed to take a back seat.
* The night and week after where I got my first kiss and lost my virginity at 26. I finally felt like a man.
* Reading a message last month from the girl of my dreams on okcupid who [for reasons I didn't and will never understand] wanted to meet me. I think she's the only girl I've ever connected with. But she lives kind of far and just wanted to be friends after the first date (was more of a casual meet really). I guess maybe she thought it could go somewhere despite her never being attracted to me. So I never saw her again. The other date I went on, I couldn't care less about the rejection, but I still think about her sometimes. I get mad at myself a lot. I had a shot and I blew it. If I had spent the years leading up to meeting her taking care of myself and not being fat and lazy maybe she would have liked me back.

I feel like my brain just isn't wired for happiness. It's faulty. Does anyone else feel this way? Did you get over it? Is there something I can do...something to hope for? I want to be happy. I really do. I just don't know how. :(

Every week, I tell myself THIS IS THE WEEK. I'm going to finally get my act together and stick to my much needed diet. And inevitably every week I go a few days and then fail.

Tomorrow I have an interview at the top company in my field. I've known about this for two fucking weeks. I should have prepared like crazy. This is literally an opportunity of a life time, but instead I did nothing. I spent my free time redditing, being depressed, porn, and crying. Why am I so fucking stupid?

Last year someone I knew pretty closely committed suicide. We were very close friends my first year at college, but drifted apart after that. We still kept in touch though. At the time, I was in one of my happy periods and I was so confused. I couldn't understand it. But now...yeah, I get it. He was a good friend. I miss him. I don't want anyone to miss me."
qe1dn,7,2012-03-01,Just offered a full time position at a company I have interned for for a year.

qdovv,1,2012-03-01,Snort Setup Question,mistawac,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qdovv/snort_setup_question/,"I'm trying to setup snort in our network, but am skeptical of my only option to deploy it.

[Here's](http://imgur.com/qTNTo) our network setup (yeah, small company).  I'm the system and network administrator basically (actually an intern) and need to get an IPS/IDS solution in place.  I've read and been told that Snort is a fantastic opensource solution.  My thing is that we have only one option to deploy it due to limited funds and limited hardware.

If you take a look at that picture you'll see a quickly thrown together view of the network I'm working with.  We have far more servers than that, but you get the basic idea from the drawing.  My only option is to implement Snort as a VM on VM1.  Is this something that would work for Snort, or does it need to be in between the network and the ASA on it's own machine to work properly?

qg33y,4,2012-03-03,About to graduate with CS degree and I'm not sure what I want to do. I think want to do something that involves science. Any advice or ideas?,SnailHunter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qg33y/about_to_graduate_with_cs_degree_and_im_not_sure/,"My biggest fear is that I will end up in a job working on menial projects that I don't care about at all. That's how I felt at my internship this summer, where I worked on iPhone apps. It really wasn't fulfilling to me to work projects that I just didn't really care about. I liked the experience of learning, and getting better at programming, and there were moments where I really enjoyed the hunt of coming up with a solution to a problem, but I didn't care about the products I was working on at all. It became very draining to me after just a few months. I couldn't imagine being stuck in that kind of job for a few years. Or a lifetime.

My dream would be to do something in the sciences, working on advancing our understanding of the world in some way. My *real* dream job would be to somehow be involved with writing software used by NASA, or something similar. I would just love to be involved in any way with something like that. I also think I would enjoy working on any type of big project that would affect a lot of people's lives (like writing software that would control an underground subway or something like that). Those types of jobs sound really fulfilling to me, but I'm not sure what exactly my options are when it comes to these things with just a bachelors degree in computer science.



I've got a few questions:

How important is it to future employers that I get a job right out of college? Does it matter? Is it better to just get any old job to start out with than to wait and try to find my 'dream' job (or at least something in the same vein as it)? Also, does it look bad to jump around a lot in jobs, or is it seen as a plus for having that much more or a diversity of experience? 

My basic 'plan' right now is to just find a job (knowing my lack of experience will greatly hinder me from achieving my dream jobs right out of college), and if I end up hating it, just move on to the next one, all-the-while looking into finding a way to reach one of my ideal jobs. On the side, I want to be making my own projects, apps as well, and hopefully make a small amount of profit from those.



What kind of opportunities are realistic for me, as it comes to the types of dream jobs I listed above? What path would you recommend? Should I consider grad school? Does it sound like I maybe should've chosen engineering or a physical science to major in instead of computer science, given my aspirations? Please be brutally honest.

Would it be appropriate for me to ask one of my cs professors to meet up to discuss these types of questions? I feel like my advisor doesn't really help that much, and I have a professor in mind that I really look up to.

One more aside: I love math and I really like the theory side of computer science.  I love studying algorithms, and I'm taking a model-checking class right now that I find really cool. Are there any jobs I could realistically get that involve something like model-checking?

Any advice at all would be so very appreciated. I need some honest direction from people more knowledgeable than myself."

[Aside from making my favorite mod ever, he is just an awesome guy. In about 2003 when I was considering trying to go from business software product management to a video game job, he took the time to talk to me on the phone for 2 hours to give me guidance and advice!  And in the years since he's always been just a really terrific person to talk to and seems like a really great person. How hard was it to get NS2 on steam? were the valve guys big fans of NS/UW or was it just like any other business relationship? Any interesting memories from when you were working on the first Natural Selection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgoui?context=5)|The beta wasn't for motivation, it was for money. We needed our community's support or we were...going to have to close up shop. However, we always wanted to get feedback from our fans as early as possible, we just didn't want to do it THAT early. - Not hard. We sold a lot of copies of Half-life because people wanted to play NS1 (or so we heard anecdotally, quite a few times) so I think they saw value there. They are also cool folks who want to help small guys like us and have always been there to lend a helping hand. - Heh. I mostly huddled inside and programmed for 2 years. I literally didn't leave my room more than once or twice a week. I was completely obsessed and I had the time of my life. I've never been so productive or focused, not before and not since. I'm glad I did it, but I have to say it wasn't balanced at all. Now our team prides itself on doing great work but without the personal sacrifice. OK we've taken crap salaries for a long time but we're getting past that point now...
[When the beta first came out, you remarked that it was a big risk and you were using the pressure of a public beta to motivate the NS2 developers (if i recall correctly). how did that work out? did you get the feedback you expected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgoui?context=5)|Thank YOU Joe! Thanks for all your support and servers all over the years. How could I forget?
[I am a machinima maker and have started a new comedy troupe that is planning to use NS2 as the main engine in one of our new series. I remember reading that the NS2 edit tools include a lot of things geared specifically towards movie-making. Is this still true and if so what can you tell me about it? Will you be able to import custom models and textures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgquo?context=5)|Please do this! But don't do it yet. We still have a bit of work to do with our tools. Our original Onos teaser was all done with our tools but we need to do more with them to make them fun and easy to use. That said, all the tools are in the main game's directory, you can play around now. You can import your own custom art now. Here's a tutorial: http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/2011/7/ns2_custom_model_importing_guide.
[What exactly was the BUS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhxl3?context=5)|Oh, you bitch. ;)  I'm sorry, I am forbidden for ever talking about this. One day you will see something like it from us, but I doubt we'll ever tell you ""THAT was the BUS"".  Sorry I can't give you more.
[Did you ever feel worried that having an OPEN(ish) beta so early in the development process for NS2 would negatively impact how the game is received? Has the feedback you've received been helpful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgmyj?context=5)|Nope. We want to make sure we're making a sequel that is faithful to the original. We've made some bad decisions that we've reversed since even before the beta (we started getting feedback in 2009) and I'm SO glad.
[You distribute NS2 via Steam but don't sell the game on Steam. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgl5o?context=5)|We will - come summer. The game isn't ready for the mega audience of Steam. But we want our community to play the game now and give us feedback while we still have time to make (sometimes big) changes.
[In the same vein, considering CS, TFC and DOD are all fully-owned and controlled Valve IP that leaves NS1 as one of the biggest non-valve HL1 mods. Has Valve ever gone to you with a buyout/employment offer? Can you give a quick history of your personal/professional relationship with Valve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgl5o?context=5)|Valve has always been very supportive of us, and continues to be, but has never given us an offer like that.
[As a follow up would you take it now that you've built your own engine?  Would you have taken it before you started to build your own engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkfd0?context=5)|Hmmm. I actually don't think we'd take it either way, unless a) it was an amazing deal and b) we could continue to operate totally independently.  But it was a pretty big sacrifice to do things our own way (in terms of salary, stress and time taken). For most people/projects I would recommend getting support like this if you can. If I ever start a new company, I would be less concerned with independence and control and more interested in moving quickly.
[How do you feel about how far back the release date has been pushed since the original trailer for NS2 was released? What is the current projected release date for NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgk81?context=5)|There are many embarrassing factors involved with not making our original date, but we're going to make this one. - We don't have an exact release date but it will be this summer for sure.
[Piggybacking on that last question/answer, what programming language or ecosystem is the easiest to get into as a new developer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xigsz?context=5)|Not a simple question to answer. I'd probably recommend Javascript right now: it's very similar to Lua and here in the Bay Area, you can get a very high-paying great job doing web programming if you aren't able to make the transition into games right away.
[What are the current plans for supporting Natural Selection 2 after its release? Should we expect paid DLC? Or smaller free updates like Team Fortress 2 (and building off of this question, when can I expect hats for my gorge)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgzmq?context=5)|We want to ""unite the world through play"". If people have to pay for updates, then suddenly our community splits and people aren't all playing the same game.  So I expect we'll be releasing tons of patches, maps, new weapons, etc. for years, and all for free. We may add a fireman's hat for the Gorge, but you shouldn't have to pay for it. :)
[How did you come up with the names for the Alien 'classes'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgqg7?context=5)|I wanted short names that reflected how the marines might refer to the aliens when they saw them. That also meant that the words were easy to remember. ""Skulk"", ""Gorge"", ""Lerk"", ""Fade"" and yes, even ""Onos"" were all words that roughnecks might use to crudely refer to these slimy creatures.
[What do you mean by not calling yourselves indie? How do you classify UnknownWorlds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj6zb?context=5)|Hard to say. The whole ""indie"" title is so ridiculous. Devs want to call themselves indie because it seems cool and artsy, but no one seems to know what it really means.  We aren't making a niche game with 8-bit aesthetics that is a personal tale of suffering about the designer's life. But we ARE making a game on our own terms, the way we want to make it.   I don't know if that's ""indie"" or not, but I don't really care. We're making the game we want to make. We hope you love every second of it.
[Have you had much adoption of your in-house engine for mods and other independent projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgkeb?context=5)|Lots of people have been working on mods for NS2. We get regular performance improvements, bug fixes, new alien roles, movement tweaks and so much more from the community. They literally send us the code. We've hired through our community heavily.
[I would like to know how you see the NS2 community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xh1q4?context=5)|Yes there are days we hate everyone.
[I just have to imagine some days after a patch with a rough spot you might just hate everyone. But overall do you and the other developers like to see the heavily opinionated community watching over the whole process, does it pressure you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xh1q4?context=5)|I'm more used to the negativity then some of the other members of the team so I have pretty thick skin. You just have to remember that people usually complain because they care. They care about your game and they don't want to see you mess it up so they react. Harshly.
[What other Sci-Fi games and/or films have inspired Natural Selection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgltf?context=5)|The usual suspects: Aliens. Gloom. Starcraft. Planetside. Blade Runner. Minority Report. Counter-strike. eXistenZ.
[Any thoughts on some spacious, partially-outdoor maps with vegetation?  How would this sort of thing work visually (with the art assets you currently have) and how do you feel it would affect the game mechanics to try this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhw1j?context=5)|Sounds awesome. We would love this, but right now we are focusing on nailing the indoor environments. That's hard enough, especially for a team of our size and resources. If we can pull off indoor environments, there's a really good chance we'll expand them beyond that.
[What do you look for specifically when hiring programmers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgmbh?context=5)|Great communication skills. Great programming skills. Not over engineering things. Passionate about our game. Fun to work with. Knows who we are already and what we do (great cover letter).  We are hiring programmers by the way! http://www.unknownworlds.com/jobs.
[Charlie, I notice that the great emphasis on the cover letter is not just mentioned here on Reddit but on the jobs site itself as well as even the programming test document where it is said to be ""very important!"" I am a college freshman in CS with experience writing a minimal amount cover letters for internships and advice given to me over the months has been varied in regards to what is actually expected of it. Would you be able to give some insight into some potential content a great cover letter would cover from your unique perspective as a programmer (i.e. how do we demonstrate knowledge of the company, should we reiterate parts of the resume or not, talk about side projects/plug our Github, etc.)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi7n4?context=5)|It's kind of like giving a wedding toast: it's hard to give advice on how to do it, but it's completely clear to everyone on the receiving end when you're got a good one or not. The only criteria is that it comes from the heart. If you actually care about our company and game, let it through. If it, it doesn't matter what you say or how you say it.
[As an employer, what are 3 things that you specifically look for when a veteran 3D artist, yet inexperienced in the gaming industry, sends in a resume and art portfolio?  Do they have any chance at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgkyd?context=5)|Cover letter is extremely important: we want to see that they candidate knows who we are and is passionate about what we're doing.  A hot portfolio is very helpful (keep it simple and loading fast, we have ADD). Being versatile in your skills also helps a lot, as we sometimes have to move people around.
[Hey, how big was the spike in sales after NS2 was frontpaged not too long ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtsl?context=5)|We had the biggest day of pre-sales today in at least the past 6 months. It's been really nice!
[When is heavy armor coming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtsl?context=5)|Exosuit is being worked on as we speak. It's coming.
[NS1 had a decently popular professional gaming scene. What do you think about e-Sports today? Are you willing to support and encourage the development of it in regards to NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhbei?context=5)|We are quite committed to it. I watch scrims whenever I can (thanks NS2HD!) and I love it. It's amazing to see what very skilled, very focused teams can do. It's always a rush. I actually can't think of much I'd RATHER do than watch two amazing teams struggle for dominance.  It's hard to get a handle on e-sports today, but I do watch a lot of competitive Starcraft 2 and that's a great model. I'm hoping the scene is ready for something new.
[I loved NS1 specifically because of the asymmetry between the two sides not just in weapons/abilities but in how the teams were managed.  The marines were highly organized but relied on their commander, while the aliens had a more individual approach but everybody could do their thing without being managed by a commander.  So I am wondering why you guys decided to add an alien commander in NS2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi95n?context=5)|I get this question a lot. It's to unify the resource model.  Not having an alien commander in NS1 made the resource model asymmetric which was a big problem for balance. The game could be balanced for small teams or large teams, but didn't ""scale"" for all player sizes. I ended up balancing it for 6 vs. 6 but for NS2 I wanted to fix this problem. That mean unifying the resource model and adding an alien commander.  However, keep in mind that the two roles are going to be totally different, so we're still committed to ""Two Unique Sides"". Just like Starcraft where Zerg plays very different than Terran, but I would say our differences could be even bigger. The alien commander is by far the least finished part of the game right now.
[Do you guys ever get overwhelmed by the feedback on the forums? I know sometimes it can be overly negative or critical. How much actual game balancing takes place from online feedback vs. playtesting/simulations? (and how many playtesters do you guys use?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xiacv?context=5)|Yes we do get overwhelmed, to the point where sometimes we can't look or have to take a break for awhile. I'm pretty good with not letting negative people get to me though.  Balancing is done using a combination of feedback from our internal play testers (I think we have about 30 who play the game almost every day), our development team (we all play the game almost every day) and our wider beta community (31k players). We also have extensive game stats that we've been collecting and we're adding to that almost every patch.
[How many official maps / Environmental texture sets do you currently plan on releasing post-launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xi3sd?context=5)|We are starting on a new map/environment art set now. I imagine we'll add a few new sets, at minimum. We would love to see some new looks!
[Is NS2 going to be localized, or will it only be available in English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj06r?context=5)|I really really want to give our community free reign over localizations. The plan is to allow people to translate the game through a web form (add a new language, start translating) and then people could vote up or down the translations (to get rid of jokes and briefing).
[Just thought I'd say 'kudos' for Mod Support, custom maps and gamemodes were what kept me playing the original NS for as long as I did. I was wondering: Have you thought about adding a 'survival' mode? Single-life marines lasting for as long as they can against a single alien infestor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkcga?context=5)|I think ""survival"" mode would be awesome. You know what? One could make this as an NS2 mod with about 300 lines of Lua script. The most work would be creating a new alien model, but you could use a scaled/tweaked Fade or Onos for now.
[Could you maybe help me understand why NS2 is awesome in ~two sentences?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xih4e?context=5)|An immersive video game like NS2 is the best way to experience these things - more powerful than books, more fantastic than paintball, more personal than film.
[Charlie, how long are you going to use that picture?  Its been around forever!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhm69?context=5)|Busted. Sorry I need some new pics.
[If you were to hypothetically make a sandwich in the next hour, in a kitchen full of everything you need to do it, what would you put on your sandwich?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj06n?context=5)|Oooh, so hungry.  Crusty toasted focaccia. Avocado. Mozzarella. Roasted red peppers. Arugula. Just a sprinkle of the finest olive oil and the best salt you've ever had.
[I actually thought it was really fun. It was very team oriented, and there was more communication than in games like CoD or Battlefield. I haven't tried out Natural Selection yet (I have a massive backlog of games on Steam), but it looks great.   What kind of games do you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkt3y?context=5)|I play a lot of Euro board games, as well as more artsy/unique video games. My favorite video games of recent memory: Braid, Limbo (perfection), Portal and...Mortal Kombat 9.
[Charlie, you do some amazing work with the community, you keep us all well informed of whats going on, my question is how do you cope?  what energy drink fuels Charlie Clevelend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhhms?context=5)|Black tea and lattes. Sightglass or Vega preferred. Our office is in the land of amazing, snobby coffee.
[I've been a huge fan of ns since way back. I've always wanted to play it single player. Now when beta is starting to look and feel real good to play I'm even more interested in the idea. Perhaps something to dabble in after the game is released? I mean... Just look at it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhdk0?context=5)|I've had an idea for a story for awhile, but I don't see us doing SP any time soon. Budgets have gotten completely out of control in this area (Uncharted 3 anyone?) and I don't want to figure out how to spend 30 million dollars creating cut-scenes.  I think our company will always be about multiplayer. It just makes so much more sense to make a game that people play forever instead of once, and I'm much more interested in people-oriented games than story-oriented games.
[You've been committed to NS for a long time now. How did you decide to start, and did you ever imagine you'd still be at it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xhtw9?context=5)|Heh. No, if I realized how much time I would on this game I'm not sure I would've gone down this path. It's become a lifestyle.  I started because I got fired from my last job and I had saved up some money. I had this idea of a game burning in my brain and was amazed to see how big the mod scene had gotten. Making it a HL mod seemed like the right approach to bring this game to the world so I just started.   http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014394/1-Hour-Video-Game.
[I bought your game twice via various deals (one was humble bundle, the other something else). I'm on Ubuntu though, and while there certainly won't be a native version, will any effort be put into any potential incompatibilities with Wine/Crossover Games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgs1y?context=5)|Probably not. We're a tiny team and we barely have enough resources to get the game done. I don't think it makes sense for us to work on the a linux client or Wine support.  However, I bet our community can and will do this.
[That woul require some access to the source code. The renderer has to be rewritten to opengl, and probably some file access/threading changes. Totaly doable, but not only with the lua code. In an older newspost that possibility was mentioned and seemed like the way forward for a potential linux port. Is this still the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xkjcc?context=5)|Hey Asraniel, good to see you outside of our forums.  Sorry, I was talking about the Wine support. I don't know much about it, but I know our players got NS1 working in Wine, I bet they could do for NS2 also.
[What will you do after the game is released and you can take some time off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgw7n?context=5)|I plan on bicycling across Italy. It's something I've wanted to do for a very long time.  Then it's back to work.

I think that was just luck and timing. Or maybe it's just that most people don't ask?
[Do you have any other projects in mind for the Spark engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xgvy8?context=5)|Yes, quite a few. Some very different genres too. Some pretty experimental ideas too.
[Hey Charlie! I started playing NS in early 2003. I've had my times off but I always come back to it. Just wanted you to know that you and your mod (and now game) have given me many many hours of enjoyable videogame moments. So here's the question, how comfortable do you guys feel with the release date for Ns2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xguoa?context=5)|We're committed to it. If the game has serious flaws that we think we need more time to address, we'll fix them instead of releasing something bad, but I'm think we're going to hit it.
[I'd love to hear more about your involvement with MindRover. Sadly it's no longer available for purchase, but it succeeded in getting really good reviews at places like IGN upon release. Do you think it would be more successful if released now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xl5it?context=5)|Wow, you played MindRover?! That was the first commercial game I worked on. It was just a couple a people - I worked my butt off on that game. It was a complete blast too.
[Any ideas on what happened to the rights? Could we see a re-release on GOG or even an open sourcing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xl5it?context=5)|Kent still owns the rights to MindRover as far as I know. You can contact him if you Google Kent Quirk.
[Are you planning to make anything after NS2? :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xlsdi?context=5)|Oh yeah.  We're just getting started. Lots of ideas, some very different. It's my hope that as we grow we'll be able to do more projects and do them a bit faster too. It would be amazing to release a game every 6 months or year.
[Why is your Spark engine so sexy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xka8v?context=5)|That's a question for Max: http://www.unknownworlds.com/about.
[How the hell do you kill fades?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xknfu?context=5)|You need to gang up with your buddies and get shotguns! The balance isn't perfect yet though and a good Fade player can really rip you up.
[Still, fucking awesome game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xlbz7?context=5)|Just think about all the work you DIDN'T have to do to play this game...
[Of course =(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qgp6n/charlie_cleveland_cofounder_of_indie_game_company/c3xj1bx?context=5)|I don't see us adding a third race any time soon. What I really love about the game is the Marines vs. Aliens feel. We all know what that's like from various sci-fi books and movies, and as soon as you add a third race it totally changes that.

For as long as i know i haven't been able to study or work properly during the day. 

During daytime i will sit behind my desk and try to get on with my dissertation but ideas won't come, i don't seem to understand the information i'm reading and i loose track of my progress. I get frustrated and basically browse the web or find excuses not to work.

However as soon as the clock strikes 8PM i turn into a focused machine that knows how to proceed and actually gets something done.

This shouldn't be a problem but i would prefer a normal rhythm and during internships i experienced the same problem. I don't think this will make me a good employee.

I tried using Ritalin, green tea, coffee but all this just seems to block my mind even more.

I always study in my room, which is a quiet clean place.

Any tips?"

For a number of years I was very close friends to a guy and a girl who are a couple together and had a son (The female is sick it's not terminal but it is pretty serious and they have no idea what is going on). I regarded them as my family and did everything in my power to help then whenever they had problems. On one occassion she called me up crying cause they had a huge fight in which I was going to get sucked up in at 04:00 AM and I instantly got in my car and drove over) however there was about a 150km distance between us. So I visisted them alot and then stayed for a few days during that period. Keep in mind at that moment I had no job no school and no source of obligations.

That lasted for about 6 months during the time my depression got less and started doing some freelance work for an old internship for some small payment just to keep busy since the owners of that company were worried about me.

About a month later (this was about July) I met my current girlfriend and felt my life was going in an upward stream. All was well untill I landed in October with an chance to get a contract. It was a freelance job for 3 months (till January) so I made clear to everyone that this was very important for me and that I wanted this job so that was my number one priority at the moment.

During the course of those 3 months we spoke less and less resulting in her questioning our friendship. I tried to make clear that with this contract and my new girlfriend (We just got serious during that period) that I didn't have alot of sparetime however that I still cared about them deeply and that I would surely visit them later when things had calmed down. So we had like 4-5 of these conversations during the course of November. Then we had another one in which I lost my temper a little bit and said that I felt she was claiming me. At that moment she got mad at me and said she never wanted to see me again and logged off and distanced herself from me. I didn't like her reaction and was very sad and upset about it. However in my view it was her choice and I had to respect it if I liked it or not. So about a month went by and I had kept her in my phone on MSN and on FB so she could contact me if she wanted to. But she didn't.

So after 4-5 weeks I give up and remove her from MSN and FB assuming our friendship was over. So about 2-3 weeks later her boyfriend hits me up asking me if I removed her from MSN and FB so I reply in all honesty that I did she he questions me why I did it. I told him it was because she said she never wanted to speak to me or see me again. He then replies why I didn't try to contact her. At this moment I was baffled cause I could not believe he just said that or that that was my responsibility because she was that one that distanced herself from me and all I cared about was just get an apology from her for saying she never wanted to see me again. We argued for a few hours untill we realised we couldn't solve this so he removed me and we lost all contact.

During February my girlfriend and I moved in together. We hadn't planned on it but it was the right move cause we would both be alot closer to our jobs since my contract got extended. I celebrated my birthday went on a snowboarding holiday without ever hearing from them.
One saturday afternoon my phone starts ringing and it is her calling me. So I pick up and she instantly starts crying that her father got diagnosed with terminal cancer. I have no idea how to react to it so I just talk back that I am sorry for her but that I can't do anything for her and I make sure I don't react to attached so after a few minutes she hangs up and again I hear nothing on them. Then last weekend I get another message from her boyfriend on FB that still although what happened they still see me as a close friend and it hurts them that I haven't called them after her call yet still during all this they never even asked how I was doing so I just ignored it.

I am sorry for the bad grammar and since this is quite lengthy I wasn't able to include all details. I appreciate any response :).

**TL;DR Broke apart with closest friends because they seem more interrested in me being there for them then they are in me as a person.**"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How do you respond to people that think GMOs are like radioactive Nazis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlpos?context=5)|That unlike radioactive Nazis, there is no solid reproducible harm of GMO technology.  Scientists almost universally agree.  Plus, if any of us public scientists found harm in GMOs, we'd report it, and be set for life with grants, Nobel prizes and awesome papers that changed farming!
[Can you tell us about the light side of GMO science?  I feel that companies like Monsanto really give the field a bad name.  What are some things that will be of *benefit* to our species on the horizon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlp24?context=5)|This is a tricky question. First the science.  From model plants we have learned about the pathways that help provide tolerance to extreme weather, drought, etc.  We know how plants make metabolites and resist disease.  All of these could be parts of the new generation of transgenic plants.  More flavor, nutrition, etc too.  However, it is almost impossible to commercialize these materials.  The approval process selects for big companies, and that's why the only transgenic crops are big ag crops!   In the long run, safe transgenic technology will be the norm.  Thanks.
[Most of the questions so far seem to be based on the health vs risk factors of eating GM plants. I'm aware that transgenic plants can be used for other highly useful tasks such as landline/radiation detection.  Are you working on anything related to non-nutritional issues? If so, what? And are there any major areas that you think GM plants may be incredibly valuable?  Cheers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4j5?context=5)|Funny you should ask.  We are partnering with a Spanish lab to make a plant that gives a strong visible response at the first onset of pathogen attack.  It is not fertile with other fruits, so it can't cross out to non GMOs.  It will give a visible warning to the farmer that a pathogen is present, allowing precise application of controls. Farmers will use less pesticide/fungicide, less in the environment, huge savings, less fuel, more precise applications, less for consumers to worry about.  It is a fresh project just at the start, but could have wonderful environmental impacts. 
[I guess, a question would be how do you feel about ownership of genes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlwvv?context=5)|Ownership of genes?  In my lab we have a few novel genes we've discovered that can increase fruit size and yield.  If I can patent them, hire more people, train more students, and generate improved products for the industries I care about, I think that's a good thing.  Right now, all on the remote-remote drawing board.  Even if I had a great solution there is no way I could afford to commercialize it.  That's a game only for the Monsantos/Bayers/Dows because of the high barriers set by regualtors.
[Do you believe, based on studies, that GMOs will harm humans in the long run?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlokd?context=5)|Based on the current literature there is no reproducible, independent evidence of harm.  It all comes from the same labs and is not in the best of journals.  I can't say what will happen in the long run- no real scientist can.  However, based on our understanding of the science there is no plausible means that the technology can be harmful any more than traditional breeding.  Thanks.
[Is saving seed illegal and why?  Do you find a living organism that is produced to feed humans, engineered to kill itself frightening and maybe a tad risky?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm8y5?context=5)|This has been the case for 100 years with the introduction of hybrids to protect a company's hard earned intellectual property.  Seeds from hybrids do not produce true-to-type offspring, ensuring re-purchase.  Not new!  Farmers that grow GMO crops agree to not save the seeds- they are the intellectual property of the company.  It is not just GMOs.  Farmers are not allowed to propagate NON-gmo ornamentals, fruits and vegetables protected by plant patents.  These are superior lines that took a long time to create, so their propagation for production is forbidden except for the patent holder.  This provides a means for a scientist or company to continue crop improment efforts.
[1) How are most transgenes inserted?  Viral infection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Most transgenes are inserted using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a natural, soil bacterium that performs genetic exchange as part of its life cycle. Scientists exploit its innate properties to introduce genes. 
[2) Can you predict what the biggest obstacle that needs to be overcome is before next-gen GMO crops become the norm?  Is it identifying the correct genes/specific alleles necessary to confer drought resistance or whatever, or is it going to be incorporating these genes into the target genome without making unwanted alterations to the resulting plant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|The biggest obstacle will be correcting perception.  Transgenics have been tarnished by fear and disinformation.   I think that cis-genics, or using a plant's own genes to do the work will be the intermediate step, but it is scientifically unnecessary.
[3)In your estimation, how long until a farmer can custom-order a variant of most crops that is optimized for the climate he or she works in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Coming soon.  I think that GM technolgies will greatly expand ranges and will be used to accelerate traditional breeding in concert with molecular markers.  
[4)If you aren't part of big ag, you may not know this one.  How much of Monsanto's business model relies on the sale of Round-Up?   In other words, would it be economically viable for them to sell seeds for climate resistance, which do not require further purchases, or would this model require seed prices to be too high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlxnt?context=5)|Big Ag built itself on proprietary hybrids that did not need downstream products.  While roundup-ready has a product to use it, Bt corn, cotton etc do not.  These are superior products that farmers choose, and will continue to do so based on performance.
[I find it difficult to accept that GMO and selective breeding equate to the same thing. Can you help me understand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm3ke?context=5)|They are not the same thing.  Selective breeding moves tens of thousands of genes at one time, GMO 1-3.  Much more precise with predictable, traceable outcomes.  Selective breeding takes much longer due to linkage drag and the need to grow generations to fertility... e.g. transgenic apples resistant to scab made in a few years where selective breeding took over fifty.  They absolutely are not the same-- you are right on.
[What kind of research do you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlqle?context=5)|I work in genomics, mostly in linking genes to the traits they control.  We use GMO technology only as a tool to learn about biology.  All in the lab.  We use this information to guide traditional breeding efforts in strawberries and small, high value fruits.  Unfortunately, even if we have a proven technology that could help farmers, we can't commercialize it.  Too expensive, too much resistance. For now... 
[How hard would it be to make tomatoes produce cannabinoids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xma85?context=5)|I get emails on this one a few times a year.  I have to be careful and only say that it would be possible to make a BLT that would make you want another one.
[How would you describe your career field to a high school student? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm01z?context=5)|Also- find an internship in a real lab.  Learn how it works.  Find a good role model that can guide your early career decisions.  I train lots of high school students and undergrads- my favorite part of the job!
[Do the chemicals that break down vegetables in my stomach know the difference between GM tomatoes and heritage tomatoes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xly5j?context=5)|Your stomach cannot tell the difference.  The GM/ non-gm are functionally equivalent in that there is no plausible way that the transgenes can affect guy physiology in humans.  That's well established. 
[Do you think companies should be required to label things as GMO?  What are your thoughts on patenting organisms, genes, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4ay?context=5)|More information is always good, so in theory I'm all for labeling.  However, do we also then have to label intra-specific crosses that move tens of thousands of genes randomly from conventional breeding?  That would be intellectually consistent.  The problem is that the anti-scientists in the anti-GMO movement have scared people to death, and labeling will just provide a target to instill these fears.  I'm a scientist, environmentalist, and have concern for workers and consumers.  I don't fear GMO technology, maybe because I'm so connected to it and understand it.  That's why I'm here.  
[Did you hear Amit got tenured up at Washington State?  Also, do you think that securing funding for your lab effects the quality and direction of your research positively or negatively? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xly67?context=5)|Yikes, an inside question!  Good for Amit- he called me right away.  I'm really happy.   Funding affects the direction of research only in that we need to test hypotheses relevant to the funding agency's wishes.  HOWEVER, funding NEVER influences experimental outcomes.  The results are, what the results are.   The former is a problem.  I find myself moving into areas I'm not comfortable with and spending a lot of time learning new areas just to be able to hire students and postdocs.  However, I'm learning a lot.  Thanks for the questions.
[I find it interesting that you make the specification that funding doesn't influence experimental outcomes, but mention nothing about how funding *can absolutely* influence what is done with that data, whether promoting it or burying it, as well as how the data is presented, which is frequently skewed to be beneficial for the group paying for the research. Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xncw2?context=5)|Skewed to be beneficial to the group paying for it?  What they are paying for is the Truth.  There is no merit in ""skewing"" data.  Facts always come out and one must never sacrifice a reputation.  Bogus data does no good for a company.  Facts rise to the top sooner or later- they need it sooner especially in litigious times.
[Why do you say that anti-GMO sentiment is anti-science? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xnkda?context=5)|It is anti-science in that the concerns are not substantiated by the peer-reviewed literature.  With your credentials you should be able to see that. Plus, all of your scenarios about protein disruption etc. could just as well apply to naturally occurring transposons and other genetic rearrangements. What about straight-up crosses?  Induced polyploidy?  Spontaneous polyploidy?  All much more intrusive than adding a gene or two (and most labs don't use gene guns these days). Moreover, the allergen argument is not substantiated by the science and chemical concerns are no different than conventional farming.  Intellectual property is not GMO specific either- plants have been patented for well over a century. So the arguments specifically levied against GMO technology are inconsistent with the state of the literature and are intellectually inconsistent with what is done by other breeding efforts.  That is anti-scientific, denial of sound processes. And there is FDA mandated testing. I know people that have been through the long and expensive process.  I'm happy to discuss this further, but being anti-GMO is like being anti-vaccination or anti-climate change.  It is a sentiment inconsistent with the science.
[Do you think that GMOs will significantly alter evolution on a short-term scale, like in the case of Monsanto's Round-Up resistant ""superweeds""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xlqn3?context=5)|We have been farming crops (plants) that never were here, don't belong here, and require huge amounts of chemicals/labor/fuel to be here.  It is all unnatural.  The 14 species of Roundup resistant superweeds are just like the hundreds of other superweeds created by more harmful, hazardous chemicals in previous decades. Roundup is safer for workers, the environment and consumer.  Yes, we will need another solution as roundup looses effectiveness, but that's the battle to grow food for our growing planet.  Thanks for a good question.
[Proof that you are ""a public, academic scientist with no ties to Big Ag"", esp the latter part?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm22q?context=5)|Google my username. I'm real!  Plus all of my funding comes through the university, regardless of source, so that's all public record. You can investigate.  
[I have heard that GMO is often used to increase tolerance to pesticides (instead of increasing tolerance to the pests, in order to sell more pesticide), is that true, and any comments? Could it be that it is much easier to provide pesticide tolerance than pest tolerance? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm4zi?context=5)|I think you are confusing herbicide with pesticide.  Some GM plants are made to be herbicide resistant.  That uses more of some herbicides, less of other more toxic ones.   Pesticide resistance? It is true, but it is true of any mechanism to control pests.  What GM /transgenic technology provides is a much more durable mechanism (Bt protein is good example).  It is hard to develop resistance because of its mechanism.  
[Is Monsanto evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm8bb?context=5)|I'm a scientist.  I don't like any company dominating market share so much and would love to see new products and new competition. However, lawmakers are owned by Big Ag and activists want regulations and restrictions high.  This is a perfect storm that will ensure Big Ag's long-term survival!
[What do you think of Monsanto and of the constant negative attention it attracts, particularly on Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm7nj?context=5)|I have mixed feelings because I'm a scientist that supports GMO technology, not what companies necessarily do with it.  As stated earlier, those that oppose Monsanto et al should seek to loosen restrictions on deployment and commercialization of GMO technology- let in new competition!  Seems strange, but that's the best way to oppose them.
[If there is ""no reproducible, independent evidence of harm"", why do you think that a lot of Europe has banned gmos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm9ki?context=5)|Perception and protectionism for resident farmers.  There is no evidence of harm-- only one lab seems to find problems and they are never verified outside of that lab.  If there was hard evidence of harm it would be the biggest story in a long time. If I found it, I would get a Nobel Prize!  Just no evidence at the moment to support a position of danger.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. I feel a lot of people are concerned GM food being 'dangerous' or 'unnatural', and I am glad you are here to correct some of these pre-conceived notions.  Are there any crops that are more difficult to manipulate than others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm9ta?context=5)|You're welcome- important topic with lots of bad information out there.  Some plants, like tobacco, are really easy to work with. Petunia too.
[To expand on the question that was previously asked though... wouldn't you say that GMOs would only have short term gains as general evidence has shown that evolutionary adaptation in harmful organisms such as bacteria, and viruses would neutralize the benefits of genetically forced resistance over the long term? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xm1g5?context=5)|But this is not an argument restricted to GMO/ transgenic technology.  All gains are short term in any crop or cultivation system.  Problems find a way back in.  GM technology gives you fast response and ability to mount a counter-response faster than traditional breeding or alteration of cultivation techniques.  Plus, it is much easier to pyramid transgenic traits without associated linkage drag (ask me if you don't know that one).  Thanks.
[1. Are any seeds sold in stores GMOs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xre9c?context=5)|None for sale.  Highly regulated.  I can't even send transgenic research seeds without paperwork. 
[2. why do you go straight for a lab solution rather than rely on tricks that have been used for hundreds of years to increase yield and repel pests? I use companion planting, and certain plants that attract parasitic and predatory insects, lizards, and pollinators, as well as make my own compost, and provide bee hotels. I never have problems, and they're cheap and easy. Why rely on something expensive? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xre9c?context=5)|Your second solution is nice, but can't be adapted for a production scale without increasing food costs through the roof.  It is hard to manage one crop, let alone intercroppings, at least on an industrial scale.  Plus, when the technology is safe, why bother?
[How would [you] feel if all/some/future GMO research, development and eventual products were 'NON-PROFIT' and publicly owned? Sort of like NASA, so that all of the benefits of all things GMO would remain to benefit the peoples that supported this science and research and not individual corporations and stockholders?   [Edits]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xn04r?context=5)|Would be nice, but you know as well as I do that NASA is out of business and that privatization of space is the sustainable model.  If anything, keep it public and competitive, profitable, but let more people in by relaxing regulations.  That's how you take it away form Big Ag.
[Didn't some foundation use those techniques a couple of years ago to develop a flood resistant rice strain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xr1vi?context=5)|And the flooding resistance rice works and is quite brilliant.
[Do college classes/majors actually matter when finding a job with gmo companies? The major probably helps getting in, but does the school work help with understanding what you're doing? Or do you get almost all training on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xuazm?context=5)|Yes, good jobs at BS/MS, some at PhD too.  If you can have molecular biology skills coupled to traditional plant breeding you will find many opportunities.  Not necessarily GMO, but a good job.  The GM part is just a tool in the process.
[How is the political and business climate affects our food supply in regards to GMO's? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xtvwr?context=5)|I'm really here to talk about science and not the business. However, patents are not MON driven.  They have been commonplace for well over 100 years.
[How applicable is GMO technology to growing Agave Cacti on the nutrient barren Lunar regolith?  We need our tequila in space.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xnddk?context=5)|The agave are no problem and take well to the regolith- it is the limes that are the problem. 
[Can you get me some Ruby Roman grapevines from japan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qhb2d/ama_im_a_scientist_in_gmo_transgenic_plant/c3xse2b?context=5)|Sorry- it is tough to move things across borders.  Even a plant coming in for DNA alone has to go through the USDA for inspection, then has to be destroyed upon receipt.  Fear of pests and pathogens-- and a good fear to have.

qi2ct,2,2012-03-04,"Applying for a programming internship, which email should I use?",MangoTux,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qi2ct/applying_for_a_programming_internship_which_email/,"I have two email addresses, Mango.Tux@gmail .com, and carsnoble@yahoo .com.

(That's right, I just gave out both my email addresses to 23.000 people I don't know.)

I'm going to apply for a programming internship. The Mango.Tux one is the one I regularly use for most websites, whereas the carsnoble I've been trying to shy away from, as it's just overloaded with too much spam.

To me, the carsnoble seems more formal, as it's most of my first name and my last name, but the Mango.Tux is the one I check more often, and the Tux is a reference to Linux, which I think \*might* be worth a bit more credit for a programming job.

I understand this is something very small, but I feel this internship will be a great experience for me, and I don't want to mess up on any part of the application process."

qkvvp,4,2012-03-06,Contingent job offers and cancelling a security clearance,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qkvvp/contingent_job_offers_and_cancelling_a_security/,"Back in November, I signed a contingent offer upon customer approval and obtaining a security clearance (TS/SCI Full Scope) to accept a software engineer position with GD. I am now having doubts because they aren't offering me any internship positions over the summer and would like to go with another company, SAIC. If I accept SAIC's offer for a summer internship, they want me to rescind my GD offer so I can work for the summer internship and FT after I graduate a year from now. My question is, what legal repercussions or negative things can sprout from cancelling or rescinding a contingent job offer?

qjukd,13,2012-03-06,I am a QA engineer and I hate my job :( Help,mad_max_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qjukd/i_am_a_qa_engineer_and_i_hate_my_job_help/,"Dear Reddit,

Just to give some history, I have a Bachelors in CS which I followed up immediately with a Masters in Computer Engineering. School was a great learning experience and some of my favorite classes were Concurrent Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems and Computer Networks. 

When I graduated, I started looking for a job with some of the biggest software companies around. However,  the times were rotten and the economy was FUBAR. After months of unemployment and failing to get a job offer from the dozens of interviews that I attended, I was finally offered a role with one of the biggest software companies out there. The catch was that it was a QA and not a dev job but I was desperate for anything and I had student loans to pay off. In retrospect, that might have been the worst decision I've made in my life. 

It was exciting initially - I had my first real job and the pay (to me) seemed fantastic. Flexible hours, stock options and a great boss, I had it all. However, then the excitement wore off and I started hating my job. The only times that I felt good about my work was when I was developing test automation but that was a really small part of my job. For the most part, I was running tests manually and filing bugs. I also realized that QA people are looked down upon by most developers in the industry. I started feeling that I wasn't utilizing anything that I learned in school and that I had wasted all those years of education. I also found out that I was woefully underpaid in comparison to the industry average. So I started looking for a new job.

So after one and a half years of working for my first employer, I started working for a second employer with a significant pay increase ALSO in a QA role. I told myself that the increased pay would make me like QA and make up for the downsides. Boy, was I wrong! I've been with this company for three years and I hate this job as much as the last. I've realized that the only way I'm going to be happy is if I find a full-time development role. I'm interested in system programming, writing device drivers and operating system kernels. However, with the kind of experience that I have on my resume, the only kind of job offers that I get are QA related.

What advice does reddit have for me? Here is what I've thought of:

1) Writing open source code: I've actually been trying to contribute for a long time but its so freaking hard to get started. How do I find a project I like? How do I contribute to that project?
2) Working on side projects outside of work: Again, with my relative lack of experience and because of my full time job, its hard for me to just write a project on my own
3) Apply for programming internships. Is this even an option given that I'm not a fresh college graduate any more?

TL;DR I am a QA engineer who hates this line of work after working two years in this industry. I'm desperately looking to move on to full time development roles but I'm getting typecasted into QA positions because of my prior work experience.

Please forgive any grammatical and spelling errors; English isn't my first language :) I'd sincerely appreciate any advice that Reddit has to give."
qjq1y,2,2012-03-05,Contrite slacker would like some advice,valkyrio,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qjq1y/contrite_slacker_would_like_some_advice/,"So, I graduated technically in December, though my last class ended in August. Up until now I've been avoiding job searching due to some problems with my family and my life in general. I'm now ready to start making up for my lost time. However, I have a couple of issues that I'd love some advice on.


My resume is currently fairly bare. I have no accomplishments or internships that I did during my years at college, though I had an online store manager job fro 2006~2010. I know how bad this looks, and I'm currently in the process of learning HTML/PHP as well as introducing myself to CMS stuff to pad out my resume. On top of that though, I need to practice my programming. **What kind of stuff, that is around my level, can I do that will look decent as part of a portfolio?** The only thing I've done lately is perl and AHK scripts, which I doubt would look great anywhere.

Second: Because I'm looking to learn more programming/web development on my own time, I've decided to pick up IT jobs instead of programming-related jobs so I can actually have money to start paying back my loans - and eventually be more attractive for programming-related jobs. So question is: **Is it going to look badly if I have an IT job right out of college instead of a programming job?**"

Now, my recovery has been a slow process—the broken bones healed, but there are still episodes of confusion I have, that are associated with the brain injury. And the migraines don’t get me started on them. 

When I began thinking about the accident, and the trauma that had induced it, I began to believe I had presented myself with a valid, tangible way of explaining the things that had been happening to me. I even went as far as, on that Monday morning, sitting down at my desk with a pad and paper over lunch break and making a list of all of the strange experiences I’d had in the past three years since the accident.  What I came up with centered mainly around the first year after the accident. Several things I’d been experiencing bore a striking resemblance to what I was now experiencing.

It wasn’t as if I didn’t know about the side effects of brain trauma, and I don’t find myself particularly given to fancy, however… the things I saw that first year, mostly in dreams, disturbed me. My sleep patterns were highly irregular for months after the accident—sometimes I would not be able to sleep for days on end; I just had no desire to. I’d estimate that it was about six months after the accident that my sleep had evened out, and, coincidentally, when my dreams had gotten a bit more concerning. With more sleep came more dreams, and with more dreams came some interesting, albeit frightening, occurrences. At this time, Jen and I were experiencing a rough patch; she had been offered an internship upstate, and was planning her move, while I was grounded where we’d been living for two years together. 

We never imagine the ease with which some people can sever others from their lives; but they can and they do. Long story relatively short, Jen took the internship. In all honesty, the choppiness of my sleep schedule and my irritability following the injury probably had had a great deal to do with all of it, as well. She and I had tried the long-distance thing for a while, but the time and the money eluded us, and soon the contact had trickled to a halt. I’ve been a lone wolf, so to speak, since then.

Getting back to business… due to the lack of sleep, I believe, anyhow, there were these… hallucinations. They started small, things in my peripheral vision, dark spots, shadows on the wall, the cliché stuff of any ghost story. They seemed sleep-related to begin with, they correlated to the amount of sleep—if any—I was getting, and it seemed that the closer I got to a regular sleep schedule, the less frequent they’d become.  First, though, I should explain the dreams.

I’d see a person, in my dreams. It was always a tall, large figure, and he or she was always faceless. I got the impression that it was a masculine presence, however. Explaining “how” I knew that never makes sense, even to me, so I will not even attempt it here. Essentially, this figure would be in nearly all of my dreams, and he looked and felt like the presence of those faceless people I’d imagined after being hit. It wouldn’t matter what the dream was, necessarily, either—it could be a silly thing like a family reunion or bungee jumping—he’d still usually make an appearance. He never interacted with me, just merely stood and watched. It got to the point, for a while, that when he didn’t show up in my dreams, I was unnerved. Thankfully, those dreams lessened quite a bit, to the point that, presently, I rarely ever dream of him.

Like I mentioned before, it was about this time that the hallucinations began, full swing. They began in dreams—much like what I’d experienced with Eric. I’d see an image in my dream, and it would carry over into waking life. Sometimes I’d see it right as I woke, but other times it would appear at random during the day. One of the most memorable of these hallucinations occurred while I was at work. I had just begun the job I have now, in the university’s counseling office. It began with me, at work, just sitting at my desk, between appointments. I usually had fifteen or twenty minutes between them to check over the next kid’s paperwork or organize things. Well, I was sitting there, just having awoken from dozing off at my desk for a few minutes, and I felt as if I was being watched. I don’t have to elaborate on that feeling—we all have been there. Now, my office is small; it’s only about ten feet by eight, and there’s not much hiding room. It also has no window. I was feeling a presence, and paranoia set in—feeling as if you are being watched in a space as small as that is one of the most unnerving feelings in the world, I believe. 

Feeling like a goofy, superstitious idiot, I checked everywhere in the small office. I looked under my desk, behind my small filing cabinet. Of course, there was nothing there. Had I expected there to be? I took a seat back in my armchair, waiting for the next patient and checking the clock on the wall every thirty seconds or so. I contemplated opening my door and going into the waiting room, but I had just begun working there, and did not want to appear unprofessional and nervous. I decided to stick it out. 

I heard a noise. It was a scuffle, sounded like a footstep against the carpet in my office. Needless to say, I was frozen, eyes glued to my office door. I began reciting to myself, as I’d done since the accident, “This is not reality. You are not hearing or seeing anything; your mind is playing tricks on you. Remember your mind is playing tricks on you.” Generally, this mantra, paired with a calm demeanor, would eventually allow the feeling of dread to pass. This time, though, I felt something touch me. It was like a hand on my shoulder for a split second, and then it was gone. Just as I mustered the courage to reach up to feel for something behind me, my office door opened, nearly causing me to soil myself. The look on my face must’ve been priceless. The receptionist was letting me know my client was ready to see me. I told her to show him in, but that I wasn’t feeling well and might need the rest of the day off. 

Now, since this incident, there hadn’t been anything major. Just a few odd dreams and some fragmented paranoia once in a while. Sitting in my office chair the Monday after seeing Eric’s imagined image in my dreams, it seemed that these incidences had a lot in common. Really, at this point, I was worried for my neurological health; the doctor had warned me that there could be side-effects like the dreams, or like the hallucinations. He also told me to keep track of them, and report them to him every six months we had an appointment, just to make sure nothing more serious was going on in there. Well, it had been so long since one of the more full-fledged hallucinations, that I was beginning to worry it might be a sign of something much more serious than a bout of sleep paralysis. 

As I sat making that list of episodes, I resigned to calling my neurologist and seeing how soon I could get in for an appointment. I spoke on the phone with his nurse, and she assured me that what I was experiencing seemed to be, indeed, related to the injury, and to try not to worry. I was able to schedule one for the next week, early, which gave me much-needed peace-of-mind. 

*I'll stop here, for now. It's been a long day, and I have some work to finish with. I will update you very soon, though, if you're interested. I am thoroughly surprised at the response, you guys are great; there is peace-of-mind in sharing this with ya'll.* "
qlztw,4,2012-03-07,One small company wants to hire me but I have an interview scheduled for a larger one. What do I do?,Osupda,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qlztw/one_small_company_wants_to_hire_me_but_i_have_an/,"This is my first question on Reddit, and I really need some advice. I graduated last year with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and I've been living at home ever since, working a part-time job in town. During the summer I applied to several full-time jobs, one of which for a big, very well-known company (can't say who it is). After months of no luck I decided to take up an internship in September and put job searching on hold so I gain some applicable experience and improve my chances of getting hired.

In early January, I was told by my parents that it would have to end soon because our car would be needed for my dad's work and I would have no transportation (there is public transportation, but it would mean getting up at 5AM for a 2-hour commute). Until the internship ended I applied to several other jobs, one of which is a start-up company located right in town. This particular one was on Craigslist and shortly after I applied, the posting was removed and I did not hear back for several weeks.

In early February, the big company from the summer responded back by saying they wanted to schedule a phone screening with me (as well as an undefined number of others). I did great on the initial screening and on the second one as well. In late February they scheduled me for an in-person interview, which is two weeks from today, and I am very excited for it.

This is where it gets complicated. A few days ago, the small company from the Craigslist posting finally responded back and asked if I was still available and interested for a part-time position, which would eventually grow. I was advised to reply ""yes"" and not mention the upcoming interview, because it's likely to be a deal breaker even though an interview does not necessarily mean I'm unavailable. Yesterday I had one 10-minute interview with the small company, and they want me to come in a few days from now and start initial training.

I don't know what to do now. I'm afraid that telling them about the upcoming interview might ruin everything: if the upcoming interview does not yield the full-time position, then I could also lose the opportunity for a position I would have received otherwise.

I really need some advice. How should I handle this mess?"

I would be the definition of internet nerd if I even had any sort of interactions online with people. I have no friends, both real life and internet/online gaming. 

I had a friend who ive known since we were kids, through who i met a few other friends of his to hang out with but they never considered me their friend. Unless the middle friend was there, they didn't care to hang out with me and slowly all of them just sorta stopped talking to me. 

I feel sad for my parents, who worked so hard to help get me through school, who are always talking with parents boasting about how great their kid is doing or something and how embarrassed they must be time and time again to repeat the same thing on how i'm still jobless doing nothing.

I really wish i even had a hobby or something i enjoyed doing, but i dont. I'm terrible at video games, seem to have a horrible memory when it comes to specifics, not athletic(im a fat fuck), dont play any instruments(tried learning guitar and failed horribly), nothing to help guide me on where to go. I have no ambition or goals at all. 
What do i want to be? I have no idea. What do i want to do? No clue. What do i enjoy doing? Nothing.

I've thought about suicide countless times, planned it all out and just could never go through with it because of my parents. Just the thought of doing something even worse as a final spit in the face of what they've done for me...

I expressed that I have a very flexible skill set, but I get the idea that the employers looking for hardware guys are seeking computer engineers, and the employers looking for software guys are seeking software engineers. Computer systems is basically a mix of both, and due to my lack of experience in the industry, I don't know what I would *enjoy* more if I could only pick one.

I enjoy computer science, I do pretty good in the classes that do low level stuff like assembly, cache organization, etc. On the other hand I find my data structures classes challenging and I don't particularly hate it because I am learning so much.

I will also add that I do freelance/word-of-mouth computer repair IT stuff, it's easy money and along with tech retail experience I have, I have no problem communicating with clients or expressing my ideas. I find this as a trait most CS majors do not have.

I asked someone who works there what language do they want their employees to be proficient in, and I was told that most people they want are efficient with Java (yikes). They told me in 5 months, send my resume over to them, and they will see what they can do as far as getting me a paid internship with the software development team.


Now...I by NO means expect to be a Java master within 5 months. I just want to develop a solid/basic understanding of Java, enough so that I'd be acceptable as an intern to this amazing company.

Is that realistic? Should I just jump straight into a Java course? Is there another language that would help me develop fundamentals that are really similar to Java writing?

Well, after my first mid term ever in college I felt okay. It was a very hard test but I had to remind myself that it was curved so it didn't matter. I texted my friend in my class and asked what she thought of it. She said it was super easy and that she finished early and left. I was crushed. (I'm not sure why but I was) I cried all day until my friends came over to go to a concert we had tickets to. This is when I ran into the law. I went there just trying to have a good time. I was dancing and was pretty close to the front when this chick behind me taps me on the shoulder and says something about her friend right behind me not being able to see. I don't know what she expected me to do, so I say to her ""It's a concert bro"", and turn back around. She then turns to her friend and starts laughing at me because I said ""bro"". I was keeping cool but then she started pushing me. Mind you that she is the only one around me pushing me and she's not directly behind, right, left or in front of me. Finally after a few pushes I turn around a bop her in the face. I'm not a violent person, everyone that knows me would know that that was completely out of character for me. That evening I was super emotional from the midterm and I took it out the wrong way. She says ""YOU PUNCHED ME!!!"" I'm all ""You wouldn't leave me alone"". I guess I wasn't thinking, but I stayed in the same place. She got the security and I was escorted out. The security were pretty nice to me. The first guy even thought I would be able to go back to the concert. Well I'm sitting there and a small fire truck comes. She had firefighters come to examine her face and put an ice pack on it. Which there was 0 damage done. No bruises, no swelling, no cuts. The firefighters put a pack of ice on it and leave. Then the police come. They were pretty much huge ass holes to me. I thought it was pretty funny because they were all ""well it's obvious you aren't telling the truth, and we'll see that when she tells her story and see that they are different"". We had the same story, but that's besides the point. The whole time I was apologetic. Even right after she left I was thinking about going back and finding her and saying sorry. The whole time I was beyond cooperative and beyond apologetic. I mean the police asked for my name and address without looking at my ID and I gave all the correct information. Any ways, they didn't take me in because this girl ""had mercy on me"" as the police put it. They told me that I would hear from them within 90 days. Also, after the police said I could go, me and my friends were walking and we saw her (she didn't go back to the concert even though she could) and she had thrown the ice pack away. 90 days passed and I didn't hear anything from them so I was pretty happy because I thought they weren't pressing charges. Well two weeks ago I finally got the letter summoning me to court. I was completely crushed. I had just applied for this program at my college where I would be an intern at Boeing. Even worse the court date was right before my math final for this quarter.

So here I am, it's the night before my court date. I just REALLY needed to get this off my chest. Basically I feel like this could just totally fuck up all the hard work I went through to get where I am. I have nothing besides school. I can't just live with my parents my whole life. I have a final on Saturday and I just can't understand Taylor series worth shit. But who cares because I might be going to jail anyways. If I am sentenced to go to jail I will be killing myself. I've counted all my mom's sleeping pills. 

This is a throw away. But thank you reddit. You've been great. 

tl;dr I have court tomorrow for assault charges, if it ends up fucking my life then I will personally fuck it. "

I work in IT-Research Support, which is the branch of IT responsible for supporting research professors. As this university is all about research, you'd expect us to be pretty important...which is entirely not the case. Instead, we're 3 full time employees and 5 students running a cluster, building one-off research tech, setting up sensors to gather data, and many, many other things. And we're all significantly underpaid, even for the middle-of-nowhere town that we live in. 

I've worked at this job for over 2 years. I stay around mostly because I like the work (I administer all the linux computer labs, among other things). 

Recently, my boss has decided to try to get us some publicity so that people realize that what we do is a lot of hard work, and therefore land us some more money for the team. The way he's decided to do this is by putting all of the student workers on one project that is going to be pretty impressive (I'd say what it is but I'm under NDA). The project involves a lot of cutting-edge tech and is about the same type of work undergraduate research students do here. Unfortunately, this project has a ridiculously tight deadline, and my boss knows the only way we'll get close to making it is if we all work more hours than we're getting paid for. (We can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week as full-time students.) I, in particular, have much more experience with the tech on this project than any of my co-workers, and I can objectively say the project would fail if I left, unless my boss was able to find someone to replace me within a week. Most of the people here who could replace me are working on other projects or jobs that pay more than what this one does. I know, because I've tried to recruit them for this project...

On top of this, he's lately made a couple points when he asks why things aren't getting done or why we haven't been at work at times (we get to choose our own hours). We'll be like, ""But I have homework/other things to do"" and he's said, literally, ""That's not my problem.""

On top of all that, he's paying me $8.75 an hour. The USGS recently posted part-time student job openings for CS majors at $15 an hour. I've got an internship at Amazon this summer, so I'm pretty confident I can land a position at the USGS if I wanted to. The *only* thing that keeps me from doing that is that I like my work. That, and one of the students is using this project as a final project for his senior capstone class, so if the project fails he can't graduate. 

tl;dr: My boss is kind of a dick, and he doesn't pay me anywhere near what I'm worth. 

How do I go about getting some respect and a raise from him?"

I'm fairly comfortable with being grilled over my earlier projects, but I tend to get stuck in the algorithmic/coding rounds. I've somehow managed to clear them in the past, but I know that this is a weakness, and I want to work on it in the next 2 months before I start sending in my applications.

My question is - what is the best way to prepare for such rounds which involve problems which are highly algorithmic in nature? Should I just start with solving problems on sites like codeeval.com, or problems from previous Code Jams? Should I review all the data structures and the most common algorithms, and code them up while doing that? Should I even care to pick up a book for that (just because books on such topics tend to be very exhaustive and it might not be possible to finish them cover to cover)? Or are there any concise books that I could refer? I'm just looking for the best way to tackle this. Any suggestions?

I've recently been offered a position at the small company that I'm interning at and while I'm glad I interned there and I think working there would be fine, the problem kind of is that working there would be just fine - not my dream or ideal job fresh out of school. They have offered me a position and would like my reply by then end of this next week. Meanwhile, the other companies I've been applying to haven't even begun their hiring process (no calls to me - no calls to anybody I have talked to in my major/courses).  
  
  
The offer I have at this point is good and it's well, an offer as opposed to not even an interview. My issue is what I'm to do next. As far as I know now, there are three options:  
* Take the job, stop looking for other jobs. The economy is not amazing. If I was a stellar candidate other companies would have already  been in contact with me. It is unethical to sign an acceptance letter and continue to look for another position.  
* Take the job, keep looking. I live in an at-will state and am free to choose what is best for me. I can rescind my acceptance courteously and although the company will not be happy, there's not much they can do about it.  
* Refuse the job. Hopefully with an engineering degree this wouldn't be my only job offer. I wouldn't become homeless if I were to be unemployed for awhile and I'm a professional and cannot make commitments I can't keep.  
  
  
Some background on me is that I don't have much experience, this internship is pretty much it. My GPA is between a 3.0 and 3.25. Decent but not impressive. There is another intern at this company that I'm sure the company would switch to in a heartbeat if I didn't seem interested.  
  
  
I wish I could just ask for more time but I feel like this would reflect really badly and they would just go with the other intern (there's only one position). I like to hold myself to a high standard ethically and would hate to back out of the contract but it's extremely hard to pass up a sure thing. 
  
  
Please help me out and state your opinion on the matter and what you feel you would do in this position. Thanks for reading and let me know if I left anything out (or feel free to gripe at me for giving too much info)!"

So I have been out of work for about 2 years. Before this I was a journeyman carpenter in Las Vegas. Work dried up pretty bad and now I'm living in southern Oregon with some friends who have been very gracious with me. I had a good amount of money saved up, but it's been gone a while.

A few problems I may be having are the lack of an in state driver's licence. I am working on getting a birth certificate so I can get a new drivers license. My references are probably terrible in that I doubt any of them are even reachable. The construction industry got tore up pretty bad and most of my contacts have been fired or layed-off and no longer have company phones. 

I don't have good relationship skills, so that has hurt me a lot. I moved around growing up between parents and just didn't really understand the benefits of keeping in contact with friends and coworkers that would put in a good word for me.

Before that I worked at a automotive supplier as a part of an internship in college for mechanical engineering. I only completed a year of that before I had to drop out for financial reasons.

I need to get on track and gain a reliable source of income. I fear I am on the verge of homelessness and more bad news in general.

I am pretty computer savvy, always work hard and have always had employers that were very happy with me. I just don't know what to do to get started again.

Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. I will try to answer any questions if anyone has any.

qt8rw,2,2012-03-12,"Aspiring Musician/Audio Engineer in CA, should I move to Ann Arbor, MI?",creatoranddistractor,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qt8rw/aspiring_musicianaudio_engineer_in_ca_should_i/,"Hi guys, I'm having a tough time coming to a big decision affecting my life, relationship and career, and thought maybe someone here might have some wise insight. I am really at a loss as to what to do. Do any of you live in or near Ann Arbor, MI? 

A little backstory, my girlfriend of 5+ years and I are both 26 and live in San Diego CA. She's applied to a number of graduate schools, including UC Berkeley, The New School (NY), American University (DC), University of Washington (Seattle), and University of Michigan. She's studying International Sustainable Agricultural Development, and all these schools have good programs related to this field.  I am a musician/music producer whose career is just starting to materialize...my band just released [this] (http://creatoranddistractor.bandcamp.com) and I cowrote/produced a song for  [My Drunk Kitchen's Hannah Hart](http://youtu.be/mafimBTMTmY). My bandmates are based in California, and we have a number of friends in the industry here, so we have sort of an established ""home base"" in California. 

Anyway, she's starting to hear back from schools. She's been accepted to University of Michigan and American University so far. She hasn't been rejected by any schools yet, but because she heard back from these two schools first, these schools have sort of subconsiously jumped to the top of her list in her mind. She's starting to get really excited about the program at Michigan, despite the fact that when she first applied, it was at the bottom of her list, due to the high cost and its location. Suddenly now, the program at Berkeley, which used to be her top choice, doesn't look good enough to her, and the Michigan program is ""exacty what she wants"".

We agreed that we would move together to wherever she decides to attend, and to her credit, she based her application list somewhat on the music scene in and near those schools, taking my career into account. Obviously the bay area has a great scene, and is close to LA, and NYC is an obvious choice. Even Seattle and DC have pretty great scenes. Ann Arbor Michigan scares me though. I've been into music my whole life, and before she applied to UM, I'd never heard of the place. I've been looking into the music scene there, and have come up pretty empty handed. We're going to visit in a couple weeks to attend a Student's Day, so I'll do some more research there, but I'm starting to worry that the trip out there might sell her on the college and place, while simultaneously convincing me that I don't have much of a future there.

Moving to Michigan would certainly and significantly change the direction of my career. I've just started to make some meaningful connections in the industry in CA, and even have an internship at a recording studio lined up here in San Diego. If we move to Michigan, I'm afraid I'll be forced to put my music on the shelf for a while, and take any job I can get out there, just to pass the time while she earns her degree. Of course I want her to go to the best school for her, and get the degree that she truly wants, but it's starting to dawn on me that doing so may be at the expense of my own career. We've tried doing the long distance thing a couple times in the past, and it's fine for the short term, but the idea of having a 2 year long-distance relationship sounds...hard at best.

So I'm asking you, the fine populous of reddit, for advice. Does anyone live in or near Ann Arbor?  Is anyone attending UM and in the International Sustainable Development MA program? If so, how is it? What's the music scene like out there? Should I abandon my CA band (who will definitely not make the move with me to MI), to follow my girlfriend while she gets her MA? Should I stand my ground and follow the music? 

**tl;dr Should I follow my music career, or my girlfriend to graduate school? Are these mutually exclusive?**"

I'm kind of at an interesting point in my life, and was hoping for some advice from someone with much more wisdom than myself.  It would be a shame if I didn't try to tap into the interesting minds of the reddit community :).  Hopefully this 4 minute read is worth your time, and is greatly appreciated…  

I'm in my young 20's, ""fresh"" out of college currently living in southern California.  I graduated with a 4.0 from two universities in two different countries with two separate degrees (consider it a super-study-abroad).  I've traveled all over the States due to internships and Europe due to schooling.  I have seen more sights than most people dream of.  I have no loans, financially very sound for my age, and jobs out to wazoo ranging in every industry from space, to biology, to even top secret jobs (I already have a clearance).  I've never had a problem finding a girl, although have yet to find one that I see spending the rest of my life with.  I have an absolutely amazing family, all of whom live in a nice retirement community and are begging me to come back home (rent free!).  I have four or so very close friends that are scattered across the states, and plenty of additional friends here and there.  From an third party standpoint, I'm beyond ""blessed"".  And yet, even with all of this, I still feel empty.

Moving to southern California was the first decision I made in my life so that I would be happy instead of an advancement in my career path.  However, things didn't turn out to well.  Being a workaholic from the east coast, I'm having a hard time adjusting to the California life style and all these party hard girls :).  After getting with a girl last night, her leaving because I wasn't interested in the whole shabang (I prefer wine and dine instead of get in get out), and not sleeping all night, I came to the realization that I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life or what I want.

On one hand, I've been debating joining the Red Cross and going to teach programming abroad, preferably in Africa or somewhere destitute.  I'm a little scared of making a career at a desk job at such an early age and have no interest in money.  I just want to do something for society and have a great time.  I enjoy research as well, and have considered doing an internship at the NIH to help advance modern medicine.  On the other hand, I want to find something meaningful.  A nice girl, steady job, home close to family, and friends that I know I will not lose in 6 months due to traveling so much.  For someone who always seemed to have an answer for his friends, I just don't understand why I'm not happy.  

Should I stay in California and give it a chance (been here 3 months), or go home (not sure I'll be happy either way)? Should I see a therapist?  Have you seen a therapist before?  What if it doesn't work?  I don't want depression meds or their 8281903 side effects…  What are some good books to read? Does this feeling of emptiness I've had since the beginning of college ""go away"" as I get older, or is it just one of those life situations you need to cope with?  Am I a spoiled punk who just needs to appreciate what he has (rules say ""No yes/no answer questions"", so ignore this one :))?

I know there are millions of others with the ""quarter life crisis"" as they call it that are way worse off than me.  I just wanted to here some anonymous thoughts from people who have maybe been through the same.

Thanks greatly for your time in advance."

I had good amounts of direction on what I should be doing, and also got to work with a couple stellar Senior Developers and System Architects, where I tried to suck every bit of information from them as I could. I wrote and deployed several very successful applications for our EDMS system that our company considers cornerstone applications today!

That was short lived. I was a part of that department for about 2 years, then an IT reorganization happened. I was shifted out of Application Development into Application Administration (wtf?) and was told I was not a developer and had no idea what I was doing. Now, I am more unhappy than ever. My job consists of the same things I was doing as an intern, and keeping sharp in this interim has been hard. 

Now normally, any person within their right mind would say, ""Okay, time to go get a new job"". For me, this is a bit of a struggle. I've had *amazing* interviews where I knocked the socks off of IT Directors as well as technical leads to Application Developers. All of these interviews would end in heartbreak, because I only have my Associates Degree. Albeit, I am 8 classes away from my BS in CIS, and should be done by the end of this year, but being told that your experience is great but we're going to choose the joe right out of college with a BS instead of you with your 5 years of experience that matches up well with our position sucks. On top of that, I cannot particularly take a contract due to medical reasons (pre-existing conditions).

qujp7,10,2012-03-13,Am I being underpaid? Would anyone hire me in the USA?,hubcon,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qujp7/am_i_being_underpaid_would_anyone_hire_me_in_the/,"**TL;DR: Sick of current job, all alone in a foreign country (the USA), do I have what it takes to get a decent, but different job?**

Hey! I recently moved to the US from Denmark. I actually am in possession of both an American and Danish citizenship, although this is my first time living here (I already have been for a year by now though).

I'm a young man, 20 years old, and work as the ""junior"" sysadmin in a small business for the last 2 years. Well small in we are less than 25 employees in total, but from a technical perspective, we have plenty of IT related services including 6 branches in 2 countries with site-to-site VPN connecting everything together (what we do is provide virtual &amp; shared office space).

I have no certificates to show for, all I got is my 2½ year education as an ""[it-supporter](http://www.ug.dk/job/dataitogteleteknik/itadmsupport/it-supporter.aspx)"" where approximately half of that time is spent as an intern. I started that education when I was 15, learned the basics of electricity, but more relevant Cisco CCNA and basics of Microsoft domains. Although where I believe the education was most useful was the time spent as an intern, as I got my foot in the door &amp; learned how to act professionally as it was my first real job considering how young I was (or still am haha).

Anyway, my entire life is revolved around my current job, and I am starting to realize how unhappy I am since the job in itself is not what I want. Our CEO has major personal issues, has been going through a harsh divorce the last 3-4 years or so... and the only other IT person in our company is a sick person and an entire different story in itself. Let me just say that he is rarely at the office and can get away with this since our boss is across the Atlantic ocean, and has an extremely poisoned view of IT doing the bare-minimum required, even if it means going completely against best practices to get the job done. For example as we speak right now, our main and most important server, hosting 5 very crucial virtual servers, is and has been running off of a defective raid-5 array for the last half year.

I would be ""allright"" with this job, if it weren't for the fact that many of my ideas of improvements are often flat out denied, and when I do accomplish good things, there is no appreciation or feedback what so ever. Besides that there is barely any communication and/or teamwork between me and the ""other"" IT-guy and our boss is in Europe most of the time so I am alone pretty much EVERY single day. I just accomplished a major goal in my opinion last week, fully inspired by myself, a complete Nagios implementation monitoring ALL of our IT infrastructure, with alerts to everyone and an app for my iPhone which can wake me up in the middle of the night should something go wrong. Even utilized CloudKick for notification in the rare chance that the actual Nagios server loses connectivity. After documenting the entire setup and sending an e-mail regarding my work to boss and other it guy; I never even received a reply...

ANYWAY, on top of this my social life is non-existent and I'm living alone so I desperately need something to change as I feel like I'm breaking down. If I may summarize: 

I'm 20. Have been working as a junior sysadmin for 2 years at this company, before that was my education as an it-supporter, where 1 year of that education was spent as an intern working as a technician for personal and small-business.

I have no major specialties and no certificates besides my ""it-supporter"" education (in which I scored perfect 12 in all final-tests, although I could imagine that means nothing for an American job).

What I DO have is plenty of self-taught knowledge. To quickly go through skills and other various topics &amp; tools I know and have familiarized myself with: various raids, php, mysql, wordpress, deploying servers in ec2 and utilizing other various services from Amazon AWS such as S3 for backup, basic pentesting within BackTrack and assessing network security, the whole aircrack-ng shebang for pentesting wifi, utilization of encryption from tools such as truecrypt, google apps, microsoft ISA, ubuntu, xenserver &amp; vmware workstation, cisco from my CCNA practice from school, exchange, IIS, iphone app programming, rackspace cloud hosting, deployment of IT monitoring from nagios, google adwords and analytics for analyzing and improving marketing. Tools I know and use including malwarebytes, hijackthis, zenmap, windirstat, powershell, sysinternals suite, keepass, apache, iptables, photoshop, afteraffects, sony vegas.

I have no idea how relevant what I listed above is, and I don't want to come across as a typical ignorant and naive know-it-all, as I have great respect for everything I DON'T know. I obviously know far from everything about php, exchange and microsoft domains, but I know how to get them running, the basic troubleshooting and the basic programming in PHP. My point is that while I don't feel as if I have any unique specialty, I am good in the sense that I have a firm all-around skill base with the motivation and logically thinking brain required to easily go out and teach myself new things, in spare time or work time, if relevant. 

Now that you know a little bit about me, do you believe I have any shot of finding something else decent to do here in the United States despite my lack of a lengthy CV, certificates or local education? Any idea on where I'd stand and what I should aim for perhaps? Heck, I'd be willing to move anywhere practically. I'm just afraid that everything I can put on document will mean jack to an American company, but then again, I have no clue how it works.

Secondly, I'm being payed $2400 a month excluding healthcare, but actually including a company car... I'm being underpaid aren't I? Any speculations on what a fair salary would be?

Worst case I move back to Denmark. As good as my well-being could be over there, I feel like my life could turn out to be much more interesting if I give the United States a chance, hence my desire to stay here.

I apologize for the wall of text, but will very much appreciate any comments and/or advice. Do not be afraid to be blunt!"

I am a 3rd year student (maybe 2nd year... not sure how much my first year 7 years ago counts) and have a good GPA (3.7 last semester, and over 3.5 every semester since I've returned to school). I am excellent in math and graph theory, and theoretical computer science. My applied skills are good, but I'd doubt they are outstanding (I know what I need to do... I just have to Google to find ways to do it).


I am active at my university and I have begun the school's first open source program and have done work for various people including business owners and professors.


I have friends that have told me ""If we have an internship position available, I'm sure I can get you in."" These are friends I have made over the years playing various games. Other than that, I am from a smaller town which has few opportunities working with 1 or 2 people for the summer (and I'd much rather do Google Summer of Code).


I've had projects, which I do for fun, noticed by university staff, newspapers, and even Microsoft's Channel 9.


For the life of me, I haven't been able to get an interview with a larger company. I'm not terribly interested in game design... ideally, I'd like to get an internship with a company like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, NVidia, etc.


I don't think my resume is outstanding, but it conveys what I've written here. Clearly I must do something more to get noticed. I've tried to do networking with people from my ""target"" companies, but I've not done well (though having a few conversations). 


So... any tips for getting an internship or at the very least, how to get to an interview? (Note, I am Canadian, and I am from the West Coast)"

As my title alludes to, I have two opportunities this summer.  One is doing research in using ontologies to model things at a small, selective, liberal arts university.  The other is as an intern, mostly on databases and small application development, at a very large, global, jack of all trades bank.

Both are rather lucrative in terms of compensation, though the bank will pay considerably more and last longer(early may through late august and possibly later if it can be arranged), and the research opprtunity will last from mid may to late july.

My game-plan for the future is to work in industry for a couple to a few years, then apply to a graduate school for a masters in game design/programming (probably). 

Any opinions on which opportunity would be the better pick?  Would an employer look more favorably on a rarer experience such as computer science research, or on a more common, but more practical experience such as interning at said global bank?  Thanks for your help in advance!"

I did this because I have no confidence in myself and thought I should take what I can get now, rather than wait for other better offers. I received emails from Company B about interviewing with them while they were on campus in February, and I took the interview because I thought it would be harmless and a very good experience since they give technically demanding interviews. I did unexpectedly well and received an offer from them. I wouldn't normally consider reneging, but the new offer is *far* superior. They provide incredible pay, housing and transportation support, and look really good on a resume (everyone knows the name of this company). It's an unbelievable opportunity.

Company A provides no housing or transportation support, which is a major issue for me since I will have to buy a car and find a place to live in a city I don't know. I knew this was an issue when I signed, though.

Extra points to consider:

* It has been a few months since I accepted, but still a few months till summer
* Company A may have a hard time finding a replacement since they were searching early on
* There's definitely no public transportation option at Company A's office
* Company A gave me a choice of which office to work at, but after choosing the office they forced me to a different office. This happened immediately after I accepted
* I have spoken to a school adviser. He said, essentially, that there won't be any side effects of breaking off the offer other than I likely won't be hired by them in the future (I'm ok with this), but it will be hard for them to find a replacement and he can't officially advise me to renege on an offer.
* Neither company knows I interviewed with the other. If I have to break it off, I would in no way tell them that it's because I'm going to another company
* This is my last summer to intern
* I understand that what I'm doing is likely very much frowned upon in professional ethics

Here's my main questions to you all:

* What would you do if you were me?
* Do I have an ethical obligation to Company A? Companies are willing to cut employees, and people interview for other jobs while hired all the time, but for some reason doing this on an internship feels extra wrong.
* If I break off the internship with Company A, how should I tell them? Send a general but apologetic email? Call the HR person who gave the offer? I don't owe them the full story, and it would complicate the issue to tell more than is necessary.
* How would you feel if you were the HR person dealing with a dropped intern?

I should note that I am leaning towards Company B, but I can be persuaded.
Thank you for any response at all, I am extremely conflicted and need objective help.

I am primarily interested in working in either a financial services sector or a software development division, but I am open to other fields. I have a 4.0 GPA in major and am willing to relocate if the internship is paid. 

One of my greatest strengths is my quantitative skills. I have a good record in mathematics, having tested out of multiple classes at my university as well have won first in a variety of university-sponsored competitions. I ascribe my success in this subject to my long-formed pursuit in the content of numbers predicting and mapping the world. I believe that my drive will materialize into my work, producing excellent results.

In addition, I am fluent in English and advanced in Spanish. I also am proficient and have programing experience with a variety of computer languages such as Java, OCaml, and a few others. I reinforce this statement with my 4.0 GPA in Computer Science. I believe that by learning advanced calculations and computer languages, one also receives insight into possible applications and predictions. Therefore, I believe my programming and high calculation experiences are an important asset I have.

I am able to provide my resume and additional information upon request to continue the process.

I want to be an ios engineer but I don't have much experience. 
I went to school for a computer science degree (graduated in June). I did not intern anywhere because of my immigration issue at the time (couldn't get a work permit). 
I just got this resolved recently and looking for a job now. 
I didn't have any formal experiences but I have done some game programming side project and websites.


After college, I taught myself objective c, xocde, xcode interface builder and worked on an iphone app. It's a very simple app that counts scores for magic the gathering game. I downloaded a bunch of other similar free apps and improved mine to have better usability and nicer graphic. 
I released the app and it got about 1000+ something download in the first month or so. 
I then moved on to make a 2D game with cocos2d. The finished project was not that fun for me to play and I just decided not to release it.  
I also used Instruments to detect memory leaks, just to learn how to use the tool. 

I found ios developing to be pretty fun relative to other things and I think I would find my career more rewarding.

My question to you is :

- How did you become a developer?

- Is there a chance that I can get started without experience? How do I make myself stand out for entry-level positions? 

- While I am unemployed, what more about ios should I learn? What skills are particularly useful for an ios developer to have? What skills are valued by the employers?

- Other comments? I really, really, really want to make this happen. 

Thank you guys =)

qzqr2,9,2012-03-16,Graduating in May. I have no real projects of my own. Better to work on some after I graduate before entering the workforce?,SnailHunter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qzqr2/graduating_in_may_i_have_no_real_projects_of_my/,"I'm graduating with my BS in CS this May. I always hear people saying that you should have a portfolio of all the projects you've worked on in your spare time, and that employers really look for that kind of stuff.  I've had two internships, but I haven't really done any projects on my own. 

 I would like to make some of my own mobile apps (as I already have some experience doing this with internships), but right now I'm way too busy with school. Would it be better to take some time off after I graduate to work on some project of my own that I would be proud of before I start interviewing for jobs? More importantly, does it look bad to employers if they see that you took time off after you graduated instead of getting a job right away? What if I wanted to take a year off to travel, for instance? Would this hurt me?

The big reason I really haven't done much in my spare time is that, for one, I didn't even know how to program before I began my CS degree. And for two, the little spare time I've had while pursing this degree has been spent socializing to ensure I keep some semblance of sanity. I think the biggest reason though is that I just wasn't experienced enough to even consider making something interesting on my own. As a senior, I definitely feel ready to make some things on my own now, and I really want to. I started working on something during spring break, but now that school's back I just don't have the time. 

So, to summarize my question, would it better to take some time off after I graduate (maybe a few months or more), or perhaps just work part time, so I can work on a project of my own that I could be proud of and show off to employers? Does it look really bad if I have nothing to show except the stuff that I did in my internships (which isn't really that interesting)?

Also, what should I even say if an employer asks me about my own projects and I don't really have any?"

Most of my life I've been completely miserable. I don't really know why, I just always feel alone, even with my best of friends at times. In high school I thought I was a complete loser...even as I walked off the field being crowned homecoming king. I always felt like an idiot even though I walked in late to my act without a calculator or a god damn clue and wound up with a 31 and used that to segue my way into a full ride scholarship, not to bad for an idiot I thought. I got to school and got heavy into drugs. They made me happy. They were not to be my ultimate problem though. That would be my parents.

They are divorced, have been since I was 4 weeks old. Dads rich, moms poor, lived with mom, visited dad, that old story.

I am at msu in my second semester, spring 2010. A bad LSD trip has convinced me to profess my hidden/repressed feelings for my best friend. She makes me feel like no body else can or will. Let me rephrase this again, more clearly; the only times in my adult life that I have been happy, were because this person, and this person alone, was simply there, talking to me, and genuinely caring that I existed.  She feels the same towards me, and I get to spend the greatest time of my life with her. Things are great. I'm getting off drugs, im happy, truly happy, and at peace with myself and others for the first time in my life. Fast forward one month. I get sick.I have to go home on medical leave, we end up taking a break, mutually, I'm so sick I can't leave the bed. The doctors say its mono. I cry in front of my mom over my loss of my new found happiness and love and she sends me to a psych ward. I get out 3 days later. I see a psych, get put on every medication you can name, get my sanity and mind pushed through zaps, loops, to the very edge. I get back to school in the fall. Things between me and the only girl I will ever love (20 since none come close) questions my sanity and is seeing someone. I drink heavily and fail. Get pulled out of school by dad. At this point he was running my finances, paying my bills. I thought he had control of my tuition grant. Nope, he just forged my name and lied, forcing me to come home, and go to community college for the past year and work for him full time, because he knows I don't have the will to do anything about it anymore.

My mom tried to kill herself last year. Luckily I was home, and with my encyclopedic pharmacology knowledge I knew I could stabilize her long enough until the emt got there, she ended up totally fine. She hated me for it. He wanted her friend to save her. Her friend never showed up, or if she did, it would have been much too late. A month after that I had to sleep outside. My mother, the one I saved, was going to press assault charges, for yelling at 1am when I woke up to her screaming at my poor crying sister balled up on the kitchen floor ""you are not sending my sister to the nut house and fucking her life up like you did mine because you are tired of being a mom"". She called her bf crying saying I was going to hit her then 911 and said out now. Had fun explaining to dad why I was leaping on the lawn o dad when he picked me up for work.

Oh yea, and those psych ward and psych visits? My mom hid the bills from me. My credit is shit and I'm still in debt. I honestly should have watched the bitched choke on her vomit. I'd be happier too, yea I'm fucked in the head, but you would be too if your mom left you with a babysitter that just locked you in the hallway closet screaming for fucking hours.

So here I am. I got my own apt and car now. Most if not all my friends have abandoned me, or ignor me, the girl of my dreams is now my long distance ex girlfriend I will never get over, and I haven't felt a happy or non-alone moment since I left college freshman year. I wake up every day wondering what I did to deserve this. I look at me, and my mom. I try to do the right thing every day, my mom throws m under a bus for a hundred bucks. She owes me her life and she fucking hates me. She's evil and does nothing but wrong, used that suicide attempt to guilt trip her new husband to the altar and is on her honeymoon in the virgin islands now. Me? The one responsible for letting her have all that? What good karma reward do I get? To wake up every day crying. Take orders from my fucked up family, at their ass backwards company, doing a job that anyone lse would get paid 6x the amount, but I get minimum wage to make web pages, owners manuals build machines, order parts, find new, cheaper parts, fix the network, all shit these old, technologically impaired ppl cannot do without huge outsourcing costs.

Here's the icing on the shit cake of my life. The girl I keep talking about visited over spring break. It was great to see her again and talk.

Well fuck my face, she is moving back here in the fall to do her internship at our old high school. Fan. Fucking. Tas tick.

TLDR: I was forced fom the love of my life by my parents, and I will never find anyone close to her, or get over her. I may significantly alter my long term life goals if I can still get her back, but I don't even know how she really feels now. She's the only person/thing that ever made me feel happy, or loved,or wanted, or like I fit in. She's the only reason I wake up and go through hell every day, crying, in complete agony. Without the hope of her, I'd kill myself right now. I know how wrong that I, but it's true, and no amount of drugs, legal or not, therapy, anything, has been able to change that, no matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it to.

I remember while in 5th and 6th grade going to bed and thinking of killing myself. I am a junior in college now. I have cut myself, I have tried to hang myself, I have punched myself, I have tried to over dose, and so on. 

I got a job once I turned 16. I was working 40+ hours a week up until college. This just made it worse. I didn't make many friends at school since I was always working. It was a shitty Subway/DQ job. I worked there up until college, then worked there over the next summer. Always 40+ hours a week. Last summer I got a different job since I didn't want to go back. This time at a deli. Was working 40+ hours a week all summer with people I hated. Just as bad as the other. 

Now for this summer. I am a Mathematics major and I have applied to countless internships, 10+ REU programs and I know I won't hear back from any of them. I have decent grades, but I'm not a minority, or female. Just an average white guy. My girl friend applies to two things and hears back that she is in an REU a month later. I will have to go back to working another 40+ hours a week this summer and hating myself every second of it. 

I have seen counselors at my school, I have seen one outside, I have been on three different anti-depressants, and nothing has worked. I can't put up with any of this anymore. "

r0kt8,1,2012-03-17,Recent high school grad outperforms two msft programmers,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/r0kt8/recent_high_school_grad_outperforms_two_msft/,"It was the summer of 1996.

My dad got me a job as an ""engineering intern"" at an avionics company that built computers that would be installed in airplanes (i.e., Data Flight Recorders, among other components).  Their main product was a ""data loader"", a $100k system that works as a CD-ROM drive for these computers (loads data not 640MB optical disks and then inserted into these computers).

The main problem was the proprietary programs worked on this computer, but an easy-to-use menu needed to be built for integration purposes (to have a complete product).  Two former Microsoft programmers were tasked with writing this menu program and came up with an issue.  Although these proprietary programs worked, the menu program exceeded the 640K limit for using base memory and would cause the entire system to crash.

Learning most of my skills from changing key bindings in DOS (as practical jokes), I was able to create a .BAT file that used colors in the background and could make a finished product.  Granted, it was text-based and used ANSI color schemes, the current product the MSFT programmers had looked no better.  And as my script was a .bat file, it took no memory overhead.

I felt really bad after the fact as the asshole boss fired both of the programmers for incompetence.  I went to college and found a different career.  However, I heard one of them made a lot of money from creating a key innovation in VOIP, so perhaps I won't feel too bad.

The main reason why I'm posting this story is to remind people that 640K was almost more than enough memory that was needed at one time.  I'm sure people who have been in computers longer will say 64K was adequate--or the space on a punchcard."

As the title says, I have been living in a medium sized city in Sweden all my life. I am 26 years old, in january 2013 I will have completed my education at my local uni.

I have about five years of work experience (retail) along with five years of studying to become a teacher in secondary school. Now the thing is I want to get away from my hometown and I have always wanted to go to the United States. As for time frame I was thinking that I'd like to be away for a year or so.

I'd like to consider myself employable. however, I realize that I can't just get a job since I am not a citizen so I was thinking along the lines of getting an internship somewhere. The job does not matter.

I could also see myself taking some classes, but I am already in debt from studying five years here in Sweden. It is not a big debt, but I have used up my student loan quota.

The reason I want to go i simple. I'd really like to visit the US to get a feel for the culture and meet the people, broaden my views. I think it would make me a better teacher in the end (Social Sciences and English).
On a more personal note, I am tired of doing the same thing day in and day out, meet the same people. My week is basically work, study, party, (occasionally) meet girls and it is killing my soul. I want to do something more stimulating. Call it my own personal journey or something crappy like that.

It might be a bit naive of me to think that going to the US is possible for me, but one can dream right?
Oh, and if there are any unmarried american female redditors looking for a blond blue eyed swede with an accent, maybe we could make an anchor viking baby :)

So what are my options?

Thank you beforehand for any advice!

TL;DR
I want to go to the US to work or study, what are my options? Thanks!"
r1juk,2,2012-03-17,Getting that foot in the door,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/r1juk/getting_that_foot_in_the_door/,"I hope this isn't too off topic.  I'm looking for some advice.  Even an answer like ""You're asking for too much."" helps me.  I just need some perspective and advice.


First, here are a few observations I have made about my city.  

We are an ""engineering city"" with a decent amount of tech jobs.  Many of these revolve around government contracts.  In order to win these contracts, it seems that the employers are only hiring more senior levels or helpdesk with little to no juniors.  Companies here are not wanting to train anyone.  They just want someone who can walk in and do the job.  


I've had multiple companies fly me in for interviews.  I've fielded call after call from recruiters out of state, but I can't seem to get anything going in my own city.  


A little background on me.  I am currently working in a web hosting tech support position while finishing the last semester of my degree.  I have worked co-ops and internships all throughout college, and have about four years of total IT experience from these positions.  I'm kind of a generalist, which is why I had my degree focus in information security.  I'm trying to really land a good junior sysadmin position and really expand my learning.


I've been running little servers at home for years - asterisk, BSD file servers, LAMP, Active Directory, NAS boxes, and the like.  It's hard for me to learn something just to learn it, so I come up with a way I can incorporate it into my home network to make it run more like an enterprise.  This has worked with great results for the most part.  These are things that my college degree aren't going to teach me.  


Now, I'm trying to get to that next level, but I'm having trouble out of most companies.  I actually have a job offer.  It's what I want to be paid out of school, and it's significantly more than my current job and the co-ops I've worked for around $15 / hour.  The job really calls for an IT generalist, but is going to require a lot of moving around -- every two years on average.  I'm actually wondering why this company is willing to ""take a chance"" on me when I get cold shouldered by the rest.  


Here is what I don't want - I don't want another tech support position.  I can post my resume if it'll help, but I really think I have experience beyond the support desk.   Am I asking too much to want to be hired into a junior sysadmin position, considering I will be fresh out of college?  Is the formula of being hired into tech support and moving up after a few years the way I am going to have to go?  Should I just shut up and take the good offer I'm given out of state?  


I would seriously appreciate some sage advice here.  Most of the people here are on experience levels I only hope to be on one day."

r47du,2,2012-03-19,"Student-teacher, feeling anxious",[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/r47du/studentteacher_feeling_anxious/,"So I am a 22year old ESL teacher in the second year of my university's program, and today it was my first time teaching a whole class using my own planning. There is another 3 weeks left in my practicum.

It's not that it went badly today... It went pretty good actually, considering the lack of planning I had done. I had a 15-20 minutes class-discussion with them about Kony 2012, then I made them watch a 20minute video, had a discussion on it and introduced The Debate, which is what I'll be working with for the next 3 weeks with 3 different groups.

Here is my problem... Even if everything went well (my associate teacher told me I had a good presence, seemed confident and everything, just lacked planning and preparation and it showed a bit), I'm still really stressed out about the three weeks ahead, but even more about the real world. I'm double-guessing my profession, and wonder if I'd be happier doing something else. I've never felt like this, but the anxiety I'm feeling towards this internship is bringing me down.

Anyone felt anxious for no apparent reasons on their first REAL internship? I feel that if I connected with my students better most of the stress would go away... I don't have the connection with them I thought I would. Anyone has any tips or any advice for me, or just anything to cheer me up? 

My groups are all 10th grade french kids, who have very VERY limited English. I HAVE to speak in English at all times and sometimes it's very hard to make myself understood."

I got my award letter today, and thinks are looking grim. My family and I would have to pay $11,000 out of pocket and get $22,000 a year in loans ever year, which we may not be able to do.

Which means that I will probably have to begrudgingly accept my full ride scholarship at NIU. However, I really, really do not want to go to NIU for a wide variety of reasons (Liberal arts degree, don't like the companies that hire from them, lack of challenge, I'd be in the top 5% of students there, classes I could just as easily find at ITT Technical Institute, crappy campus, etc). I visited the U of I campus and fell in love immediately. :/

So, I was wondering how you all pay for college. Loans? Scholarships? Paid internships? Work study? And for computer science people specifically, is your program worth the extra $120,000 I would have to pay to attend it?

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice guys! I'll figure some way to work it out. Another question, how much do CS internships pay over a summer? How early can you get them? My understanding is that the earliest they come is the summer before junior year. Thanks again."

r3wil,3,2012-03-19,"About to change my major, tell me if I'm crazy.",Dancetrooper,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/r3wil/about_to_change_my_major_tell_me_if_im_crazy/,"So I've had my heart set on being a Computer Engineer since high school. The curriculum so far is great. Programming isn't exactly my strong suit, but it's a valuable skill and I'm glad to know more than the average college student.  I love the hardware aspect of my major, and I'm much better at the electrical engineering side than the computer science.

But there seems to be this problem when I try to go out and find internships or even have casual conversations with people about what I'm doing in school.  When I'm speaking with employers, a lot of them have a hard time understanding what computer engineering is. Maybe I just get the herps and derps of recruiting, but this problem has come up enough as to where I'm probably going to switch to Electrical Engineering.

When I talk to anybody, the conversation goes something like:

Me: ""I'm a sophomore in computer enginee...""

Recruiter: ""OH SO COMPUTER SCIENCE K WE WANT ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS, LATER""

Me: ""No actually, most of my curriculum is electrical engineering classes, and it really only differentiates itself from electrical engineering during the last few semesters of school.""

At that point, they kind of understand, but seem to still be confused or horrified by what I'm doing, and continue to assume that I sit in front of a computer and program all day. I'm convinced that Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science would be a significantly better choice, and it will clear up the confusion people are having with what I'd like to do upon graduation.

For the summer, I took a full-time research job at my university instead of an internship. This may or may not have been a horrible idea, but once I officially switch my major, I'll have to stay in school an extra semester or two and figure I can make up for the lost internship/co-op during that time. I didn't want to take a computer science internship, which is basically all that was available to me. I feel as though electrical engineering positions will be given to electrical engineers, and computer science positions will be given to computer scientists(and I feel like the computer science positions are much more abundant).

Anyway Reddit, this might be a rash decision, but I want people to know that I'm more interested in hardware and electrical engineering than computer science. I was hoping to get some feedback on whether or not this is a bad idea, or if other people have had the same problem."

I have looked at the Google Summer of Code program from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r19tn/what_should_i_be_doing_right_now_with_regards_to/), but I do not know if I can commit 40 hours a week this summer.

I carefully drafted individualized cover letters to the internships and individual companies where I tried to highlight my skills that would apply to the specific job.

I also have a blog that highlights my writing skills and some projects that I'm doing outside of my school curriculum.

PS This is for an entry level position, if that matters.  My only ""real"" work experience is from an internship I had before, but also with largely unrelated work.  

Thanks for any input!

I will be graduating with a CS degree in a couple months and have already accepted a position at a consulting company where I will be doing C#/ASP.Net development. They use MVC. I was hoping to get some advice as to how I can best prepare myself for this position.

* I have done quite a bit of DB work. I am comfortable designing, managing, and querying DBs.
* I have moderate experience with C#
* I have a basic understanding of HTML
* I have a couple years of experience doing Java, Python, and C++ dev at internships
* I feel that I have a solid grasp on data structures, algorithms, networking, and most everything else that comes with a CS degree
* About 3 months experience making a ASP.NET/C# tool
* Annoying amounts of experience with source control

**What I don't have:**

* Deep understanding of HTML/C#
* Any understanding of CSS
* Any experience with MVC
* Proper design for these web-based projects
* Ways to apply object oriented programming to these projects properly
* An understanding of what else I should list here...


I know this is quite a bit and I am sure what I will need to know will depend on my company, but I was hoping you guys might be able to provide me with some sources (books, sites, etc.) so that I can begin forming a solid foundation of understanding so that I can begin making an impact sooner at my new company.

r7ivz,9,2012-03-21,Need some advice. Not doing a very good job getting a job.,rainymonday512,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r7ivz/need_some_advice_not_doing_a_very_good_job/,"Let me begin by apologizing for such a long post.

I posted a while back before having an interview with Google. It didn't go very well because my weakest area is programming. I understand this is the core of software engineering. I've done a bit of stuff on TopCoder and have continued working on my projects when I have time. TopCoder, however, seems a bit silly unless you're trying to practice algorithms. (Why not instead work on a project?) I'm currently trying to update an HTTP 1.0 proxy in C to 1.1 and add caching. (This was originally a project from last semester.) I am also working on small components of a distributed file system using RPC in C++ for a distributed systems class this semester. But that's just an assignment. I also have some Java experience, and know/can leverage most of the simple/intermediate language features, but haven't done anything of scale. 

I've had a couple of phone screens for software engineering positions that seemed to go well enough, but were for positions that I didn't directly apply for, so didn't really line up with my strengths. I have also received a number of no's just from my resume. Really what it comes down to is that my weakest point in terms of experience and expertise is programming as far as software engineering is concerned. On the other side of things, I've applied to a couple of IT positions. I was a manager at a university helpdesk, can do some scripting, and know some linux (not a lot, but enough to be useful). But in IT I don't have the experience in networking, database administration, ad, etc.

I'm still applying to places and have one interview coming up that lines up pretty well and seems like it might go well. But I feel like I am applying for the wrong positions entirely. I really like problem solving and feel I have a strong grasp on all of the undergraduate courses I've taken, but since many are missing from the department, I haven't taken a good OS, networking, or compilers class.

I like to think of myself as smart (I get good grades, etc.), but that doesn't seem to be very helpful at the moment. I also feel that whenever I am presented with a problem, I am pretty good at finding a good solution, given a little time to myself. I would have applied to graduate school were it not for student loans, but my plan is to pay off loans before going back. And when I do apply I think I'll go for EE, because I am much more interested in working with the technical details of things than high level abstractions.

I am wondering if anyone has suggestions in terms of what I really should work on in order to improve my chances for software engineering-ish jobs. I know that if I want to do IT, I should take courses and the like. Perhaps it's foolish for me now to be working on something in C because it takes such a long time to get everything correct and do all of the testing without making your own suitable abstractions (considering I have limited time)? Any suggestions for places to which to apply? Suggestions in terms of career path?

I appreciate any direction that I can get. Thanks.

EDIT: I appreciate all of the feedback. I got a pseudo-offer, which was ""do a two-month internship with us while you're still in school and then you can switch to full time in May."" But I didn't plan my semester to have time for an internship, so I said I would get back to them after next week. I have an interview and a couple of phone interviews next week. I've also applied to a few more places in the past day. I will update this thread when something changes. Again, thanks for all of the help.

EDIT2: Thanks to everyone for the feedback. Looking for jobs really and truly sucks. I had a few interviews lined up for this week and next week, but today I got a job offer from the company I really wanted to work for, so I am going to accept and cancel the other interviews. Again, I appreciate all of the feedback that I got.

I'm 18, 19 in June. I've been working for this IT company for 2 years as a system engineer intern. In July I will finish my associates degree (associates in arts, its a generic degree for transfer). I have narrowed down my options to two.
1) Stay where I am on the team I'm on and take the full time job. My last review I just did I got the highest marks possible. I'm not sure but I think my starting salary would be 40k/yr
2) Go to the university of Missouri to finish my bachelors degree in computer science. I would have to take out student loans approximately 40k in debt. Work part time still with this company but be on a different team. Come back to work for this company after I finish my degree starting out making approximately 60k/yr

Since I'm going to work for this company after graduation is it worth it to get my bachelors degree? Is the debt worth it? Are the experiences worth the debt? Should I leave something I'm excelling in to get a higher degree?

I want to get other peoples opinions. Thanks"

I took a quarter on C and still remember the bulk, but on top of that with my MIS degree I was forced into doing Visual Basic and Adobe Flex (the banes of my existence). I also taught myself HTML5 in its early form (prior to a lot of the multimedia content). I've been teaching myself other languages lately like php and javascript (and a few others but those I feel I have down most) and I seem to get the general programming knowledge, just need syntax.

At first it was an ideal job... started as an intern and got a wide exposure to different environments. Now? I find myself stressed to the max and wanting a new job!

Complaints start from our poor bonus system, no time compensation for weekend work during the week, being on call for a week (text alerts and client 'emergency' calls). We're required to get certificates to keep partnerships with Microsoft and Cisco... however; we're given no training and required to study on our own time (reimbursed for the test IF you pass).

I often feel my calendar is too jammed and I don't have time to finish things that I started. It's extremely frustrating when I find myself cheating on something and taking shortcuts because I'm limited on time. It's frustrating going to a client site and doing tasks such as moving computers to new desk and climbing underneath...

We do have internal support such as service manager, receptionist, sales, but often feel they're out of the loop not knowing technology itself. When someone quits, it takes FOREVER to get replacements if at all.

Can anyone shed some insight if these type of items are common for employed consulting? Should I be looking elsewhere? Anyone converted from IT Consulting work to full time defined position with one company and regretted it?

Don't get me wrong, this company isn't a complete bust and does better than what I'm describing. They've been around for 10+ years which is quite the accomplishment in a small / medium business. I enjoy working in IT but feel I may be at the point where I need to try another company. I'm rather clueless on what my job requirements would be for a single company of larger size to be honest.

  The class at the CC does transfer over for CS 225 credit though.  As someone who wants to pursue a software internship and possibly a future career, is the class important enough to take at school and cost me that extra 3000 tuition (I'm an out of stater)?"

The problem was that since many of the co-hosts were busy with the show, they were not able to keep up with the reviews.

So now we are looking for a dedicated reviewer who

* Speaks and writes in English well
* Able to keep to a schedule
* Has experience reviewing
* Be able to flexible and creative
* Be able to do audio and video reviews

If you feel you are up to the task email me gerardo@podcast17.com with a resume and at least 3 samples of your work. I will get back to you and we will continue the interview from there.

Although we do not offer payment as it is an internship, you do get 1) the game 2) a platform to present your article 3) the privilege of being part of a team or project 4) experience in the journalistic field

We have our podcast syndicated over many sites with hosts/sources coming from multiple backgrounds including heads of websites such as moddb and developers at indie studios. This is a perfect place to showcase your work and maybe get recognized. Podcast 17 has partnership with many developers and publishers so there is always a game available to review!

r8g1q,1,2012-03-22,"My Uni's software engineering dept offers not-so-detailed, broad programming courses, but pushes product development.  Is this bad for getting an entry level job?",Chrono-chan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r8g1q/my_unis_software_engineering_dept_offers/,"The program's broad courses teach the basics of CS through certain languages.  For me, it was some basic Java and PHP (which is scary since everyone here seems to hate PHP here, but don't worry, I 'got' Java before seeing the 'bad habit' conventions of PHP)

They really push the SDLC here, and hammer in the importance of documentation, and design, not the intricacies of programming or languages.  Rather than give small assignments, there are lots of big semester/half-semester-long projects that go from idea to implementation.

I actually really enjoy these early parts, like documentation.  I fear the implementation because the programming courses are so so broad and in some ways basic.  I feel like I can't get a job, especially entry level, because I would fail any language proficiency questions asked.

I seem better as serving the 'real' programmers through coordination and leadership.  I know the least, but since I really get into the projects and dive in head first, causing stronger programmers to look to me for answers, which is a very interesting phenomenon.

I have not had an internship, but I did get hired for a few semesters with the head professor in the program, mostly doing visual design (I was previously an animator) .  I may have an opportunity to work for a web based start-up (though some people say stick with the Uni jobs), and I'm super excited to program more, especially on my own projects.  

With this basic information is there any advice you can give?
Is this 'broad' education 'bad' for getting an entry level job?

My strengths are communication, asking tons of questions until everyone understands what's going on, and documentation, rather than programming.  However, I don't know how to leverage this in getting jobs.  Any advice as to how I can 'sharpen the spear' more?"

So I asked the organizers whether I could go as a blogger (because bloggers get in for free) and wrote a sentence about my academic background, which includes currently doing a BSc degree in CS.

I got a reply that my background sounded interesting, and since I am doing a BSc in CS they'd rather offer me an internship if I have any programming or designing skills. This is an online newspaper, who also host conferences. And I am thinking of telling them that unfortunately I don't have many programming skills, but I don't know what an intern would have to know.

I mean, I have taken one intro to programming class and I am taking the continuation of that class right now, during this semester. I can write very simple stuff in C++, Java and maybe python. But I mean really simple stuff, like solving Project Euler questions, and the longest code I've written was 2 pages long, it was, again, to solve a maths problem. I have worked with regular expressions, but I always have to look them up online, I can't memorize them and I think I am a fast learner, but I really do only have the basics.

I would really love to work at this place but the most awful thing to do would be to tell them that yes, I do have some programming skills and then go there and be a failure. What would an intern need to know?"

I know many of you are college students and some are most likely not even in the field yet but merely searching around.  I think it's quite obvious that the job market for quality engineers is stable and growing despite a weakening economy.  Regardless of the financial benefit I know more happy engineers with their careers than any other profession (I don't know any professional athletes, though).  It's a great path to take.

If you have questions about school or the interview process I know there are plenty of others here that have recently completed or are currently involved and I'm sure they'll comment on their availability for you.  I am a medical devices hardware engineer currently but have experience in HW and SW from two separate extended internships.

I'd also like to know something for those who stopped by here that are currently employed as EE's...are you happy with your job?  What would you change?

Thanks!

Hey /r/forhire. I've just started applying for summer internships, so I figured I may as well look for some offers here too.

I'm currently a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon intending to major in CS, with a decent level of experience in both Web dev and systems (most recently, I owned the [Stripe CTF challenge](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag)). I'm looking for development/engineering work, but if something *really* compelling comes along on the sysadmin side of things I'll take a look at it too.

I'll work anywhere in the US or abroad (provided I can get a visa), but I'd really like to spend the summer in either Silicon Valley or pretty much any major European/Asian city where I can mostly get around with English. Like I said in the title, I'm also really interested in startups, so if you're contacting me from a startup let me know what you do and who you're funded by!

If anyone is interested in setting up an interview, just shoot me a PM or email me at rlester@cmu.edu."

[Willing to share any close calls with us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c444ojw?context=5)|I wrote this recently about an experience I had in Haiti after the earthquake...closest call I've experienced to date...
 |It was nine days after the infamous earthquake shot the nation of Haiti to the top of the world interest charts.
 |I was with a small medical team treating open wounds in a massive tent city near the center of Port-au-Prince, the capitol city.
 |This particular day, things did not go according to plan.
 |As I reached the top of the hill with my translator, Peter, and completely out of earshot or eyesight of the rest of our team, we were surrounded by about twenty very angry men. They were armed with blunt objects, clenched fists and were ready for their voices to be heard.
 |A man who was self-appointed ringleader got right in my face and began screaming...
 |“Why are you here?!”
 |“We don’t have any food!”
 |“We don’t have any money!”
 |“We are hungry!”
 |“My daughter is very injured!”
 |“Why hasn’t Obama come to help us?”
 |The men pressed closer, and by this time my heart was racing. 
 |I wondered how much longer until the beat-down began. 
 |I wondered how long it would take until I was unconscious.
 |I was speechless. My mind was flipping through a rolodex of things to say but every sheet came up blank.
 |So I prayed.
 |What happened next still astonishes me, and as I remember the moment, it still doesn’t feel like it was really me.
 |I placed both my hands gently on his shoulders (which, by the way, is the very LAST thing you should EVER do to the person who is ready to beat you down.)
 |The group of men all stopped and stared at him, waiting to get his reaction.
 |Then, out of my mouth stumbled these words...
 |“I am so sorry...I have no idea how painful and difficult all of this is for you, but I need you to listen to me...”
 |All eyes on the leader.
 |“Ok,” he replied, “I will listen to you.”
 |More words stumbled out...
 |“I don’t have any food...if I had enough food, I’d come back and feed everyone in this city, but all I have is medicine and I need you help...”
 |He looked me in the eyes, “Ok, we will help you. What do you need us to do?”
 |We explained what we were doing, they agreed, and I pushed my way outside the mob and began putting distance between us as quickly as I could. No sense sticking around a hornet’s nest, right?
 |But suddenly, a realization hit me, and I stopped.
 |If I leave now, I’ll only remember that man as the “angry guy in the tent city”.
 |I turned and called to him, “Hey, what’s your name?”
 |“My name is Isaac,” he called back, “do you want to meet my family?”
 |“I would love to meet your family,” I replied.
 |Isaac led me by the arm to a dusty sheet draped over some wooden rods, pulled back the flap and there they were. He proudly introduced me to each member. 
 |He wasn’t the “angry guy in the tent city”...he was a loving husband...caring father...a man defending his family. Just like I would have done.
[Thank you for taking the time to write out this story.  I find it completely amazing that you were able to relate to him after all that, I wonder if he felt the same way about you. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4451mm?context=5)|I'd like to think so. It was the most surreal situation I've ever experienced.
[That's.. incredible..   Have you been in a dangerous situation in Uganda as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4456vt?context=5)|Nothing quite like this. I'm sure the day will come.
[What are the biggest problems with treating a former child soldier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c442rux?context=5)|From what we've experienced, it's reintegration. Helping them establish a new sense or ""normalcy"" that doesn't have anything to do with ""kill or be killed"", or being used as bait, or psychological abuse.
 |We work with a partner Ugandan organization that will actually take many of these children (the majority of which do not have immediate family, or are not wanted any longer), and house, educate, and treat them in a safe, family-oriented environment. 
 |We work with another child psychologist who uses a lot of art therapies that have also been very effective.
 |Where our projects are based in Central Uganda (an area known as the Luwero Triangle), it has the highest population of abandoned or orphaned children in the entire country. We've discovered this is a direct result of the aftermath of the Bush War in the 1980s. When the current Ugandand president Museveni led a coup in 85-86, he also used child soldiers to take down the government. What's interesting is, while I don't know anyone who speaks favorably of Kony or the LRA, they were very supportive of the Bush War tactics. TL;DR - we don't like child soldiers if we don't agree with the politics.
 |When the dust settled in the Bush War, the leftover children returned to their villages to find many of their families had fled. When these kids hit puberty, they began fathering/mothering children, but no one was there to help them really learn the ropes of life. This has led to all kinds of problems. 
 |The struggles they have are deep seeded. They've seen/experienced/participated in things none of us will ever quite understand. From watching their parents shot right in front of them, to actually being the shooter themselves, to being raped a dozen times a day. Helping them to the point of processing and healing is long, and only for the most patient and caring.
[Fuck, those all sound like terrible problems to have.   Definitely gives some perspective to those of us complaining of our firstworldproblems.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c4457v2?context=5)|It certainly makes our first world issues seem quite insignificant and silly.
[How is someone physically able to rape someone that many times per day? And, from a mental perspective, how does it affect their sexual development later on in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r9ts3/i_run_a_small_ngo_that_works_primarily_in_uganda/c445d2y?context=5)|It's different men.

I’m concerned that it’ll become “just another hyped up thing”. (Because we’re pretty good at that in America.) I’m concerned that a NGO is participating in assisting a military operation. (However nuanced their participation might be.) I’m concerned that the people at the very center of this story (in the African nations affected) will be ultimately left out.

But… I’m hopeful that the KONY2012 campaign has awakened an incredibly healthy conversation about how we can work together for genuine good in the world. Warlords like Joseph Kony simply must understand that these kinds of brutal legacies will not go unnoticed any longer. I’m hopeful this will lead to healing and restoration of thousands affected by brutal injustice in the focal region. I’m hopeful we can take what IC has started and make it better with time.

ran8i,0,2012-03-23,Possibly wont graduate for going over word count on a paper. What can I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ran8i/possibly_wont_graduate_for_going_over_word_count/,"I've been holding off on posting this for a while, but I've gotten to the point where I need help. I know reddit is a friendly, caring community, most of the time, so I know you guys will have so decent advice for me. 

Let me start by introducing myself, I'm a senior in college. I've been attending Fresno State for the last 4 years, and I'm typically a good student. 3.7 GPA, and I usually get all A's and B's. I'm working two jobs, one at the school paper, and one at the local paper and I also and working an internship with Pokernews.com. This should be my final semester at State, but I've encountered a huge problem.


It started about a month ago when for one of my professors asked up to write a paper. I wrote the paper with no questions asked, and submitted it before the deadline. After submitting my paper, I realized I was a few words over the 1000 word word count, 35 to be exact. 

I spoke with the professor about this the day after I submitted the paper. I told him the problem, and even asked if he wanted me to resubmit a shorter paper. He told me not to worry about it, so I didn't.

I get my grade on the paper a few weeks later, and I had received a 0 on the paper with the only comment being that I had gone over word count. 

Immediately after seeing this, I sent him an email, reminding him of the conversation we had. 

This is what I sad: 

&gt; Professor XXXXX,

&gt; I spoke to you about the word count of my paper after class one day. It was at 1035, and I asked you if that would be acceptable or If I could go and fix it. You told me not to worry about it, but when I looked at my grade, I had listed a 0. I am wondering if there is anything I can do about this? Please get back to me. 

He responded this:

&gt; I remember this conversation.  I told you to not worry about it.  But you made an assumption; I did not say you would get credit, I just said don't worry about it.  And although you apparently didn't understand this at the time, I said that because there was nothing you could do at that point.  You would have had to fix the paper, and resubmit before the deadline, which had already passed when you talked to me.  The deadlines and rules about word count are strict. I would never tell someone that the rules don't apply.  Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.  However, this does not have to influence your grade that much, if at all.  As long as you complete all 5 of papers in the course, this zero you got for going over word count will be replaced by the average of the other four papers.

While this would usually be fine, I had work a double shift one weekend, and didn't submit a paper, thinking it would be ok and that I would be fine to not submit one paper. Now this 0 is coming back to haunt me, and it is making it almost impossible to pass the course, I would have to get a perfect on every last quiz and paper just to get a mid range D. 

I went and spoke to him the next day, asking if there was any possible way I could receive credit for the paper, and explaining that without the paper grade it would be nearly impossible to pass the class. 

His responses was I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, the rules have to apply to everyone.

While I understand his sentiments, it's not as if I didn't submit the paper. I did the work. I submitted the paper on time. I studied the material and learned what I needed to write and do the paper obviously, but because I was 35 words over word count, I now cannot pass the class. 

Sadly enough, this is one of the last classes I need to graduate, and if I fail, I will not get my diploma. While it wouldn't necessarily be a huge deal, I could take another semester and retake the class, I sadly cannot afford to do that.

My question reddit, is what can I do from here? Where can I go? Who can I talk to? I've already spoken to my parents about the issue and they are supportive of me. I also spoke to my adviser who suggest I speak with the professor, which obviously didn't accomplish anything.

Is it fair to punish a student, possibly a lifetime punishment, for simply going 35 words over a word count? The point of school to me is to learn. I learned the material, and did what was asked as me, but because I slipped and missed a word count now I cannot graduate? I can understand losing a few points for going over word count, but to receive a 0 on a paper that I spent time and effort on is just ludicrous to me. I turned my assignment in on time. I was always taught that going above and beyond what was asked of you was how you got an A. 

Apparently, I was wrong. It's how you get an F. 

Also why would he tell me not to worry about it, if I should have been worrying this entire month?

Redditors, have you ever encountered something like this? What is my course of action here? I would really appreciate some advice, and some feedback, and I know this is a great place to look for it. 

I really appreciate all those who took the time out to read this.

tl:dr Got a 0 on a paper for going 35 words over word count, now can't graduate. Is this fair?"
r9f17,3,2012-03-22,Advantages for traditional over co-op path?,justforonce098765432,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/r9f17/advantages_for_traditional_over_coop_path/,"My first-year is almost at an end and we have to make a decision on what we are to major in.

My primary choice is Mechanical engineering co-op but since it's so popular the minimum GPA is unusually high (~3.1). Last semester I had 2.8 and this semester I've been trying my best to get that raised.

In case I don't make the minimum GPA, I am undecided between mechanical tradition and electrical co-op for my second choice.

I'm quite interested in electrical as I am somewhat interested in circuits, but I'm very interested in programming.

Anyways, I'm not entirely sure about the traditional path. I really want to gain engineering work experiences as much and as fast as possible. I know you can take internships but I'm not too familiar on how that works.

What do you guys think?

EDIT1: Also bonus question, are there engineering companies that hire first year students as interns? I live in Edmonton if that helps. I just want to do something productive this summer!"

I am a sophomore CE major at Johns Hopkins looking for something worthwhile to do this summer.  I already applied to a few REU programs (Research Experience for Undergraduates), but I was already turned down from one program.  Also, I think these programs are aimed towards students intending on going to graduate school, and I don't know if that's what I want to do.  I'm getting a little worried that I'm not going to be doing anything this summer (and taking classes instead).

I was wondering what I should be doing to increase my chances of getting hired/selected for an internship.  I feel that just putting my name and resume into these big job databases are not very helpful, and there may be something better I should be doing.

I have a pretty good GPA, but I haven't really had any hands-on experience, and I see these internships as a way to get hands-on experience.  What should I be doing?

Thanks reddit!"

Iam 19, will have my *highschool-like* degree in a year which i have to complete with an 12-month internship in a field i'd like to study. I will finish this on the beginning of '14 so i'll have to take another 6 month internship for the blank time. I love mathematics so for this side iam save

A few months ago i started researching about programming and development and started my first programming experience ever with a few days of qbasic and then took on C++, additionally i peaked into the very basics of html/css. Though, I did not invest the time i want to(especially on the web part), because i had a somewhat stressful time due to personal matters and due to lack of friends with the same interests.

Thus, in about 2 1/2 years iam attending a college and am currently intrested in Information Technology with focus on the practical part(programming, software dev, algorithms). The colleges here tend to use Java for projects(still c/c++ for the beginner phase).

I later want to do something in one or more of the following: web- / app- development, software development, scienctific computing, open source(?), research, side projects like games or sth.(still a wide field)

So my questions are

* What is an average work and offwork day for you as a Programmer/Developer?

* Do you have time doing things not directly job related(while or off work)? - learning other useful things(eg more programming languages), Doing sports, thinking of other things, seeing the world and stuff like that.

* is PHP programming a save/fun field?

* under what circumstances, how long, how intensive and at which age did you start and are you happy with ***what*** you do and what you ***get*** now?

* Should i stick to C++ until iam in college or should I already swap to Java? Or is it better to focus on math first?

I'm a senior in college and I've never been able to get hired for any sort of real position or internship. I only worked one job at a movie theater.

I work exceptionally hard on my school work, I've always taken challenging classes. I am excellent for my age in nearly every level of computers, it hardly even matters what I'm majoring in (database/programming type stuff) because I'm just as good everywhere else.

I take a lot of business classes: Group projects, speeches, and written essays. I am very talented in all of these. I don't have exactly the awkward personality a lot of my computer colleagues have yet I still have their skills.

I can't find any real way to convey this other than, to put in toddler words ""I did good in... Computers. I did good in... Business classes. I work hard"" (obviously I describe it a little better, but it doesn't show how superior I am to the average person)


I don't do any clubs or anything though. That is one area I suck at. But for good reason: I spend most of my free time studying psychoanalysis which I use as my own sort of counseling volunteer position. It's not technically official though, but I do have a bunch of diverse contacts who are 100% there to tell me how much I've changed their lives. It is a very large ""hobby"" of mine, complete with databases and actual ""sciency"" stuff. Can I market that somehow? 

I just don't know what to do; I apply to a bunch of jobs which is frustrating because they take like literally an hour each to go through their stupid website and filling out the information. Then I get an auto-rejected email or if I even make it to an interview, there's some asshole nuclear scientist who's applying for the level 1 internship position that gets the job instead of me and I end up with absolutely nothing to do all summer for work, and no money to do anything to build work skills.

rghrs,27,2012-03-27,Can you get an internship as a freshman in college: A Guide,LockeWatts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rghrs/can_you_get_an_internship_as_a_freshman_in/,"**Introduction:**  

Hi, I’m Locke. I’ve seen this question posted ~20 times, including once by myself, to /r/cscareerquestions over the last 6 months or so. As I have just gone through the entire process, I’m here to guide you along the way and answer questions about your wonderful exciting summer of sitting inside for 40 hours a week.  

**The answer (If you just want to know):**  

Possibly, but probably not. In a nut shell, this is just the truth of the matter. Read the actual guide if you want to know why.  

**The Story (My journey towards a summer internship):**  
If you don’t actually want to read about me, I’ll try to parse out the relevant bits into a summary at the bottom, but I find this kind of thing much easier to explain in context.  

I am a freshman at the University of Georgia, which unless you follow SEC football, you’ve probably never heard of. It’s a large research University located in Athens, GA. Our primary research is in binge drinking, but we’re also known for our biology and medical research, and occasionally something fun in our very small CS department (~200 students). I’m in the Honors program, pursuing a Bachelor’s\Master’s crossover, to get both degrees in four years. (Hooray for 37 hours of AP credit!)  

 I started my search early, in early October, looking everywhere I possibly could for internships. I crawled through all of my favorite big tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. etc.) and found a few promising gems. First, is the [Google Freshman Engineering Practicum]( http://www.google.com/jobs/engpracticum/fep/), which is exactly what it sounds like. A 10 week internship out in Mountain View, CA. Next was  the [Explore Microsoft](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/internships-explore-microsoft.aspx) program, which similarly was a 12 week internship in Redmond, WA. Well now I was all excited, between these two tech giants, and the fact that I’m very smart, there’s gotta be something cool there right? Well, we’ll see.  

From there, I looked for whatever resources I could. I leaned on my parents, aunts, and uncles to possibly find me internships at their companies, or with the companies of friends. I sat down and crawled through hundreds of job postings on sites like [Dice](http://www.dice.com) and [Monster](http://www.monster.com) looking for internship postings in my area. Don’t look outside your area, unless they’re a big tech company (See above), they won’t pay for you to relocate for the summer.  

I found some decent success through these sites, and sent out [resumes](http://i41.tinypic.com/69dsi9.jpg) to everyone. Note, the translation to a .jpg in that got a little weird. Please give employers your resume in pdf format. Also, complete props to a post a few months ago that I shamelessly stole this resume format from.  

From there, I turned to my last two avenues of discovery. These are the ones that I’m going to have the least to tell you about, as they’re specific to your university. Your University’s career fair, and your University’s job website. I checked my career fair, and looked for CS companies. Well, we don’t have any. Shit. What about large companies that have big IT departments? Well, there are a fair number of those. So I got in my suit (You MUST wear a suit to a career fair) and went and talked to one or two of them.  

And finally, my University’s job site.  This was a gold mine for me. You could narrow it down to major, type of job (Internship versus full time) and then just mass email resumes.  

So first thing, fellow programmer, to do is to do everything I just listed above. This will take you a while. And then once you do it, you’ll have to do it again. As a general rule, I checked the University job site once every few days, from October until now. That’s important, because new jobs get submitted as time goes on. I had personally thought the recruiting process started in the fall, but from what I’ve seen it actually picks up in the spring.  

Oh! I just remembered. Here’s something unscrupulous I’ve done. If around where you live has a big tech school that you don’t go to, piggy back on their recruiting process. It’s probably open to anyone online. For example, I used Georgia Tech’s website to look as well as my own.  

Okay, so. After I did all that, I had the following list of companies that I had submitted some kind of literature to:  

- Google  
- Microsoft  
- IBM  
- AT&amp;T  
- HP  
- Chick-Fil-A  
- Home Depot  
- Lockheed Martin  
- ThyssenKrupp IT Services, North America  
- Verizon Wireless  
- McKesson Provider Technologies  
- ADP (Automatic Data Processing)  
- Sybase  
- Windham Brannon  
- Macy’s  
- MedAssets  

Don’t be surprised if you don’t recognize every name on the list, I submitted a resume to literally every company within driving distance of my house. Here’s the response I got back from them all.  

- Google: No  
- Microsoft: No  
- IBM: No  
- AT&amp;T: Originally no, and then I got a call from a random HR manager in March  
- *HP: Phone interview*  
- Chick-Fil-A: No  
- *Home Depot: Phone interview*  
- Lockheed Martin: No  
- *ThyssenKrupp IT Services: Phone interview, in person interview*  
- Verizon Wireless: No  
- McKesson: No  
- ADP: No  
- *Sybase: Phone interview*  
- Windham Brannon: No  
- Macy’s: No  
- *MedAssets: Phone interview, in person interview*  

So, yeah. Lesson here is learn to accept rejection, you’ll get it a lot. Of the companies who responded to me (Which was only about half of the “no”s, the rest didn’t even bother), most said that they weren’t interested in a freshman intern. Doesn’t matter my skill set or programming ability, they simply aren’t interested.  

The reason the companies gave me for this is that most companies use their internships as recruitment programs. Nobody is thinking four years down the road as far as hiring new recruits. They want new developers after the summer you work for them. This fucking sucks, but is the truth of the matter.  

Now, as for the interview process itself. I won’t say I’m an expert on interviews. But I did go through 6 interviews of one sort or another for an internship, so I’ll fill you in on my experiences.  

As a general note of things that were covered in every interview so I don’t repeat myself:  

*General questions:*  

- Tell me about yourself. – This question sucks. I’m sorry, it just does. I would generally respond “That’s a rather broad question, do you mean academically, programmatically, personally…? I’m not really sure what you’re looking for.” Until I realized that they always meant programmatically. Tell them about your programming background. Mine went something like this:  

“Okay, I’m a 1st year at UGA in the Honors program, doing an accelerated Bachelor’s Master’s program to get both degrees in four years. I began programming when I was 12 doing basic scripting stuff relating to IRC chat rooms (Editor’s Note: Yes, I know that the C stands for “chat”. They generally don’t.), and then from there branched out into basic JavaScript and began being interested in computer security. From there beginning just before high school I branched out into Java and C++ to learn more object oriented programming, and began working on larger projects. Since then I’ve been working on becoming familiar with Python, C#, and Ruby.""  
 
Invariably, this leads to the next question which I know all of you don’t like:  

- Tell me about a project you’ve worked on in the past that you were particularly excited about doing.  

I’ll be honest right here. I have past projects to draw on. If you don’t, make it up. That is probably unethical, but if you can talk about a project like you have worked on it, even if it never got out of the design stages, it still shows the level of interest they’re looking for.  

Anyway, my answer would either be “Oh well I’m excited about the Android app I’m working on right now” or “Well I made this bot to sit in chat rooms in middle school that ended up being by number of lines by far my biggest project” and then I would elaborate.  

This is an important question. Not only will they gauge your programming ability by the depth of the project you worked on, but they’ll gauge your interest in programming in general and the work they do. If you can figure out what they do ahead of time and tailor your story to make it seem like you really like their work, all the better.  

Technical Questions:  

- The definition of inheritance - Every, single, interview. Both phone and in person. I found this easiest to elaborate by saying the definition, and then giving an example.  
- The definition of polymorphism – See above  
- Some keyword question (For HP it was C#’s “protected”, for MedAssets it was C++'s “struct”, etc). Know your terminology.   
- Some kind of database question (How do you sanitize SQL inputs, what are the advantages\disadvantages of using this kind of database, etc.)  
- Some kind of data structure question. Not the same as above. This would be like, tell me why you would use an array over a linked list, and vica versa.   

In interviews in general, you need to be relaxed. I know this can be hard, especially if you’ve never interviewed before. My general advice here would be to talk to other people about programming. Talk to people who know more than you. Talk to a professor, a grad student, a senior who's about to work at Google or whatever. Find someone, and just talk to them about code. The interview will more or less be no different.  

Surprisingly, in all of the interviews I only got asked a few actual programming questions where I had to write code. They didn’t want syntax perfect, but they wanted it to be more refined than pseudo code. I know everyone hates this, but I have to do it for tests too. It’s best to just memorize your basic syntax. The questions I had to do by hand were the following:  

- Here is a 12X12 multiplication table. Write a program to output this table.  
- Modify the program above to work with any size table.  
- Modify the problem above so that if the number is divisible by three, output “fizz” instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by five, output “buzz”. (This is the classic fizzbuzz problem).  
- Write a program to take in a string and reverse it.  
- Let’s say I have an arbitrarily large linked list. What would you do to check if someone had looped the list back on itself (Pointed one of the pointers to an earlier node).    

All of these except the last one shouldn’t be particularly challenging to a second semester CS student. I was honestly very surprised with how easy the programming challenges were.  

From there, you’ll either get a call saying we would like you to come on or we wouldn’t. To conclude my story, I did get an internship! I won’t say with who in case one of you wants to stalk me, but I’m very pleased with it.  

**Miscellaneous information you might want to know:**

- In my research into internships, I got a decent grasp of what interns get paid. In New York and California the internships I looked at were at $30/hour. Around here in Atlanta, I’m getting paid $15/hour, and another one I tried to get was $18/hour. So, definitely good money, and scales based on where you live.  

- The big tech companies are the only ones who pay for relocation, so look for something in your area. Nevertheless, it’s awesome they do that.  

- Internships are generally between eight and twelve weeks, depending on where they are, and not particularly accommodating to your schedule. I’ll end up only working about 3/4ths of my summer right now, due to when their internship block of the summer is. Oh well.  

And that’s all I got! If you have any other questions or if I’ve left out something big from this guide, please either post here or PM me! I’m happy to share whatever knowledge I have.

I'm a 24 year old male, unemployed, and living about 90mins south of a major city in a very small town.




**My education so far:**

I graduated from high school in 2007 and went to college for an IT based degree (finished 09/2011).



**My work history:**

In high school I worked landscaping and I taught guitar at a local music store (2004-2007). The owner I did landscaping with moved out of state in 06', and I had to stop teaching because of my college schedule. In 2008 I worked for a small business that ended up not having enough work to justify having a staff member, and several months later the business went under (I was there 2 months, 8 hours a week). 



**What I apply to:**

Ever since I started college I have been actively looking for some kind of work. I apply to every job under the sun; whether it is minimum wage, unpaid internships, or something in the IT field, I apply for it.

I've actually started keeping track of every job I apply to because I'm curious about the ratio of jobs to phone calls I'll receive (because applying online seems fruitless). From mid-February 2012 to this day I've filled out 317 applications and received 0 phone calls.

I have tried to use temp services but they have never offered me any work. Recruiters tell me I don't have enough experience (for the IT jobs) and they don't offer me any of the 'everyday' jobs because of my degree. I will work my ass off for any job offered to me, if I'm getting paid for something I'll put everything I have into it.

I would really like to move on with my life, but after nearly 4 years I really don't know what to do anymore. 

Can someone give me some advice?

I'm in need of some advice or recommended reading, software packages, experiences from anyone in the renewable energy industry, or anything that will help steer my self-study direction.

I have plenty of programming experience and a knack for mastering new concepts and technologies almost instantly.

I'm currently enrolled in a mechatronic engineering course. It's still fairly generic and easy to switch to a different stream, but I find that I have enough free time on my hands to do my own research or studying on the side anyway.

I wish to someday make a living by doing environmentally sound work that I love: it has to be interesting, require creative problem solving, and it absolutely must be a field that requires constant learning.

My questions are:

1. Which positions fit the above description that will be available for a fresh graduate in 4 years?
2. What should I read up on or know how to do in order to hit the ground running in the positions mentioned above?
3. How can I increase my chances of getting a relevant internship (or if I'm ridiculously lucky a bursary) after my first year of study?

I've got a pretty high overall GPA and a very high in major GPA, I'm involved in various CS related clubs on campus, and I've got an internship lined up at IBM for this summer possibly continuing on through the fall. Money is not an issue in terms of going to college 4 years instead of 3.

I'm torn on whether I should go ahead and get the masters, or move on from school and start real life. On the one hand I'm ready to stop going to school and start working and such. On the other hand I don't mind school, I like learning and I genuinely find what I'm learning in my CS classes very interesting. I'm also not a huge fan of writing, so the idea of a thesis is a little daunting, and I'm not even sure what topic I'd like to research. All I've really taken so far is the core CS classes. I'm taking all my CS electives the next two semesters, so I'm not sure what my specific interests are. I know I don't really care about game design, HCI, or other graphics oriented things. I find cyber security interesting, but I won't be able to take a course on it until another semester or two, so I don't really know for sure I'll actually like it. I also like general software development and like scientific computing, data mining, practical uses of computing, etc.

I guess my question really comes down to what do I really stand to gain from having a masters opposed to just a bachelors both in terms of interesting jobs and salary.

rh3rp,0,2012-03-28,"Reddit, I need legal advice. I want to sue my school.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rh3rp/reddit_i_need_legal_advice_i_want_to_sue_my_school/,"Before I begin, I want to state that I know legal advice on Reddit is not always good idea. I'm in a frustrated mindset, and I want opinions on my situation and whether I should look into a lawyer or not.

Background:
I've gone to a college for a long time (started in 2005). I took one year off to get my life priorities in order and come back (I'll admit, I slacked as a freshman). When I came back to school, I got into my major of choice and proceeded to kick ass and take names. I pulled my gpa up and started doing well.

Fast forward to the last year, I finished up every requirement except the internship. I was having problems finding one, and I really wanted to graduate. The internship program at my school strictly states that I need to complete my internship in the summertime, I had just moved to a new city and didn't find one until 1-2 weeks after the deadline. I tried contacting the school to find who to appeal to but no luck.

**Beginning of August** - I managed to get a hold of the dean of the department regarding my situation. I had found a temp-tern position and decided to write an appeal. I'm told that nothing can be done until the middle of September due to lack of staff. So I wait...

**October 15th** comes around and I received an email from the school saying I was being discontinued (I received no forewarning), I file for leave of absence and try to explain my situation. I contact the dean of the department again, and he lets me know that he wishes I would've contacted him sooner (I regret my delay, but I was very busy with moving/new job so I didn't notice my school email). He informs me to contact the new internship director regarding my situation.

I email the internship director, and am told that he will keep me posted as the department tries to find out a resolution for me. So I wait...

**November 11th** and I still had not heard a reply, so I send him an email asking for an update.

**November 14th** and I get an email saying he has not heard a decision yet, and will followup on this same day.

**December 1st** I'm hired into the company full time.

**December 6** - I email the dean asking for an update. Noting that the new internship director had not responded and I have since been hired.

**December 7** - I'm told he will look into the matter and let me know.

**December 18** - I ask for another update from the dean and get a response. He lets me know he that the new internship director has been contacted and will follow up with me.

**January 06** - The new director contacts me with a cryptic message saying ""the decision has not changed"". He recommends an appeal to the dean if I am not satisfied.

*At this point I feel like I'm being given the run-around.*

**January 9-12** I contact the dean again with an appeal. He once again refers me to the internship director. The internship director never gives me a clear answer so I get frustrated and mention that I should be forwarding all of this to the dean of the school. The internship director never responds. So I email the dean asking for another update (while apologizing for my frustrated remarks. Rereading my emails it's easy to see that I was angry when I sent a response to the director).

**January 13** - The dean lets me know he's looking into the issue and will get back to me. The internship director responds that they have worked out a plan and I need to sign up for spring term.

**January 29** - I get another notice that I'm going to be discontinued and will have to reapply if this is the case. I submit another leave of absence form and get approved.

**March 15** - My friend notifies me it's the end of the quarter. So I send the internship director an email asking for advice on the next steps.


**March 25** I send another email because I had received no response. I receive an email saying I have the go ahead to start the filling out the internship contracts and I need to follow the internship requirements.

**March 26th** I respond that I have spoken with HR and they've agreed to fill out paperwork for the past few months that they agreed to for the internship position (like they had said before). I forward this information to the internship director.

**March 27th** I receive another update saying I will have to start the internship over completely. 

*So I call the internship director*

I restate my situation... That I missed the internship by 1-2 weeks because I could not find one, submitted an appeal, was referred to him...
He states that because he was not in control at the time, he can't do anything and that I would need to restart the internship completely. I let him know that because the assignments are not through the employer, it would make more sense for me to have the employer fill out the necessary documents based on my 3 months as a temp-tern. Then he starts getting angry, he says ""If it was fully up to me, I would not let you in. If this was the business world I would fire you for not following up"".

I mention to him that I had tried following up but he had never responded to me. I had waited months at a time for a response, and that I had been given the most roundabout way of getting to a solution.

He continues with the rude comments about me being a slacker, how I'm unprofessional, and he wouldn't hire me because I've waited so long (He's increasingly rude at this point). I ask who I can speak to that's above him, but he doesn't give me any names. He simply states that he is the one to talk to.



So.... Reddit, I ask you for advice. I told my employer that I was finishing up my degree back in August when they first took me as a temp-tern. Now that I've been hired, I can't exactly go back to an intern position, and yet this is all I'm told to do. Even though I have already done all the hours and I'm sure my employer would be able to fill out accurate feedback of my time there.

Am I wrong for being slow to the game (yes). However, I do not feel that this sort of behavior from school officials should be tolerated. Especially when I've spent around $100,000 out of pocket to attend.

Please advise!

I have recently received offers, and reduced them down to 2 offers.

First one is from a startup company in Bay Area, that has unique products (virtualization &amp; Big Data area). They offer some good perks, benefits, but they lack 401(k) plan. Instead, they will give some stock options. The salary is less than 90k, which is comparably low with respect to the living cost in San Jose. But I am sure their product is quite unique and IPO of company will get you some money from options. The office isn't really great, but people in there seems to be  smart. A lot of masters, PhD people..

and the other one Amazon in Seattle (good benefits, bonuses and ok-salary in Seattle). Large cubicle offices, wet weather compare to San Jose. Amazon seems to be growing and expanding its coverage into various areas, like clouds and services.

This is going to be the first job that I will be having. I am looking for a career rather than switching job every year. I am thinking of going for Amazon, but I cannot decide for sure. Because I do not have any previous intern experiences nor have never lived in San Jose, and Seattle. 

Any recommendations for this choice?

Would it be helpful to build up my experiences in Amazon and then jump into Bay Area some day later? Or would it be better idea to risk little bit for startup and start my career in Bay Area?

riiuz,67,2012-03-28,I need a new place to stay,wtf_bot,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/riiuz/i_need_a_new_place_to_stay/,"I don’t know what really happened. I don’t know if I will ever be able to go back. I don’t know if I just have an over active imagination, but what I do know is there is a gash on my arm from whatever it was.

I had just started an internship with an engineering company in just outside of Detroit Michigan. I was more concerned about break-ins and muggings than anything when I moved into the rented room of the small white house in a very nice old gated community about fifteen minutes from the down town. I knew something was wrong when I asked my land lord why he was renting the house out. He said that his daughter wouldn’t stay there anymore. I didn’t want to ask anymore, because I assumed they were just fighting, and I am not the best at consoling people being a very quiet and shy guy.

I moved in about a week ago. The weather was great for March. The sun was shining and there was not a sign of snow anywhere. After I had set up my TV and settled into my room it seemed like things couldn’t get any better. I was out on my own in a nice house all by myself. I knew that my house mates wouldn’t be moving in for another week. I felt great, but then night came and the scrapping started.

I remember I was watching television and I didn’t really notice the sun setting and the darkness filling the room. I was dossing off when I first heard it, but the sound sure as hell woke me up. It was a scraping worse than nails on a chalk board. It was like a rusty blade slowly cutting through a human chalk board that was screaming out in pain.  The sound would persist for a second and then go away for just long enough to think it had gone away forever, but it always came back. 

As an engineer I tend to be a rational person, which is why I didn’t GTFO as soon as possible. Instead I searched around for what the sound could be. I looked out the window and saw nothing going on outside. I looked in the closet and around the room, but found nothing. That’s when I noticed that as I got closer to the radiator it got louder. I put my ear up close to the radiator and realized that the sound was resenting from it. I decided that I should check the boiler.

I am not the bravest of men, so I lit ever single light I could on my way to the basement. At the top of the landing I looked down. It was a dusty room with cement floors and what appeared to be a work bench all around the small room. The only light was a pull string bare bulb at the bottom of the landing. I could hear the sound grow as I opened the basement door, and I knew it was coming from down there. I took carful steps down the bare wood steps quietly listening to the screech when I saw what I am now convinced is a bench grinder and sparks flying from it every time there was a screech. I moved closer thinking that somehow it had turned on and a piece of metal was nocking agents it, but then I got a closer look at what was rubbing against the grinder.

It appeared to be a large machete floating in air and rubbing its self on the blade. Like some unseen person was sharpening his weapon. I thought my eyes must be playing a trick on me, so I slowly pulled the pull string for the light. Immediately I heard a loud raspy, “WHAT!” and saw the blade spin around as if the invisible holder turned to face me. I barely had time to react as the blade came towards me it swayed back and forth as it crossed the floor. My mind was telling me run, but my legs were frozen in fear. I was only able to move just as the blade was raised in the air. I had time to put my forearm in front of my face before the blade struck. I fell to the ground in a heap. I was frozen sprawled out on the ground blood gushing from the gash in my arm. I saw the machete lower like the invisible man was kneeling to take a look at his victim. I held my breath as I felt the warm air of the attacker on my neck as he surveyed his work. 

It stood up and I saw the blade bob up and down as it walked up the stairs. The door slammed and there was silence. I don’t know how long I lay there, but after what felt like hours I slowly lifted myself to my feet. I slowly crept up the step and poked my head slowly out of the door. All the lights I had turned on were out. The blade was resting on the kitchen counter with my blood still on it. I, still trying to be rational, crept out to try and grab the blade to make sense of it all. I had just put my hand on the blade when I heard the voice again, “How many fucking times do I have to tell you! THAT’S DADDY’S!” I ran as fast as I could out of there. 

Needless to say I need a new place to stay.

*COPIED OUT OF CREEPY PASTA FOR MORE VIEWS THERE*


Red Mist is a controversial real-life bootleg tape featuring an unaired episode of Spongebob Squarepants. Like the long-lost but recently discovered ""Suicide Mouse"" tape, Red Mist was purportedly created by a now imprisoned Scottish animator for the series who intended to pass the tape off as the season four premiere episode and featured the death of Squidward.

DESCRIPTION OF TAPE
*warning tape is desturbing*
     Red Mist begins with Squidward preparing to practice his clarinet in his room as Spongebob and Patrick play merrily outside. Squidward wraps his mouth around the clarinet and is only able to play one note before being interrupted by someone knocking on the door. He walks down and opens the door and discovers that a traveling salesman is at his door. The salesman, a Scottish fish, asks if he could have a moment of Squidward's time. Squidward tells him that he isn't interested and slams the door in the man's face, walking back to his room. The salesman begins knocking again, and Squidward opens the door angrily. The salesman, looking very upset, tells Squidward that ""the red mist is coming"" and precedes to walk off, confusing Squidward. Squidward walks back to his room and finally begins playing the clarinet. After performing several off-key notes, Spongebob and Patrick begin laughing outside, interrupting Squidward yet again. Squidward walks over to the window and shouts at the two, telling them he needs to practice for a concert he will be performing at. Spongebob and Patrick apologize with tears in their eyes and walk back to their houses. Squidward, unsure of himself, walks back over and begins playing his clarinet again, this time uninterrupted. The scene then fades to red over the course of twelve seconds.

     Perhaps by glitch, the same scene is repeated once more which is somewhat common in rough cuts of animation. However, this time, the eyes have been replaced with new, more realistic eyes with red pupils, clearly not real but more realistic than CGI or animated. The audio is also completely absent from this scene, save for occasional clicks. 

After the repeat of the previous scene, a new scene begins with the same red eyes, but at the theater where Squidward is playing his clarinet. The frames in the animation skip every four seconds, but the sound remains synced. After an unruly performance of a song he dubbed ""Red Mist"", Spongebob and Patrick are seen in the crowd booing Squidward, very uncommon for them. The scene pans to reveal the same Scottish salesman sitting next to them, also booing, as Squidward walks back to his home with his head in his tentacles. What's odd is that the scene actually shows him walking to his house, with nothing happening in the background, for three minutes and fifty seconds before abruptly cutting to red for another twenty seconds, just as he arrives at his house. 

A new scene appears, back to the original cartoon eyes, with Squidward sitting in a chair in his room that night, with a blank look on his face for roughly thirty seconds before starting to sob softly. Again, the audio is completely missing for most of the scene, until the sobbing begins. This is when the sound of a slight

breeze through a forest can be heard in the background. It also begins very mildly zooming in on Squidward's face, only noticeable if you compare ten seconds of frames side by side. The sound of him sobbing can suddenly be heard, very loudly and severe as the screen twitches in on itself briefly. The salesman's laughing can also be heard echoing in the background.

After another thirty seconds, the screen blurs and twitches violently and a single frame flashes over the screen. Upon pausing it exactly on the frame, the viewer can see a real-life photo of a deceased six year-old boy laying in the forest in his underwear, whose face has been mangled, eye has been popped, and stomach cut open with entrails laying beside him. Next to him, the shadow of the photographer is clearly visible with part of the photographer's hand appearing to the right of the screen. 

After this photograph is seen, it cuts back to Squidward sobbing, much louder than before with what appears to be blood running from his eyes instead of tears and the sound of the salesman still heard. The sound of the wind in the forest is also played at a much louder volume, but now with the sound of branches snapping and the screams of a young boy heard. After twenty more seconds, another single frame appears, this time of an eight year-old girl in the forest laying on her stomach in a pool of blood, with her back cut open and entrails piled on top. The shadow of the photographer is also visible. 

The scene reverts back to Squidward, now with the same realistic red eyes from before, completely silent and no longer sobbing. The sound of the forest can no longer be heard. Another three seconds later and it cuts back to the sobbing, this time piercing loud and with the sound of the forest heard. The screams of both a young boy and young girl can be heard mixed together as the song ""Amazing Grace"" plays on both the clarinet and the
bagpipes. During this, seven frames are seen in black and white of the boy from the first photograph laying in the woods. Over the course of the seven frames, the hand of the photographer reaches in and grabs the boy's entrails, as his remaining eye focuses on the man's hand and even blinks once. 

This cuts back to Squidward again, this time staring at the viewer as the sound of the salesman echoes ""DO IT"" and ""the red mist is coming"" repeatedly. After forty seconds of this, the camera quickly pans out to reveal Squidward holding a realistic gun, looking as though it were Photoshopped into the scene. Squidward lifts the barrel into his mouth and fires, with blood shooting out from his head and then the screen cut to static. 

DELIVERY OF THE TAPE
On November 7, 2004, after the initial animation of the storyboards were completed in Fife, Scotland, the tape was delivered to the lead animators and sound editors at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, California during the middle of the night. The tape was taken into the editing room where it was watched by said animators and editors, as well as two sixteen year-old interns. The tape, which was supposed to feature the rough cut of ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"", instead began with a title card using the name ""Red Mist"". While thrown off at first, the animators continued watching, discovering the tape had been heavily tampered with as some sort of cruel joke. 

As a result, three animators (Barry O'Neill, Grant Kirkland, Jr. and Alyssa Simpson) were sent to the hospital, one editor retired (Fernando de la Peña) and one intern (Jackie McMullen) committed suicide. The tape was sent to the police, who determined that it had been made by Andrew Skinner, a disgruntled animator from Fife, Scotland, who has since been charged with nine counts of murder, including the murder of the two children seen in the tape. Oddly enough, after going through the data on the VHS, police discovered that the last edit to the tape had been made exactly twenty four seconds before it was watched by the Spongebob staff.

One copy of the tape was made (before police confiscated the original) by Chaz Agnew, writer of this article and the sole surviving intern from that night. Agnew has made various attempts to distribute copies of Skinner's tape and hopes to secure clearance rights to release it on several online auction websites soon.

rlce9,3,2012-03-30,Need career advice for civil engineering graduate,need_advice25,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rlce9/need_career_advice_for_civil_engineering_graduate/,"Background:    I’ve been looking to start my career since fall of ’09 when I graduated from a big 10 school with a degree in civil engineering.  I couldn’t find a job then so I took an energy engineering internship just to gain some experience.  I was hired full time but laid off about a month later (4.5 months total).  I again could not seem to find a structural or civil position.  I went back to take a semester of graduate courses ($7000 out of pocket) and applied to grad school.  I did not get into grad school but finished the semester with a 3.43 gpa.  I have volunteered in the community and been waiting tables through all of this to build my resume and keep ahead financially.  I am also EIT certified, was pretty involved in 3 student groups in college and have always been working part time.  I’ve had people edit and look over my resumes and cover letters.  I’ve even done an informational interview or two.  

Today I was rejected for a bridge engineering internship where the interview had gone very well.  I’m at the end of my rope.  I can’t even get an internship and I don’t know what else to do.  I am looking for advice from people in the industry.  What program do I need to have experience in to get hired?  Am I able to sign up for DOT seminars and possibly get certifications from them?  Is it just a matter of persistence (I’ve applied for maybe 50 positions total)?  Any advice or uplifting words would be greatly appreciated. I am feeling pretty rejected and useless right now.

rla5p,0,2012-03-30,Civil Engineer ----&gt; Software Developer,triple654,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rla5p/civil_engineer_software_developer/,"**Apologies for the length of my post, [the process of writing everything down has helped me think things through](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html) anyway, will be extremely grateful for any kind of advice**

I am a recent graduate from a Civil Engineering (MEng) course from a University in London (based there as well); 

Prior to university I didn't know anything about code or the process behind programming, as soon I was introduced to my first programming module (simple mathsy stuff in MATLAB), I realised that I liked solving problems computationally and would work a lot harder on these modules than on anything else. If I had had enough confidence in my decisions I would have tried to change to a Comp Sci course but I persisted and completed my MEng in Civil, however I always picked modules and my dissertation theme on the more computational side of things.

Since a lot of my fellow students (and I assume to some extent the industry) were really averse to programming; I thought I would find a niche as being a more computationally inclined Civil Engineer; however I soon realised I was totally uninspired by a lot of what you would call the ""bread and butter"" of Civil Engineering, so I never really sought out to involve myself with anything that would further a career in Civil Engineering, even my dissertation was more about bio mechanics.

In my last year of uni, I ended up helping a designer friend code some actionScript for a Flash Website Uni project and I started doing the programming for his web design clients. This then lead me to an internship with a small digital marketing company; initially for a general job. I then immediately found away of saving them money by custom building a lot of web applications they were paying for monthly and in the process learning new, more useful web languages; javascript, php, ruby, sql .. etc. 

They then hired me full time, for a very basic wage,  to create them a suite of web apps they could sell to their customers (much of the suite being my own ideas as to what their customers would want); So I did this in about 6 months, it turned out to be popular among their clients, opening up a completely new revenue stream for them. 

But i decided to leave because a) I didn't want to be the only technical guy in a non-technical company and b) even though i was very grateful that they allowed me to trial my own ideas and learn a lot in the process, I didn't really agree in their business model (it relied heavily on using ""social media"") and c) I had never planned for this to be a long-term commitment and I wasn't particularly happy there. They convinced me to stay on as a ""freelance consultant"" while I looked for another job.     

Up to recently I was convinced I would try to get graduate programs in Engineering or Consultancy or even Finance (*shudder*) but I was seriously uninspired until I had a revelation and realised that at every career/university choice I had always elected to do something where I could code to solve a problem. So why not try to go into Software Development or something similar?

So my questions are: 

How much does it matter if I don't have a Comp Sci degree when applying to serious software/technology jobs? 
Based on what limited experience I have would I ever be seriously considered?
What is the best way to demonstrate (or even find out if I have) ability in this area? 

**tl;dr: Graduated from a Civil Engineering Masters, want to become a professional software developer.. am I crazy?.. any advice?**   "

[Hey Kevin! Just a couple of questions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rk4y6/hello_redditland_i_am_kevin_pereira_amaeafch/c46gtx1?context=5)|I fell in love with the BBS community at a very early age. Naturally, that lead to a fascination with the early internet. The ability to interact with people outside of my small town was too compelling. When I was twelve, I had my own Internet Service Provider and gobs of bandwidth -- so I launched a small radio show (you kids call 'em PODCASTS these days :) and that snowballed into a video show...

Realizing that I really just needed to get home, I hail a taxi to get me back to my porn.

Well, we're like a block away from my dorm when I go into my wallet...and I don't have any cash (or if I did it was nowhere near enough to expect him to be willing to call it even). I attempted to explain my predicament to the taxi driver, and I offered that I would have no problem resolving the problem by having him take me to an ATM so that I could pay him. Basically trying to make it clear that this was an honest fuck-up on my part and that I did not have any intention of stiffing him.

His response was basically to start screaming at me to get out of the taxi, and it was pretty clear he thought I was trying to stiff him. Which I guess being a taxi driver in the GWU/Georgetown part of town he probably gets often enough from drunk college kids (and I'm sure it didn't help that we were going to the GWU dorm I was staying in), but I can't really say that I feel bad or as if I otherwise ripped him off.

Basically considering that I was trying to make it *very* clear that I had every intention of paying, that the lack of cash was an honest goof (I guess credit card readers like in NYC or Chicago would be too much to ask considering that DC only recently got off the ""zone"" system for taxis--if you never dealt with it it was basically the ""rape the tourists' wallets"" system), and that I wanted to go get cash right then and there to fix the problem...at that point I can't feel guilty about what is basically his refusal to take my money.

Hopefully some of you have more interesting stories. :p

The position I was applying for is IT Technician. According to their website, they have 7 different store locations in Chicago. The store in which I had the interview at was just a really old building, with computer parts everywhere in the back of the shop and some computer products on the storefront. The interview was incredibly easy; it wasn't even like a real interview. He asked if I have at least some basic knowledge about computer (like installing programs and replacing computer screen), then he proceed to said that I should be qualified base on my education background (I am a civil engineer). He said that they will provide training for 2-3 months, depending on how fast I learn. During this internship period, I will only get paid $500 for the first month, $800 the second month, and $1200 the third month. Also, I am to work full time. Afterward I pass the training, I will get paid about $2000 per month. He offered me the job right on the spot, which I thought was just way too easy. I am wary about this whole situation.

How much knowledge on the topic is enough to have a decent understanding of it? I was just taken aback by how much there is on it. I thought it was a single computer program like Powerpoint or something, and it seems like a whole field of study almost.

rkc8z,0,2012-03-29,How do front-end engineers stack up?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rkc8z/how_do_frontend_engineers_stack_up/,"Hey everyone,

I've got a bunch of questions about front-end [web] engineering.

**Background:**

I started making simple websites when I was ten. When I was twelve, I started learning HTML/CSS. For a while, I made static websites and concentrated a lot on learning design, since I originally wanted to be a web designer. Eventually, I realized that I was much more of a programmer than a designer, so I chose computer science as my major when I started college.

**Now**

I'm now finishing up my junior year of college. Computer science is awesome, and I've learned a whole lot, especially about web development. I had two jobs last summer doing web development, and I've participated in a bunch of hackathons. I've also been the webmaster of a few organizations here at my school. Because of my experience Photoshopping and web designing, my friends usually ask me to be the front-end developer in projects that I'm involved in. In my group of friends, I'm know as ""the front-end guy."" However, I consider myself an ""end-to-end"" web developer, since I'm just as comfortable with the back-ends of websites. It just so happens that I'm the best front-end developer out of my group of friends, so that's what I get stuck doing most of the time.

As of now, I've *literally* applied for thirty summer internships. Out of those, I've either been denied or ignored by at least 23 of them (waiting on the rest). These applications were all for software engineering internship positions. I'm definitely not dumb, and while my GPA isn't stellar (3.35, mostly due to one bad semester freshman year), it's not the worst in the world.

I've been interviewing with one company recently for a front-end engineering position, and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to get it. It's going to deal a lot with data visualization in JavaScript, which I think would be cool (and the company is awesome), but it still bothers me that there's a chance that my only offer for this summer will be for a front-end position.

**Questions**

1. Do I have any reason to feel like front-end engineering isn't as prestigious/difficult as other types software engineering?
2. Will taking a front-end engineering internship ruin my chances at becoming a non-front-end software engineer later in life, even if most of my job will consist of data visualization (as opposed to putting divs in the right spots)?
3. On average, is a front-end engineer as valuable as a non-front-end software engineer?
4. In your experience, how do front-end engineers stack up against other software engineers in terms of programming ability? (I have this strange feeling that people consider front-end engineers not much better than designers at programming).
5. I admit that I've had a few bad interviews, but I've also had some pretty good ones. My friends and I are amazed that I've been denied from so many places. Is there a good chance that I haven't received another internship offer because companies think that someone who's worked so much on the front-end doesn't have the skill to work behind the scenes?

Thanks,
Gerard

tl;dr - Do people think I'm a sucky developer because of my experience doing front-end web development?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[1)  Why are you hosted by GoDaddy if you are so against SOPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)|There will also be much lower turnout in a runoff. Romney cannot secure enough delegates before our May 29th Primary to ensure that he's the nominee, which means that Texas will still be in play. Lamar Smith has endorsed Romney and has a home in MA, where rumor has it he spends more time than here in Texas. Romney appears to be the front-runner down here, and people who would vote for Romney are probably more likely to vote for Smith than for either Mack or myself. In a runoff, however, there will be much lower turnout, and no one will be voting for the President anymore, making it much more likely that our guys will turnout, not Smith's. Also, our voters are motivated and will turnout twice, while Smith's voters will vote for him largely due to his universal name ID and the fact that they've voted for him for decades. Something else is with two of us, we can cover twice as much ground. Our district is quite large. It includes San Antonio, Austin, and a whole lot of countryside. Mack lives in the countryside, and I'm hoping he can lock up those votes. Meanwhile, I'm in Austin, and I'm focusing here. I haven't seen Mack at a single event, so if he's working as hard as I am, that means we're covering twice as much ground together as either of us would alone. I'm more worried about my supporters getting confused when they see two Richard's than I am about us splitting the anti-Lamar Smith vote.
[2) Are you worried about 2 'Richard M.'s splitting the anti-Lamar Smith vote? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)| 
[3) How do you respond to these comments about why we shouldn't take you seriously, namely that ""Richard Morgan is NOT a candidate to take seriously. He's someone looking to cash in on splitting the vote. He has similar positions to Lamar while not being Lamar.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvkt?context=5)|2) I don't see it so much as splitting the anti-Smith vote, rather I see it as giving the anti-Smith voters two alternatives. There are people who will prefer Mack, and there are people who will prefer me. By giving people two options, there is a better chance that they will vote for one of us, rather than reluctantly voting for Smith if they disagreed with either of us on important issues to them. Incumbents are more likely to die in office than to lose a Primary. The best way to beat Smith is in a runoff, not in the Primary. To force a runoff, we need to get a combined 50% + 1 vote. If that happens, whichever two candidates received the most votes will go into a runoff.  3) I have some things in common with Smith and some things in common with Mack. Again, it gives voters two choices, and I believe I'm a safer choice. Mack has a following here, but he also has lots of people who will never vote for him. Ever. If things have appeared a little disorganized or rushed, it's because I was the last to enter the race, and both of my opponents have been preparing a lot longer. The first several weeks were hectic, but now that I have a framework and some volunteers in place, things are settling down.  4) [It seems like you filed for your candidacy at the last possible minute.

 |Rather than get into a debate about why or why not, I would just leave it at this. As an engineer, the universe seems more like the result of a brilliant creator / designer than the result of chance.
 |I knew it wouldn't be a popular answer here, but I find it somewhat disappointing that a simple, honest answer regarding my personal beliefs on one issue would cause so many people to write off everything else. This is why politicians pander.
 |I'd also like to point out that I believe all three of us (Smith, Mack, and myself) running in the Primary share the same view on this question. There are many other areas where we disagree.

(edit, added question27)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ptd7?context=5)|This is a long one. I've got to run some errands, but I'll answer this soon.
[What is your opinion of the War on Drugs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o5ij?context=5)|In my opinion, I think it's bad policy, and I believe history will judge us for it. We should have learned from Prohibition. My opponent has a record of refusing to hear bills he disagrees with, and I disagree with him for that. Rather than block Ron Paul's bill for consideration, he should have let it come up for a much-overdue debate. Let all the facts come out, and then let our Representatives vote. And to those who support the War on Drugs, I think it's important to point out that ending the federal prohibition is not the same as ending all regulation. It's simply returning that authority to the states so that they can each regulate it as they see fit.
[This was a typical political answer. I know you think it's bad policy, and that we should at least debate/discuss the issue, but I want to know how do *you* feel about the war on drugs?   Do you think it has been a complete failure?   Do you think drugs should be legalized, if not at the very least, marijuana?  Is this a criminal issue? Health issue? Moral issue? Individual rights issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46p7dq?context=5)|A) Pretty much. b) I think we should decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. c) It's a matter of rights. It's not the federal government's role.
[*refusing to hear bills he disagrees with.*  Some people ignore evidence they don't agree with. Sound familiar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46qt92?context=5)|There's a big difference between disagreeing and refusing to allow the conversation.
[*It's not the federal government's role.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tta8?context=5)|I think there's a big difference between prescription drug safety and the Department of Justice [shutting down an Amish farm for selling fresh milk](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/13/feds-shut-down-amish-farm-selling-fresh-milk/print/). I oppose the latter.
[So, you would probably go the next step and stay the fed. has no rule in food safety or prescription drug safety, yes? Say a state had a long standing record of letting either of these items enter the market in a contaminated state... well tough nookies, yes?  The market will figure it out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tta8?context=5)|I also have a big problem with school officials [taking away a child's home packed lunch due to USDA guidelines](http://www.carolinajournal.com/exclusives/display_exclusive.html?id=8762).
[What direction do you think the Internet is headed if these bills were to pass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nckt?context=5)|Congress as a whole is taking us in the direction of China / Iran / Egypt, what with censorship, tracking of online activity, a recent internet killswitch proposal, prior proposals to ban encryption, etc. These two bills were terrible, but they're part of a bigger trend that undermines our freedom. IMO, it's not enough just to push back on these bills. We need to reverse the trend and write bills (with extensive feedback from the tech community) to limit the government's reach and require them to get a warrant before reading our emails, tracking us through our cell phones, etc. I'll verify in just a minute.
[Also, verification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nckt?context=5)|Verification added.
[But isn't one of the problems with the bills that they are proposed under the pretense of another goal? You're right that ""congress as a whole"" is doing this, but do you have any specific plans for a paradigm shift regarding these shady strategies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ogt2?context=5)|Yes, but that's a problem with lots of bills, not just technology-related bills. We need to write smaller bills. We need more debate. We need to write bills that focus on one thing. We need to make sure we use very specific language in the bills rather than leave things vague. We need more transparency. The general public should be able to see the bills with plenty of time to provide feedback, and we need people who will listen.
[Can you please elaborate on a few other issues/views that are fundamentally different than Mr. Smith?  SOPA / PCIP is an important issue, but there are others I would like to hear your views on as well. Anything else that really sets you apart from him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nvbi?context=5)|I'm against the NDAA vs he voted for it. I'm against HR 347 vs he voted for it. I'm against the Patriot Act vs he voted for it. I'm against No Child Left behind vs he voted for it.
 |In short, I see Mr. Smith as a big-government Republican, and I see myself as a limited-government conservative. I'm very concerned about all the rights the government has been taking away from us, and I'm against bureaucracy.
[In your opinion, why is congress so adamant in censoring the internet without any regard of the damage they can cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nmdd?context=5)|I don't think they really understand the impact these bills would have. Let's look at their backgrounds--you have 181 businessmen, 172 political science majors, 148 lawyers... and 6 engineers. Senator Wyden and Congressman Issa were two of the strongest voices against SOPA, and they both come from science backgrounds.
[Would you accept donations from corporations to lobby for their interests? If not, do you reasonably think you stand any chance to make a difference? If yes, aren't you doing the same Lamar does, only for different interst groups?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o4wo?context=5)|There is a big difference between accepting contributions vs letting those contributions influence decision-making. I've already pledged not to keep more than 60% of the salary, so hopefully it's clear already that money is not what motivates me.
 |I did not come from a rich family, and I've worked 80 hours a week since I was 14 between my job and school. 7-8 years ago, I was counting pennies so that I could buy myself a Whopper at the end of each week. At 19, I had a great job. At 23, I bought a great house. At 24, I got promoted to senior front-end developer--the only senior developer under 30. With each success came a temporary satisfaction but a greater feeling of disappointment.
 |I realized a couple years ago that money didn't satisfy me. I'd reached my financial goals and was well on track to my goal of an early retirement and freedom, but I didn't want to spend the next 20 years going through the motions. I spent a few months overseas doing volunteer work, where I witnessed the effects of government corruption and after coming back I began to get involved in politics. That's my passion. I like fighting for the things I believe in. If people want to donate so that I can keep doing what I'm doing, then I think that's great, but money is not going to change what I believe in.
[As someone coming from engineering who is running against a man who is hated for his stance on internet bills, your campaign so far seems to have a laser focus.  How do you compare to Lamar Smith on other issues important to your district that do not relate to internet freedoms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46nhwo?context=5)|According to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, 25% of payroll in the Austin are related to tech jobs, so I think it's important to point out that my technology background is more than simply opposing SOPA. It's about fighting to make sure policy doesn't get written that hurts these startups. I was watching C-SPAN the other day when the crowdfunding provision in the JOBS Act was being debated. I noticed that Senator Merkley from Oregon kept talking about the potential for predators to take advantage of investors if crowdfunding sites weren't regulated. Here were some of the thoughts that came to mind that I didn't hear anyone mention: - Crowdfunding platforms have an incentive to prevent fraud, because if their investors get burned, they'll stop using that platform (in favor of a better platform that has more features or less fraud). I truly believe competition works. - If registering with the SEC would actually solve all problems, then wouldn't companies choose to do so voluntarily? - Engineers and tech startups have more or less solved spam. Can't we at least be given a chance to solve this on our own?
[Realistically, what are your chances of beating this guy?  He's been in office nearly 25 years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o27u?context=5)|I think the chances are fairly good. Most people I've talked to have no idea how many things he's voted for that they disagree with. The biggest challenge is spreading the word and informing people. Once they hear, most will vote against him.
[How much of an impact do you think the offshoring of sofware dev has had, and will have in the future on the us and other western countries? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46neey?context=5)|Certainly offshoring has had an impact, and I expect that trend to continue, especially as companies start taking advantage of video conferencing so that executives feel like they can keep an eye on overseas offices. Still, good programmers will always have jobs, and the need for good programmers is growing faster than we're producing them. From the reports I've seen, and from my first-hand experience and talking with other programmers, there are no shortage of jobs for good programmers. (If you've seen differently, come to Texas.)
 |As the need for programmers continues to grow, I suspect a shortage of programmers here might motivate employers to move those jobs overseas, and I would support this strategy of bringing skilled workers here so that they could contribute to our economy, rather than sending our jobs to them: [Link to www.ktvb.com](http://www.ktvb.com/news/Congressman-introduces-bill-to-fill-high-tech-jobs-131894928.html)
[I'm a consultant working in Austin. What can I do to help you run/win against Lamar Smith? This is a cause I'd definitely volunteer time and effort for.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o3i7?context=5)|Please email me at richard@richardmorgan.com. I'd love to get coffee sometime and get you connected with the rest of my volunteers. There's a lot to do.
[Newly arrived in Austin, I really had no idea Lamar Smith was [mis]representing me. I have sent you an email requesting details.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ol5y?context=5)|Thank you--I'll send you more information soon.
[You're gonna get a heck of a lot more mail once you get in office, on a daily basis, especially if some controversial bill comes up, than what reddit is throwing at you today. ;)  Oh, on the Link to thomas.loc.go site, if you do a search, there's no ""permalink"" button on any of the pages. This means I have to search twice, once to find a bill, and again using the ""browse by bill number"" method, to get a link I can share that won't expire. For some pages, I can't even find any method which will give me a permanent link. As a software engineer, what will you do to fix this (or get someone else to fix it)?  Why does Link to gis1.tlc.state.tx.us have at least 36 districts listed when Link to www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us says there are only 32 congressional districts? How many congressional districts are there? Is there something less confusing one could use to find out who their Representative is? With the district changes, does one vote based on their old district, or the new one they're in? Does an incumbent's district number change, or just the boundaries of the district they're in?  Are there any congressmen currently in office who you think are doing a good job, and why? Besides Lamar, which congressmen do you think should not get another term, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46v3rh?context=5)|I think technology can do a lot to make Congress more efficient and responsive into the 21st century. I would like to see a better tool where people can collaborate and offer suggestions. I would also like to start groups around certain issues where people who care about various issues can get regular updates. I've had my own frustrations with thomas.loc.gov, so send me suggestions, and I'll do what I can.  I respect Darrell Issa a lot. I also like what I've seen of Jason Chaffetz. I would be willing to replace most incumbents. There are relatively few who I think have done an outstanding job. I dislike incumbents that appeal to fear and urgency rather than holding a rational dialog.
 |Texas had 32 districts until the recent census when 4 new districts were added due to our population growth. Some incumbents chang district numbers, but Lamar Smith has filed in district 21 again.
[What college did you go to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46rnen?context=5)|1) I went to Dallas Baptist University. I was hired there when I was 17 and took night classes while working during the day after a semester at community college.
[What was your degree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46rnen?context=5)|2) I studied Computer Science and took a number of business / marketing classes.
[What was your college GPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46rnen?context=5)|3) I raised my GPA from a 3.5 my first semester to a 3.7, while working full-time.
[What companies have you worked at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46rnen?context=5)|4) I've worked full-time at Dallas Baptist University, Heritage Auctions, and SoftLayer (via TEK Systems). Before that I did contract work for a number of small companies. I had an internship writing PHP for ECHO Inc. (now owned by Intuit) when I was 14.
[How many direct reports have you had to supervise on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46rnen?context=5)|5) I'm more of a programmer than a manager. I've led projects rather than people.
[Tell me, do you hate to see smith?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46om2l?context=5)|I have a debate with him on April 11th, and I'm very much looking forward to it.
[How do you explain your late entry to this race? Why didn't you get started earlier when HR1981 and SOPA were first getting attention? (not Jan. 18, but earlier in 2011)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tiid?context=5)|I had a job, and I was active on a couple other campaigns, so I hadn't planned to run against him till I realized he didn't have a challenger. I explored for several weeks, during which time I found out Mack was also exploring, so another factor was whether I thought Mack could win. Another challenge is I didn't know where the final district map would be till the week before the filing deadline. If I had filed several months ago, I have no doubt we would have raised TONS of money during the SOPA debate.
[Where did you get the money for your registration fee? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tiid?context=5)|I paid the filing fee myself because I felt this was something I needed to do.
[Why are you aiming for congress this early on? Why not a local office where you can build up a reputation and track record?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46tiid?context=5)|It's funny that most people dislike career politicians, and yet most people also suggest running for smaller offices first. I've been very active in politics behind the scenes, and the people I've worked with know where I stand. SOPA is a big enough issue that I think I'm the best candidate for this race. If I hadn't decided to run for this, I would still be working behind the scenes on another congressional race.
[What else motivates you to run besides SOPA/PIPA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46ua4x?context=5)|Out of control spending, high taxes, entitlement programs that need to be improved, the fact that our generation is inheriting some major issues, and we don't even have a say.
[Is there no one else running against Smith?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46qf4n?context=5)|Not in the Primary.

[Do Lamar Smith's religious beliefs have anything to do with your campaign against him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46wesv?context=5)|They don't. I'm running against him because of his record.

[As a member of District 21, it's pretty hard to see how anyone can take it from Smith. The voting majority are old, rich as fuck, and either don't care or support SOPA. No offense, but my 'twice or three times as old as me' neighbors are laughing at you for running. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46p95f?context=5)|I have support from people of all ages. There are always skeptics, but overall it's been a great response.
[What is your stance on abortion, we had another guy recently who thought the day after pill was the same as killing an infant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46o4z5?context=5)|I'm pro-life, but I would say there is a difference between preventing a pregnancy vs ending a pregnancy.
[If the dem primary is uncontested, I recommend registering as a republican so that you are able to vote in the primary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46r9lf?context=5)|Actually, any registered voter is eligible to vote in either Primary.

PHP is my day job. Python is better structured. Ruby just isn't me. Erlang and Scala are both on my study list.
[TL;DR: I hate SOPA/PIPA but I am just like Smith and Mack. Texas=takes ass.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rkyav/i_am_richard_morgan_the_software_engineer_running/c46vli0?context=5)|I'm a Republican, so certainly there are areas where I agree with Smith, but I disagree with him entirely on other issues such as SOPA, PCIP, HR 347, NDAA, No Child Left Behind, etc.

[I'm going to get A LOT of hate for this, but I feel like he's using SOPA as a way to get into a higher position in life, it's a common thing to do, but just because he's against SOPA/PIPA, doesn't mean he should become senator.

rlq6g,124,2012-03-30,The worst part is that nobody will ever believe you.,23523,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rlq6g/the_worst_part_is_that_nobody_will_ever_believe/,"Thank you everybody. After [I poured out my soul yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rjilx/just_going_home_after_work/) and saw all your responses and realised that maybe people understand I felt much better. I hope it will be the same today, because things did not exactly turn out for the better. I wrote a few replies during my work day. So you might have read those already and you guys gave me a few things to think about. Things didn't go upwards from there but somehow I am more composed today. For the last maybe two or three hours the hair on my back is standing up straight, I am tense as seldom before, and I am scared to a level I can't even describe. But I know now that I'm not insane, I know that something is happening and maybe its the adrenaline that's pumping through my blood, but my head, now, it seems clear. All day I couldn't concentrate on my work at all, I just thought about the last evening and the events, and my mind kept going back to that moment that seems to have shaken my whole belief system in its foundations. I don't believe in anything supernatural but I definitely know now that I'm not crazy. Although everybody else thinks that now.

It all got worse when my boss came into the office. He was supposed to be out all day on some sort of conference but he cut it short because he said too many people called in sick. I'm actually fairly close to him. I know him from a few years before I started here, he is the one who got me the job. That somehow allows me to talk with him on a level of equals and to ask questions and say things that others here wouldn't dare. I guess for people not close to him he is a bit intimidating because of his big frame and the way he doesn't blink much. But there is something else about our long connection that is worth mentioning here: He also is willing to share things with me. He lets his guard down while usually he maintains his authority. 

When he called me into his office I thought he had noticed how poorly I worked today, maybe even that I checked on reddit every hour or so, hoping for somebody to give me a clue what might have happened or for somebody to tell me they experienced similar things. When he called me in I thought he would send me home or tell me to get my act together. I didn't expect him to say ""I need to ask you something"". And even less did I expect him to say ""I think something weird is going on"". He told me how in the last weeks people had been calling in sick at a higher rate than usually. To call in sick, you must know, the policy here is to call your supervisor directly. Since he is responsible for quite a few of us and is close to some other managers he is fairly well informed about what's going on and shares a lot with the other managers. But, he said, this is something I need to keep silent about, that he didn't want to talk about this with anyone else. It's just because he values my opinion and knows how rational I usually am, that's why he wanted to talk to me. I guess he too wanted to make sure that he wasn't going crazy.

""You know"", he said, ""you know how Esteban called in sick last month?"" I nodded, so he continued: ""that's when I noticed it first"". I asked him what he meant and instead of answering he just said ""please, don't think I'm crazy. I don't need you to believe me, I'm just trying to understand if it's me or if it's something else. Maybe I'm thinking too much into this"". I let out a half-hearted laugh and said of course I knew he wasn't crazy. If anything I must be the more crazy one of us, I thought. By this point, you know, i already had seen [horrorfangirls reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rjilx/just_going_home_after_work/c46lcc8) to my post from yesterday. I was certain the handle was on open and that the security guard had commented on it. So I knew that either I must be completely insane and hallucinating the whole thing - but then, why am I not waking out of this - or, there must be.. something.

My boss, Paul, sighed and spoke on. ""It's when Esteban called in sick. That's when I noticed. You know how he is, even when there would be a sword in his chest he would still be making jokes. This guy can't be serious, he always is cheerful and happy and joking."" I nodded and felt how I tensed. Paul got visibly more nervous. ""It was when he called.. I'm not sure how to say it. It was his voice. It was monotonous. And he didn't make any jokes. I mean, I don't expect people to be happy or to make jokes when they call in sick, but he was just.. off. His voice didn't sound strange, it was definitely him, but he was so damn monotonous. I know company policy doesn't allow me to speak about health issues, that's a private thing. But I just need to say it, you know, he didn't really give a reason. He just said 'Hello Paul. It's me, Esteban. I will be sick for a while.' I asked him why and without even a moment hesitation - there was no 'uuh' or even a small pause - he just said 'I will be sick for a while'. That's all he said. I asked again and he repeated the same sentence again when I asked a second time, you know, it's not that he needed to tell me, but I thought he trusts me and would have told me what it was"".

I wanted to reply that that was indeed strange and that it was odd and that I wouldn't have expected that but I didn't have time. Paul got impatient, he talked quicker, visibly more shaken: ""And you know, the same with Grace. I wouldn't really expect her to be emotional or tell me her issues, you know how withdrawn she is. But she called in only two or three days later, only two damn days later, and I had nearly forgotten about the thing with Esteban, I had sorted out his replacement and I had nearly forgotten, but then Grace called and all she said was 'Hello Paul, It's me, Grace. I will be sick for a while'. I nearly fell off my chair. The *exact* same words. And, worse, the same voice. Of course, no, it was her voice, not the same voice. But it was the same style of speaking, it was as if she was completely without emotion. I didn't even have time to ask anything, she just said it again, 'I will be sick for a while'. And then she did hang up."" Where Paul had nearly fallen off his chair, I had just turned to stone. I could just feel how every single cell in my body had frozen, how the only thing rushing through my body were hormones of fear. You know, the fight or flight instinct. It's not that Paul did anything. And I didn't see anything. But I felt terror so deep inside me it was in my bones. And Paul had not even finished.

""And since then, as you know, they both didn't come back to work. I tried calling both of them a few times, but neither answered the landline or their mobiles or even their emails, hell I even tried facebook."" I was gasping at this point, I remember Pauls words as clear as anything can be, but what I said I don't remember. It must have been something soothing, something where I tried to excuse what happened, play it down, as I usually would, but it must not have come out right. Paul just snapped ""Oh come on, I'm not a child. I don't need you to tell me it will all clear itself out. Actually, I don't want you to, because I know its a lie. I know, because three other people called in sick. The two guys from the far end table, you know, the ones who always stick with themselves. They called in sick last week Thursday, around 10pm. They left me messages on my voicemail. Identical messages. Messages identical not just to each other, but to the freaking two I told you above."" I think at this point my heart skipped a beat. And Paul who I had known for several years as maybe the most rational, the most calm person I knew, went on, and I could hear a slight panic in his voice: ""But today. Today was the kicker. Have you seen Martha today?"" I thought for a moment, my mind moving as slow as seldom before, as if my brain was working at a quarter of its normal speed. I thought of Martha, the pretty polish girl who sat in the office opposite of mine. Sometimes she distracted my from my work, not by saying anything, but just by being there. How could I ever not realise she was missing. But today, I tried to think back, did she say her usual smiling ""good morning""? No, I don't think so. She didn't ask my office whether we'd join them for lunch either. I must have been so upset, so sleep deprived and exhausted and mentally restless from last night that I didn't even notice she was missing. I realised how out of my usual self I must have been. ""No"" I said. ""No, I certainly didn't"". ""I would have been surprised"", Paul said, ""because she called me. It's maybe twenty minutes ago."" He was silent and I knew his answer already but I still asked, I don't know why I asked, maybe it would have been better not to hear it. ""She said 'Hi Paul, it's Martha. I will be sick for a while'"". He added with a weak voice ""that's all she said"". As if I didn't know that already.

We both just sat there, quietly. I have no idea how long we sat there, literally staring at each other, both looking in the other's eye. We were both trying to find any hint that the other had an answer. There was no need to ask the question, it was obvious. It was impossible and yet it was obvious. And Paul didn't even know my story yet.

After what seemed like ages I somehow got out of this mode, I shaked my head slightly and just opened my mouth to say ""I have to tell you something too"", when he jumped up, abruptly, he must have hit his legs against his wooden desk, I heard the sound, but he didn't even seem to notice. ""Let's go"", he said. ""Let's get out of here"", and before I could get out of my frozen state he had already pulled me up and out of his office and he shouted along the corridor with half-open offices ""guys, everybody, we make it a short Friday, let's get home"". There was some quiet cheering but people mostly seemed confused. It's not as if we didn't take short Fridays, occasionally, just usually he would send us a note at least the day before. I think it's because he didn't want to be alone either, but we both just stood there, smiling awkwardly, probably drenched in sweat and smelling of this slightly sweet and bitter odour you can only smell when a person fears for their life. Pretty much everyone was ready to leave within less than two minutes, like people in most offices on most Fridays they had just just been sitting and wasting time while  waiting for the clock to jump to the right number. Just two or three were slower, the group of us, maybe 9 in total, including Paul and me, we started walking and I could hear the others rushing to catch up with us after a few moments.

Somebody, I think it was Thomas, asked whether Paul already told the rest of the team, on the other floor. Paul just wiped it away with a ""yeah, sure"". I don't think he was even listening. Finally being able, to get the courage and strength to tell his story to someone must have made him feel it and see it in a different light, must have made him see it in the extreme, in the clarity and in the whole awkward and scary whole of it - just like I experienced it yesterday. Telling your story is cathartic, I always knew that, but I never realised until then that telling a story also makes you feel the story, makes you experience the things, in your mind, as if they just happened. It was less than a second after Paul had answered, that this feeling hit me, came back to me, this feeling or.. this moment, this moment of Cecile being pulled off my shoulder. It's when I noticed in which direction we walked.

I froze on the spot. I froze, and I must have turned even more pale and even more cold than i had been all day. It didn't take long for someone to notice, it was the new intern, he had just started two weeks ago, and he was one of those two or three who were a bit slower. I guess he must have been searching something in his bag or so, because he walked straight into me, just hit his head at the back of my left shoulder. I don't remember if I really felt it, but I woke up from my daze in that moment and of course everyone turned around when they heard the distinct bone-on-bone sound of him walking into me. They stared at me while I opened and closed my jaw helplessly a few times, without any sound coming out, it was like my tongue was doing something independent from my lips and jaw and lungs. Paul said, sternly and rudely ""I said let's get out of here"". I guess the rudeness took everyone by surprise since they didn't know *why* we left early. They must have assumed it was because he was in a really good mood or maybe a birthday or maybe he was a bit sick and just wanted to get home early himself. I could see the surprise glances flying between the others, the intern behind me squeezed out a muffled ""sorry, sorry Mark"". I don't know what Paul and I looked like, I just stared at his face, and he at mine, both of us pale and even to the others the dread in our eyes must have been obvious. ""No.. no.. not the elevators."" I pressed out. ""P.. please"".

Paul was having none of it. ""I said we get out"". He spoke but to me it sounded like he was screaming, shouting, like he *wanted* to shout. He grabbed my arm and forcefully dragged me along, my voice failed me again, I tried to speak, say something, but there was nothing I could do, the rest, obviously stunned, fell behind for a few moments, for a few moments, exactly until Paul barked ""Go"". One word was enough, the situation was so tense - and none of them could have known why - the situation was so tense, just from these few moments, these raw emotions that obviously must have shaken two adult men into the most unusual behaviour they - we - had ever shown. I tried to pull back, but my feet kept walking while Paul kept pulling my arm, he must have been hurting me but I didn't feel it, all I could think of was that there is one single place I did not want to be, one single place that I knew was now the wrong place to be.

It didn't take long, I guess, I can't really find the following moments from my memory. What I remember though is the moment the finger touched the button. I'm not sure who's finger it was, I didn't look a the finger, it's the button I stared at because I knew what it meant. Just a moment later an elevator opened - on the left side, in the middle. It had been standing there. ""At least it's not *that* one"" I thought, or I guess I must have thought it, because somehow now I was pulling forward. I knew there was no way out of this, no way out of this except to tell everyone the whole story, and I knew, I just knew, after our odd behaviour that everyone would just think I was insane in that very moment. Paul and I got in first. Someone, probably Thomas as well, suggested that the rest of them would wait there for the next elevator - we really must have scared them. But Paul ordered them in, and, in a weird mix of hesitation and hurry, they all came in. The elevator nearly closed the last two out but something got in front of the sensor - maybe someone stretched out their hand? - and the door opened again and they came in.

The new intern - I really should know his name by now - pressed the button for the ground floor and probably was surprised when Paul just pushed it as well, as if he didn't notice the intern's finger. Me just standing next to him, right at the wall, far away from the center of the elevator, far away from the emergency exit. Especially the intern must have been surprised when Paul kept pushing the button again and again and again and again, quickly, one time after the other, faster and faster, as if pushing it more would somehow make the elevator speed up.

We moved downwards, with the typical clonking sound you hear when the elevator starts its journey, and I could feel the tension in the small cabin, I could feel how our bodies were churning out stress hormones at an unhealthy rate, how our hearts were all beating twice as fast as normal. How everybody, even as they didn't know anything that Paul knew, much less even, what I knew, just had one thought, one goal: To get out. You know this moment of fear, when you don't want to think, do, say anything - you just want to run? That is, and I'm not doubting that for a second, that is what every one of us felt. That's what every one of us felt - when it happened.

Exactly the same loud, screeching sound of metal scraping metal. The sudden, hard stop. All lights went out.

That's when I broke. I'm not sure if I heard the small metallic sound that I had heard the day before, the sound that had burned itself in my brain like none ever before, the sound that I associated with whatever it was that had taken Cecile. I'm not sure if I heard that sound, among all the other noise, but I guess I must have. Or maybe I just reacted to the situation, to the night with barely any sleep, to the day that I was ruminating and worrying, to the accumulated tension that had kept me awake until then against my exhaustion and fear.

That moment my brain turned itself off, I became something else, something purely emotional, something primal. My lungs - not me, my lungs - let out a roar, a scream, a sound that was a mix of anger and hate and even more anger while my fist, already cold from terror, clenched hard. I was screaming as never before while my arm hammered my hand hard against the glass mirror on the wall, I could feel how I was pushing against the metal frame of the elevator behind it, how glass pieces were cutting through my skin and flying all over the room. There was no light but I felt as if I could see, I simply knew where everyone was, I could feel, I could *see* the expressions of fear on my colleagues' faces, I could see how Paul jumped back, probably right onto the intern, but, mainly, most importantly, away from me. I was jumping up and screaming at the top of my lungs ""LEAVE ME ALONE. LEAVE ME ALONG, HAVEN'T I SUFFERED ENOUGH?!!?"" My fists must have kept hammering against the mirrors and walls, I must have kept screaming, but all I can remember from then on is how I felt, how my insides were boiling with a mix of terror and rage, how every muscle, every fibre, every cell of my body awoke in just one moment, how I jumped up so strongly that my elbow hit the ceiling and how I came back down with a loud, crunching sound that shaked the whole elevator. It fell. It moved. The elevator moved, fell, I should say, because from the hazy blurr that I remember I remember feeling this special feeling, you know when you are on an airplane, and suddenly the floor seems to fall down, away from your feet, and then it takes just a fraction of a second for you to follow, but you feel it, I felt it. That didn't stop me, of course, I kept screaming, I can't remember breathing in at all, all I did was I threw all the air that was inside me, together with all the tension and anger from a day of pure terror, I was pressing all this out, trying to throw it at whatever it was, at whatever this thing was that had terrorised me, that had taken Cecile, that must have taken the others. I was never before so alive and at the same time so not in myself, I wasn't me, just this primal being full of anger and terror. I didn't notice the lights turning on, I don't remember seeing and I don't remember not seeing either. I just knew where everything was in that dreadful room, I knew where it all was, even when I saw that now it was not just the reflection of my face that was full of terror, but also the faces of my coworkers, all of us covered in shards and cuts and with skin that looked as if someone had drained the colour out of the world. The difference being that I was scared of *that*, but they were scared of *me*.

Maybe I screamed until we arrived downstairs, the ground floor, safety, until the doors started to open and until my bloody and snow-white hands pushed between the opening door. I basically ripped it open, just with that one goal of getting out, just with that one goal of getting *away*, of running, of running as far as I could, of running until my breath would fail me.

Someone was following me and I knew it was Paul, it was not just that I knew he was a great runner, and that I could, when the fog from my mind slowly cleared, hear the regularity of his steps that only a trained runner has. I knew it was Paul because I knew that he would have been the only one able to move, the only one who knew enough, who could understand enough, to be able to run after me when I sped out of that elevator, when I jumped the security gate and pushed the guard aside and ran against the exit door so hard that it flew to the side against the frame of bulletproof glass.

I knew it was Paul, and when I realised that I finally noticed my body again. It hit me heavy how tired, no, exhausted to the maximum, my body was. I started to feel the first cold air of the evening flying past me. I started to feel the pain of my feet, then my hands, stinging with pain. My muscles, they must have been cramping for a while. I have no idea about how long, but I ran at least two miles, in a straight line, I must have crossed busy streets and walked past pedestrians but I have no recollection of that at all. I just slowed down, like a runner ending his race behind the finish line. I tried slowing down to a walk, when I felt my knees giving in, when I fell backwards, on my hurting hand that stung again in pain, but at least it kept me sitting until Paul moved my back against a car.

I might have blacked out for a moment, or maybe I just don't remember. You know, our brains can't really process too many things at once, and when there is too much coming in your brain just shuts down for a moment, resetting itself to be able to function. I remember being next to Paul, both of us breathing hard, my chest hurting, if from the screaming or the running or something else, I have no idea. But I felt the catharsis. The terror had left me, I would have laughed if I had had the energy for it. We sat for a while, people walked by but I didn't even look up to see who they were or how they would react to us, two well-dressed men, sitting there full of shards and blood and pale as snow and breathing with deep gasps. I could feel Pauls head falling on my shoulder and I knew he didn't care either. 

It took us a while to get back up. Paul supported me, my right foot felt - feels - like something is cutting deep inside my flesh, like some broken bone. But we didn't care about a doctor or a hospital. We just needed to get somewhere with a Whiskey and silence and privacy. We didn't even talk about that, I guess we just both knew the other wanted the same. We got a taxi, Paul did it, I couldn't even think straight, I could only feel, could only try and process all this emotion that was now, slowly, fading away. I could feel my body calming down, very slowly, my heart pumping hard to refill the energy reserves of my muscles and cells.

I told him, tonight, I told Paul everything. I told him what happened, with the elevator, with Cecile, with writing on here and how you made me realise I wasn't crazy. We cried while we sat in his apartment, talking, getting it all out, emptying our hearts with all the fear and terror we had felt. I realise that he probably had been worse off then me. It was the unknown that scared me so much, the not understanding - and he had it seen building up for weeks. He said I should write it off my soul, to go back to here and share my story - and he would do the same with his diary. Writing helps, he said, it gets your thoughts in order. It helps to process the things that happened, it helps to put your memories in order. Paul got a call from two or three of our colleagues, I don't think he answered. What would he tell them? That I am insane, he would have to say. That a harmless broken elevator was what triggered some sort of insanity from all those hours of overtime I've been doing, a mental breakdown, a burnout from work and party and worry and lack of sleep.

And, I guess, that's what we will say. I would like to tell them my story. I like my colleagues, they are good people. And I would like to warn them, in case this.. whatever it is.. is still there. We escaped from something, but I don't know how or why. I would like to tell my colleagues what happened, tell them, warn them, and I really want them to understand me, I don't want them to be scared of me or worried about me.

But I know I have only two options: either I will plead insanity, temporary insanity - that I had a breakdown from all the stress, and when the elevator stopped it just triggered it. IfI say that they might have pity and they might forget that I covered them in shards and someday they might be able to sit in the same room with me again. Or I could tell them what I told you. I could tell them what happened. And then they would certainly never again believe even for a moment that I could be sane. They would laugh, awkwardly and dismiss what happened today as nothing, or, more exactly, as just me being crazy. They would live their lives as if nothing happened, just with one person less in it.. and I fear then something will happen to them. I will tell them it was just a breakdown, because if someone is only insane for a moment, then you will always have a small grain of doubt. You will always think that maybe, after all, this person that was always normal and is now normal again, you will think that maybe in that moment he wasn't insane, that maybe there is something true about it. At least then I can hope that they will be careful. 

I know yesterday many of you pushed me to do this. I will try to find some sort of authorities that I can talk to, that I can forward this text with a few more details about the place and people involved, so that they can send someone who knows how to deal with.. strange things. There is something, I know it with certainty. But I know I can only tell them anonymously, because, simply, I know no one will believe me and I don't want to end up in an asylum. Now, while reflecting on it, I realise this may be the hardest part. For the next weeks, months, years, maybe my whole life I will have to pretend nothing happened. I will meet thousands of people, maybe someday I will marry and raise kids. And I realise now that the scariest, hardest, most impossible part, the worst part about experiencing something unbelievable, about what I experienced the last two days - the worst part is that nobody will ever believe you."
