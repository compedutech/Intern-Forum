Just wanted to get an outside perspective I guess.  
Happy New Year btw ü•≥

Demographics: Asian Female, URM, first generation 
Low income school (doesn‚Äôt have the best rep in my community) 

SAT I: Took it twice, first time 1410, second time 1520 (760 Math and English) 

No other standardized tests because wasn‚Äôt planning to apply to selective schools until last minute  

UW/W GPA and Rank: 
Weighted 4.3 ish 
Unweighted 4.0 
At the college 3.9  

Ranks isn‚Äôt as clearly defined at my school,       but I would guess top 1% (I am doing full time classes at my local community college, so who knows how that plays in) 

Coursework: I took three AP classes from Freshmen to Sophomore Year (Studio Art, Bio, World History) and passed all of the tests with a 3 or 4. All honor classes 
 
NOTE- a ‚Äúfull time‚Äù duel enrollment student is one taking at least three classes at the college level

Junior year, started taking 3 classes at my local cc (runs on quarter system) to obtain an Associates in Biology. The degree consists of a  3 course sequence of both Chem and Bio, plus other standard courses (English, Humanities, etc etc). Was still taking an anatomy class and online Japanese at my hs. 

Senior year, still full time at the college working towards an associates and taking AP Calc BC. I‚Äôve also been taking a lot of language classes for electives (ASL, Spanish, Chinese) because outside of bio, learning about culture is one of my passions 

Projected coursework for the reminder of the school year
-Chinese I
-Last two Chem classes in the sequence 
-Last Bio class in the sequence 
-AP Calc BC
-Humanities
-Medical Terminology


Awards:
-AP Scholar 
-Gold Medalist in State Engineering Comp (went on to nationals but... not worth talking about lol) 
-Honor Roll at community college
-Academic Excellence Award in Bio and Social Studies at my school


Extracurriculars: 
-work at family business at least 6 hours every day after class and on weekend (since freshmen year; wrote my Coalition about the challenges of doing so)
-VP of Skills USA (joined junior year) 
-President National Honors Society 
-Key Club (minimal involvement)
-Youth Group (counselor in training)
-International Peer Mentoring (since Senior year, work with exchange students at my cc, one of my most meaningful ec)
-Varsity Tennis (joined as freshmen) 
-MESA at cc (stem club) 
-summer internship at urgent care and pathology lab 

Most of my time is focused on my family/home situation and being a leader to my younger siblings, which I talked about in my interview 
 

Essays/LORs/Other:

Essays 8/10 - my responses to the supplements included a lot of references to my cultural background and interest in the medical field, but were pretty light hearted and quirky. Looking back, they were fun to write but I don‚Äôt think it was my best work, especially the intellectual vitality essay

First Teacher LOR 10/10 - asked my AP world history teacher, who tbh, adores me. I still talk to her despite not being at the high school and was the top student at the time of taking her class.

Second Teacher LOR 7/10 - didn‚Äôt get to read it, but asked anatomy teacher, who was written one for me before. We weren‚Äôt that close, though I enjoyed her class and preformed well 

Counselor LOR 9/10 - asked career counselor who has written multiple LORs for me before. Knows a lot about my personal circumstances and involvement in community, so I think she touched a lot on my leadership qualities 

Interview 8/10 - Interviewer said that I reminded her of herself as a child. Made her laugh a few times despite being nervous out of my mind. Practically bared my soul to her. I think it went decently well."

Second, I am still in school and graduate 2020 so I am working full time and going to school part time. My degree is in IT, Network Operations and Security.

Third, I got offered an opportunity to join google's IT residency program. However, it wouldn't be until I finish my degree. So roughly 2021.

Fourth, my long term goal is to find my way into a devops/SRE position within the next 5 years.

I was the only support engineer for a while but they are bringing on two more people and offered me a promotion. However, it's even more work and really not enough money at all. I have decided that I want to stay long enough to train the new guys and my own replacment and then bounce. It has been incredibly difficult to finish this last semester with the work hours and stress. Past 6 months I have had to work 60+ hours a week and I am burnt out.

 There are a few different scenarios that I am considering. I am really interested in the google ITRP which is basically what I do now but at google and would lead to a possible SRE job at google after 26 months. However, it is not set in stone I might fail the last interview and it's a year away. But if I have a really good shot at it I don't want to start another job where I will just be leaving in the next 6 months or so.

I am considering a few different options.

1. Stay at my current company until August/September and save up some money. Quit and focus on finishing my degree by December of 2020 and my interview with google. If things don't work out with google I can get a job somewhere else. I am currently applying for positions and will contiue to do so throughout the year just to gauge salaries and see whats out there.
2. Quit my job in March/April and get a summer intership. I would like to get a dev internship to brush up on my coding skills and maybe add one or two projects to my resume. The area I live in there are a lot of decent paying SWE internships and some other technical ones. I think it would be fun to have something temporary and project based. The internships would end around September time frame. Plus if my interview doesn't go well with google then I maybe have a foot in the door somewhere else.

Either way I want to quit my job and move on. I also do want like a two month break. I have money saved up now and can save another 5-10k in the next two or three months. I just need some time to focus on my studies and my mental health. I feel like I work really hard at my job but everyday more problems come up and then when I can't help someone or fix a problem I feel like a failure. I am absolutely drowning and I have tried really hard to make things better but either things get denied or I don't have the time. The company culture is toxic, abusive, and manipulative."

**demographics:** female/gender non-conforming, bi, half indian (as in the country) and half white, upper middle class, WA state. both parents are grads of tufts, dad has law degree from upenn.

for 9-10th grade i went to a massive public high school (700 or so in my class); in 11-12 i'm at a small private school that was started last year by a highly renowned private school in my state. i'll graduate with a class of 14.

**intended major(s):** poli sci, history, intl relations, human rights/justice, humanitarian/intl law, etc.

i want to pursue grad school and a phd. 

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** ACT 35 composite (took it once, 31 math, 36 all others lol)

i haven't taken the SAT and will not but i got a 1420 on the PSAT. will probably take some subject tests in the spring.

**gpa/rank:** school doesn't report GPA or rank, but i'm a mostly A, sometimes B student.

**coursework:** current school doesn't offer ap's or honors, but our courses are rigorous and engaging.

9th grade: honors english, honors world history, algebra 2 (2 years ahead of common core), band, chemistry, honors spanish 2

10th grade: honors english, ap european history (5), pre-calculus, band, ap environmental science (4), honors spanish 3

11th grade (new school): english, state history, spanish 4, calculus, biology

**awards:** honestly? not any that i know of, at least not yet. what could i put here?

**extracurriculars:** recreational, select, and premier soccer (9th, some 10th grade before i was forced to quit by medical issues - will elaborate more later)

concert/marching band (9th, 10th grade)

volunteer @ collectively owned bookstore in city (10th, 11th, 12th grade) for 3 hrs a week

volunteer @ local food bank (10th, 11th, 12th grade) - probably 50 hours so far?

volunteer @ homeless shelters (11th, 12th grade) - i just started this, but am hoping to be really engaged in it and will look to get as many hours as i can. i'm also working on getting more engaged with the homeless community in my city. probably will be 150+ hrs (could be a lot more)

tutored two kids in math for a semester (10th) as their parents had medical issues

taking some MOOCs in diplomacy and intl development, will be taking more! (11th, maybe 12th) i took an online class on the global context of 9/11 in the summer of 2019 too

model UN, school newspaper, started a podcast abt current events (11th, 12th grade)

currently i'm waiting to see if i get an interview for an internship at an international relations organization in the city.

**essays:** i haven't started them bc i'm still an early junior lol but i'm a decent writer and think they'll be pretty good.

**LORs:** will be good. i'm in a class of 14 so my teachers/head of school know me well and will probably write me good recs!

**other:** i've been diagnosed w depression and anxiety. in 9th grade it wasn't great, but in 10th grade i was diagnosed w anorexia and kind of lost it (physically and mentally). i was in recovery from november-august 2019, and am still working on it but essentially recovered now! (thank god lmfao). it took a lot of time and energy away from me hence why i don't have that many engaging ec's for 9th/10th grade. it's a big reason why i switched schools. i'll probably write about this in my apps just so schools know.

**schools:** top schools - columbia (probably will apply ED), barnard, brown, georgetown, pomona

other interests: wellesley, yale

all of these are super selective lmfao so if u have any ideas for safeties/likelies....let me know because i need them. thanks!"

eihv8z,7,2020-01-01,Questions regarding Fachhochschulen,Loodyeyes,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/eihv8z/questions_regarding_fachhochschulen/,"Hallo zusammen, I'm an international trying to get into a CS-related masters program in Germany. I'm currently in the phase of getting my paperwork ready and choosing which universities I will be applying to.  I'm having a hard time getting through some misconceptions that I have, regardless of what I read on the internet. I wanted to ask you guys some questions regarding Fachhochschulen and hopefully get some insight. Before the questions I want you to know that I have never been to Germany before, I am quite ignorant on how exactly is the education system there. Of course I have done my research but I still feel like my grasp is fairly shallow.   


1. How true is the statement ""Fachhochschulen are not viewed as inferior to Universit√§t, they are just focused more on practical stuff.""? I have heard this a lot and it makes sense since most schools in Germany are government funded afaik, but for example where I live, the equivalent of fachhochschule is where students who have had weaker academic performance go. This is because the general consensus is ""Higher education is where you lay the foundation with learning the theory behind your discipline, you can always build practical knowledge through internships, working, building projects in which you will need to use your theoretical knowledge."" That is why having a FH-equivalent diploma in my country gives a weird impression. Isn't it even slightly the same in Germany? Is it common for top students to choose FH over Uni? 
2. What should my criterias be when choosing a FH to apply to? They are not featured much on ranking websites, where can I get information on their quality of education? If they are more or less the same, would choosing city over school be a good approach? 

Thank you for your time."

I'm currently a junior studying Computer Engineering at a top 20 CS school in the US. So last semester I spent the entire semester applying to internships the following way:

I mostly went to Linkedin and applied to internships. I applied to \~250 internships and have gotten probably 6-7 coding challenges in total. Out of those in 2 I got emails saying that I did really well and that they wanted to schedule a phone interview with me, but recently I got emails from both companies that they fulfilled their internship positions.

Another story is that during summer I got approached by a Microsoft recruiter, and after doing on-campus interviews and getting to the final rounds this Fall, I did not end up getting the internship position.

Currently I've been applying to internships but I'm not seeing the same success I was during Fall, in fact I've only gotten rejection emails. This has lead me to believe that there's something wrong with my resume, but after putting several posts in this subreddit, I did not get any feedback, and after getting my resumes reviewed by some friends and my University's career services I got positive feedback.

At this point, my only guess is that the way I'm applying to internships is ineffective, or that I need to improve my resume somehow, since I keep hearing about the importance of networking and I don't even understand what people mean by ""networking"". For those of you that got internships for this upcoming summer, is there anything different that you did that made you successful on your internship search?

If you read all of this, thank you very much for taking your time to do it, I'm currently lost and every bit of feedback is appreciated, thank you again.

P.S: I'm doing a web development course on Udemy that also teaches React since I've been seeing that a lot of jobs look for experience in this technology, so I figured that learning this skill will make me more desirable as an intern.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated this Summer and started working at the place where I got an internship. I don't see myself lasting very long in that company.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't know what field would interest me and am unsure how to tackle this problem. I believe the field isn't very important, as long as I can find a great working environment and good conditions (which I don't think I have at the moment). A little bit about me : Before being a programmer, I was a teacher. The main reason why I switched career was because of the instability of teaching (Not many permanent positions).

&amp;#x200B;

Some friends suggested I apply at their companies because they offer more benefits, better working environments, etc. In most cases, their companies use different languages/technologies. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys/girls do when you are looking for a job? 

* Do you find a job that requires mostly what you already know? (IE : My company works with PHP, fullstack, SQL...). 
* Or are you willing to learn new languages/tools in hope of getitng an interview in another company? (IE : One of my best friend works in a company that uses Microsoft's tools : Visual Studio, .NET , etc. I have little experience in .NET). 

Obviously, I don't plan on quitting before finding something else (unless it becomes unbearable).

I graduated from my local technical college this past May with an associate's degree in Network Systems Management. Since then, I have been trying to break into the IT field with a help desk or tech support job with no luck. I've had a few interviews, but nothing panned out. 

I'm the only one in my class still without an IT job, and I think it's mostly because of a lack of work experience. I couldn't afford to take an internship due to my family size and financial obligations.

My wife has a business license because she's an artist and needs one to vend at the local farmer's market. She told me I could put down that I've done tech support for her for the past four years, which, technically, I have. She does all of her business stuff from her laptop at home, so when something goes wrong, I am the one to fix it.

I'm wondering if I should put this on my resume. Would employers see it as being dishonest or dismiss it as not being applicable for help desk/tech support?

Until now I've been applying unsuccessfully for apprenticeships but soon I will be over the age limit for funding, so I need to switch tactics.

Some background:  


* I'm willing to relocate anywhere, however my options are probably limited to the UK as I only speak English (also Brexit).
* I will work for any company, in any position, for any salary (including unpaid) - so long as it involves writing code in some form, not only web design
* I only have a Diploma of Higher Education (equivalent to 2 years of a bachelors) in AI &amp; Computer Science
* I only have retail work experience (latest position as a supervisor)
* I'm currently working on a personal website / blog - primarily to showcase my projects (as none of them are finished enough to release, but are substantive enough to be talked about) and partly as a demonstration of my graphic design / HTML / CSS / Ruby / Rails ability
* I'm most proficient with Haskell, followed by Java (I transitioned from C# so .NET wouldn't be much of a stretch). I have some experience with C/C++, JS (but no frameworks), Ruby (Rails), and Erlang.
* My CV could use some work as its still really more suited to a retail job: [https://i.imgur.com/v8UyLYJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/v8UyLYJ.png), I'd appreciate any criticism
* I have a video CV which I think best shows off what work I have done: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD8Wz8x5w7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD8Wz8x5w7o), again criticism is appreciated
* I have an unpaid internship writing VB for a small company, lined up for January, however there is no prospect of a job with that company.

I'm basically looking for a year's experience. I can survive for a year on any salary - I'm betting everything on it being a little easier to find a better paid job with some relevant experience.

Then, came the final round with two software engineers. I answered both of their questions correctly, and they said they were impressed by my skills and ability to explain my thought process. They said I would hear back results within a week, but they were hopeful I would get the offer. 

Two weeks pass - no response. I email my recruiter, with no response. I then find out that he has left for another company. So I email another recruiter at the company asking for a status update -  again no response.

1 month passes and no response - I email one of my interviewers - again to be ghosted.

Finally, after 3 months, I follow up again with my interviewer. He says that he has not heard a response yet from the higher ups, but he will ask. 5 minutes after the follow up, I get a generic ""Thank you for your interest"" email.

If you were going to make me go through the final round, give me false hope, ignore my follow up emails for months, and finally give me a generic rejection email, I'd appreciate it if you never interviewed me in the first place.

Essays:

Common App (9): I wrote a lot about my identity and the different parts comprising it. It was a pretty normal topic (cultural, emotional identity) but I wrote it in a fun way working in a metaphor about marching band. My friends/teachers gave me really good reviews about it

Brown Supplements (8): Honestly, these weren't my most impressive or intellectual essays. I wrote them very genuinely and I would say they showed off the goofy/fun sides of my personal moreso than my purely academic mind, but I think my AOs liked that. I would say I was most confident in the fact that nobody else could write these exact essays; they were so eccentric about different parts of me that I knew I was really being myself in my essays. When I was writing essays about a more generic topic (e.g. an activity that a lot of people might do), I tried to focus on what made that activity or community important to *me* specifically, and how to individualize that essay.

Interview (7):

Honestly I'm not the best interviewer lol, we probably spent \~40 minutes talking about myself and the rest was my interviewer talking about Brown as I asked a barrage of questions (I reaaaaally liked hearing about his time there). I would say I was definitely genuine in my interview and tried to make it casual (I made a weird joke about preferring being called a flutist rather than a flautist because of the latter's resemblance to flatulence--probably not my best move, but it worked).  

Reflections:

Honestly, I didn't expect to get in at all; I think my essays were definitely my strongest point. I would definitely characterize them as not taking myself too seriously (I think only 1/5 essays I submitted to Brown didn't involve some type of humor/joke within it). I would say that you should do your best to write genuinely and be yourself in your essays. I'm someone who loves to laugh and make stupid jokes, so I did the same in my essays (and even in my interview), and I think my AO appreciated that genuineness. 

For the longest time, I expected a flat rejection and thought my ECs were way below what ""they would want."" Admissions is honestly such an unpredictable game that I think you should just go into it with an open mind.

Good luck to everyone, and PM me if you want me to read over any essays (especially for Brown hehe)."

As such, I never had the ability to do an internship during that time. 

I got my BS in August, but have failed five entry level software developer interviews before and since. It's the technical portions I keep failing. While overcoming the stigma of having worked for so long in an unrelated field is easier due to my high GPA, it's clear I have neither the experience nor the practice to meet interviewers' expectations. I suspect it could take months to reach that level from where I am.

That said, I'm getting pressure from my friends to get a job in the field, even if it's not software development, and work up from there. I just don't know what would qualify for a position that's both relevant and below the bar set by ""entry level."" Does such a position exist, or should I stay in my current unrelated job until I finally pass an entry level interview?"

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand you have folks who don't have a degree, self teach, and grind until they get a foot in the door - and I'm not saying this doesn't happen - but on the other hand you have folks who start all the way in middle school, go to technical high schools, get into these very expensive CS schools, get their internships at a Google or Facebook, and all told have dedicated half of their lives to this by the time they've graduated and even \*then\* they can often struggle to get their foot in the door. It's probably my anxiety talking, but I'm not understanding how the over-30 (or 40 or 50) self taught coder is supposed to fit into the industry with folks who live, eat, and breathe these concepts in ways someone who's self taught probably won't get a chance to develop until they're many years into their career already.

eitoy1,3,2020-01-02,Scared of conformity,inspectorpickle,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/eitoy1/scared_of_conformity/,"I'm a junior studying computer science at a prestigious university and trying to get into the entertainment industry. But that's hard, its impossibly hard it seems. I could also end up working for a nonprofit or some social good organization but that's also harder than just going down the funnel into some overpaid code monkey position at a soulless big tech corporation like both my parents.

And tbh even that might be fine, if I was certain I would be able to maintain my artistic practice and creativity. But I'm convinced that I'm not strong enough to do even that, let alone get artistic creativity become part of my career. 

From freshman year of hs to freshman year of college, I've disciplined myself to give up things and follow the most guaranteed path to success and despite my best efforts these past 2 years, I feel like I still dont know how to step out of that rut. 

And I know this comes from a place of great privelege, being able to jump off the path to an easy life, but it constantly causes me a lot of pain, to stay on that silver lined road. I hate that I dont appreciate what I have, but i just dont.

My question then, I guess, is how do you not let your work consume you, if you do something you dont necessarily hate but also dont love? Or if you've been in a similar position to me, how did you follow your dreams and do it? 

Edit: I'm sorry this is so long, but I also have had a taste of corporate life through an internship and I'm scared of how complacent I was. I was low key sad but never super sad and I spent most of my day waiting for the weekends, during which I would be too tired do art."

Been suicidal since my teens, I lost 2 internships due to my self harm - very embarrassing. Then my mother went on holiday for 6 weeks to Australia (my dad died when I was 9 so I was alone at home aged 22) and I drank a bottle of wine and 60 codeine tablets. Passed out, woke up 6 hours later covered in vomit and half dissolved tablets. Cleaned up and went to work... it was bizarre being alive around people who had no idea that I tried to be dead a few hours before.

Anyways, my wife's gran died last week - and I went to her funeral and realized that unless you have insurance, or a really wealthy family - your suicide will cripple your loved ones. Financially.... Funerals are so expensive, and to put your loved ones through that social stigma would be a very VERY tough duty to place on them. We think sometimes a vengeful suicide will reap some sort of ""win"" but coming from me, who hates his in laws that I want to write a fuck you note to them before I kill myself, will only mean that my wife will be a pariah, someone who had no idea - who was too ignorant to not notice he was serious etc. Causing her a life of sadness for doing nothing wrong.

You are loved, maybe not by the people or person that SHOULD or you would like to have love you, but I love you, this sub loves you and we are always here to hear your deepest darkest fears, plans or concerns.

You may think that you have royally and completely fucked up yours and your family's lives, however it will not be better without you - that is NEVER true. 

I know by now some have stopped reading because they don't want to think of a way of life that is not full of thoughts of ending it, because it is a coping mechanism so many of us have. 

I am not saying stop thinking about dying, or that life will get better or that you need to change a single thing in your life. All I want to get you to do is mouth while reading this, is that you have this sub, you have us, you have me - for anything and everything. 

You are not alone, you are not better off dead, you are are you and in the entire creation of the life as we know it from the atom to the largest star know to humankind - you are the only one that is you. No one can take your place, no one will ever get over you killing yourself and people think of you all the time and they like you - whether you like it or not.

We are soldiers, we face the same fight day after day, month after month, decade after decade. Against our inner demons that know our every thought and our saddest weaknesses. But, we persevere, we fight, just to get the basics of life down. While other around us reach goals and new heights of success with zero problems, and yet we stand back humbled and burdened by a disease society is just barely getting to understand and start to accept that we are ill.... keep the fight alive.

Peaceful thoughts and brotherly love to you from me,

eiwsyv,62,2020-01-02,Sharing my (20F Indonesian) plans to move out to the Netherlands (or other possible EU countries?) in 2021. Suggestions and advice are welcome!,maiiiorca,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/eiwsyv/sharing_my_20f_indonesian_plans_to_move_out_to/,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post regarding moving out of my country, Indonesia. I apologize for any inconveniences such false formatting or any grammatical errors. On this post I will try to explain why and how i want to move out and the struggles i \*think\* i have to face in order for me to finally be able to move out of here.

I am a 20 y/o girl currently living nearby the capital city of Indonesia. I am a broke undergraduate student majoring in Dutch studies and i expect myself to graduate in early 2021. I currently don't have a job, not even a part time because i'm focusing on my studies. (i might do intern in my final years somewhere). Thus, i don't think it's possible to move out of here *as soon as i got my bachelor's degree*. Basic skills that i gained through my academic years and organizations are probably writing, news reporting, and graphic designing, but i have never done anything professionally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why** I think i need to move out of here ASAP (mid 2021/late 2021/early 2022):

* Indonesia isn't an LGBT+ friendly country. Might sound like it's not a big deal, but this is what fuels me with a huge desire to move out.
* The society I'm living in isn't so civilized. ~~It can be, but it takes time and powerful leader to change it~~
* I can't stand how corrupt the government is, this explains why everything sucks. Education, healthcare, welfare, sustainability, etc.
* Polluted environment everywhere, seriously,  i think i wouldn't survive my 40's if i ended up living here any longer.
* Here in the capital city, everything is so messy. Traffic, pollution, low wages high living cost (even for public transportation). 
* Thinking about working my a\*\* off just to get paid minimum wage (USD 305.45\~) for years sounds hopeless to me, especially in my field.
* my family just went broke  and as much as homophobic they are, i need to find a way to help my family. i have 4 younger siblings who 2 of them are still little kids and my father is lowkey financially abusive to my mother)
* I am passionate about art, culture, and heritage. Those things are very underappreciated by the government and the society
* I have friends across the world who i really want to see, i made them online through twitter. I'm also in a LDR with my girlfriend who lives in the US.
* I just have huge dreams about seeing the world outside and i don't think i would make it if i ended up being stuck working and living in here.
* When i go back here someday (temporary), i would love to try fix the mess by applying the experience that i would gain from studying/working/living abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

**How,** the possible ways i can try to move out of here and live a better life in the future, sorted from the most prioritized one:

* Getting *a* *master's degree in the Netherlands* after getting my bachelor's. But here are some things in my mind that i still need to figure out:
   * So far, i have been trying to look up universities in NL that offer master programs in arts and culture, mainly heritage studies and museology. However, because i **want** to settle my life out there (in NL or anywhere in the EU), i need to consider which major is worthy for me to enroll to considering the chance to work after i graduate my master's aside of majors in art and culture.  
   * master's degree for non-EU/EEA students is very expensive (EUR 12000\~) in the Netherlands and i don't have the money. I have been looking for scholarships, but some fully funded scholarships that are offered by Indo-NL institutions require their participants to go back to their respectful countries after the study is finished, and i do not want to immediately go back here.
   * I will definitely try to apply for some other scholarships that i have found even tho they don't fully support my studies, and by that i will need to work part time jobs while i'm also studying *if* i get accepted.
* *A master's degree in* a university in EU with zero cost. I tried gathering information online, and google showed me that *state universities in Norway and Germany* are free. However, getting the student visa isn't easy in both countries as i have to provide information about financial capability (approximately 121100 NOK for Norway and EUR 8700 for Germany). And i would have to learn Norwegian or German at least to into a certain level to get certified.
   * found a uni and its major in Norway that i'm interested in (energy/environmental sustainability studies), interesting, but again, i dont have the money. 
   * found out that i could try to get a student visa in Germany without having to show that i have money through something called verpflichtungserkl√§rung, but i don't have any relatives who reside in Germany nor know a German that would sign their name for said document. 
* ~~Applying for a job.. abroad,,, is that even possible? i don't think so. No especially i am a fresh graduate with no actual professional skill...?~~
* The last desperate move is to register myself as an Au Pair (for years, moving around EU) until i finally have money to attend a master's in the Netherlands (or somewhere else). Besides living in EU (finally free from polluted air and see the new world), i would also *maybe* be given some money for taking care of host family's kids and doing household tasks and in that way i can try to actually save up.
   * I know i can try looking for jobs here while i'm processing my applications for a master's and scholarships, but the pay here is so low and with all considered things, i wouldn't be able to save up much.
   * also, is it possible to change Au Pair visas from countries to countries without going back to origin country? can we change Au Pair visa to student visa if any miracle happens? i have never figured these things out.

&amp;#x200B;

**what i can do... for now**

* look up for internships/part time jobs for the summer break and try to save up money as much as i can
* take an English proficiency test (IELTS or TOEFL) in early 2020, or late 2020 if i'm still that broke
* gather more information about available scholarships that are offered throughout European countries

&amp;#x200B;

okay, i think i'm done with writing down everything that has been stuck in my mind for months. I am just a gay broke college kid with huge dreams and ambitions that might sound unrealistic, but i feel like sharing my plans with people outside of my reach would help me figure out things that i have to do for my future. So, any advice, suggestions, and critics are very welcome and will be appreciated. Thank you for everyone who has read my post this far, I will also try to keep an update if anything significant in my life happens :)"

I've been researching a lot of different opportunities and couldn't avoid noticing how the vast majority of offers are for backend web development (with Django, PHP and Node being the most wanted) or frontend with Javascript, React, Angular and Vue.

I really enjoyed the courses involving C, such as Algos/DS, OS. Unfortunately, I've only seen a couple of positions in which these kind of things are listed as requirements or at least desirable knowledge.

I like both areas similarly and still haven't decided which to invest, but everytime I'm sharpening my C skills with some sort of project, it's inevitable to feel like losing time, because the entry positions I find seldom really care about it.

I'm starting to think that the area is being neglected as more and more software shifts towards web-based apps and Electron-based desktop apps.

Lastly, even though I still try to dirty my hands with pointers and stuff, it's like it is shrinking its importance.

I do think I'm being naive with this thinking, but would like to hear some opinions of people in the industry.

In 2018, I had an internship at a good company in Hong Kong for a few months. They liked me well enough to request I return to them once I graduated from uni. I graduated June 2019 in a digital-arts related discipline, right when the protests started. I then went to stay with my parents and have a short holiday before starting work. My plan was to start work at the company in September, hopefully after things in Hong Kong had cooled down.

In July/August, I heard through the woodwork that the company was going through some major financial difficulties. My parents said to try and negotiate going back to the company much later, to give the company time to fix things and to wait out the stuff happening in Hong Kong. Okay, sounds reasonable enough. In the meantime, I continued working on my digital art skills and looked for jobs elsewhere as a backup plan.   


During this time, the ""honeymoon phase"" with my family ended, and they started the usual AP things that would drive my crazy. For the sake of post length, I'll write about it elsewhere. But I knew I was going crazy and needed a job as soon as possible so I could gain financial independence and make my own decisions.

In November, I flew to Shenzhen for a job interview, but it didn't work out. I stayed there for a month networking, supported by my boyfriend, but my parents insisted I return to them as soon as possible. I didn't want to hurt their feelings, so I went back despite the job searching being so much easier when I was in the area. During my time there, I made a day trip to Hong Kong and  was able to reach out to the company again. They came clean about the financial situation and told me to reach out to them again. I emailed the department head and he called me saying they could send me an offer in January. I told my parents this and they seemed happy... 

Then, they started making holiday plans in January, totally disregarding my potential job offer. I then noticed that whenever we met up with my parents' friends and they asked when I would start my job, my dad would respond FOR me, saying ""after Chinese New Year"". I was like wtf? I told my mom in private that I didn't like this behavior of his, and if the company sends me a job offer, I would take it immediately, I couldn't keep them waiting for so long. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's now January. I sent a happy new year message to the company and didn't get a response. I'm getting worried, and noticed there was a networking event in Hong Kong on January 31st that would be extremely useful for my career. I asked my parents if I could go. My dad said ""no, it's right after Chinese New Year and we have to spend time with family, and we have vacation plans"". 

I was shocked, he said himself ""after Chinese New Year"" and now he has vacation plans for after Chinese New Year? How long more do they want to keep me for? Also in hindsight, why do I need to ""ask permission"" for something like this? They didn't ask me for my schedule or permission to book tickets over January. I'm also 24, this is something a teenager should ask, not me. 

Over dinner, I then told them that I really, really needed to go to this networking event, it would really be a good opportunity for me to kick-start my career, and we were going to be with our relative for the majority of Chinese New Year anyway I could just buy my own ticket to the event and fly back to my parents afterwards. 

They got accusatory and rough and demanded why I was so desperate to go. I tried re-listing the reasons above, but eventually I broke down in tears and told them I was worried the company didn't want me anymore because they waited too long for me. (my exact words)  
THEY. FREAKED. OUT. They literally went ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?! WE KEPT YOU TOO LONG?? HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE US OF THIS??! IT'S OUR FAULT?!?!""  
I never put words in their mouth, I never accused them of anything, they knew the underlying issue already and twisted my words. I started crying even more while they started tearing into me. ""I TOLD YOU TO GET A COURSE AND STUDY SOMETHING"" - there are no courses in our area for my skills, I told them this and had to study on my own. They scoffed at my response. (I have to use my laptop to do my work and they assume laptop = unproductive/lazy.)   
They told me ""STOP CRYING RIGHT NOW, I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE"" despite them yelling at me in the first place in public, mind you. I tried to push the conversation back to wanting to go to the event, but they continued the guilt-tripping and yelling, telling me I hurt their feelings and was ungrateful and this and that, making me cry even more, and then making them even more mad when I couldn't stop crying. My mom told me to stop using my phone because my dad would think I was texting my boyfriend about this and it would upset him (excuse me? who's the upset one here). 

At home, my mom found me in my room and told me forcibly to stop crying. I told her I was upset and needed to cry, I just needed a moment to myself. She demanded I stop crying again. She said she talked to my dad and he said I could go, but first I needed to go ""apologize"" and be nice to him. (Apologize for what?! This felt like grovelling to him, which it was). In the end, my dad said he would think about it and book the tickets for me, and ""try to figure out all the holiday plans"".   


&amp;#x200B;

I'm just sitting here feeling awful and wondering if I've been massively gaslighted or am I just being ungrateful to my parents. I honestly want to (and I know I technically can) just book a one way ticket back to Hong Kong and just stay there to continue my job search, I have savings and I could stay at my boyfriend's place like last time.

At this point I‚Äôm wondering if this is just how the real world is, or If I have bad judgement when I comes to choosing jobs / not asking enough questions in interviews.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I mean (and these aren‚Äôt even all of the jobs I‚Äôve had, but I don‚Äôt want to write a book):

‚Ä¢ Job #1 - NYC luxury showroom, startup. Toxic work environment. Handful of employees tear into the others when they aren‚Äôt around. They did this to just about everyone, so everyone found out, but no one would do anything about it since the toxic people were some of the highest performers. According to LinkedIn, none of my colleagues work there anymore.

‚Ä¢ Job #2 - NYC E-commerce, startup. I was a social media intern. Expected to learn about social media, but my boss wanted me to teach myself. Kinda weird I thought, but I went along with it. Was a contractor and was paid less than minimum wage at the time, didn‚Äôt know it. My boss had the expectation that I shouldn‚Äôt be making mistakes though I was an intern. Also weird. A year in my boss wants to give me all the work the other intern is doing because of how efficient I am. Since my responsibilities would grow, and I was already doing a lot of work, I asked for a raise. They offer 25 or 50 cents extra. Underwhelming. I learn that the company has been around for 6 years but only made $3k in revenue, and it‚Äôs only afloat cause the CEO‚Äôs husband is a doctor, whose income covers costs. Looking back, I realize it wasn‚Äôt an internship, but a way for the CEO to get cheap labor. 

‚Ä¢ Job #3 - Another NYC e-commerce startup. I learn in my first few days at the job that my boss has been sued for copyright issues before because he‚Äôd rip photos off of the internet and place it on his luxury dresses he was selling. Oh boy. I figure, well, he‚Äôs admitting it, so hopefully that‚Äôs in the past. Then he asks me to use copyrighted music in content I‚Äôm making for him, I explain he needs permission, he doesn‚Äôt want to listen. I‚Äôm able to find an un-copyrighted track for my content, but then he hires a videographer and uses a copyrighted song in another video ‚Äî It‚Äôs a Justin Bieber remix. I lose the job due to lack of funding about a year in since he couldn‚Äôt sell enough inventory to meet a quota. He owed me hundreds in wages and tried to pin the cost on a bigger company he used to collaborate with. Had to open a small claims court case to get my wages back ‚Äî from him ‚Äî like a month later. The company never recovered.

‚Ä¢ Job #4 - Online Photography Class Business, used to be successful but reverted to startup. Business is run by a 65+ year old man that doesn‚Äôt want to learn technology despite it being his business and has major depression / anger issues. He once fell down the stairs when I came in for a shift because he fought with his wife. Yelled at me and cried at me on many occasions because his business was a financial failure ‚Äî he often paid people late ‚Äî and even hired people who were totally incompetent cause he felt bad for them. He‚Äôd also say things like ‚ÄúI need to go to the store,‚Äù we‚Äôd go together since he was tech challenged, but then he‚Äôd stop at a store or something, make me wait an hour, and say that it doesn‚Äôt count towards my work hours. He often made me sit around and do nothing while he fumbled through something simple like his email, trying to find something. It was torture. Tried to talk him into making better decisions, but he didn‚Äôt want to change. Left.

‚Ä¢ Job #5 - Luxury hospitality startup. Run by 65+ year old man who also has anger issues. I sold $1k - $3k in hotel rooms and services every week. Business wasn‚Äôt turning a profit, so the small team was overworked constantly. Both of my managers would have emotional breakdowns at work every now and then over it, which would cause they to go home immediately. My boss was either oblivious or didn‚Äôt care. Boss tended to shoot first, ask questions later. He yelled at me once for something I didn‚Äôt do, and after explaining my colleague did it, he disciplined them, but didn‚Äôt apologize to me. Once I was getting yelled at for things another colleague did, cause he didn‚Äôt do any prior investigating, I gave my two weeks. By the time I left, most of my team was already gone cause they resigned. Ironically, one of my managers was yelled at really badly by my boss in front of a hotel guest the same day I resigned, so they put in their two weeks that day, too. My boss thought my manager timed it that way on purpose out of spite. Yeah, he‚Äôs out of touch...

Job #6 - Established Non-profit. Small group of wealthy people hate us to the point of vandalizing my colleague‚Äôs garage. We get hate digitally and in-person often. One person even said they were going to blow up the facility over the phone. Sadly, these people hate homeless people, and that‚Äôs literally their entire logic. They see them as violent / drug addicted people who have no place in the community. This makes everyday a bit tense. I do great work in social media, hundreds of donations, website re-design, grew email list, and get promoted. I‚Äôm bringing my own camera, backdrops, and software to work to save them money. I start to ask for a little funding for more complicated marketing tasks ‚Äî $200 for facebook ads, an extra $20 more for a better website. My frugal colleague disagrees, and since my boss and colleagues like to make sure everyone agrees on everything, that alone shuts down my efforts. Two weeks later the organization holds a meeting, which they told me nothing about, where they were considering getting more outside help for marketing. They drop $30k for a 3 month contract with a NYC PR firm. It takes them a month to give us an underwhelming 2 page strategy. Meetings are awkward because the PR firm keeps making suggestions that I‚Äôve already done for my workplace. PR firm‚Äôs strategy becomes my entire job, and I‚Äôm doing most of the work for the entire campaign cause our team is small. I‚Äôm boiling on the inside, but decide to stick it out for the sake of our homeless residents. Then debris fell on my car by accident cause the building next to my workplace was being gutted. 110% done, I left.

I‚Äôve been unemployed since ‚Äî 4 months later. Dealing with career disillusionment and depression. 

So... is this what working is like? Or is it me? Cause honestly, I‚Äôm considering getting a minimum wage job JUST so I don‚Äôt have to deal with higher levels of aggravation. I don‚Äôt even have motivation to grow professionally anymore. I busted my butt for years and sacrificed so much for my career ‚Äî and this is it? I‚Äôm getting very bitter, but all in all, I don‚Äôt want to keep ending up in places like these. All feedback is appreciated."

I am wondering about a few things that can help me to prepare, as I am very slow in coding and not very smart.

1. What resources can I employ in advance to learn or hone skills prior to school so that I am ahead of the curve?
2. What projects should I do, and what is a good resource for giving ""problems"" and making me code a ""solution""
3. Where can I find real-world applicable programming experience before hand (It can be simulated)
4. What should I know/do from your personal experience?
5. I am worried to death about not getting a job (or internship during) when I am done my diploma.  What can I do to facilitate the optimization of my success?

ej1snz,0,2020-01-02,Dual Degree Program,CleverFox3,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ej1snz/dual_degree_program/,"Hi everyone! 

I've got a specific career ambition in mind that I'll go into some detail on and was looking for the best path to getting there. 

My first ever internship was as an intern-diplomat at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. I would give up just about anything to get back to that position and be a diplomat or working for the United Nations or for the Department of State as a diplomat to the United Nations. I wouldn't necessarily need to be the diplomat, but just having a job working towards the UN's goals would be a dream come true and something that I would feel fulfilled by. 

In order to do this, and based on my advisers from that internship, I believe that I would need to get an internationally focused MPP or MPA (Public Policy/Public Administration) or an MIA with a specialty in the particular field that I would like to get into, which would be either Economic or Political Affairs. 

That being said, after graduating in December of 2018 it took me a while to find a job in the private sector. Many of the positions that I applied to within the Department of State or UN I did not get interviewed or seriously considered for. This was a soul-sucking experience in which I idled in unemployment for far too long before getting my current job as a tech consultant for a FinTech SaaS company. The hard to accept explanation for this was that my undergraduate degrees (all be it from a good school, University of Michigan) in Economics and International Studies did not endow me with many skills craved in the domestic labor market.

As such, while I still want to pursue my goals (working at the UN) I understand that I should also use graduate school as an opportunity to build skills that could give me gainful employment. 

Thus, I'd like to pair this MPP/MPA/MIA with an MBA. I believe that this would be the right direction for me, as this degree would also equip me with transferable skills for diplomacy and international affairs that employees within that sector do not currently possess. For example, I found as an intern in the State Department that middle management was under-equipped or skilled to handle managerial or administrative responsibilities efficiently. 

I'm currently looking into dual degree programs for this and wanted to pose some questions to this forum:

1- Given my career ambitions and desire for financial security in life even if I fail in reaching them, is this the right dual degree for me? I've also thought of JD/MBA or JD/MPP. 

2- If anyone has similar career ambitions that they've gone to graduate school for, did your graduate degree assist you in pursuing these ambitions? If so, what was it? If not, why? 

3- How competitive of an applicant am I? What target schools should I be looking into? For reference: 3.49 cumulative GPA with a double BA (1- Economics (3.5 major GPA) , 2- International Studies(3.68 major GPA)), GRE on practice tests is between 305-310, work experience is predominantly internships at this point (I'm only 24) with internships at the UN, for a Congressional District Office, financial firm and my current job in tech consulting. Historically speaking, I'm a pretty strong writer, so anticipate at least above average application essays.

Some programs I'm considering:

**University of Michigan Ross/Ford** 

**Indiana University MBA/MPP**

**Georgetown MBA/MSFS**

**NYU Stern/MPP** 

**Darla Moore IMBA**

**Harvard Kennedy School**

**Columbia SIPA** 

**Johns Hopkins** 

**Tufts MBA/Fletcher** 

**George Washington University MIA/MBA** 

**University of Texas Austin - McCombs/MPP**

4- Are any of these totally over the moon/pipe dreams/unrealistic enough to not even apply to?

5- Are there any programs that I'm not considering strongly enough?

Appreciate all of your consideration and guidance in advance!"

------------------------

Post anything related to recruitment advice, company / group research, or general insecurity in here. 

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) r√©sum√© or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.

Misusing or trolling the sticky will result in an immediate ban.

**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target program (school + degree where a consulting firm focuses it's recruiting efforts), join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through target program undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  
 * Experienced hires do happen, but is a much smaller entry channel and often requires a combination of strong pedigree, in-demand experience, and a meaningful referral.  Without this combination, it can be very hard to stand out from the large volume of general applicants. 

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

 * [Read wiki on what firms look for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/lookfor)
 * [Read wiki on resumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcresume)
 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the application / interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Time to hear back can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires to never at all.  Asking in this thread will not help.

I'm a sophomore CS major at a big state university, and I'm somewhat worried about summer internships. I applied to about 30 companies last fall, and only got interview (still waiting to hear back from the interviewer). My GPA is a 3.3 and the only side project I really have is a very basic python/flask blog I made last summer. On top of that, I haven't really done much leetcode/CTCI so I'm not too confident in my problem-solving coding skills.

So the question is, what steps should I take to progress further? I feel like most companies do all their hiring in the fall, so I don't know about applying. And in general I don't know what I should focus on. Does anyone have any advice? I think I may be a bit hard on myself, but I'm just worried because I feel behind and really want to get my foot in the door.

Note: I know I could've posted in r/csMajors, but I felt like it would help to get input from some more experienced people in the field"

I am a second year undergrad student in a business/tech program who has been offered a video interview for a tech consulting internship with EY in their Insurance Technology department in the summer. I am wondering what to expect throughout the process. Is the video interview itself difficult? What should I expect afterwards in terms of an in-person interview?

To put things into perspective, I already graduate one year late because of some family issues right after my first year, so this bachelor's degree is already taking me 5 years.

I recently got an internship offer for the winter from the big 4 tech, which I will obviously accept, that is a no-brainer.

However, I also got an offer for the summer, which is for a very big game engine company (you can prob already guess which one it is). Now this is a hard choice for me, the industry and technology stack is very different, and I am very interested in learning how the game engine works, also a return offer is almost guaranteed for this role. But by accepting this offer, it will mean that I will have to delay my graduation by 4-8 months, which I am not sure if it will be worth it.

Would delay my graduation be worth it? I have seen a lot of people do tons of internships, does that strategy work out well?"

Should I learn some UIKit stuff before my start date in May? (I doubt they will use SwiftUI because it‚Äôs so new at this point). Do companies often provide training session? I should also point out that I was tested on the Swift language, some basic OS concepts, and was given an algorithm test and analysis assignment for the interview.

So for some background, I'm a junior software engineering student seeking an internship. My GPA is less than most of the internships around my area require, and this is my second year of tirelessly seeking internships. I literally applied to about 60 internships last year and only got a follow-up from 2, and did not get either. I'm constantly applying to the point it's driving me bats. I have refined my resume several times, put in the extra effort to try and raise my GPA, and have gotten pretty good at interviews. I just don't know what I'm missing and my motivation is starting to take a downfall. This is my last chance to get one and I really would like one to not only give myself real world experience, but to also actually be able to survive this summer. Does anyone have any advice or tips? Maybe some reasons to keep my motivation upwards? Thanks!"

I have lived in CH in the past (not at the moment) and worked for a major international organization in my career before programming.

As far as programming I have gotten quite proficient at React and JS, and very competent at Node. These things I can prove at a technical, but my experience is nonetheless less than 1 year. I also speak basic french from my time in CH.

So I am wondering, were I to move in (I'm EU national), how quickly could I expect to land a job to get started?

I am confident that I can rise very quickly once employed but am afraid to make the move if I'm facing 3 months or so of unemployment in Switzerland, and I'm not sure what my chances are if I apply for things remotely."

Education: mediocre state school CS degree, 2.9 gpa, no internships  
Employer: large gov't sector software company, local to quiet college town, small talent pool  
Role: developer working on legacy java desktop app 

I'm 6 months in to my first dev job and struggling to level up or learn much, but i feel like i don't have the experience or skills to get a better job yet. I feel I haven't learned enough to ""talk the (developer) talk"" in an interview for any role that is even slightly competitive. How do I level up? I can't ask for more challenging work.  I'm simply given more bug fix tickets, or a simple feature that's no different from the last. I don't feel like my programming skills are advancing. Code reviews are non existent; if you write good tests and it works and passes QA, it ships, but I still feel like I'm not a ""smart"" or clever programmer, and I know nothing about enterprise architecture or how all this stuff really works. I'm basically hacking away in java till things work, and my higher-ups are happy. I can get away with moving at a dying snail's pace and no one seems to notice. I'm young and hungry and want to level up, have plenty of free time, but am struggling to find a good direction to take. Any advice? I know some will say side projects or tutorials but its hard to learn anything from building games or doing code-alongs, nothing really sticks. Maybe I could use some inspiration for getting started on more complex, multi layered projects that resemble real dev work? Idk. Any advice is greatly appreciated

ej5pk1,1,2020-01-02,Dealing with Losing People Around Me,Stock_Birthday,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ej5pk1/dealing_with_losing_people_around_me/,"First off, I don't want this to sound like a ""Woe is me"" kinda deal, I'm genuinely reaching out for advice and your guy's opinions.

About a month and a half ago, actually 2 days after Thanksgiving, I abruptly ended things with my now ex-girlfriend. For about 9 months before that, however, It might be the happiest I've ever been in life... or so I thought. While our relationship seemed strong and going in the right direction. In fact, I almost felt like if things had been going the same way in a year, I would've gladly moved away with her to Oregon, a long-time dream that both of us had in common of living in Portland. But, I had my doubts. She didn't liked when I talked to other people about our problems (red flag, I know), but the day after Thanksgiving I took the chance to talk to my mom about my doubts and I ended up spilling what seemed like everything. My doubts, how I felt about her, the way she treated me and more often than not controlled me, all that jazz. To sum that conversation up, my mom told me ""I wish I had known sooner that things between you and \_\_\_ had gotten this extreme, this isn't healthy."" For some reason hearing that from my mom made me snap and give up completely on our relationship. I felt appalled that someone had taken advantage of me in such a way by exploiting my generosity and care (not trying to brag, I guess I'm just a pushover). Anyways, we haven't spoken since. I know I cant get back with her because of what she did to me, but I've severed a relationship like this before and it took me a long while to gain my stride again.

Around the same time, when my most recent ex and I were starting to get serious, a seemingly tidal wave of news came crashing down on me. One of my closest friends that I've known since middle school (about to graduate college now), had informed me that he was seeing another one of my exes. It was shocking to hear that such a thing would happen, I mean cmon yeah everyone deserves to be happy and find someone else, but out of the 4.5 billion women on this planet, maybe 2 billion of those being viable partners, my closest friend had to choose my ex? For a while there, I brushed it off, and thought, ""well, what can I do about it now? Maybe things like this are just normalized as you get older."" I had suppressed my anger and continued hanging out with him when he was in town, just actively forgetting about what happened. It might be good to add that my friend sorta has a track record of doing this, going for girls that I was once involved with, yeah kinda weird.

This is where things get... interesting. I decided to meet up with the ex that my best friend had been seeing. This ex is not the most recent one that I had just broken up with, for clarity. We decided to get a cup of coffee to catch up since it had been quite a long time since we spoke (Obviously I didn't talk to her for the duration of my most recent relationship). She was incredibly apologetic about what happened with her and my best friend, and I half-accepted her apology. But, what really got to me was the time frame of the events that had occurred. Turns out, my best friend waited around 6 months to tell me about what was going on, and was actively avoiding telling me during that time and had actively avoided me in 1 on 1 confrontation because I was undoubtedly going to bring up what happened. Even better? It seemed like everyone but myself knew what was happening. All of my ""friends"" and ""best friends"" told me ""it wasn't any of their business so they didn't feel the need to tell me what was happening.""  Sweet.

On top of this, my brother who I currently live just graduated and is moving out in about a month to go to Europe. My brother and I are incredibly close, so its like losing another best friend. 

Alright so, here's my situation. I broke up with my girlfriend because she treated me terribly but still miss her, my friends have essentially been treating me terribly too because they didn't care enough to tell me, and my brother is leaving so now I will be going to school and living on my own. 

It just feels like everyone that I once had at my side is now gone, and I don't know how to cope with it. I work a ton as a sales intern, so work occupies most of my days. I have my hobbies, I go to the gym every day, do fun things on the weekend like going to museums and very rarely go out to bars or clubs, I try to write as much as possible in the form of journaling, but a cloud of loneliness is forming over my head and I don't see how to escape it, I feel trapped in a cycle of depression that currently seems inescapable. How should I meet people? Should I try different hobbies? How can I get both of my exes of my mind for a little peace?

Roast me and telling me I'm overreacting, I'll accept any form of advice or criticism. Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)

TLDR; Dumped my girlfriend, friends deceived me and aren't my friends anymore, brother is moving out for a one-way ticket to Europe. How do I change things up to get my life feeling a little bit happier and cohesive again?"

Unfortunately, I was unable to even get an interview for an internship while completing my undergrad degree (applied to 70+ this past summer which I see is pretty standard). I was a pretty average student with no personal projects so it was understandable that these companies never looked twice at my resume. I just never had time to work on projects while school was in session and never had any idea of what kinds of projects would make me a quality candidate.

I have applied to several full time SWE positions but I fear that due to my lack of experience, I am hopeless in pursuing any positions in Silicon Valley or Southern California. It's just so discouraging to see that there are 200+ applicants on a post on LinkedIn that is less than a week old when you know more than half of those people have better experience than you. I'm looking at full time IT positions but that is not where I want to end up for the rest of my life. I am only pursuing IT because I need to pay bills and it's essentially the only field with a job market in my area. I currently work part-time but because it's a student position, I am only allowed to work until the end of the academic year (\~4 more months).

My current plan is to use this extra free time to pursue projects that will get me hired as an engineer.

My questions are:

* How does an unremarkable candidate with my background (or lack thereof) become a quality candidate after already graduating?
* What kind of projects make a candidate stand out?
* How many personal projects vs school projects is a good amount to include on a resume?
* Am I going about this whole situation the wrong way?

I appreciate any input, thanks.

EDIT: Lots of good advice here, thank you. A couple things worth clarifying though, I am not **only** looking at LinkedIn job postings. I was just using that as an example of job postings with a visible high number of applicants. Also, a lot of the opportunities on LinkedIn are also posted on other job search sites which is the point I was hoping to make. I'm also not **only** applying to jobs in the SF and LA area but that is the bulk of them but maybe I need to focus my search on smaller companies in different areas. I wanted to find something in those areas mainly because family lives equidistant from both of those areas and I feel like I would be bored out of my mind living in a new city where there is nothing to do but I suppose we all have to put in out time to get the experience we need."

I'm 24, and a female who recently went back to college. I never really accomplished anything in high school and graduated with what I consider to be an average GPA (2.8). I am very anxious but I also have a lot of drive to succeed now that I have more life experience. 

Upon going back to college I made a commitment to myself to put myself out there and push myself out of my comfort zone. I have applied to scholarships and an honor society and took on the role of a club president, that I thought I wouldn't stand a chance at, and managed to succeed. 

I applied to 70+ internships that I thought I'd never get, and I received an offer. I'm still pushing myself and stepping out of my comfort zone to do more ""prestigious"" things. 

However I am still suffering with insecurities and feeling inadequate.

A few months ago I was faced with a question on a scholarship application asking what I had accomplished and I couldn't make words come out, instead I cried and panicked and didn't finish the application because I felt like I hadn't done enough to deserve it.

How can I over come these feelings? I thought stepping out of my zone would help and that eventually I would feel more confident but so far it's just making me worry more that I will let down my mentors and professors. That at some point I will have a breakdown and run away and just give up. 

I guess I'm looking for advice.

I can only assume this is coming from my past, where my family didn't believe I would accomplish anything, and my ex bf who was incredibly abusive in every way and knocked me down every chance he got. I'm surrounded by supportive people now but the thoughts inside my head still come around. 

I've been seeing a counselor but thus far it hasn't been helping much. I was taken from my biological parents, because they weren't suitable and I was raised by parents who never did make anything of themselves therefore I'm trying to be better, but I often fear that I'm doomed to turn out a failure because I was failed by nature and nurture. These thoughts led to panic attacks in the middle of biology class while discussing the course material and I just want to get over these feelings I've been having and make something of myself."

I am a final year computer science student and just finished  an awesome 6 months internship on ETL. However, I would like to go  further and become a full  fledged data scientist. After looking into  what I should know for this, I checked out the math (studied  probability, statistics, linear algebra, and much more during my  studies), sql and python boxes. Sadly, I have little knowledge regarding  Machine Learning and did not manage to settle on a course to study from  (majority of sources show how to use entities such as decision trees,  but not how they were implemented).

Moreover,  when searching for jobs on LinkedIn, I found few open positions with  many already registered applications. While I am quite confident in my  skills, the added fact that most required experience (even entry ones)   made me confused towards what should I do.

Given that I can't afford not having a job after graduating (hopefully this summer), what do you think the best approach is?"

I (21M) am extremely confused about my future. Currently, I am studying Economics and Business Administration on university, and will finish my Bachelor‚Äôs degree by summer. For now, I wish to study a Master‚Äôs degree in International Marketing, hopefully specializing in the tech industry, as it is my major interest and knowledge skill. I live in Northern Denmark in a small city. However, despite having the educational goals set, I am worried about recieving a job after my degree. I was never employed by anyone, even when I was younger, as I was too busy doing my freetime hobbies, and made money off YouTube videos on that hobby for some years, which was enough for a younger me to sufficiently finance those hobbies, which was my only interest at the time.

I do wish to find an internship, but it seems like every company wants either absurdly high grades, or an absurdly impressive resum√©, one which I do not have, also due to the fact that i‚Äôm still young and didnt have much time to develop it so far. So, in essence, I feel quite stuck in that position. My dad works in a succesful medium-sized IT company as an engineer and project manager, and I did project work through university with them previously, and hopefully that could be an entry for a great business internship. As my study is very internationally based, I hear alot of people claim, that moving to another country is the best option to expand your resum√©. However, as for now, that step doesn‚Äôt seem feasible, not only to mention economically (how can any student afford this?), and because of the fact I would have to leave my whole family and social network behind. I would like to recieve any advice on how to better my position, as to get the most friction-free transition to job opportunities in the future. What could you guys reccommend to expand my resum√©? I know I am able to adapt to most tasks in great detail and i‚Äôm very open to try anything!"

I was 18 and thought I could conquer the world. I was in the upper 15% of my graduating class with a pretty good SAT and I wanted the best out of my continued education. Not having a clue what my passion was, I googled things like ""Highest paying college majors"" simply because my only criteria for a line of work was success. I landed on Computer Science which was high on every list, and subsequently googled ""Best schools for Computer Science"". My very generous parents took me to tour various colleges within the top 50, all of which we could not afford.

I landed on a school for stupid reasons. It was one of the better ranked CS schools I was accepted to and it had a great party scene with a lot of pretty (But heartless) girls. I did not pay attention to the cost or the inevitable loan debt I would accrue, it didn't matter because CS is such a high paying field right? Well I left for school and began the worst year of my life so far. I was deeply depressed. I was failing and doing poorly in classes, I found it nearly impossible to make like minded friends, I was far from my family, and most of all I just hated my life. I contemplated suicide as I struggled with the reality of things, and if not for a pretty girl (now my wife) nearly 500 miles away, I might not be here now.

She instilled the idea of a transfer of schools into my mind. I knew that I wanted to be closer to home and subsequently closer to her. My GPA restricted my options but I found a spot in a local city close to where I am from. I transferred and left my past behind me. It was about half the price, which still was not a concern to me, but I am so glad this was the case now. I thrived here. Many semesters above a 3.5, a long term and healthy relationship, regularly seeing family, tons of friends, and internships while I studied. It was so much better, and I was so much happier.

CS was no longer a means to make money, it was a passion. I started learning in my free time, which I thought I'd never want to do. I explored so many subsets of CS through YouTube and [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) and just genuinely wanted to build software to solve problems. I found my way onto a full stack and let my creativity and ingenuity run wild.

I graduated, and remained in the same city I transferred to. A great paying job, but a lot of unfortunate debt. I refinanced my loans and after being granted 15 hours of overtime and working 55 hours a week, I'd have them paid off within the decade, lowering hours as my salary increased. I married the beautiful woman that inspired me to be where I am today, and I cannot express how great my life has turned around.

To all those looking at colleges or making a decision, use me as an example. Do what is RIGHT and check the boxes for the attributes that matter. Care not about some blogger's rankings of the institution or how much fun you will have at a party, and more about what is financially viable and will inspire you to get where you want to be. Your college education is what you make it. The work you put in while being there determines what you get out of it. You could go to the best school or the worst school, if you aren't inspired to do the work, nothing good can come of it. At this point in my career, I know people without a degree at all, out-earning ivy leaguers.

I wish everyone a wonderful and prosperous New Year, and all those deciding on their school the best of luck in their search. It will be a remarkable 4 years and an awakening of who you choose to become for the rest of your life."

I am currently finishing a master's degree in Cybersecurity, and as the next step seeking employment for when I graduate.  I have a 4.0 GPA and unlike my classmates, I am always doing Cybersecurity related things outside of class.  Created a virtual lab with VMs to participate in CTF competitions.  Learning to perfect my knowledge of Linux and Command Line.  Trying my best to learn programming as time allows.  My point is that I really am a great candidate for an entry level Cybersecurity position.  I am looking to get an internship for this summer as I finish school in Fall 2020 and after graduation, a permanent position.  I would really like to work for the government.  My question is basically whether this is possible after I tell you a few things.  

I grew up in a Prescription pill household.  Xanax.  Dexdrine.  Oxycodone out the wazoo.  You name it.  From a pretty early age, I was given drugs to cope with life.  My mom didnt mean any harm, but quickly I learned: cant sleep, take xanax.  Hurt your finger.  Take some percacet.  So from a pretty early age I was starting to develop dependency.  Throughout my later teenage years and early twenties, my mother continued to supply me with percocet.  I honestly didnt see this as wrong; I thought that since I had depression, this was as good an approach as any.  My mom didnt know any better.  Fast forward to age 25.  Both mom and dad were very sick.  I was running their business and using their pills.  Well, withing two months of each other, they both died and then my grandma.  Left with a dependency on pain pills and nowhere to get them and of course no money, I went through some hard times, eventually finding work to support myself, but the drug habit continued and I continued my career now on Heroin which I found was much cheaper than pain pills.  Also, which I neglected to mention, my parents and I were using my personal credit cards to pay for the restaurant equipment for the business, as we were completely broke.  When they died, they left me with a mountain of debt, which I still have, and this destroyed my credit, which is only now beginning to rebuild.

After meeting the girl of my dreams and marrying her and a couple of rehabs later, I have been clean 1 year and a half, but with the support of Methadone Maintenance, and have been stable enough to really succeed in my master's program.  I will never go back to a life of drugs and risk losing my wife and my life.  My question is this; do I have a shot of passing a background check and/or being considered by a Gov Agency like the Dept of Defense, Homeland Security, CIA, FBI, CISA etc?  I have put all of my eggs in one basket with the Cybersecurity thing, and the government is the only route I know to an actually entry level Cybersecurity career.  At the very least, to suceed in Cybersecurity, one needs a Government Clearance.  Is this something I could hope to obtain, or are my dreams shattered?

Thanks,

Grateful Addict in Recovery"

I'm currently deciding between doing a 6 month boot camp (Epicodus) or just finishing a bachelors. I have an associate's degree (initially for nursing) but I've been on a 2 year break from school.

I've had a couple passengers (I drive Lyft to pay the bills) tell me that they finished a bootcamp program and landed a healthy job as a developer.

So my question is: is it worth spending $8k for a bootcamp program that basically guarantees a paid internship position? Or would I be better off finishing a bachelor's and trying to apply for an internship while finishing my degree? Programming isn't necessarily my passion, but it's the highest paying industry I feel I would be qualified for in the meantime, while I pursue something more fulfilling."

Been debating for a few years whether I should be getting my MBA and hoping to get some insights from you folks. I have been thinking of doing it to enhance my business acumen and most importantly build my network and see what else is out there. My current profile is:

\- 31 years of age

\- Undergrad in Engineering (first 2 years was shit GPA, last 2 years \~ 3.5) from a Top Canadian Uni

\- 6.5 years of work experience + 1.5 years of Internships

\- Experience in consumer goods (CPG) industry

\- Currently working as a Senior Manager, manage a team of 7, budget of $1M, etc

\- Make $130 base + bonus + stocks + some other benefits

\- Post MBA plan: I love the industry but open to trying new ones (consulting, tech etc.)

I think I am doing well in my career so far. My VP adores me and I know I am being groomed to become a Director in my current company in probably \~ 1-1.5 year. I love my job, I have a massive responsibility and I love my team. I guess I feel I need to broaden my skills, increase my business acumen and build my network. My goal is to hold an executive position in my 40s and I am hoping an MBA can help me get there (and distinguish myself from my peers).

I have written GMAT once and got a 660 which isn't enough so I am thinking of writing again. With hard work and some luck, I think I can break 700. I also know there is no point in getting an MBA unless it's from a Top 20 and because my first two years GPA was shit, I am worried I won't even be considered.

I have stellar recommendations, won employee of the year, have 3 promotions in my 6.5 years experience. Plus my company **may** be willing to pay for me if I get into a Top school - but my CGPA doesn't even break 3.0.

What are your thoughts? Thanks all."

ejhwx3,1,2020-01-03,"Is there such a thing as bad ""experience"" that could hinder finding other jobs? Not sure how to go forward",NotAn0thaThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ejhwx3/is_there_such_a_thing_as_bad_experience_that/,"So I feel like I've fucked up. I'll keep it brief and try to keep the personal shit to a minimum, but I truly feel like I've ruined any future chances at getting a better job. Here's a little background:

I graduated early 2017 with very subpar grades in software engineering and made the mistake of not lining up an internship or job after graduation. The only experience I got during college was working for the math department one summer creating a Matlab program for some research institution. It was really basic linear algebra and signal processing stuff where the math was written by someone else and I just adapted it to a GUI, so I didn't do much in that regard. Anyways, after graduation I kept sending out applications until I got one job interview where they gave me a ""trial run"" where I worked there for a week to see how things went. I was ultimately not hired due to lack of experience. Not long after I had a major life event that did not allow me to search for work for the rest of that year which really damaged my self-esteem as time went on. Luckily a family friend helped me out and put in a good word for me at an oil and gas automation company which landed me a job as a system integrator. It's not what I went to school for but at least it was something. This is where things really started to go downhill. This is a small company where I only work under one person and that person happens to be overworked while at the same time building off of a set of code that he inherited from the previous person that was in his position who had no prior experience. I can't express how much of a mess all of the code is and due to lack of time we can't just rebuild everything and end up just building on top of borderline unreadable spaghetti code, but at the same time I don't feel I have enough experience to rebuild everything even if I had all of the time in the world. It has not been a good experience. On top of this, no matter how much I ask I am only given a small set of work at a time due to the guy I work under constantly having to take calls to diagnose technical problems in the field along with the workload he consistently has to deal with. At the beginning, he wanted to take me under his wing and teach me how everything works but he stopped doing that completely and 99% I'm left having to figure out an entire codebase that I know absolutely nothing about. In the past year I have barely written any code whatsoever because of this and because of the nature of the HMI software we use. I thought that things might change in the future. I told myself to just give it a year, but I've felt more and more useless since then. After about a year I tried to start studying on my own because I don't want to be stuck here. I've already wasted enough time here and  I feel like I have forgotten everything I learned in school. When I started trying to study on my own again it felt like starting from scratch and it's been rough. Now this month I'm approaching the two year mark of my employment and I feel like I can't take another year of this both mentally and because I'm being paid &lt;30k a year and can't sustain myself financially. I just want out and to shed all of the bad coding practices I've picked up along the way.

Now here is my issue, I feel like this two years of ""experience"" is completely worthless. I have not learned anything in that time period and my skills have actually regressed to the point that I do not feel comfortable applying anywhere. I feel that if I apply, my two years of experience looks to an employer like I should know what I'm doing which couldn't be further from the truth. Is there a point where ""experience"" can actually be detrimental to finding another job due to expectations from your resume being way higher than what you're capable of? At this point I'm just completely at a loss as to how to move forward.

I hope this doesn't come off as whiny or that I feel like I'm too good for the job that I currently have. I know how lacking my skills are and am in no way trying to bash my employer. I just want a way out and to actually be proud of my work and feel like I'm contributing something to society. I went to school to work in a team while following a development model, not pick up a multitude of bad coding practices while constantly building on top of spaghetti code

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr I have been at a job for two years where my skills have regressed and I am scared to apply elsewhere for fear of my ""experience"" making me seem more capable than I actually am and I don't know where to go from here besides self study until I'm comfortable enough to apply elsewhere"

ejiosq,1,2020-01-03,How important are data structures and algorithms for someone who wants to do signal processing/computer vision/deep learning related job? Can I get a job without deep understanding of these?,ai_research_purposes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ejiosq/how_important_are_data_structures_and_algorithms/,"Hey r/cscareerquestions!  A bit of background: My undergrad was in Mechanical Engineering and for my Masters I decided to change to an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Program but my research and classes are definitely more oriented towards the fields mentioned above (DIP, DSP, CV, DL, ML, ...).

I am passionate about what I do (Computer Vision for Biosignal processing), but currently if I have an idea I just go for the fastest implementation I can come up with and then from there clean up my code, but so far I have never needed to worry about optimization of the code and space/time complexity, if I'm using the appropiate data structures/algorithms and the likes. I have never taken any classes on these so I plan to take one in the next semester to know what people are talking about when they talk about a tree, or heuristic algorithms and the the like, but to be honest from my (admittedly) shallow experience with these concepts/ideas I feel pretty averse towards them since the way I reason around and tackle a problem is fundamentally different to the approaches I see described for these leetcode like DS/Algorithms questions.

I always imagined I could work in teams where I would be focused on coming up with an idea, implement it, and someone more experienced with these could come up and optimize my code. But today I had an interview for an internship where they asked me to define a function to do a tree traverse or something like that which obviously I didn't know how to do and then they kept stressing how it's absolutely vital to be well versed in data structures and algorithms if you want any job in these fields. I feel pretty conflicted about this since I have made a lot of progress in my coding abilities in the past few months, but I'm definitely far from having the cleanest and I don't think I'll ever be able to write as clean and optimized code as CS students who have taken a whole undergrad load of courses on these concepts.

Sorry for the essay. I just felt a bit overwhelmed and disappointed with the direction that interview took."

ejk53q,2,2020-01-03,"27M, expensive degree in History that I don't know how to use, skilled at writing but no idea what to do with it",narok_kurai,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ejk53q/27m_expensive_degree_in_history_that_i_dont_know/,"I'll admit that I have been the cause of most of my own problems. Anxiety, procrastination and poor time management have caused me to miss a lot of important career and personal development milestones. A bright mind in high school, I got into a top tier university and immediately began to flounder as I struggled to meet deadlines or remain focused on any subject for very long. It ended up taking me almost eight years to complete a four-year degree in History, which was the only subject which I consistently enjoyed studying, but honestly I have very little interest in pursuing as a career in teaching or academia. Now I'm back at home, living with my parents, looking at my looming 30s and wondering if I'm ever going to get myself out of this hole.

My greatest strength is my skill at writing. It's something that I've been cultivating for a long time and been consistently praised for--even in rejection letters I have been told that my writing is phenomenal, but I'm not a good fit for such-and-such reasons, etc.

Unfortunately, the most valuable secondary skills for writing are exactly the ones I lack most. Time management, consistent work ethic, self-motivation are all things which I have tried and failed to cultivate, again and again and again and again. I can do good work when someone tells me exactly what to do and how to do it, but it seems to me that any idiot can do that, and they don't need ""Exceptional written communication skills"" on their resume to do it. I've had a handful of marketing and copy writing internships in the past, and felt like a complete failure in all of them, as I was once again unable to complete my assignments on time, and felt creatively empty doing it. I hate marketing. It makes me feel like a con man.

So now I'm stuck. Marketing is the biggest game in professional writing, but I don't like it and I'm not good at it. Everything else seems too nebulous and inaccessible; I hardly even know where to start to look. I've tried writing novels and short stories on my own time, but again my struggles with motivation and time management held me back, and now I've got a dozen half-finished rough drafts and nothing to show for any of it. Even if I did, making a career as a self-published author is about as big a pipe dream as any. I just want something that I can do good work in and feel good about. More importantly, I want money, so I can finally move out of my childhood bedroom and get started on my life.

What do I do? Where do I start? I'm sorry if the question is too ambiguous, but I've been feeling very ambiguous for a very long time, and it's eating me alive."
ejk8ta,3,2020-01-03,Name and Shame: Avanade,LinusCatTips,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ejk8ta/name_and_shame_avanade/,"I'll start by saying that Avanade has definitely given me the most ""interesting"" interviewing experience I've ever had. For some context, I'm a Computer Science student graduating next May studying in a somewhat well-known school in Western Canada.

I started out by applying to Avanade's New Grad Software Consultant position in Toronto sometime in September. After a few days, the recruiter scheduled a 30 minute phone call with me, which went pretty well. During the call, the recruiter mentioned that the base salary would have been $67,700 CAD and was not negotiable. This was the first red flag, and although I was a bit bummed out by this, I still felt lucky to have an interview that early into the hiring season.

The next round was a technical phone screen with a Senior Consultant that lasted for around an hour. I was asked about my previous internships, technical trivia about Node.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, .NET, and then two easy Leetcode questions. I wasn't able to answer all of the trivia questions, but the interviewer explained the answers he was looking for, so I felt like that was a good learning experience.

A few days later, the recruiter told me I made it to the final round that would have taken place a month later. I was pretty excited to have a final round interview and to visit Toronto for the first time in my life. I confirmed that I would be available for the final round, and the recruiter told me they were going to book flights soon.

This is where the fun begins. Two weeks passed by and I didn't hear back, so I started getting confused by this point. I sent the recruiter several follow-up emails over the span of a week and she finally replied the week before the interview. The recruiter claimed that the business was not comfortable booking flights for anyone at the time, and that she would've followed up with me on the following Monday. Two months have passed and she never followed up.

I was a bit shocked to hear this because Avanade is a consulting company that regularly flies out their employees. I'm not sure what happened behind the scenes in Avanade, but I felt like it was very disrespectful of them to offer me an interview and then decide that plane tickets were too expensive."
ejkd01,1428,2020-01-03,Name and Shame: Home Depot,throwawaycscq95,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ejkd01/name_and_shame_home_depot/,"This was for data analytics/business analytics in the corporate office. Was contacted by a recruiter after applying that they wanted a phone interview. Had the interview (purely behavioral) and it went great. They told me they wanted to fly me to Atlanta. Awesome! 

In the coming days they set up a flight hotel room etc. Everything went great. Had two interviews (both 45 minutes) with two people. First went pretty well (7/10) second one went really well (9/10). I was told they would get back to me within a few weeks. 

A few days later I receive an email from the head recruiter saying that my recruiter will send feedback next week. Great- this is it. I then open my email one morning- for her to tell me to wait a few more weeks. Great. 

At this point I have a final round interview with a telecom company. I let Home Depot know and they told me to notify them if I get an offer. They ended up giving me an offer and I let Home Depot know. My recruiter said we would be in contact soon. 

7 days later and I still haven‚Äôt heard from them and I told my recruiter I might have to sign my current offer. She said she wanted to call me. We talked and she recommended I sign my current offer and if I get Home Depot to renege. I was admittedly surprised she said this. I never want to renege on an offer and at this points it‚Äôs been quite a while.  (2+ weeks) 

About 10 days later I was contacted and she wanted to speak with me- finally. She then calls me to tell me to wait until Mid January. Keep in mind this was mid December when she told me this. I was floored. But I decided to wait. 

Finally, I emailed my recruiter yesterday. She wanted to call me. She called me today to tell me that I did great in the interview and the hiring managers liked me but a returning intern accepted a returning offer- and thus they couldn‚Äôt offer me a position. After almost nearly two months of waiting and being strung along I was declined. 

I‚Äôm not upset- I‚Äôm actually really excited about my current offer. But I was shocked a Fortune 500 company could be so disorganized. Furthermore, it shouldn‚Äôt take nearly two months- for a rejection. 

Just my two cents"
ejkmcu,0,2020-01-03,How do I (17M) deal with my mother (45F) who there‚Äôs so much to say about?,AndrewLally,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ejkmcu/how_do_i_17m_deal_with_my_mother_45f_who_theres/,"I‚Äôve been posting quite a bit about my mother, and I figured there‚Äôs always more and more to post about, so thats what I‚Äôm doing.

My mom makes a big fuss over a lot of things that I do and say, most of which there‚Äôs no point in her getting so mad at me for and I don‚Äôt understand what her problem is. I‚Äôll share a couple examples below:

1. I had just met a black man who had worked for my dad the other day. He was very, very polite and kind, far more than probably anyone I had ever met. I decided to tell my mom about him, and I said I met Jim and he was a good person and very polite. As soon as she heard me say the words ‚Äúgood person‚Äù and ‚Äúpolite‚Äù, she started labeling my compliment as racist, and she lectured me for about half an hour and then made me read some online resource. Apparently, it‚Äôs racist to call a black person polite. She said I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised that black people can be polite, which I was confused about. If anything, I was surprised that any human being is as polite as that man, regardless of whether he‚Äôs black or white.

2. I was talking to my aunt the other day and she asked us what it is that my sister specializes in for her social work intern. Knowing nothing about the health or social work area, I didn‚Äôt know. My aunt brought up some fancy terms, I think one of them was pediatrician and there were a couple others, I really have no idea. My mom, who is a nurse with a degree in public health, wasn‚Äôt there. The next morning I was talking to my mom, and I brought up how aunt was wondering what my sister was specializing in. I told my mom i was unsure but thought it might be pediatrics or gynecology, which I had no idea what either were, and still only have the faintest idea. My mom got so pissed off at me when I said ‚Äúgynecology‚Äù. She said I was making fun of it, I should show it more respect, and that it is a fully competent and good field of health, all the while I still don‚Äôt know what it means. I told her I didn‚Äôt know what and means and still don‚Äôt, and she said that in all her years of nursing she‚Äôs never met anyone who doesn‚Äôt know what it is and said I was lying about not knowing it. She accused my school, an all-boys private school my parents wanted me to go to, of teaching kids that gynecology was stupid, which I think gave me a little hint as to what gynecology is, because my mother is an avid prolifer whereas my high school is an all-boys Catholic high school. Regardless, she got pissed over me saying that, for whatever reason.

3. I was driving my mom home one day in the car, and she had asked me what I want to do after high school. I told her that I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but somehow I want to go to college and then after get a blue-collar job. As soon as I said ‚Äúblue-collar‚Äù, she got pissed off at me once again. She said that the phrase ‚Äúblue-collar‚Äù is derogatory, and I should show more respect to people in skilled trades. She spent a half hour lecturing me on why I shouldn‚Äôt have said ‚Äúblue collar‚Äù and why it is am insult. I think part of her also got upset because, with my sister in social work and brother in biomedical engineering, she wanted me to follow suit and get a white collar job.

Along with going after everything I say, I find that my mother has created a narrative that I hate her and that I show her no respect. I believe she sees all the conflict between me and her, which is nearly always caused by her finding some sort of fault in what I say, like I just gave some examples of. I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt make her nitpicking and ridiculing turn into conflict, but it always does. In each of these examples above, I‚Äôve asked her what‚Äôs wrong and told her I think she‚Äôs overreacting... and she doesn‚Äôt take that well at all. She says that what I said is rude, disrespectful, and hateful... and I end up just giving up. I apologize even though I can‚Äôt really mean it because I don‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm really apologizing for. She then goes on crying and pinning it all on me. I feel terrible for what I‚Äôve done, but I really don‚Äôt understand. I wish I did, but I don‚Äôt, and I think she may be the problem.

I also feel as though she doesn‚Äôt trust me, and I think that‚Äôs true for all of my siblings. My father even admits that my mother doesn‚Äôt trust anyone. My father says she trusts us to have good intentions, but from my experience, I don‚Äôt believe that either. From reading my texts over my shoulder to always asking me what I‚Äôm doing on my phone to tracking where I am on my phone, I don‚Äôt believe she trusts me at all.

I‚Äôve learned not to engage in political discussions with her, because we disagree on nearly everything, and she calls all of my political views hateful, which leads to arguments and fights. I‚Äôll shut up, and I have, but she always says stuff that in my head I struggle to not laugh at (I know I need to work on that). She told my father that if he voted for a certain political candidate she‚Äôd divorce him, and she told me something similar, except of course not a divorce... yet she puts her favorite political stickers in public view in our kitchen and her and my brother constantly talk politics and blast the debates when they‚Äôre on or whatever. I feel like it‚Äôs hypocritical, but she‚Äôs my mom, so I can‚Äôt do anything but shut up, and so I do.

It‚Äôs come to a point where I try to avoid her. I don‚Äôt want to have to, but I don‚Äôt see any other option. If I‚Äôm around her and I talk chances are she‚Äôll find something I say to fight about, and if I‚Äôm around her and I don‚Äôt say anything, she accuses me of giving her the silent treatment. 

There was one time, a couple weeks ago, when I was sleeping in the car on the way home, and when we got home we went in side. I said ‚Äúhi‚Äù to my sister who I hadn‚Äôt seen yet that day. My mom who was going back out, this time to the store, yelled at me for giving her the ‚Äúsilent treatment‚Äù and talking to my sister but not her. For the record, I had talked to my mom that morning, and it ended with my example on the list above where she got upset because I said ‚Äúgynecology‚Äù. I decided I‚Äôd be better being quiet for a few minutes, but then fell asleep on the way there and way back. She yelled at me and started crying heavily and slammed the door because of this.

In conclusion, I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I need as much advice as y‚Äôall can give me, please. Thank you very much! Let me know if y‚Äôall need clarification or anything. Thank you."
ejkz1j,5,2020-01-03,Grad School for Computer Science vs. Air Traffic Controller,cr035,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/ejkz1j/grad_school_for_computer_science_vs_air_traffic/,"I'm 27 recently returned from working abroad for almost four years. My previous experiences don't translate to anything meaningful in America so I'm essentially starting from scratch. I am from the nyc region and went to a liberal arts college (i got one of those worthless degrees as they're called) and soon starting a what I should've stuck to during my undergrad years, a stem degree. However, I have also been in the pipeline for an air traffic controller job for over 1.5 years.

I have paid off my undergrad debt from working abroad and have some savings to sustain me for roughly a year if I decide to go back to school. I have been working random odd jobs for the past 8 months saving aggressively which will go to either grad school or just plain savings. 

The tradeoff are: 

MSc in CS: 

* start time: in three weeks
* total length: 2-2.5 years (first semester taking transitional courses)
* cost: roughly $65k debt
* salary potential: $120k-140k (assuming I nail internships + work on personal projects) - feel free to bash me if I'm being overly optimistic regarding potential

Note: I have beginner coding experience, have spent several months self-learning on the side + taken high level math during my undergrad time. 

ATC training: 

* start time: unknown + subject to interruptions by Trump shutting down the government, further delaying application process or completely pausing training (delayed my background check by 6 months during the previous shutdown). But I'm towards the very end of the application process.
* total length: at least 6-8 months paid training in Oklahoma then Long Island placement (HCOL). 
* cost: time spent in the limbo waiting + spent hundreds if not $1000+ of dollars in the process already (flying from asia to complete in-person requirements among other things)
* salary potential: starting $57k increases with on the job training certifications by steps to $90k, $120k, $140k, $175k, $227k within 2 years on average + overtime that everyone does cause facilities are understaffed

I know it seems like I already chose to go on the computer science path and clearly i'm still clinging to the hope of having a cushy (but high stress) government job. Honestly, I'm not necessarily overly passionate for either careers except for the fact that they are high yielding professions, but I also feel like I wasted enough time playing games and trying to ""find what I love"" rather than just doing what the market demands and what is a return on investment decision. I grew up poor and my family is still very much working class, doing what you love is overrated for us, we need financial security. I don't have kids and I'm not married. 

 Any experiences from folks in either careers as a software engineer or air traffic controller? Tips going forward?"

i am a freshman who just transferred into ece/software for second semester am planning to go to my school's upcoming spring career fair!

i haven't taken any cs courses yet so im not gunning to get a big internship or anything but i am currently trying to craft my resume so that i can present myself as well as i can to employers at the fair!

questions i had that hopefully can be answered:

* i'm a beginner to programming, and i just finished up a poker game in java (random moves, AI is extremely dumb). Looking at other threads on here, it seems that tic-tac-toe, chess, etc. are pretty common games done in school and weren't worth putting on resumes, so would my small game be worth putting on there? if not, would adding a GUI (still in progress)  and implementing machine learning (this is a hopeful addition, not close to being done yet) make it a decent project to present?
* what do companies at these fairs look for to determine competency? i'm currently doing an online courses over data structures and algorithms and will be fairly knowledgeable in Java, but other than that i dont know any technologies like react, node.js, etc. &lt;- are these something that recruiters are looking for? 
* if i do need to know these technologies, what would be some small, neat projects that i could work on in order to learn them? 
* lastly is the resume advice threads still active? i'd like any advice on crafting my resume with the things i have now, but not sure where to ask

Thank you for any advice!"
ejl757,2,2020-01-03,Am I doing career suicide?,Rivyan,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ejl757/am_i_doing_career_suicide/,"Hi all!

It's gonna be a bit long winged, so thanks to anybody who stick with me till the end of it.

Background:
I have a Bsc degree in Civil Engineering with Surveying and GIS specialization. (Most of my knowledge is based around GIS: ArcGIS, QGIS). I graduated in June 2018 in an Eastern European country. As the economy and political state of it is not really great, my wife and I decided to move to the UK. Our idea was to move when one of us finds a good job (She is a flood modeller with MSc in infrastructure and water engineering).

She found a good position around July 2018, in a smaller city in East Anglia. Because of that we moved here in early September. Her workplace is simply great, she has great managers, graduate program which help her develop. I on the other hand wasn't that lucky, I couldn't find anything related to my field until February 2019. I worked as a mobile mapping surveyor, using top level gear for scanning. The pay was rather bad (so low I couldn't pay a small 1 bedroom apartment by myself, whilst my partner could do it easily) and my job needed me to travel a lot on really short notices (like I have been told to go work in Ireland for 2 weeks 3 days before the leave). It started to wear me down and put a pressure on my relationship too, as we couldn't plan anything properly, since we didn't know when I had to leave for several days. 

I started looking for another position, but sadly it's nigh impossible to find a GIS related job in our area. A few positions popped up in the last 1.5 year, but my experience wasn't enough to anywhere (did around 8 months of internships over the course of my education, all related to my field). 

In October I found a position with better pay as a Tech Support for a Surveying equipment company. With this salary we could plan around, have a kid, which is our long held dream. The thing is, I don't see any way to move forward from this position later on. It's a small department, and the experience I gain is only related to this company's kits. 

I'm afraid if I stay here let's say 2 years so avoid hopping between jobs too often, I won't be able to ever work in my chosen field. I have been told all along my education, that GIS engineers are in need, and it wouldn't be hard to find a job on the international market. 

We wouldn't like to try long distance, since paying 2 apartments would be a financial sinkhole (and we are saving for a baby), and she can't change her job until she finishes her graduate program (around October 2020). Her company has many offices around the UK, but she has a really good manager and we don't know if she could change to a different office or not.

I don't really know what would be a good path for me from here and I feel a tad lost.

Any advice, idea would be much appreciated...

Thanks a lot!"

I'm a 25 year old project coordinator at a big biotech company in San Francisco with a biochemistry undergraduate degree. I was hired right out of college for an internship then bounced around internally to get a contractor position and was recently converted to a full time employee.

I was initially planning to go back to school for a masters or phd program at the end of my contract but now that I'm full time I get tuition assistance and might switch gears to become a project manager and get more into the business side of the biotech world.

Has anyone else made this kind of a career progression and would have advice for someone who is progressing in this kind of a field? What cloud an mba do for someone with this kind of a background and what opportunities can an mba bring someone with a science background?

Hello, I'm an Italian undergraduate student.

My profile:

Bsc Statistical Science from University of Bologna (best public italian university for international rankings)

GPA: 29.59/30¬† - top 1-5 % of my class -¬† projected first class degree

No relevant internship

GMAT to take soon ( not aiming high cause I have less then one month to prepare)

pretty strong references

I've got the maximum grads with some honours in all the most important quantitative courses taken.

Ielts score 7 with at least 6.5 in all the sub-scores.  


I'd like to continue my studies outside Italy with a master's degree in Quantitative Finance/ Financial Engineering.  


I  worked my ass off during the last three years in order to make some  money aside for my postgraduate study but I don't have a strong family  support, so it's really important for me to start working right after the master.  


Until now I applied for:  


Quantitative Finance - eth/uzh - 1.5yr

Financial Engineering - EPFL - 2yr

Risk Management and Financial Engineering - Imperial - 1yr  


I'd like to ask you:   


1) What you consider the best between these three, how do you rank them

2) What are my chances to get into these programs, for yours experience or just by your opinion

3)  I'd like to receive some tips for good masters in europe for QF/FE, taking  into consideration that my Gmat score will probably be between 620-680."

I know these are such common feelings, but I don't know what to do about it. The feeling that whatever you do, there's always someone better.   


Maybe I'm just feeling pretty discouraged from a tough internship hunt and I'm seriously afraid that if I don't land something, my career upon graduation will be absolutely screwed. I've applied to 100 positions so far, and I've had a few interviews with competitive and/or big companies, so the chances of success are pretty small. I've started putting more focus on smaller companies but I'm wondering if it's already too late? I've signed up for my school's spring semester career fair in February and I'm hoping to land something before then, but if not, it's my best shot. It's a sense of dread where the clock is ticking and if I don't get industry-related job experience before I graduate, then I'm going to end up jobless when I finish school.

Looking at engineering Reddits hasn't really helped things, people in every subreddit says that their field has dried up, or that even with a good GPA and EC's it's impossible to land a good entry level job, or that even with an internship it's still difficult. I tell myself that there's plenty of people who have successful careers despite ""starting late"", and that there's plenty of people out there with the same struggles as I do, and that academic-wise, I'm doing pretty good. I've held a summer job where I taught kids some techy stuff and I'm doing independent research in a lab, although the latter doesn't really help my imposter syndrome because everything is so niche and complex and I feel like everyone there is so much smarter than me.  


But compared to those who already have internships or those who can achieve the same results in class as I do even with less effort, I feel like I'm nothing. And I can't really talk about these troubles with many friends, because I dislike hearing the ""you'll be fine"" or ""you're doing better than many people"" type responses. I want to figure out how to improve myself. I've signed up for my school's career services for resumes and mock interviews and all that jazz. Now that my hardest classes are out of the way, I'll be networking more and doing more EC's. But I don't know how to get out of this mental rut and I don't know if my fears about my careers are justified or if I'm in big trouble and I'm not sure if I'm missing anything major.  


TLDR: Imposter syndrome, college junior studying engineering. Struggling with finding internships and worried about my career as a result. Good GPA + research experience but there's so many other people much smarter than me. Made a plan for self improvement but still struggling with self esteem and fear of the future."
ejn8rs,1,2020-01-03,Help with my first office job,glowy660,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ejn8rs/help_with_my_first_office_job/,"Hey guys so I‚Äôve recently got an internship style job at a company that a family friend owns. For context I‚Äôm currently about to start my 2nd semester of college for mech engineering. 

I‚Äôve honestly been feeling super useless there and I feel like I have no real purpose being there. I‚Äôm super grateful for having been given such an amazing opportunity but I feel like I was kind of thrust into the position with no real idea what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing. On my first day my boss gave me a general outline on what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing. I‚Äôm supposed to be helping with IT and ironing out issues that arise with computers in the office as well as helping collect tax documents and some accounting. 

The list of tasks my boss (family friend) gave me were pretty basic and I completed them very quickly on my 1st week then on my 2nd week when pretty much the whole the office was on vacation I just kind of sat around with nothing to do. I feel like I‚Äôm a burden on all the other employees since I don‚Äôt know almost anything that they know. I started at the company December 18th so I‚Äôve only been in the company now 3 weeks. The last two weeks that I worked were very slow as no one was in the office because of the holidays and because my list of tasks were very simple. I tried asking if anyone needed help with stuff but it ended up just being a futile attempt as either they didn‚Äôt need any help, I didn‚Äôt have the proper accounts made for me to access the software or that they didn‚Äôt have anything that I could do. So I got a list of somewhat random items for me to complete which included collecting forms, connecting printers, etc. I didn‚Äôt really have anyone to help or much to do after completing the tasks I could (some of the tasks are taking time because people were on vacation and i couldn‚Äôt complete them because of that) so I ended up sitting there trying to learn whatever in order to look busy. I ended up making a report of what I got done that week which I forwarded to my boss, he said it looked good and didn‚Äôt mention anything else. 

I used to work in a restaurant so I‚Äôm very used to knowing what exactly needs to get done because my boss would tell me to exactly what to do, when to clock out, what tasks to switch out etc. but now I feel very lost and quite frankly super anxious because I feel like I‚Äôm disappointing everyone and that I‚Äôm going to get fired. 

I had a chat today with one of the guys in the accounting department and he said that he needed some help with some stuff in accounting, something which my boss had mentioned to me yesterday I said that I‚Äôd be more than happy to help. He ended up saying that it required dedication, motivation and hard work and I said that I am up to the challenge I‚Äôm not sure if I interpreted his tone right but it seemed to me like he was saying that I needed to do something because I wasn‚Äôt doing anything the last two weeks. I‚Äôm about to start my semester next week Monday and I will only be in the office around 12 hours a week and I feel like I‚Äôm not providing any benefit to the company and have been feeling super anxious because I don‚Äôt want to lose this amazing opportunity. I don‚Äôt know what to do in the office, I don‚Äôt know when to clock out because I feel like if I clock out before everyone else they will think I‚Äôm lazy and just skipping work. Is this what office environments are like or am I doing something wrong. Any advice on what to do? Thanks!"
ejna0c,0,2020-01-03,Advise regarding getting an entry level job at Lockheed Martin,misstj555,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ejna0c/advise_regarding_getting_an_entry_level_job_at/,"Hello. I am a Computer Science student. I heard about a company called Lockheed Martin in a history class but I became more interested in working for Lockheed Martin when I learned that there is a Lockheed Martin terminal close by to were I live. Also, they hire Computer Science majors. I applied to six software internships with them and so far I got only one interview with them. It seems  that they really liked all my personal projects but I still got denied the internship (maybe they got someone more qualified/ they were not looking for a lot of people). I was denied two other internships for Lockheed Martin (I didn't get an interview for those positions), one is still under review and the other two positions still say ""applied"" so it's not being reviewed after several months. I am starting to think that I won't get an internship with them. I have looked to other companies but I keep getting denied also. Due to this dilemma, I have a few questions for anyone who has worked with this company before please (sorry, this post is long):



(1) If I can't get an internship somewhere, could Lockheed Martin still hire me for a real entry level position? I have done a research project one summer regarding my field of study and I have a website with all my personal projects on it. Is this is enough or are they looking for other things also? Should I do more projects, try coding compitions and do more research projects? 



(2) I was planning on being a student teacher at a technology bootcamp for kids or working at the IT department at my university. Could this take the place of an internship or help me increase my chances of getting the entry level position?



(3) How difficult is the white board/ technical interview for this company? I did a mock interview  with my school and they said that I did a fine job. However, I have never done a white board interview. After my interview with them on the phone (just questions about polymorphism and Scrum development) , I looked online to see if I could get information about how Lockheed Martin interviews candidates so that I know what this company  is looking for at their company. I read that Lockheed Martin doesn't ask difficult technical questions and ask a lot of STAR questions. Can someone give me more information please?



(4) Part of the reason why I got the interview was because I found the email addresses for several of the recruiters from this company on this website: careershift.com (my school gives students a paid subscription to the website). So, I emailed  them and one of them got me an interview. If I am looking for a real entry level position, would it be ok to email them again in the future? I don't want to bother them but I don't know how else to network with employeers from the company.



(5) Any advice on how to network with this company? I signed up for job alerts for Lockheed Martin (which is not really networking) and signed up for something on the Lockheed Martin website called ""The Talent Network"". I don't know if this and the fact that I interviewed them before could increase my chances of at least getting another chance at an interview with them (the interview does not guarantee that I will get the job but I just wanted to know if the would give me a chance).



If anyone can answer one or more of these questions (especially if it's someone who worked with Lockheed Martin before) I will greatly appreciate it. Thank You."

ejof8y,1,2020-01-03,Should I attempt to find a new job after I graduate?,tKLogicTA,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ejof8y/should_i_attempt_to_find_a_new_job_after_i/,"So today, I learned that my employers purposely hired me late enough so they don‚Äôt have to give me a raise or bonus now. Verbally promised one. Yup, should have been in writing... I was hired first week of July and now they told me I don‚Äôt get a chance for a raise after my 1 year anniversary July 2020, only until January 2021. 

Honestly, the company IT wise was setup pretty poorly, I pretty much setup all of domain policies and active directory permissions. I managed all the o365 licensing and accounts and been reviewing unnecessary licensing. There have been over 100... I setup all new computers and replacements, they initially bought Windows Home.In addition, I assist in setting up new locations, just phones and switches. 

I‚Äôm also the main help desk person for 500 people doing 95% of the work. The 5% are executives so that goes to manager which I may end up doing while he does the talking. 

All of this for 14 an hr... now I had expected to at least be able to negotiate but since I was entry level, there was no negotiating. I feel like I could be making more. 

My previous internships in IT made me 12, 15, 17. Help Desk, Sys/Network Admin. These were all full time, 40 hrs a week, I spent about 4 months at the first one, 8 months at the second one then 1 year at the 3rd one. They told me those experiences didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcount‚Äù in the real world. K. I‚Äôm a senior doing my bachelors in IT, I have 1 unnecessary cert now. Didn‚Äôt have time for more, car accident got in the way. 

So I took this job because it was literally 5 mins away from my apartment and 5 mins away from my college. Allowing me to get more experience while finishing up school. They made it sound like I could really grow so I took it, not really understanding how bad it was. Like how does a company operate without domain for 5 years, I don‚Äôt know in being so wasteful with their spending. 

I‚Äôm graduating in May. I feel like I could do better overall and they don‚Äôt value me as much as I do myself. My VP told me I was doing an exceptional job but he doesn‚Äôt work with me directly. Even the performance reviews indicted I had a high level of technical knowledge. I picked up on everything with little training from my supervisor, just learning how some medical software works. I even automate a lot of my job at this point, computer setup, and accounts creation. 

In the end, should I try to find a new job in May? It would be 8 full months until I could a raise and I have no idea if it would be enough. Does having worked at 5 companies in 5 years raise red flags even if it were some internship and crappy restaurant? Am I just being arrogant and overvaluing myself?"

HI Guys,

So i am currently a 32 year old engineer working as a consultant/software implementation guy for a CAD software here in the USA. I want to switch into programming as a profession/skill set;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few options that i see:

&amp;#x200B;

Try to go the self taught route:

	‚Ä¢ Attempt to show some self made programs to my current employer to solve a few of the outstanding issues coming from clients; 

		‚óã Pros

			\- essentially free

			\- Can find out if I like or despise coding doing it as a hobby for a year or so (I like it now, but hard to see how I will feel a year from now)

		‚óã Cons

			\- two engineers  have successfully transitioned over but you have to be at the HQ in Australia (already done the immigration with a family so not keen on this)

			\- Several have been unsuccessful including a few actively studying Computer Science on the side;

	‚Ä¢ Take a boot camp then apply to a local company

		‚óã Pros

			\- Quick

			\- Cheaper then university

			\- Some appear to be alright with job placement but appear to be mostly web development jobs (nothing wrong with this just appears to be a trend)

		‚óã Cons 

			\- Have to leave my current job and do this full time (have kids to feed)

			\- There appear to be tons of boot camp grads so competition seems heavy

	‚Ä¢ Get a proper 4 year CS degree get internships then eventually a full time job at another company;

		‚óã Pros

			\- Won't be a full 120 credits as I can transition quite a few credits across from my current engineering degree

			\- Better job prospects

			\- Internship opportunities

		‚óã Cons

			\- Have to quit my job at some point since my job is a travel heavy job so cannot guarantee I can attend classes/tests

			\- 2 years full time required to get the degree

			\- Investing in a degree that will teach me a lot of theory and will still need to learn coding on the side so feels like I would do this just to land my first job;

&amp;#x200B;

Currently leaning towards self taught since it is low risk, but feel like I should take some computer science classes since I'm not a spring chicken and should try to transition as quickly as I can before I get ancient;

&amp;#x200B;

If you were in my shoes what route would you take?"

Now everything in my life is even worse.",NobleJuror,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ejrg97/almost_ended_myself_a_couple_months_ago_but/,"last October, I almost killed myself but wound up hospitalized due to last second panic. calling for help made every aspect of my life worse in every regard--my mother hates me and thinks it was all a stunt, my friends never talk to me the same way anymore, I lost my internship and failed out of my classes, my mental health has gotten even worse... Everything right now feels like it did in the days leading up to my hospitalization. im doing the same things--binge eating/starving myself, self-harming, unable to get out of bed all day--but this time im not being stupid about it.

I stopped myself last time for a few reasons, but chief among them was thinking of my online (and only) friends and realizing they'd never know what happened to me. I hate hurting people. I couldn't do that to them, but I had already hurt myself pretty badly and I knew I couldn't stay safe if I was left by myself, hence going to the ER.

This time, I already begun steadily receding from my friendships so no one will care that much when i kill myself. I already know mom won't care--she's more or less told me as much. and yeah, it'll still hurt my friends, but I think they'll be okay eventually. A few of them have taken the initiative and distanced themselves from me all on their own after what happened in October.

I wish things could go back to the way they were before that day. But I can't go back. I can't undo what I did to myself, or to the people who cared about me. The best I can do now is not fuck it up this time around."

- I‚Äôve never worked in the HW industry so maybe some experience would be helpful in choosing my future careers
- Big Brand Name
- access to resources (experienced HW and SW engineers and internal resources for learning)

Box
- I‚Äôve never experienced a smaller company environment (almost startup culture)
- been leaning toward SWE Career in the future (but again never experienced HW work)
- more clout in Silicon Valley for full time recruiting?

My main kicker is that my high school stats kinda suck, but my college profile is pretty good (I think).

**Background:**

* U.S. State: Massachusetts (Just moved, lived in Colorado throughout my entire high school career)
* High School Type: Boarding School (went to Phillips Exeter Academy, a boarding school in New Hampshire)
* Current College and Class: Carnegie Mellon University, 2023 (Freshman)
* Major: Physics, Additional Major in Cognitive Science
* Ethnicity: Hispanic
* Race: White, Asian (Filipino)
* Gender: M

**Objective:**

* SAT I: 1440
* SAT II: 780 Math II, 700 Physics
* Unweighted GPA (HS): 3.35/4.0
* College GPA: 3.81/4.0
* Academic Course-load: 54 hours a week from a credit perspective (one class credit represents one hour of work, whether in-class or not)
* AP: Calc BC (5), AP Lit (4 - not too important, but thought I should mention it)
* Notable Coursework (HS): Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Intro to Continuous Dynamical Systems
* Awards: 5 publications (1 as a first author &amp; cited), National Merit Scholar Finalist

**Subjective**

* HS ECs: Track and Field (was a recruit), Philosophy Club (Co-head), Peer Tutoring, Radio DJ
* College ECs: Track and Field, CMU EMS, Biomedical Engineering Research
* Job/Work Experience: Currently working as an intern at BioMotivate as a Clinical Research Coordinator
* Volunteer/Community Service: Alpha Phi Omega (Assistant Serve VP), planning to volunteer at UPMC-Presbyterian, Camp Counselor for a Summer
* Summer Research Experience: Worked in three research labs: one in University of Colorado, one in Brigham Women's Hospital, one in Boston University. Planning to participate in an REU program of some sort
* Projects: Made a CO2 sensor out of Arduino parts, conducted an proteomics research project for my FADS class 

**Writing**

* Essays: Technically haven't really started yet, but I have been working on applications for REU's, and think that my writing is pretty solid, from a creative perspective at least (7/10)
* Teacher Recommendations: again, haven't really started the process, but I think my recommenders would be fine. Nothing surprising really, just a typical ""really good LoR"" from my respective recommenders (5.5/10 Overall)

**Reasons for Transferring (Skip, If You Wanna):**

* Carnegie Mellon has great resources, but its unique opportunities generally limited to upperclassmen and Engineering/CS students (kinda got lucky w/ the BME research position, and do not want to pigeonhole myself into working in that lab until I'm completely sure)
* Social life is pretty bad (a lot of downers): Stress culture is huge, people complain about the school a lot, people are comparing each other and tie academics and what they have accomplished to their self-worth. To summarize, CMU is ""work hard play hard,"" minus the ""playing"" and character
* Very bureaucratic - this point is like the two previous points combined. CS is super dominant, so unless you're in a tech/engineering field, you're essentially considered ""not as good"" as the others. The school also mainly provides opportunities to those professional fields as well (literally 80-90% of all science labs are in an entire section 15 minutes away from campus).
* Living in Boston would make me closer to my parents, which is a plus
* I'm premed, and although having little competition (not a lot of premed students in a tech school) + indirect access to UPMC is a plus, it'd be nice if those resources were more direct
* The weather sucks: Equivalent to Sex Panther from Dodgeball, in the sense that it's good 12% of the time
* Pittsburgh has a water crisis (lead poisoning) and that affect CMU's drinking fountains (never thought this would be an issue lol). Yes, there are filters, but only at certain places (this point is more funny than concerning - maybe that's the led poisoning kicking in tho)

I'm not really sure if I should even transfer, honestly. I'm posting here to mainly see if I'd have a really good shot at getting into some of the schools I mentioned, and think I should apply. Hell, maybe you think I should develop an extra year to boost stats (I wouldn't think that'd be an issue, but damn, some of the people posting on chanceme are good). Plus, the main reason why I'd transfer is because of the social scene (which I feel is contingent upon who I just hang out with)."

I have put out numerous applications and will continue to apply to more, but I feel like I should at least hear back from more just wanting an interview. I have personal projects up on Github and a resume that details my skills in various areas while displaying some of my projects. I also believe my LinkedIn account is well put together but displays work experience exclusively in retail. My expected graduation date is December 2020 and I would love to have gained experience in the field when I graduate. 

I understand that this is a VERY competitive field, but it would be nice to at least gain interview experience while I work towards landing a job. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I want to be a game developer in one of AAA studios and just wanted to ask, do you need connections or is it necessary to have a referral from one of the employees from these companies to atleast land an interview. I'm worried about this because it would be sad if i never got a chance to prove myself that i could be a better game developer in terms of both design and programming.   


I'm asking this because, recently I applied for 4-5 internship in some startups which also provide courses and they said, students can apply for intership but the thing is, I never got any reply from them regarding this. I got worried because, if these startups requires referrrals, so will these AAA studios.  


I just wanted to know if referrals are required, how do you increase your connections in game industry or in any industry. I need guidance regarding this, please help."
ejslda,0,2020-01-04,Advice on obtaining an internship with basically no work experience and only class knowledge,ZohanX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ejslda/advice_on_obtaining_an_internship_with_basically/,"I'm currently a junior working towards a bachelors in computer science. I'm looking for internships to build up my resume but I have no clue how to do most preferred qualifications in the job postings I've looked at. My school focus is Java but most specific technologies that companies are looking for aren't incorporated into the course-work.

I'm also a bit anxious because I don't know which particular field I want to specialize in, but that's another problem I'll have to figure out for myself.

My preferred company is Intel because of its proximity but the preferred and even minimum qualifications on the application seem like a foreign language. Should I spend several weeks looking up YouTube videos or buying courses on learning Intel's specific technologies even though I may not end up getting a job there at all? Should I look somewhere else given my expertise? What is the best way to learn these technologies effectively?

People always told me that internships are a company's way to look for prospective, beginner minds to build up, even from scratch, so that they can go on to work for them in the future, but I feel so many companies have qualifications that could only be obtained with months or years of outside knowledge that you don't learn in school.

If a career at Intel doesn't work out, I'd like to go into the data field.

I'd appreciate any and all advice from those who have been in my situation and prevailed. Thank you."

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. I've been looking at this for a while now and have been torn between the Dell XPS 13 2in1 7390 and the HP Spectre x360 13T (Ice Lake refresh), though I'm open to suggestions. I was able to try the Dell at a nearby Microcenter and, while it wasn't my favorite keyboard the world, I truly did not mind the maglev keyboard, and even liked it more than most of the laptops they had on display. I'm thinking 2 in 1 because most of my school work involves reading PDFs of journal articles, and being able to mark them up in tablet mode would be nice. I think the Spectre would be perfect for me if it had a 16:10 screen like Dell's offering but, since it doesn't, I figured I'd ask here to see if anyone had experience with these computers or other recommendations to check out."

ejvj0j,2,2020-01-04,How to find a mentorship to improve my web development skills?,x65rdu,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ejvj0j/how_to_find_a_mentorship_to_improve_my_web/,"Hello Reddit!

I want to learn a web development but have problems with developing of my skills. Can you please give me an advice of how to improve them? Is mentorship the solution I should look for?

About me. I have no special education in programming and all I know I learned from the Internet. I like programming, I think so because I never feel bored doing that, at some point it becames more interesting to me than video games. My problem is: I don't understand how to solve complex tasks decomposing them correctly into simpler ones.

Intent to improve my skills I found a job of a backend web developer, but it did not help me a lot. I work half a year now, and all I do is just to add some CRUD operations to existing project. Most of the time I look how other people code works and extend it a bit. When I ask to give me a job to add something new and large to the project like add GraphQL API (we use REST), I constantly receive a reject ""We have no time to do that right now, maybe later."" This is strange, because as I feel I have plenty of time. I receive about four tasks per week, let's say: two on Monday, one on Wednesday, and one on Friday, on each task I spend about an hour to solve it, and all other time I just wait.

So in my spare time I have begun to build my own web application from a scratch, but because of lack of knowledge it constantly leads me to deep frustration on each step:

* How to organize my code, is it RDY and SOLID enough?
* How to write tests: is it possible to test everything?
* Which database to choose: SQL/NoSQL/in memory cache?
* How to make an autentication process?
* What API to choose to talk between services: REST/GraphQL/Protobuff?
* How to build a frontend: should it be a SPA or not, if it will be a SPA what framework to choose: Vue, React, Angular?
* How to design user interfaces?
* Where to host the app?
* How to set up piplines to automatically rebuild application after merging git branches into dev and master?

As I see the solution now: I want to find an experienced programmer who will give me some real tasks to solve and will do a review of my code. I can spend at least two hours per day working on some project at my spare time, actually I can work a full day now, but even if something eventually changes at my regular job, I still will be able to find two hours after it.

So my question is: where can I find that kind of person, who will agree to take me like an intern? Or maybe it is a not realistic scenario at all and I should look for some other ways to improve my skills?

PS: after I have written it all down I realized that I need to find a new job, but I'm a bit scared of that thought, because obtaining my first programmer job wasn't simple at all, and I don't feel like I am ready to repeat that process again right now. Thank you for reading."

The internship would be full time &amp; 8 months so basically I could not proceed with my studies at the same time. However, they filled the position with internal transfer and I got an offer for the position that is now vacant. The job would be slightly different, mainly data analysis using SAS , SQL, R &amp; PBI.  The analysis would be for the sales organisation and not that much related to finance, portfolio- or risk management. Additionally, they told me that switching team and advancing in the organisation would be possible going forward (after internship).

So I'm asking if someone has experience in similar situation or advise on how should I deal with this,- is it worth to have a break from studies for this- How respected a data-analyst internship would be in future- Is it bad move to settle for this or should I seek for more relevant internships

I‚Äôm not really scared about the work since I know this is a time to learn, just not coming off distant to my new coworkers does. I had an internship that was part time and I barely spoke to those in my cubicle area, this job is an open space format and I actually do want to talk to others. 


Any advice? Thank you."

Hi there everyone, 
I'm an expat who's living and working in Germany since 8 years now , 
after the company i used to work in closed doors permantaly due to automatization and online shops AKA being overtaken by programmers and developers  

I decided to join the club, and i managed to get a scholarship in a local tech college backed by the German Employment agency - 

The study is specifically a 2 years term , including a 1 year internship in a company of my choice,

My question(s) : 
- what's expected from me as a trainee , I'm i expected to take tasks - and show my (yet to exist) qualities !?

- Would it be possible for me as a trainee to continue learning by doing during the internship, or I'm expected to perform as junior developer ? 

The extremely tight schedule in the college makes it really almost impossible for a completely beginner like me to offer any valuable qualities to any company as a trainee, 
and I'm quite scared that my internship will be aborted and canceled .
as I'm actually counting the internship time as a learning time , and a chance to review all the materials I couldn't digest throughout the theoretical study time 


Thanks in advance for ur answers guys 
Cheers"

I plan to work somewhere in the West after that, as I am currently living in a not-so-great eastern european country. Quantitative finance would be my preferred field, but I also like programming.

Until then, I would like to get some experience, as I don't really have classes in this last semester, some 20-30 hours/week job until summer would be ideal. The thing is, I already had an internship last year at some big bank and it was an utterly disappointing experience. I wasn't taught much I already didn't know, and mostly I was just doing some boring documentation checking or excel thing. I would really like some challenges, to be pushed to my limits. I think I have the potential to do something bigger. I was/am a top-of-my class student in university, and I am motivated by the challenges, and these boring mundane tasks and mediocrity is killing me.

My question is, how should I communicate this to companies I apply to effectively? Should I apply to positions and talk about this in the interview, or is writing cold emails explaining my situation a valid thing? I don't really know how this works.

I would be grateful for any advice or insight."

Thank you for helping me in advance.  

I am a dual UK-US citizen.  Currently, I am not enrolled in any university, though I have completed my GCSE and A-Levels (Computer Science, Maths, Further Maths, and Chemistry).  I have decent marks in all of my A-levels (A, A, B, A) and GCSE.  The reason I did not apply to any university is because of certain personal circumstances (emotional abuse, depression).

I also have saved about ¬£7,000 from a job to get myself started.  

I am looking for cities to basically start my life over.  My American relatives live in Minnesota, which is somewhere I definitely do not want to go (they're nice people, just don't want cold weather).

Some of the things I am looking for is warm weather (medical condition) and reasonable rent.  

However, I am also looking for an area with good community colleges.  I eventually want to transfer and get my university degree.  One question I had was about how far my current qualifications (GCSE and A-Levels) will take me. I understand that typically a high school diploma is required to get past certain entry level and remedial classes in subjects like Maths and English in community college.  However, I am unsure if my A-Levels and GCSE will help me get past these prerequisites.

Some of the cities/metropolitan areas I have considered:

Riverside, CA (college town, close to Los Angeles, cheaper than LA)

San Mateo, CA (close to SF and in Silicon Valley)

Houston, Texas (cheaper rent, also has some nice colleges)

Dallas, Texas (cheaper rent)

I know basic Python, C++, and Java knowledge and have some knowledge on data structures such as graphs, binary trees, sorting algorithms, etc.  One specific question I had was if this was enough to get an internship or preferably a job.  Sorry about this stupid question, I am just a bit anxious about taking these big steps in life.  

Basically, how common is it to hire a high school graduate with some knowledge of programming and math on an hourly programming job in America? 

So to summarize here are my questions:

1) Which cities would you recommend either from the above list or some other place that has a decent community college for transfer to university?

2) Basically, how common is it to hire a high school graduate with some knowledge of programming and maths on an hourly programming job in America? (I realize this is a wide question, but I am just looking for some guidance on how to get my career started)

3) Which cities would you recommend in general for a young high school graduate?

4) Has anyone transferred from a UK-style secondary education system to a US community college with GCSE?  How did the transfer of courses work out?  How would I do it?"
ejzhps,12,2020-01-04,"A Lesson from a short, failed engineering career.",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ejzhps/a_lesson_from_a_short_failed_engineering_career/,"In (a long time ago) I was given an engineering internship with a consulting (redacted) firm working to update a (redacted) facility. The (anonymous unit) had just wasted (number with many 0's) on a previous project which failed because the contractors had not built up to specification and the (unit) was unhappy. To prevent a similar mistake, the (unit) hired my boss' firm. The firm is a consulting firm specializing in (redacted). My boss was one of their best and I was lucky to work for him. 

Fast forward to day one of my job. My mother was dying so I chose to spend the weekend before with her. I then commuted very early in the morning to my job and house that was going to be 500 miles away from her. My mind was more on her and her cancer than it was on the job ahead of me but I knew I couldn't pass up this opportunity so I tried my best to juggle between the two important things in my life. I arrived on site a little before 6:00 AM to meet my boss and he met me at my car. He then took his morning coffee and showed me to the (unit) engineer at the edge of the plant. We were over looking (redacted for obvious purposes) and chatted about the job. I was exhausted as I hadn't slept much since the tumors in my mom's brain were causing her to not be the mom I grew up with and I had just seen her off for this gig. 

The job was tense. Contractor, (unit), (engineering firm), and consulting (plural) firms were at odds with each other. Things were not going smooth and someone(s) were to blame. Every fucking thing I did at that site was holding a clip board next to my boss holding a clip board next to the (person) holding his coffee next to his boss holding a clip board all while we stood across a (redacted) staring at contractors holding clip boards next to corporate bosses holding clip boards next to sub contractors sweating and in near tears as this entire thing was on the verge of being utterly fucked and they had the most to lose since they had the least to begin with. 

This job is exhausting, (redacted place of work is not pleasant), the bosses are pissed, and the workers detest the pretty clean intern with a clip board staring at everything they do. Every day I would do my reports and write my observations and take my pictures I had two dozen eyes glaring at me and a (person) telling me to fuck off everywhere I stepped. In hind sight I realize now it is because everyone was in danger of losing their job or business or career or future or whatever but at the time I just was tired and bummed and trying to do a good job. 

Some people were nice. My boss liked to chat when the door was closed but he put my laptop and me at the door so that I would be the alert to a pissed off (redacted kind of person) walking in wanting to know what the fuck needs to be done next. It was a tense nightmare of a job site.

All this was happening while on weekends I would see my dying mom. My boss offered to drive me as on weekends he would go to his home in the same state but some time past mine. I simply didn't want to drive with him or my father (commuting through same area but on a completely unrelated career that put us in the sameish area out of coincidence) because I needed some time to be sad and angry on my own and the drives out there would give me that time. 

All this was happening next to a helipad. That was significant because I switched from helicopter pilot school/aviation management bachelor's program to engineering as I thought engineering would be a more stable and happy life. I would watch these pilots climb in and out of those lovely birds all day and fly somewhere that didn't smell like shit, that didn't have angry white men storming around, that didn't smell of fear and anger all day.

I was distracted.

One day on one walk between one (redacted location and another redacted location) we were all chatting. I let slip that I had seen (redacted thing I saw) on my (redacted time of seeing redacted thing). This thing honestly wasn't suspicious in the slightest to me. It wasn't even something that seemed connected to me. It didn't fucking seem different than saying ""I saw a seagull near the ocean"" to me. I was so very wrong.

After I said what I saw and saw what I said, the entire group turned stiff. Everyone stops walking, everyone stops talking, and I get two sets of two glaring eyes looking at me. Everyone walks away from me. 24 hours later, the job stops. I stop having things to do. I am given a shovel and sent to a field to do manual labor as there is no consulting intern work to be had. I go to no more meetings. I take pictures but of nothing. The dozens of eyes turn to one as the (last lone worker on site) now spends his days making sure (things are tidy).

What happened? There were some fucky things going on. Every unit was suspicious of everyone's unit; everyone was okay with their fucky suspicious because before my comment, no one knew for sure what was happening. My comment connected and confirmed the fuckiness to a certain set of eyes. 

The job ends, I can't get recommendations, and I'm just so tired. I commute from school to my mom's house regularly and watch her rot from the inside. Her eyes and skin are there but her hair is gone from chemo and the tumors are crushing her brain from the inside. 

Highschool me was bad but smart. I got D's but had a high ACT score and an associate's degree at graduation. I simply was going into piloting so why worry about grades, right? Then I change to engineering and get good grades. Then this thing happens, then my mom dies, then I want to die, then I stop going to class, then I get A's to C's to F's. I drop out. 

I'm going back to school again for a third major in a third career. (fourth maybe?) I remember this sub from the olden days and I wanted to share this story. 

My engineering friends have had the spectrum of success and failure. The ones who barely passed can't get jobs that say 3.0 or higher required so they work shitty jobs. My friends with 3.0-3.6 type GPAs are working okay government jobs (except the one who did drugs in a foreign land because you can only break so many laws and not have it catch up to you). My 4.0 friend is a COO at a small but profitable firm. 

Me? I'm at a call center getting yelled at by morons dumber than any I met on that site. Somehow I failed at both and here I am. 

The point of this post is to say this: Stay focused and don't try to juggle too much. If you can't focus on school TAKE A BREAK INSTEAD OF FAILING. You can return later but you can't just erase F's. And if you get a job where things feel wrong, they probably are.

Also, loose lips and all that. Good luck to you all

TL;DR I let slip a secret I didn't know was secret and blew a job. I also didn't focus in school and failed. Focus, work, and take a break instead of failing if you can't focus and work."

First of all, this situation is taking place in Belgium - Brussels, to be precise. As part of a three-and-a-half month internship  in the city (I'm a European student based in France), I rented a room in a three-bedroom apartment via an online property rental agency. For this room, we paid a deposit worth two month's rent as well as another small deposit for the rental of the room's furniture.

There were no problems during my stay, and I left the room on good terms with the landlord (room was left clean enough for them, etc.) However, a couple of weeks after leaving the room, I started to wonder when I would receive my deposit. After getting in touch with the landlord, they confirmed that they would be giving the full sum of the deposit back, and asked me for the bank account details to do the transfer. I sent my details, and they quickly wired me back the smaller deposit for the furniture. 

Since then... I haven't received the rest of the deposit - the main sum worth two months' rent. I have sent them numerous emails and messages, to which they have not responded. I contacted my agency, which said they could not do anything apart from contacting the landlord, and informed me that the law in Brussels allows landlord's to keep the deposit for up to three months.

Likewise I am currently a junior and just started my USACO journey after discovering it on reddit and was too late to register for any other olympiads this year. This extends to programs and internships where I think I am one of only 5 or so kids at my school doing an internship. ( our school is approx 2000). For this reason I don‚Äôt think anyone in my entire school has ever even participated in ISTS( I hope to next year) My question is essentially do colleges account for the fact that there are areas where students are not aware of said competitions and  therefore are not able to participate even though they may be more than capable.

I‚Äôm also on mobile so if the format is awful I apologize. 

I just finished an internship at a mental health hospital in activity therapy, so essentially we do assessments for new patients and then lead psycho-educational groups. I enjoyed my time at the hospital, especially the unit I was on but I struggled a lot. Even at the end of my internship I struggled to feel comfortable leading the groups and even getting the conversation to last the entire scheduled group time. 

I was offered a job at the hospital, although it is a per diem job. That means I‚Äôll be moving around to all the units and covering shifts where needed, and honestly will probably only have one or two shifts a week. At first this sounded great, job straight out of college ya know. The more I think about it the more anxious I get. I don‚Äôt know if I actually feel ready for this, or if I will feel comfortable on the other units. 

This whole week leading up to the start of my job has been one of the hardest weeks in a long time, I am constantly anxious and have had some suicidal thoughts concerning the job and how nervous and scared I am for it. I can‚Äôt focus on anything, and I don‚Äôt want to sleep as it‚Äôll make time pass faster and the last thing I want to do is actually go and start my job. 

Therefore, I‚Äôm wondering if the job is even worth it. If it‚Äôs causing me this much stress, to the point where death feels like the only option, is it really worth for me to go through with? I feel like maybe I‚Äôm just looking for people to tell me it‚Äôs okay to quit before I‚Äôve even began. But I‚Äôve done the internship and I know what to expect with the job, I‚Äôm just not sure if it‚Äôs the right path for me anymore. 

Anyway, thanks for reading through this long post. Honestly any advise or input would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR; offered a job at my internship that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm qualified for and have been extremely anxious about. Is it shitty to quit a job before you‚Äôve even started if the thought of the job gives you the worst anxiety you‚Äôve ever had and contemplate suicide?

ek2z65,2,2020-01-04,Quitting An Internship With No End Date?,newjerseyplayer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ek2z65/quitting_an_internship_with_no_end_date/,"Background: Co-op, started in September and only handed in my two weeks last Thursday (Jan 2nd), which is longer than what HR said internships at the large (&gt;1000 employee) B2B sales company last (Normally only 1 semester, from Sept-Dec or Jan-May, and specifically had to ask about working during winter break) 

More background: My offer letter didn‚Äôt stipulate an end date, and with the rush of activity for me to do and learn (previous intern was leaving as well for reasons I‚Äôll discuss later), I didn‚Äôt even get the chance to attend the onboarding sessions with HR because I was doing intern stuff. 

More more background: My boss‚Äôs boss, and my boss, both asked me separately how long I wanted to stay; I told them both (to which they acknowledged) that I only intended to stay as long as there was work available for me after graduation (boss‚Äôs boss told me upfront that she has no intention of hiring me, and to explore other opportunities in the company; this was a 1.5 months before I handed in my 2 weeks)

Even more background: I‚Äôve attended an HR session (that was treated as a complaint, rather than advice seeking as I had intended) over the fact that my boss admitted that she didn‚Äôt read the job description before hiring me, and intended on bringing me on as a secretary-like intern doing things like filing invoices, shipping packages, etc. and not what the description entailed (KPI analysis, strategy along product segmentations, etc) 

Despite me chasing work and coming up with things to show them (Power BI dashboards, Python scripts for forecasting things, etc) they never circled back (despite appearing pleased with the work I essentially assigned myself) and most of these tasks were dead end and I was always back to invoice filing. 

This HR session culminated in the HR rep communicating my grievances to my boss and her boss, and we sat down for a meeting regarding the situation (I‚Äôm just an intern and made it clear to them that I just wanna do a good job and didn‚Äôt anticipate that it would get back to them)

More...background...: This isn‚Äôt the 1st HR complaint that my boss has received, and so it was serious I guess. They basically asked me to ‚Äúrespect the hierarchy‚Äù and go to them before HR (fair, I didn‚Äôt go to them first and tbh idk why I didn‚Äôt) 

Fast forward to December, I take some time off finals and communicate even heavier that I‚Äôd like to keep working here and learn as much as possible, and that I was available full time to immerse myself as much as possible. 

They say to limit my hours to 20 for budget reasons, which is about as much as I did during the semester. 

My supervisor who also complained to HR about my boss is leaving the department, with no extended offer to me to replace her in sight. Instead they opted to transfer her responsibilities to me, minus the training. 

And so I called my boss, and explained to her that I was leaving for the reasons we discussed and mutually acknowledged as valid. She seemed 100% fine, albeit disappointed that I was leaving but acknowledged that I was doing it for my career.

I called because she was working from home that day...after a 2 week vacation...the internship was bad and she was never present ever (multiple WFH days, and almost 0 one on one attention). The former intern told me on the first day that the job would be ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù as did the sales reps, but I stuck it out as much as possible. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Am I in...a bad spot here? I don‚Äôt have a positive relationship with my last employer (boss hates me, but passed a background check to work for current internship). And this employer was also a mess to navigate, although they seem fine with me (2-3 positive references between supervisors, and my overall boss seems ok and her boss gave me a Christmas present, which was nice) 

I feel really sour quitting the internship, especially since my supervisor is leaving leaving the team short staffed. That being said, they didn‚Äôt intend on hiring me apparently even with my supervisor gone, so I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre fine? I also don‚Äôt know what this employer will say about me now that I‚Äôve ‚Äúquit‚Äù. Is this a ‚Äúsuccessfully completed‚Äù internship? I‚Äôve worked more than what HR generally considers a coop to last (not affiliated with my university), but less than the previous intern who was asked to stay when he left and stayed an extra few months. 

I‚Äôm kinda scared as to what my boss will say about me (I hope she respects my decision and is positive despite the rocky HR situation) and really idk if this is good to put on my resume (my last internship seemed to pass background checks, so maybe I‚Äôm fine?) 

I have a full-time job offer already in hand, but I‚Äôm irrationally terrified of losing that although I think I‚Äôm fine but I just don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúquitting‚Äù means for a background check on employment. I had to quit eventually, but will this knock me? 

Thanks everyone."

An ideal candidate would bring 1-5 years' full-stack experience with a focus on back-end systems development -- and a track record of employment, internship and/or open source contribution that demonstrates elite talent. You will work across our tech stack, contributing to everything from architecture to testing frameworks. You'll be an integral member of our early engineering team, translating our roadmap into product features and open source contributions.

We face many unique technical and design challenges as we build a new payment network. To that end, we have a pragmatic approach to the blockchain development environment: extend where falling short, fix where broken, and build where missing. Successful adoption for our product demands that we approach all aspects of development with a fundamental focus on security, reliability, upgradability and usability. We need engineers that are both disciplined and imaginative, who are driven by our vision and refuse to accept that any technical problem is impossible at first impression. We hope this is you!

Why This Matters
Our everyday payment systems are dependent upon financial infrastructure design decades ago. Consumers benefit from rewards programs and new checkout experiences, but in the background money moves the same as ever: through insecure networks that impose unnecessary costs on all of us as they strain to meet the needs of modern commerce.

We started Eco because we know that with the right product strategy, serving the right use cases, cryptocurrency and blockchain finally present a solution for many of our most persistent payment problems. It's possible to rethink our current payment systems from the ground up. In doing that, we confront several difficult, challenging and impactful problems which will demand solutions in order to build a trusted and ubiquitous payment system to enable commerce for everyone. To achieve our mission and realize our vision, we've put together an incredible team and are selectively adding to it.

What you'll do (outcomes)

- Write, test and audit applications and APIs to contribute to the Eco cryptocurrency implementation, manage blockchain settlement and support our launch partners.
- Compose existing and new solutions into a comprehensive tooling chain: build, packaging, unit testing, security fuzzing, coverage reporting, continuous deployment. We will publish and maintain this meta-package.
- Contribute to open-source community where existing productivity tools fall short. Maintain strong relationships with the relevant communities and projects.
- Work with platform and product engineers to understand deficiencies in tools and opportunities to improve them.
- Contribute to blog posts, meetups and workshop presentations promoting Eco's contributions to the community.

What you'll bring (core competencies)

- You're comfortable working anywhere in the technology stack. You can develop back end applications, user interfaces, APIs, and smart contracts.
- You prioritize tests. You test your code as a matter of practice, and automate tests as part of getting the job done. You don't consider code complete until there are automated tests demonstrating that it works.
- You thrive in a problem solving environment. You bring a pragmatic approach to solving problems; solving issues to unblock other developers without creating future maintenance problems. You're persistent and not easily flustered when working with broken/buggy toolchains.
- You have an open source mindset. You have experience and presence in the open-source community; you have contributed to distributed projects. 
- You have strong CS fundamentals. You're familiar with common algorithms and data structures, comfortable implementing new data structures where no suitable implementation already exists.
- You understand basic cryptography and security fundamentals. You have strong understanding of security and privacy.

Nice to Have

- 2+ years of full-stack experience as an engineer, with a provable track record of deploying code into production and contributing to the open source community.
- 1+ years of blockchain development experience.
- Familiarity with a variety of languages, particularly some combination of of: Node.js, Go, C++, Python, Java, Solidity
- You understand the use cases of common cryptographic primitives and can design secure systems using them.
- Tech/DevOps experience: comfortable operating and administering technology systems, debugging production issues, and deploying cloud applications. You understand system instrumentation, and make monitoring production systems part of the design process.

- 
Eco is open to supporting remote work. For remote applicants, additional requirements apply:

- Strong written English language communication skills.
- A minimum of 2 years of prior full-time remote work experience. This is negotiable if you can be in the office a minimum of 1 day per week.

I am currently in the final stages of deciding which MBA offer I want to accept and would love to hear your opinion as I am still quite undecided.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**

* McKinsey consultant (3 years)      from Germany
* Will finance MBA on my own      (personal funds and tax deductions)
* Want to leverage MBA to move      to US (strong preference for California), so staying in the US after      graduation using OPT STEM or H1B
* Potentially go back to Europe      at some point in my career, but aim to live in California in the near      future (next 5-10 years)
* Aim to work in Tech (think      FAANG, Spotify, potentially VC) afterwards, 90% set on this

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1: Berkeley Haas (no scholarship)**

* Great cultural fit, love the      people there, will allow me to already have a significant social network      when staying in California afterwards
* Top school for tech in      California (along GSB), will allow me for great placement for internship +      post-graduation employment
* Amazing location and more      laid-back program (less pressure than at Wharton) - will have a nicer,      more relaxed time there overall, which will allow me to focus on other      things important to me (e.g. founding a startup)

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2: Wharton (no scholarship)**

* Very strong brand overall,      especially outside US in case I return to Europe some day
* As it is one of the      ""elite programs"", probably even smarter peers and professors -      will potentially benefit me in the long term when it comes to getting      funding / becoming CEO etc. due to the brand name
* While Wharton seems to be      academically intense (which I am not to keen on, because I finally want to      enjoy those final 2 years of studying), I like that it is focused around      data (I have always been analytically inclined)
* I am not to keen to go to the      East Coast and Philadelphia for the MBA, so this is a strong disadvantage      for me - however, still possible to spend a semester at the SF campus
* I know that in absolute terms      quite a lot of Wharton grads go to West Coast, but I think it's going to      be hard to have a strong social network there post-graduation (likely low      overlap between people who go to West Coast + friends I make at Wharton)      compared to Berkeley 

&amp;#x200B;

**General thoughts:**

* Given I already have multiple      MBB consultancies, investment banks etc. in my resume, brand name does not      matter as much to me as it might matter to others
* I think both schools will      finally enable me to get good placement in tech in California
* Berkeley likely has a better      culture and friendlier people, but I think that both programs will allow      me to have a good time during the two years
* Apparently both Berkeley      (overall program) and Wharton (if I take Business Analytics major) have      the OPT STEM accreditation which would guarantee me 5 years in US (2 yr      MBA + 1 year OPT + 2 year extension) as alternative to an H1B visa

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

* My heart says Haas - I think I will have an amazing time there, make friends there who might be the base of my future life in California, get great placement in Tech
* However, Wharton will also be a good time, will also bring me to Cali afterwards if I want to, will be the better brand which might have benefits in the long term
* My general view on life is that I want to prioritize things that make me happy vs. things that impress others (I am done with this after all the McKinsey etc. time).      What I want to do is have a happy life and go to California - and Berkeley enables me to do that right away (Wharton with a 2 year delay)

Given all this background, would be amazing to hear your thoughts! Am I crazy to go to Berkeley with a Wharton offer? Or is it reasonable given my background and goals?

Thanks so much in advance!"
ekaxwp,13,2020-01-05,Advice to enter Germany's Startup scene?,kyumulominkus_98,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ekaxwp/advice_to_enter_germanys_startup_scene/,"Hello. I am a CS student from a good American university in the Middle East and I will be graduating in the summer of 2020. My GPA is 3.3 (hopefully 3.4 b4 graduation), not amazing, but I think it's okay. I also had one summer internship in a German startup, and I am involved in a lot of my school's CS and Engineering department's research projects. Additionally, I have a really good passport (non-european though). While I am no top-tier candidate, I still think I am in a decently good position to find a job in Germany.

During my summer internship, I enjoyed the startup culture very much, and I have noticed many German startups that have exciting visions. My work experience are broad (data science, robotics, software engineering) but not highly specialized and not all from industry. I am looking into Berlin and Munich.

Since I have never been to the EU, let alone Germany, and this subreddit is telling me that the European interview process is slightly different, I have the following questions:

1. What are the standard process for German startup interviews like?
2. What advice do you have for me to prepare so I can do well in these interviews?
3. How much should I expect for my starting salary as an undergrad who just graduated?"

Currently, I'm a senior computer science student at university. I was planning on going part-time with school while working the job. However, I'm unsure if I should accept the offer. The wage is $15 an hour which seems fairly low given the COL where I am. My last QA internship paid $20 an hour and my school pays tutors $19 an hour. Is this a reasonable wage?  

Despite the lower than expected salary, the flexibility they offer is very nice.  I'm only required to work 15 hours per week and only 7 of those hours have to be within regular business hours.  They also said I could stack hours one week, to scale back on the following week (e.g. 20 hours week 1, 10 hours week 2).  This flexibility could come in handy when I have upcoming projects and midterms/finals.  

Would it be wise to take the job to gain experience and get my foot in the door, or should I just focus on graduating?  I like quality assurance, but I'm also curious about software engineering and FPGA design engineering.  I don't want to pigeonhole myself into one specialized area too early.  My professor told our class that working too many QA internships will make landing a developer job harder.  

I've already posed this question in the Boeing subreddit, but I wanted to gain broader insight from people in the tech industry as a whole.  I appreciate you all taking the time to read this and respond."

I have one semester left before I graduate and am a little worried/anxious about finding a job and what to expect once I do find a job. I originally didn't plan on getting into GIS, Geography, and Cartography. However, I ended up taking a few classes and found out that I enjoyed it. 

I plan on doing an internship this spring, it's mostly going to be using ESRI online but I was wondering what is a typical work day for someone who works with GIS and what tasks are you typically given?

As someone who is going to graduate very soon what are some good tips you could give to someone for trying to land a job? Should I brush up on certain skills? How much am I expect to know as a fresh graduate and what skills should I try to sell to a potential employer?

Thanks for any help!"

I haven't talked to my family in about 3 years or friends in 5 years.  Family has disowned me and friends do not care about me anymore.  They have lost interest in me always needing to be in front of the computer working on something else.

I have lost interest or just time in the things I used to care about do not have any hobbies other than browsing Reddit or YouTube.  Related to this I have become extremely out of shape and cannot run more than about 20 yards.

I search and apply to the junior developer postings for hours every day all around my state, but I find little to no opportunities.  All the postings are for more experience.  Recruiters only contact me about lead roles.

Most days I starve or have around 800-1200 calories of food be wise I cannot afford any more.

All I remember about school is putting countless hours into the labs.  While other students would breeze the labs in a few hours, I would be there well into the night sometimes and spend entire weekends.  

I was told I was not talented enough with a high enough IQ to do this type of work.  First in college, then at internships and jobs.  

What can I possibly do moving forward.  I am 28 years old and my life feels like it is already over. I am trapped in current situation with no way out.  Working full time only to starve and have no money for relocation.

I would like to try to restart into this field but it feels further and further out of grasp.  When they see my resume they will only see the graduation date being so long ago, with limited experience.  Occasionally I will get a phone screen but they will be wary of me from the start, pressuring me about my work experience and gap.  Then I will get ghosted.

I spend much time listening to interview prep videos and studying for technical interview, such as example projects.  Confident that the technical skills are still there to pass interview, I am solid junior level developer candidate.  I can make a simple CRUD website in .NET Core or Java Spring with a decent frontend within a few days if I had to (I know some could do this in a day).  

I am not picky about where to find a job.  Looking in Midwest or south for low paying jobs that don't require experience.  However I'm also fucked for relocating because I have no money, so if they don't offer relocation I simply can't go.  Im thinking about live out of my car and may end up doing this."

I""m wondering if the M7 is really worth the tuition / opportunity costs vs a lower ranking M7-T15 part time / 1 year programs. I'm not too old, but going to a 2 year M7 does set me back a bit.

Last summer, I had my first internship. 

It was my first real work experience in a field that I was interested in and I enjoyed it a lot. I was looking forward to working for them after graduation as the pay was good even for an intern, their location was convenient, and people were pleasant to work with. People seemed to like me a good amount as some even joked about how I didn't need to go back to school and could just stay to work for them.

However, I had some health issues that came out of nowhere and had to abruptly quit halfway (it was a 10-week program but I was only there for 5 weeks). When I contacted them later noting that I hope to come back for more opportunities in the future, they took a couple of days to respond telling me to ""keep in touch"".

Today I checked their page on LinkedIn and noticed that they were hiring Summer interns again and some full-time positions that require more experience. I feel that I am almost ready for a full-time position as I learned a lot about the company during my time and have left a good impression, but I also feel that I may be better off applying for the same internship position as last summer since I never completed it. 

What should I do? Should I contact my former boss and the recruiting manager to let them know that I am looking for employment opportunities as I am graduating this summer and see what they say? Should I just apply to positions (either or both internship/full-time) and let them know that I have applied? or something else?

And when should I contact them? I was going to contact them a month before graduation as they posted a lot more positions then, including the summer interns, but the fact that they have already posted them this time makes me think that I should contact them as soon as possible."

I just graduated from University of Windsor with a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering (M.Eng - Automotive Option). I've been looking for and applying to jobs for the past four months without success. 

I've been applying on Indeed and LinkedIN for all entry-level positions, internships and positions that require less than 2-3 years of experience. I have reached out to seniors &amp; HR professionals of various organizations on LinkedIn asking for advice on how to enter their companies, have been fortunate to receive a few replies but nothing in terms of steps for attaining a job. I have also visited the Careers portal on some of the companies' sites and applied for a few positions again in vain. I have made sure to tailor my resume and cover letter to the needs of the companies and explain how my experience meet their requirements.

I am currently living in Stoney Creek and have a vehicle, I am open to relocate anywhere in Canada and will not require sponsorship now or in the future. I have decent grades, reference from my manager at my previous part-time job and a strong desire to enter the field in entry-level Mechanical engineering jobs or as an intern.

**Can anyone please tell me if there is something that I have been missing or doing wrong?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous information and a personal bit:

I entered Master's at the end of my Bachelor's in NIT, Surat (Gujarat, India) so I don't have any work or co-op experience. From 2nd year onwards, I have spend most of my summers at the school, at the end of second and third year, I was involved in FSAE mainly responsible for Chassis design, material selections and construction. At the end of third year I was enrolled in CAD and FEA training at Red &amp; White academy in Surat. I am deeply passionate about automobiles and design. I am certified in Solidworks and have used the software to design various FSAE vehicle parts, pneumatic vice and chair made of cardboard to name a few. 

I have decent grades (87% in masters and 77% in undergrad) and took part in various University level competitions in Undergrad such as Robowars, inter-year basketball, automotive quiz etc. During master's program, I was a member of Student Advisory Council responsible for holding events such as Career Workshop, introduction to APQP course, updating students in-person and on social media about various events, etc. I was working part-time as a Go-kart attendant too.

I am an international student who dreamt about working in the Automotive Industry in Windsor as soon as I graduated but unfortunately, Ford (FoMoCo) &amp; FCA ARDC (Automotive Research &amp; Development Centre) hires only MSc. students from University of Windsor. I wish I knew this before applying for the program, I would have definitely strived to enter the Msc. program. That being said, the M.Eng program was very a very decent program with knowledgeable professors who worked in the industry that introduced application of various topics such as Fluid Mechanics, Heat transfer and brought the opportunity to learn software such as Star-CCM+, LS-DYNA, Hyperworks/Hypermesh and Abaqus CAE.

Attaining a meaningful job has probably been the biggest challenge in my life. So far, I 've always had a path defined for me to follow, Highschool --&gt; Undergrad --&gt; Masters, this is the first time I don't have something definite to do and I feel like I'm wasting time. I feel like I've done everything right, attended every class, studied well and yet I don't have something that I deserve. I am yearning for the one chance to enter a company where I will can study as deep as possible into the field because I know I will have practical application for it &amp; strive to excel as an employee. I remind myself that at every moment I can choose what to focus on, I have been utterly blessed to have angles for parents who are pinnacles of support structures (financially and emotionally) and that I have a comfortable place to live and enough money to cover all my needs.

Update:
One month later, found a job as a weld inspector for National Steel Car! Decent pay, 25/hr with good scope for growth.. My friend in the same position as I was also found a job after a month of relentless search.

All those who are looking for jobs, give it all you have and don't be invested in the results, your hardwork won't go to waste and you'll be rewarded. Best of luck!"

Im an Analyst working in S&amp;T for a non-BB Bank (but one of the big top 20 Global Investment Banks). I am located in one of their satellite offices. I always wanted to become a Trader, but due to the nature of not living in a major financial hub, there were no Trader roles here, I am in a Sales Trader role, executing agency orders or working closely with our Traders for risk prices. I touch a lot of different products and it is great experience for a junior. 

I understand I will need to move to a risk-center like NY, London, HK., if you want to be a trader running one of the risk books. 

My question is, how can I make the move from my current Sales role to a Trading Analyst role?

I am considering many options like going for my masters, or try to transfer internally, or applying externally.

Should I get a Master's in a Computational Finance/Quantitative Finance /Mathematical/Comp Sci (one of those)?

I noticed banks usually hire Trading Analyst directly from their Rotational Summer Intern pool. Going for a Masters would let me step back, reapply to their Intern programs this time in Trading.

Should I just keep working at my bank and wait for the opportunity?

Should I apply externally to other banks and not wait?


Let me know your thoughts on going from Sales to Trading within S&amp;T as a Junior."

Shpressnrek hummed to herself as she strolled along the mostly-empty  corridor, which really meant she sounded like an overenthusiastic  didgeridoo impression by an idling V8 engine traveling towards you at a  (relative) dead sprint. The New Years party proper was *most definitely*  in the top 3 in her mind, and a pleasant soreness that extended  throughout most of her body was testament to that - the fact that there  were so *many* warm-cuddles that were double-jointed was‚Ä¶ nothing short of incredible-   


‚Äú\[Oh!\]‚Äù  Shpressnrek murmured as she rounded the corner almost into Tr‚ÄôGrakz,  the Karnakian humming along himself with a slight bounce in his step -  the same bounce that almost made them smack into each other.   


‚Äú\[Ah!  Good morning, \[Shpressnrek\]! Pleasure to see you ‚Ä¶again.\]‚Äù Tr‚ÄôGrakz  said, giving a little bow of his head. With a sarcastic flourish  Shpressnrek copied him, and met his gaze‚Ä¶ and promptly burst out in  laughter.   


‚Äú\[Oh my *goodness* really? Like the Red King?\]‚Äù Shpressnrek said, grinning knowingly.   


‚Äú\[Ah, you caught that part of the play? Lost Carcosa was *very* well done, but the jello-monster wrestling pit-\]‚Äù   


‚Äú\[That didn‚Äôt need to be done nude, did it-\]‚Äù   


‚Äú\[That  didn‚Äôt need you to join in, did it?\]‚Äù Tr‚ÄôGrakz chuckled, eyeing his  friend knowingly. ‚Äú\[Though, I think you absolutely added to the  performance, if I do say so myself.\]‚Äù   


Shpressnrek hummed  softly in thought before shrugging. ‚Äú\[Well. It was an amateur  performance, but I‚Äôm impressed you were even able to see anything since  you were, yanno. *Preoccupied*.\]‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Ah.\]‚Äù Tr‚ÄôGrakz said, fluffing his chest crest slightly. ‚Äú\[Well, being suspended from the ceiling *was* an issue, but if you just squeeze your thighs together when-\]‚Äù   


The  door catty-corner to the conversation slid open, immediately halting  the conversation of the (arguably #2 best) New Years party that was so  incredible, it‚Äôll never be written down - just kept in the hearts,  minds, and video recordings of everyone who was there. Out poured a - if  Shpressnrek was counting correctly - an entire concern of warm-cuddles,  dressed in‚Ä¶ interesting clothing.   


The two aliens shared a *look* with each other, and began their approach.   


= = = = =

‚ÄúAnd so I‚Äôm like, Yeah, I might be doing that thing with my tongue but this is the *New Years Party* and that doesn‚Äôt mean I want to be the alpha of an entire pack of fema-‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Greetings,  \[Jessica\]!\]‚Äù Shpressnrek said, cheerfully hiding as much of her concern  as she could while approaching the entire concern of humans. ‚Äú\[What‚Äôs‚Ä¶  this?\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúOh! Hey Starburst!‚Äù Jessica said, bouncing slightly in place as she flailed her arms infront of her in a co-ordinated w-   


Oh. Punches. Those were *punches*.   


‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù Jessica beamed, smiling wide. ‚ÄúYou coming to join us at the Gym?‚Äù   


‚Äú\[The  Gym? You have to move boxes out of storage in that?\]‚Äù Tr‚ÄôGrakz said,  tilting his head in confusion at the skin-tight color-coordinated  clothing the warm-cuddles were sporting.   


‚ÄúWhat? No. The Gym is where you go to, yanno, work out?‚Äù Jessica said, playfully tapping the Karnakian with a taped-up hand.   


‚Äú\[No‚Ä¶  no. That‚Äôs not what the translator is saying - we are talking about the  same place, right? The one with all the storage boxes-\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúThose were temporary!‚Äù   


‚Äú\[They‚Äôve  been there for years, though.\]‚Äù Shpressnrek murmured, checking her own  implant for a hot-fix updated translation but finding none. ‚Äú\[Are you  sure we‚Äôre talking about the storage unit at-\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù  Jessica sighed, placing her hands on her hips. ‚ÄúOk, look, yeah, it was a  bit of a ‚Ä¶ multi-purpose room, but that‚Äôs different now! Me and the  girls-‚Äù At this the rest of the concern of female warm-cuddles stopped  their conversation amongst themselves and waved - and a few of them gave  Tr‚ÄôGrakz a very pointed *look* \- ‚Äú-were going to go to the gym to start our Resolutions.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Your.  I‚Äôm sorry, your determination? What?\]‚Äù Tr‚ÄôGrakz said, tapping his  temple in the decidedly human mannerism of percussive maintenance. ‚Äú\[I  don‚Äôt think I understand-\]‚Äù   


Jessica waved along her friends,  the concern of warm-cuddles dwindling down to just the one. When they  were outside of earshot Jessica explained.   


‚ÄúLook, every year  around New Years we - I mean, people in general - make New Years  Resolutions to be better people, reach for goals, the like - so, some of  us want to lose a few pounds, some want to eat better, others to pick  up a new skill they‚Äôve been meaning to. There‚Äôs no rhyme or reason or  set method to it, it‚Äôs just everyone trying to be better at stuff!‚Äù   


‚Äú\[*So precious*\]‚Äù  Tr‚ÄôGrakz whispered, earning a light jab from Shpressnrek‚Äôs elbow.  ‚Äú\[Well, that sounds wonderful! Self-improvement is an extremely  important thing to work on, and I‚Äôm glad that you as a species have  adopted it as a holiday tradition in and of itself!\]‚Äù Shpressnrek  beamed, leaning down slightly to get on eye level with Jessica. ‚Äú\[Would  it be appropriate for us to follow you and observe?\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúSure!  But we might ask you to help!‚Äù Jessica said, playfully punching  Shpressnrek‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúCause everyone‚Äôs gotta pray at the iron church!‚Äù   


Tr‚ÄôGrakz perked up immediately. ‚Äú\[Oh! It‚Äôs a new Relig-\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúNO.‚Äù

= = = = =

Shpressnrek hummed to herself, again, but not as loudly as before - the warm-cuddles were *concentrating*, after all, and it‚Äôs important not to distract them from their tasks. Distractions lead to accidents, or ‚Ä¶*incidents*, and both of those are bad things to have when on a space station.   


Didn‚Äôt stop any of them from *happening*, mind you, but still. A good mental practice to have.   


But,  regardless, Storage Room A-45 had been cleared of all the emergency  flares, capsules and hugboxes, and the machinery inside had been, for  the lack of a better word, *excavated* from their cardboard  tombs. Said equipment seemed to be exercise and physical training  machinery that ranged from metal bars hanging from the ceiling (which  the warm-cuddles spent time jumping at, grabbing, and immediately  falling from), metal bars that they lifted up and down (with additional  plates that weren‚Äôt yet used), metal bars that were attached by cords to  machines (which may or may not have been appropriately connected to  begin with), smaller metal bars that they waved around in a free-range  area before putting them back (in the wrong place, apparently, as every  warm-cuddle put them back in a different configuration) and, because  their species did *nothing* without water, a big ol‚Äô pool for water that had been filled up which they were happily bobbing up and down in.   


At  what point this was supposed to be directed ‚Äúexercise‚Äù was not clear to  Shpressnrek; there were personal trainers, sure, but they weren‚Äôt  directing classes, setting up machinery, or even really helping anyone  who didn‚Äôt approach their desk that didn‚Äôt flirt with them shamelessly.  The warm-cuddles did their‚Ä¶ thing, and once they were red-faced,  sweating and *absolutely radiating heat*, they‚Äôd stop, proud of what they accomplished.   


And then they would swing by the juice bar on their way out for a congratulatory health-shake.   


‚Äú\[I don‚Äôt get this at all.\]‚Äù Shpressnrek murmured, taking copious mental notes.   


‚ÄúWhat  - haah - don‚Äôt you - hoo - get?‚Äù Jessica panted, working on a machine  that seemed to be nothing more than an endless staircase, her legs  forcing her up - but her body mainly held up by her shaking arms.   


‚Äú\[None‚Ä¶ none of you did this at all last year-\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúCause  it‚Äôs NEW YEARS RESOLUTION BABY-‚Äù Jessica crowed, getting a response  hoot from a stranger across the gym, an ‚Äúair high five‚Äù occurring  between them. ‚ÄúAnd - hnnnhgh, fuck, I‚Äôm too thicc - we gotta git gud!  Uuugh-‚Äù Jessica continued, dying on the inside and the outside as she  tried to talk and conquer the stairmaster at the same time over the  rhythmic clapping of what Shpressnrek assumed was an un-oiled and  non-maintained machine. With a final gasp of effort she climed her last  stair, letting the momentum of the machine deposit her back on the  floor. Shpressnrek gave Jessica a few moments of panting, swearing and  just generally being warm enough to pleasantly heat the air around her  before she spoke again.   


‚Äú\[So‚Ä¶ now what?\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúWell! I‚Äôve been at that for long enough-‚Äù   


‚Äú\[It‚Äôs been 5 of your minutes-\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúRight!  And it‚Äôs important not to overdo it on your first day back in the gym.‚Äù  Jessica nodded sagely, taking her sweat towel and resting it on her  shoulders. ‚ÄúSo we should take a break - a juice break!‚Äù she beamed, and  Shpressnrek nodded.   


‚Äú\[S-sure.\]‚Äù After all, who was she to  judge? Maybe their bodies just needed that little exercise to accomplish  physical fitness - again, alien physiologies and whatnot. Shpressnrek  pondered these mysteries as she carefully followed Jessica over to the  juice bar, lost in thought. Would this explain why they never used the  Gym for the entire year‚Ä¶ or the year before, or the one before that -  they only needed just a few minutes of physical activity to-   


‚ÄúOne  Quintenta-sized Triple-Green Apple Smoothie, Extra Protein, Extra Power  Cleanse, TriBerry Shot, EnergyBean Shot and an extra scoop of powdered  honey.‚Äù   


Shpressnrek blinked - which is impressive for  a species not really known for the action - and slowly turned to face  Eagle-screm, who was happily bouncing in place as the Smoothie Bar  worker picked up what looked like a cleaning bucket and began to fill it  with-   


‚Äú\[Forgive me, \[Jessica\], but, I thought the goal of  working out was to burn more calories than you took in, building muscle  to increase your base metabolic rate and thereby losing weight.\]‚Äù ‚Äò*Yanno, like everyone else in the universe‚Äô* Shpressnrek mentally added.   


‚ÄúOh! Yeah, that‚Äôs correct!‚Äù   


‚Äú\[But this looks to be‚Ä¶ 50 or more ounces of smoothie.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúYah! Worked up a big sweat, gotta have a big cleanse after!‚Äù   


Shpressnrek thought, again, super hard.   


‚Äú\[But this‚Ä¶ has to be at least 8,000 calories.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Jessica said, spinning on her heel and away from the accurate calorie count. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt count!‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Calories‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt count.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúNuh! Cause it‚Äôs got *protein* in it. And protein slows down the calories.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[But.\]‚Äù  Shpressnrek said, slowly, trying to follow the logic of a human on a  new diet fad. ‚Äú\[Aren‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ still consuming them, even if they‚Äôre  slow?\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a *cleanse*.‚Äù The Smoothieguy  helpfully said as he held the bucket under a syrup pump and began to  piston the sugary concoction into the tub. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally filled with  phytonutrients and beta-tocotrenols and sucrose solids and antioxidants  and-‚Äù   


Shpressnrek leaned over the counter to better study  everything that was happening, The Smoothieguy not missing a beat as he  ducked under the inquisitive snake. ‚Äú\[But. But none of those words *mean* anything-\]‚Äù   


Jessica scrunched up her nose. ‚ÄúLook, you just don‚Äôt understand *nutrition*, ok? This - this stuff works, trust me.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Trust-  I mean, fine, fine.\]‚Äù Shpressnrek leaned back, slowly coiling into  herself to shrink her height. ‚Äú\[It‚Äôs just. You‚Äôve never done this  before-\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúI read a comment chain on Twitumblook that *totally* explained all of this.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[So, they were doctors having a debate?\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúI mean. Maybe, I don‚Äôt know, *you‚Äôre not a doctor either shutup-‚Äù* Jessica  huffed, crossing her arms as the sound of an industrial blender broke  the awkward conversation, turning away from the far-too-inquisitive  Jornissian. Said Jornissian looked away as well - best to break eye  contact and let things calm down for a bit - and surveyed the  post-workout juice bar. Various warm-cuddles were excitedly talking with  one another, flexing in‚Ä¶ some attempt to do *something*, and were trading what looked like jars of powders, cosmetics, and in a few cases shaped quartz crystals.   


Then there was the table Tr‚ÄôGrakz was at.   


At  what point he slipped away Shpressnrek couldn‚Äôt say, but there he was,  full-body bobbing up and down and chanting in time with the rest of the  male warm-cuddles as one of them upturned a bucket and drank heavily -  and continuously - from it, in an attempt to drink it‚Äôs contents down in  a single go.   


Shpressnrek felt the wiggling tendrils of concern grow up the back of her mind, and frowned.

= = = = =

*This was,* as Eagle-screm-from-a-year-ago would say*, ‚Äòbullshit.‚Äô* Shpressnrek thought as she worked at her station. Her clean, uncluttered workstation. Her clean, uncluttered, professional and *scientifically-backed*  workstation. She glanced over at her colleague, Eagle-Screm, who was  currently adding in another few drops of ‚Äòget hype‚Äô to a water  evaporator, which she *assured* Shpressnrek would ‚Äúincrease her vitality, concentration and energy flow‚Äù throughout the work day.   


The  evaporator made an annoying, droning sound as it kicked on, a  bitter-smelling cool mist beginning to disperse into the shared room.   


‚Äú\[Are you *sure* that‚Äôs going to work?\]‚Äù Shpressnrek said, frowning.   


‚ÄúEyup! This, combined with my standing chi-focus mat and the harmonic resonance crystals will *absolutely* make a difference!‚Äù Jessica beamed proudly, the bumped and textured mat that she now stood on squeaking in protest.   


‚Äú\[‚Ä¶so all this will help you file those spectrographic reports?\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúMmhmm.‚Äù  Jessica said, reaching for her handy bottle of neem oil, applying a dab  on each side of her head. ‚ÄúGotta cleanse out all the toxins to clear  the mind!‚Äù   


‚Äú\[I just want to point out - and don‚Äôt take this  the wrong way - but, you could have finished your workload for the day  in the time it took you to setup your new‚Ä¶ *interesting* workstation.\]‚Äù Shpressnrek said, attempting to choose her words carefully as the bitter-smelling (and now rancid-*tasting)* mist permeated the workspace.   


‚ÄúYeah, but this sets me up for future success! Besides, once I work on the energy chi lines in the office, we‚Äôll **both** be more productive!‚Äù   


Shpressnrek calmed her inner self for a moment at the news, before responding carefully and evenly. ‚Äú\[The‚Ä¶ entire office.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúMmhmm! I‚Äôve got some supplies being fabbed right now - we‚Äôre gonna fix the energy of *everything*\-‚Äù   


Shpressnrek rolled her jaw in thought and locked her station. ‚Äú\[I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ going to take a quick break.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúOh, good idea! Getting a walk in absolutely gets the lymph nodes flowing-‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Y-yeah.  Yeah. I‚Äôll be back.\]‚Äù Shpressnrek half-answered, sliding under her  bench and wordlessly making her way out of the room.   


There was a warm-cuddle she needed to see.

Glenn  ‚ÄúSir Not Appearing in This Film‚Äù Abramson was doing just that up until  this paragraph. The knowledge of this made him frown, but not as hard as  he was when he was awoken in the middle of his staggered sleep cycle by  the incessant dinging of his door chime. After attempting to wait out  the noise for a good 15 minutes he eventually got up, racked his  shotgun, and made his way to the door. He did this because:  
(1) It‚Äôs an intern that needs to learn a lesson  
(2) It‚Äôs a xenos that needs to learn a lesson  
Or  
(3)  It‚Äôs that troupe of busty-thicc barely-legal ventriloquist Jornissians  from the New Year‚Äôs Eve party trying to get him out of his ‚Äúcave‚Äù, *again*, and for all intents and purposes he was still severely dehydrated from helping out in their last ‚Äúact‚Äù.   


Either way, CASTLE LAW.   


‚ÄúWhat  do you want.‚Äù Glenn growled through the door, re-racking his shotgun  for intimidation factor. ‚ÄúBecause I gave at the office, and I‚Äôm all out  of holiday cheer.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Stationmaster Glenn.\]‚Äù Growl-clicked the Dorarizin on the other side. ‚Äú\[We need your help.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúTh‚Äôfuck do you mean, *we?*‚Äù  Glenn said, reaching up to tap a button on his door. The frame infront  of him became transparent, micro-cameras on the outside blinking on to  show him what was on the other side of his door. By his count, it was at  least‚Ä¶   


‚Ä¶at least a third of the station‚Äôs xenos population.   


‚ÄúGoddamnit.‚Äù  Glenn said, opening the door, greeting his work colleagues in week-old  boxers, a half-opened bathrobe and a disheveled aura of a man who lost a  rug that tied his whole life together.   


‚Äú\[Greetings,  Stationmaster.\]‚Äù Said Dorarizin - Dave, was it? - said, bowing slightly.  Glenn held his shotgun in his hands, still not entirely sure the  problem before him couldn‚Äôt be solved by just blastin‚Äô. ‚Äú\[We need  help.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúI charge group rates for psychotherapy, but you have to bring your own shrooms.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[N-no, not that.\]‚Äù a Karnakian female said, smoothing out her crest as she approached. ‚Äú\[It‚Äôs the rest of the \[Humans\].\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúWhat? Are they dead?‚Äù   


‚Äú\[No.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúDying?‚Äù   


‚Äú\[No.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúSo  this isn‚Äôt my problem.‚Äù Glenn said, taking a pointed step back and  resting his hand on the door-close mechanism. ‚ÄúNow if you‚Äôll excuse me-‚Äù    


All at once a chorus of voices began to bubble forth, a dozen hundred issues raised together.  
‚Äú\[\[Susan\] Won‚Äôt stop playing bass-boosted binaural beats-\]‚Äù  
‚Äú\[I keep trying to clean the rec area but there are so many *standing mats*\-\]‚Äù  
‚Äú\[-1500 Mineral Crystals shaped like orbs-\]‚Äù  
‚Äú\[-teen minutes tries to lead us all into a stretch that he can‚Äôt even do. *We don‚Äôt have legs, \[Glenn\]. I can‚Äôt-*\]‚Äù  
‚Äú\[-not working because the ‚Äòenergy of the room is black ichor‚Äô and that doesn‚Äôt even **mean** ***anything***\-\]‚Äù  
‚Äú\[***-won‚Äôt stop tweaking his nipples to power up-***\]‚Äù

Glenn  let the screeching barnyard of nightmare horror voices wash over him,  his commbead temporarily shutting down due to just the sheer *volume*  of complaints. Usually such suffering would sustain him for quite some  time, especially if he was smart about rationing it, but this. This was  different.   


This was suffering *he wasn‚Äôt responsible for*, and as such, he couldn‚Äôt enjoy *any* of it.   


With  a helpful beep his beads came back online, and he raised a hand to calm  down the mob. ‚ÄúAlright. Start from the beginning. You.‚Äù   


Glenn pointed at random into the mob, and Shpressnrek came forward.   


‚ÄúWhat.‚Äù   


And so she told her story.

= = = = =

‚Äú\[Stationmaster, I do not think this is going to work.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúJust watch.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[But we‚Äôre going to be seen.\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúJust *watch*.‚Äù   


Glenn  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too Robust for this shit‚Äù Abramson had listened to a few of the  Xenos‚Äô stories before he realized what was going on, and ended a few  more *enthusiastic* storytellers‚Äô tales short with a beanbag shot  to the torso. Eventually running out of ammo forced him to think about  how best to calm down his murderbeast coworkers, and after a few seconds  of deliberation he figured a hands-on visual demo would be enough to  calm the tide.   


This is why he was crouched down behind a  TruFeel Plastic Plant pot in the breakroom. Well. Him and roughly 50  other xenos who would *not* accept his word for it and demanded proof.   


‚Äú\[We‚Äôre not even behind this fake plant, Stationmaster. Some of us are just‚Ä¶ here.\]‚Äù   


Glenn  turned and ferally hissed at the Karnakian, turning back around to peer  through the fake palm leaves. ‚ÄúTrust me. No one even looks over here;  plastic plants are invisible to the human eye.‚Äù   


‚Äú\[I. That doesn‚Äôt sound corre-\]‚Äù   


The  karnakian was interrupted by another animalistic hiss from Glenn as the  door to the breakroom slid open, a thigh-high legwarmer wearing Mike  running in place. Well. ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù. It was more swaying back and forth  vigorously, which honestly counted for *something* in this perpetual hellhole of the space backrooms.   


Rgrezneh-of-Hrzgaren  began to full-body shake, murmuring something about ‚ÄúCouples Jazzercize  classes‚Äù - Glenn reached up and clamped his hands around her muzzle,  pulling her down. ‚Äú*Look*.‚Äù   


The xenos crouched, doing  their best to hide behind the plant - or behind each other - as they  watched the wobbling Mike make his way over to the Vending machine. It  had been recently restocked, filled with new and healthy options such as  Sunbutt Chips, Luna Crunches, Horsereference Fries and a bunch of other  ‚Äúcalorie smart‚Äù selections. Of course, as this was still a vending  machine manned by human beings, the items that hadn‚Äôt sold yet remained,  a tempting if outdated choice.

¬†And that was key.

¬†‚ÄúThe human male *Michaeus Slobbicus* *Horribilus*  scans his larder, making the first meal decision for the day.‚Äù Glenn  began to narrate in an extraordinarily british voice. ‚ÄúAs he is useless  in almost every facet of life-‚Äù   


‚Äú\[H-hey!\]‚Äù Rgrezneh-of-Hrzgaren said, her interjection popping her muzzle free from Glenn‚Äôs grip.   


‚Äú-He  must get his food like all other pests; by scavenging.‚Äù Glenn  continued, unabated as he creeped through the singular bush. ‚ÄúNow, the *Michaeus Horribilus*,  commonly known as the ‚ÄòFucking wake up‚Äô or ‚Äòjackass‚Äô, has a peculiar  evolutionary trait; he has a fixed amount of willpower daily.‚Äù   


At this, every xeno stopped their murmuring and began to listen to Glenn ‚ÄúDavid Attenborough‚Äù Abramson.   


‚ÄúThis  can be increased through training, but the common jackass would do no  such thing over the course of his life. No, spurts like these almost  always die out sooner rather than later.‚Äù   


Mike stopped his wobbling back and forth and studied the choices, eyes glazing over the healthier, fresher options.   


‚ÄúAnd so now we watch nature take it‚Äôs course.‚Äù   


Mike‚Äôs head scanned row after row, hot food, cold food, drinks of all sorts and sizes, all healthy, all *tasteless*.  But a bright orange bag caught his eye, and steadying himself against  the machine he crouched down, face breaking out into a soft grin. For  there, alone, a single row of a forgotten era; Dodino‚Äôs brand **DUST LUST**, now with 33% more lard.   


Mike looked to his left, then to his right, scanning over the potted plant. No one was here to witness him‚Ä¶

*Good.*

Mike pressed his selection into the vending machine, the **DUST LUST** dropping down to the collection bin. With another quick look around he grabbed the bag and ripped it open.   


‚ÄúThe  common jackass is influenced by the thots around him; he won‚Äôt show his  true nature unless it‚Äôs the popular opinion, since he‚Äôs of the *Basic Bitch* genus-‚Äù   


‚Äú\[Ok I think this is getting a bit too harsh, Stationmaster.\]‚Äù Rgrezneh-of-Hrzgaren said, furrowing her brow. ‚Äú\[He‚Äôs not *that* bad-\]‚Äù   


‚ÄúMMNNOOFFFF\~‚Äù  The group watched in silence as Mike moaned through the bag of Dodinos  dust that he upturned into his mouth, his body shaking with the ecstasy  of 500% of his daily sodium intake, 4g of pure MSG and all those  delicious, delicious parabens hitting his bloodstream at once.   


‚Äú\[It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Stationmaster \[Glenn\], what does it mean?\]‚Äù   


The door slid open again, a red-faced Jessica wandering into the breakroom. The two looked at each other for a moment, before-

‚ÄúOh fuck yeah, there‚Äôs still DUST LUST in here?‚Äù Jessica chirped, wandering over to the vending machine.

‚ÄúIt  means there is a Santa Claus, Virginia.‚Äù Glenn said, nodding and  smiling to himself over the soft sobbing relief of the aliens behind  him.

Truly, it was the one last Holidaysmas Miracle for the year.

Cause, let‚Äôs face it. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre keeping your resolutions, right?

‚Ä¶.Right?

eki239,1,2020-01-05,Which car should I buy and why?,afolling,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eki239/which_car_should_i_buy_and_why/,"Hey guys, recently I sold my old car for $400. It just kept breaking and I put 500 a month into repairs till the transmission started to go and i finally said screw this and sold it for parts. Now I am looking at buying. The problem is I only recently established my credit so most places are offering a 20% interest rate which I would never accept. So I am building my credit and saving close to 1000 a month for a new car. 

I found a used charger with less than 40k miles. It's my dream car. I have always wanted one. It's a 2018 RT for 22k. The only thing is I don't know how practical it is. My worry is if I dont get this car now I never will. It's not really a family car and I want a family some day. 

I have also been looking at a 2018 mazda 3 and a 2019 Camry. These two are more practical and significantly cheaper than the charger but I dont think they would be as fun to drive. 

I still love with my parents and my only bill is my school tuition. I make 15 and hour as an intern for the government in an IT department. However the internship is ongoing and I can stay for another 4 to 5 years. Or I can leave and get a job paying closer to 25 an hour but it wouldn't work as well with school. (Sorry got a little off topic).

I feel like the charger payments wouldn't be bad if I saved for a while longer on a good down payment. 

Thank you guys in advance for the advice."
eki8t1,1,2020-01-05,What should I do after I graduate if I dislike my field and am unqualified to pursue what I care about?,butwilltheygetit,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eki8t1/what_should_i_do_after_i_graduate_if_i_dislike_my/,"My situation:

I'm about to start my last semester at Georgia Tech, and if all goes as planned will be graduating with a degree in Computer Science (CS). This may seem all well and good but the truth is I've never liked Computer Science (""why'd you major in it then?"" --that's a story for another day.). I realize how fortunate I am to be in the position I am, and this just adds to my feeling of urgency in putting my time / mind / effort to good use. The problem is I really, really dislike the software world, associated types of work, and culture. 

In fact, I get this horrible feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach thinking about working in the field. I've already interned twice (as a software dev), so it's not for lack of trying to acclimate to it. It's very hard for me to feel ok about working in a field that at best, seems to be twiddling its thumbs as the world burns, and at worst, is actively fanning the flames. Literally. See [https://gizmodo.com/how-google-microsoft-and-big-tech-are-automating-the-1832790799](https://gizmodo.com/how-google-microsoft-and-big-tech-are-automating-the-1832790799) as an example. 

I know there are probably benign companies out there who could use computer people, and working at such places would certainly be easier to stomach, were it not for the fact that I have a hard time sitting in front of a screen for hours. I'm like the antithesis of the tech person stereotype, and often have what amounts to an emotional allergic reaction trying to picture myself working in the tech world. Unlike many of my peers in the field, the last thing I want to do in my free time is ""tinker around"" with a new programming language, code a video game, or work on an app. In my free time, I usually try to get as far away from tech-related things as possible, and prefer to be outside in nature, or read a book, or learn about regenerative agriculture. My interests mainly stem around the natural world, and how we can use what is around us to adapt to a rapidly changing climate / world. Specifically, I'm interested in sustainable / regenerative agriculture, agroecology, etc. 

I'm woefully unskilled in these areas, however, as the majority of my time these past few years has been dedicated to my CS studies. Since I'm graduating in a few months, I feel like I'm on this train hurtling towards a cliff, and I have very little time to decide what to do. I'm wondering if I should just suck it up and work a CS job for a year or two to save money and ""gain experience"", before then trying to work my way into the natural science / climate science / sustainable agriculture fields. Or if I should just go intern on a farm, or what. I wonder if it would even be useful to work in tech for a year, since technology changes so fast, and working for a year now might be irrelevant 10 years from now (thoughts?). Then there's part of me that imagines maybe I could do freelance work or get into UX/UI (more palatable than programming, but equally thumb-twiddly), and use that to fund other pursuits. 

I really don't want to waste time, and feel this urgency to do something useful (that doesn't drain my soul). Sometimes I wonder if that's even possible, as it seems most people are stuck working whatever jobs they can, and I read somewhere that 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. And much of these jobs are just perpetuating and reinforcing much of the problematic world structures / institutions that got us into this economical / political / social/ climate mess that we find ourselves in. The situation is dire and seems to be getting worse both in the US and all over the world, and I feel I \*must\* contribute to restoring balance, in whatever way I can. 

If you've read this far, thank you, and I'm sorry my writing is all over the place. I guess it captures how I feel and have been feeling for a while."

Am I too old for employers and how to go about switching careers to software development while pursuing the degree?",Dels1nRowe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ekjzp3/i_am_39_established_engineer_and_just_started_a/,"*Note:  I have seem similar posts in this subreddit where people shared their stories.  However, I didn't get a clear answer and hence wanted to create a new post.  Apologies in advance if there is some overlap.*

I am 39 and graduated with an Electrical Engineering degree (embedded systems focus) decades ago.  For the past 14 years, I have been working as an established electrical engineering in corporate doing system engineering work (no programming) with good salary.  Lately, I started a Bachelor in CS.  I tried Master's in CS programs however most schools weren't teaching the fundamentals well enough so the Bachelor is a good fit.  I am enjoying the degree and had a couple of questions:

1. I work full time and so my degree will finish in 3 years and I'll be 42 then and plan to start a Masters's in CS afterwards.  Is that too old for employers?  
2. Is it possible for me to switch careers and get a full time CS related job now while pursuing my degree?  I have been searching and for folks like myself who have just started the degree, most companies have intern positions and I need something full time to pay bills etc. Or, do I just have to wait till i graduate to find a full time job?  What bugs me is that I want to start working a CS job before my degree finishes in 3 years to get the experience.  
3. For others who might have done something similar, did you take a huge paycut and how was your transition?

As a side note, I have read articles where people say that I should also build a portfolio of programming projects to appeal to employers.  Most of my projects are school related and with a full time job as well as school, it has been extremely hard to make time for side projects at the moment.   

Thanks for your time."

Around two months ago I had a referral put in for a fairly large computer chip/ semiconductor company in the bay area, where I would intern on their server term in the summer of 2020. After an interview, I received an email saying they were working on an offer for my internship role. However, I received that email almost three weeks ago and was thinking about sending another follow-up email. Should I want another week before sending the email and what should I say in the email to not come off as too desperate or careless?

Thanks for all your help guys

I'm a 16 year old international student living in America. I don't live with a host family because I've lived here my whole life as my dad had a job opportunity here - before he was sent back to my home country. Still, he wanted to keep the family here because of the quality of education. As a result, my mom has had to fly in and out of the country for periods of time and soon, she will have to fly home during the summer and will have to stay there for 7 months. My older brother will be out of town for an internship and my little brother is usually at his friends house. I'm really worried what will happen when I'm forced to spend my entire summer alone. Any advice?"

Obviously switching my major is not really an option, and I have my current internship lined up to go through the summer, however I may be getting an internship offer for a ChE job that pays incredibly well, and is with a relatively known company.

I've honestly committed to making the switch to data but I'm intrigued by the ChE opportunity.

1) I was rejected from plenty data internships for this summer (obviously found one)

If I stick with my current internship, what's the likelihood I can land a job as a Data Analyst with a great company post grad?

2) if I don't stick with my data internship for the summer, what's the likelihood I can land a job in ChE/what's the chance I significantly lowered my chances for a data job?

Web : services , loads of dev projects using laravel framework and others , all about databases and some complexity

what they share is in common , is that they all include the JEE framework as a seperate module to study.

ekmsyn,32,2020-01-05,Tragedy at Disney‚Äôs Toontown,freakyattractions,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ekmsyn/tragedy_at_disneys_toontown/,"Disney World‚Äôs Toon Town was my first job out of high school and at the beginning everything was great. For those of you who don‚Äôt remember, Toon town was where Mickey and Minnie lived in the park and had everything that you would imagine would be in a real neighborhood a neighborhood that a cartoon would live in. There were houses kitchens, bedrooms, kids could even go in and microwave stuff on a little cartoon microwave. Donald Duck had a little houseboat that you inside. Goofy had his roller coaster. There was a lot of cool stuff. And although it was for kids I actually really liked it. I mean where else in the world could you go to step inside a real cartoon village. That was all until I started working the night shift there. What, in the day time, seemed to be cute and silly quickly became very creepy when the sun went down and the guests left the park.

I worked in custodial so I was one of the last people to go through the parks at night and unfortunately I usually had to go in alone. So one night when I was doing my rounds and emptying trash cans. I walked straight through toon town to try to get to Tomorrowland and back to the front of the park. I was finishing a ten-hour day and was definitely ready to get out so I was walking pretty fast.

Normally all of the little houses would be dark and the sound effects and stuff would be turned off. Not tonight though, I went back there and all of the lights and effects were still going strong throughout the entire area. I was dumbfounded, this was a serious departure from protocol. So, I had to tell someone about it and people were seriously going to get in trouble. I continued walking and pulled out my radio but as soon as I did‚Ä¶ everything shut off. I then heard shuffling in the distance and thought I saw a tail go into some bushes over near the train station. I figured it was probably some raccoon or something, the area back there is totally surrounded by national forests and animals turn up all the time. So I pretty much forgot about it and went about the rest of my night.

During my shift the next morning though I heard some very disturbing news about that area. A rat was found gutted and smeared all over Minnies House's floor. The official story was that it was killed by an opossum or two but the amount of carnage involved seemed suspicious to me.

Anyways, it was business as usual of course. The amount of situations that could happen at this park before there is any change in operation is truly astounding. That was until later on in the early evening I saw a batch of policemen and security officers crowded around Main street strategizing something. For that amount of them to be all gathered in one place meant something definitely must have happened. I found one of my leaders standing on the sidewalk staring over at the group and asked her what had happened. She said she wasn‚Äôt sure but heard something about a baby going missing. I had never heard about anything like that happening at these parks so that really freaked me out.

By the time I did my sweep later that night it was about 2 in the morning. I did all of my normal tasks but I was certainly dreading getting to Toon Town. I was still kind of shook up by the events from the night before, even though I knew they were honestly pretty much normal. So by the time I got to the area I was relieved to see that the lights and sound effects were not on.

I approached an empty trash can in front of Minnie‚Äôs house and noticed through the window that the cartoon refrigerator was still open. I figured one of the crazy interns must have forgotten to shut the door when they closed down the park for the night. So I walked inside the house and went to the kitchen to close it but when I tried it didn‚Äôt close all the way. Fear suddenly surged through my veins. I automatically knew something was wrong. Then I slowly opened the refrigerator door and witnessed to my horror a baby inside, lifeless and cold.

In a panic, I radioed my supervisor and told him what happened. He told me to get outside of the house immediately and that police were on their way. Then a number of boxes and items got knocked down in one of the rooms behind me and somebody ran out the door. Too terrified to move I stood there and watched as a manlike thing with a tail skittered past the window.

I immediately went outside the house desperate to see what it was but it was gone. Then a few moments later the police arrived and after looking around for a few minutes grabbed me to ask some questions. As we were walking away I saw something standing in the front of the little kid's coaster. I could barely make it out because it was mostly standing in the shadows but it appeared to have a hideous protruding snout. Like a human who had surgically altered his face to look more like a cartoon.

I yelled for the police to turn around but when they looked over it was already gone. Probably out into the woods right behind the ride. After my story police did a thorough search of the park and woods but turned up with nothing. Considering that the sighting of this bizarre cartoon man could only be verified by me it wasn‚Äôt taken very seriously. The baby‚Äôs tragic passing which was determined to be from suffocation was essentially blamed on the parents they said the parents weren‚Äôt looking and the baby probably climbed in the refrigerator on its own.

Regardless of how everything turned out I‚Äôll always know what really happened to him and let's just say anytime I‚Äôm in that area I always have my eyes peeled, for the cartoon man.

I am about to graduate myself soon and see myself falling into the same boat unfortuately, so I wanted to spruce up my resume and skillset with some certifications to better increase my chances.

ekokg1,4,2020-01-05,I graduated! What now?,mikey2334,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ekokg1/i_graduated_what_now/,"I just graduated during the fall semester with a BS in Computer Engineering. I have knowledge and experience with embedded systems, programming, IT, and Cybersecurity. Funny enough, now I feel so lost. I wanted to be finished so bad, but now that I did I get so stressed looking for my first real engineering job. 

I feel like I am not qualified for any job I find, and then the ones that I do find are too entry level for me. What do I do? It's really been bugging me out especially now that I have all the time in the world to think about it. Unfortunately, I was never able to get an internship and I regret it so much. Most jobs that I am interested in require 1+ years of experience or at least an internship that shows I can apply my knowledge to a real world application. I also don't have one thing that I solely focused on so I have a good foundation on each different concentration that I did but am not 100% confident in any of them. Should I study and work on projects in the meantime? Sorry that my mind is all over the place."
ekoljy,8,2020-01-05,Getting an internship,MFDOOMKendrickEarl,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ekoljy/getting_an_internship/,"Hi reddit this is my first time posting on this sub. I got introduced to programming last year's September, fell in love with it and since then it is all I do. Started learning my first programming languages a month ago. Got an idea to do job searches in my area to kind of steer my learning direction. What I noticed was that the Internship's requirement are very high, most web intern postings require fullstack developers who know many different technologies, some even require multiple degrees or years of experience. While the pay is often very low and some times unpaid yet the requirements identically match an entry level position with a much higher starting salary.

Is this normal and to be expected? Why are internships just as demanding as full-time jobs? Is there just an overabundance programmers in my area. I live in NYC for reference. I often heard that software or web development  is well compensated especially in big cities where I live, so this came as a surprise to me. Shouldn't internships be easier to get into than an entry level fulltime position?

I know just the fundamentals of HTML5 + CSS &amp; Js, I learned a lot in a very short time because I have put a lot hours into. However not enough to learn the 3 or 4 different UI frameworks they require and node. I thought I would be job ready in the next 8 months, however those job requirements gave me a reality check.

I am a junior CS student trying to get an internship this summer. I have only received rejections when I‚Äôve applied in the past, and I‚Äôd like to hear advice on how those who have succeeded managed to do so.

My GPA is 3.32, and my CS GPA is 4.0. 
I live in Georgia, but I would ideally prefer an internship opportunity in New York, since I plan to move there after I graduate (May 2021), and I think having experience in the city would look good to employers. However, at this point, any experience would be welcome."

Also what about NYU? Big reach? My Father got his Masters there so I'm kind of a legacy.  


I am a white male homeschooled student from Florida.  


GPA: 3.8 UW  


ACT: 29 (average for some of these schools, low for others)  


I have taken many courses through dual enrollment, getting A's in all except one (B+).  


I took higher level math courses (Calc in sophomore year).  


I've taken interesting classes, taking advantage of my homeschooled  status(e.g. Python programming, Astronomy, Philosophy, Ethics).  


My ECs:  


Volunteer at local animal shelter with 100+ hours.  


Accepted to two different competitive internships at a sea turtle hospital, spent over 115+ hours over the summer.  


Tae Kwon Do for 13 years, currently have my 2nd degree black belt. I  have been an assistant teacher to the younger classes for the past year.  


Hapkido for 2 years.  


Part of my local highschool's varsity bowling team for the past two  seasons. Team captain the most recent season. (I was allowed to  participate since I'm in the zone for the school). (I submitted a video  of me bowling)  


I have won mutiple tournaments and qualified for state tournaments in bowling.  


I have a job at a local ice cream shop that I've held for the past 4 months or so.  


I've built computers since around freshman year. I listed this as a hobby.  


My letter of recommendations are pretty good, two from my dual  enrollment professors (english, philosphy). One from my past physics  teacher. A couple others from my bowling coach and Tae Kwon Do teacher.  7.5-8/10 probably.  


My Essay is good in my opinion. Since I've homeschooled I've traveled  the world with my dad. I tried to steer clear of the cliche ""Seeing  different cultures changed who I am as a person,"" and made it more  personal. 8/10.  


My supp essays are good as well for those who require them, 7.5-8/10 ish.  


Any help is appreciated, as well as suggested schools that aren't on my list. Thank you so much!"

ekuypm,4,2020-01-06,Can I get into a decent Masters in Data Science Program (USA) with a low undergraduate GPA in Industrial Engineering,Classic-Box,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ekuypm/can_i_get_into_a_decent_masters_in_data_science/," 

Hi,

I am a graduating Industrial Engineering student with a minor in IT from the Philippines. Over the past year, I've developed an interest for data science, and would like to pursue a graduate degree abroad (preferably USA, though I guess I am open to Canada/Australia too). Unfortunately, I will probably graduate with a 2.8 after this last trimester (see attached image).

Just for some context, I started out my undergraduate degree , with a GPA of around 2.99 at the end of freshman year, landing in the dean's list 2/3 of the trimesters.

Towards the end of my sophomore year, I began to experience personal issues (family related) which eventually took a toll on my grades and my motivation. At this point, I just wanted to get college over , so I began to work on a side business and alternative sources of income thinking it would grant me greater independence in case I needed it. By the end of my Junior Year, my CGPA fell to 2.6 and I realized I wanted to get back on my feet, academically

Aside from improving my grades, I decided to pursue some extra-curricular activities, such as case competitions sponsored by established fortune 500 companies. As a result, I had won several awards, and secured two internships related to business intelligence. One of these internships, was mandatory for my undergraduate degree, while the second, I took on voluntarily and juggled it with a 18 credit/unit load. I also decided to pursue a challenging thesis topic in operations research, hoping to augment my portfolio, which I am now about to finish and hopefully publish.

I am now on my last term, with a CGPA of 2.8. I understand this is just average, or maybe even on the lower end in terms of US standards, but from my own observation, I estimate that it will be on the upper 20-25% of my graduating batch. I plan to start reviewing for the GRE soon, as well as improve my skills in programming and ML through online courses/books and build my portfolio.

I was hoping for some insights and tips regarding my current situation, as well as suggestions for applicable MS in Data Science programs.

ekv8pw,1,2020-01-06,Confused with life and making ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationships in college given my situation,chimmycatdogbear,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ekv8pw/confused_with_life_and_making_real_relationships/,"
I‚Äôve been holding off on this post for a while now, but am now feeling lost about myself and my family. I (M20) feel as though I‚Äôm in an ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù position to make closer friends or meet girls my age besides tinder (which the logistics of that working is pain in the ass for me).  

For context, before my college career started, I left my home town in Jersey to PA after my junior year of highschool. This was devastating as I had some many friends and I was connected by my sports team. Then to make things worse  my mom thought it would be a good idea to make me and my younger siblings homeschooled. So me feeling destroyed after leaving all my friends decided to along with it. Horrible decision as I was extremely lonely during my senior year. Following graduation, I decided to take gap year to work on an entrepreneurial project with my 2 older brothers. Both my older brothers have graduated highschool and my eldest brother had just graduated college the prior year. My second eldest brother decided not to go to college to focus on entrepreneurial projects, but none have yielded any money (he  has social anxiety and is currently depressed). During this gap year I learned a lot about marketing and social media, but decided to go to college as I did not see any possibility in making money with our entrepreneurial project (making a mobile game...). My brothers, well now mainly my eldest brother to this day are still working on this project (my second eldest brother is becoming even more depressed as I think he feels like a failure in life).

Fast forward, I got an internship over the summer to work in marketing, which became now a paid parting gig. I‚Äôm a freshman in college. I‚Äôm doing very well in school, I‚Äôm a commuter and the school is a very small college  not far from where I live. What makes my situation complicated is in large part due to my financial situation (Although part of it is my own fault I guess...). My family is big, 7 people total, and our income is small given that we live off my dad‚Äôs investments from when he was on Wall Street (he wasn‚Äôt allowed to trade for many years...long story). 

Since I am a commuter, I spend far less time with my peers then the residents do with each other. Luckily i pushed myself throughout the semester to be as social as possible and I‚Äôve made many ‚Äúacquaintances‚Äù (as I would put it) but I wouldn‚Äôt totally call them my ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends as I do not have a ton in common with them besides going to parties and classes. My other social outlet is the business club which I am on the board of. My one ‚Äúreal‚Äù friend at the school advised me and got me this position which provides a big social outlet at the school. 

The issue with this school is that a lot of the people come from lower to middle class families. Literally only 1 or 3 other people besides me in the classes actually gives a fuck and tries. So this has started discourage me from wanting to really hang o it with these people as I now view some of them as straight up lazy. Obviously I don‚Äôt act on the previously stated, I treat everyone with respect, but it just makes me not want to associate with some people who just don‚Äôt give a shit about their future. 

As I have already alluded to, I have been very social and my involvement with the business club has opened many doors socially and career wise, which has lead me take part in partying. I have had lots of experience when I attended public highschool for partying so nothing was new there. But during the semester I fucked for the first time which I didn‚Äôt think was going to happen soon as I had never kissed or had a girl friend in my life as I was too afraid to ask and insecure. That one night gave me the confidence to then ask out my ‚Äúreal‚Äù crush who we will all J (f24) for now. She is older then me but she is very attractive, we hooked up, planned to fuck, but one night when I was at another party I sent J a snap staying I was drunk af and that following week when I met her in person she look disgusted with me. When we spent time together we would discuss what kind of things we liked blah blah but we would also discusss what kind of relationship we wanted to have (which I kept changing my mind on). I also told her that I one of my fears in is that I care to much about that other people think. I also gave off the impression that I had no personal feelings as I was trying very hard to please all her requests/wants (big fuck up lol). She eventually ended our 2 week relationship which made me feel heart broken as it was my first and I was trying so hard to make it work. 

One thing to say is that I don‚Äôt even have a car. I require rides my dad and ubers to get around. I always get the question ‚Äúhow do you get to school if you don‚Äôt have a car?‚Äù Since I‚Äôm a commuter and everyone expects me to. Since the area I live is not really accessible by walking or public transportation you have to have a car to essentially get anywhere without getting hit (it‚Äôs a nice suburb, poor in a rich town...small house). 

The next question I get is why don‚Äôt you buy one? Well technically i could buy a used junker, but all my money I make from my marketing job and workstudy from school would go to it and not to paying/saving up for next semester. I do have the federal student loans, and I‚Äôm very careful with spending since I know the debt crisis is insane. 

So when it comes to meeting people the max they can really be is 15 mins by car and I‚Äôm still relying on my dad. I could possible use public transport but then it brings up the question is it worth 2hrs in a bus to see them? Also I do live near Philly which does open social opportunities, which I have considered this winter break.

Also that is another big push for me writing this post as this past break has been extremely depressing. Christmas and New Years has never felt so sad.  I was planning to crash with one of my my friends from jersey but the only way I could‚Äôve of done that is by train (which I have never done by myself....I know...no excuses smh...). I saw all of friends hanging out with all their highschool friends form their home town while I was with my crazy family who is extremely socially isolating in an area where I know no one besides the people at my college who are all out of town.

I wish I could just live on my own. It‚Äôs impossible to have any kind of romantic relationship if I can‚Äôt even invite the girl over. Like I‚Äôm going to make a tinder as a soon as I can get better pics of myself lol, but then the question is how will I meet them? Where would I even meet to fuck? Also with making friend it seems like a lot of the groups are for 26 yrs and 30s, not for college students. And since i don‚Äôt have an unlimited supply of Uber‚Äôs or cash to eat out or go to some overpriced concert it makes it harder to suggest events to attend with my existing acquaintances.

I‚Äôve thought about getting another job during the school year but I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to maintain a 4.0 gpa and business club actives. This summer is promising for more paid internships which I would be working the whole summer. Honestly I feel lost, I feel like I‚Äôm holding myself back, but I‚Äôm like maybe that just my fucked up situation. Any advice would be welcome?"
ekvlng,4,2020-01-06,Profile Review For Deferred MBA Programs | What Is An Appropriate GMAT Score To Target?,MBA_Australia,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/ekvlng/profile_review_for_deferred_mba_programs_what_is/,"Hi everyone, I am a 22-year-old Australian about to begin my final year of undergraduate studies with the intention to complete an MBA through a deferred program. Due to my expected graduation date, I am eligible to apply to potential programs in 2021. I believe that my GMAT score and essay(s) will ‚Äòmake or break‚Äô my application. I appreciate any feedback on my profile and would like to hear opinions on what would be an appropriate GMAT score to target. My current train of thought is minimum --&gt; 710, target --&gt; 730, dream --&gt; 750.

&amp;nbsp;

**(1) BACKGROUND**

**Work experience:**

* Big 3 German automotive manufacturer (Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes)

    * *6-month internship in Germany*

&amp;nbsp;

**(3) MBA INFO**

**Goal of MBA:**

* [Short-term] To move away from traditional engineering roles and into management style roles particularly in NPO start-ups. By being accepted into a deferred program I will have the confidence after undergrad to take professional risks, whether that is to begin/grow a start-up or apply myself in a smaller boutique firm. Furthermore, I will have the support of the school‚Äôs network to help accelerate my professional progression in the period before matriculation.

- [Long-term] My longer-term vision is to make a positive impact in Australia. Currently Australia has a large dependence on its mining and farming exports however both industries are in decline which will ultimately damage the economy. The automotive industry was once in this position, unfortunately the industry succumbed to the downward trend and manufacturing has since been abandoned. My goal is to bring back the automotive industry to Australia in the form of renewable and sustainable practises thus contributing jobs, innovative technology, and pride to the country.

**Target schools:**

* Reach: HBS, GSB

- Target: Sloan, Wharton, Darden, Haas
    * *There are rumours that Haas is introducing a deferred program in 2021.*

&amp;nbsp;

**(4) OTHER**

**International exposure and languages:**

* Two months in Tanzania

- Two years in Germany
    * *Can speak German at an elementary workplace level which I learnt in my own time.*

**Matriculation:**

* Aim to work for 3-4 years before matriculating
    * *Assuming that I am accepted into a deferred program.*

- Will be ~27 years old at time of matriculation

**Essay discussion points:**

* Aspirations to lead and make a positive impact.
    * *~~Unfortunately~~ Fortunately I have no ‚Äòsob stories‚Äô.*

-  MBA goals

* Time spent in Germany

I am a 4th year undergrad student in Computer Science at an Indian University. I recently started looking into applying to a Masters abroad, preferably in the US.

Academically speaking, I haven't really had much luck (**GPA 2.3/4.0**) and nor have I participated in any internships, so I presume my chances are slim for getting into a top tier university but I still want to give it a solid try (Purdue would be nice as a best case).

The first three years were a blur and I have only now really grasped what I can do with this degree and what I need to be doing with my life. I really want to work hard on improving my prospects, which will be hard but I am ready to give it my all.

I have decent English proficiency but lack or am pretty weak when it comes to networking and talking to professors. Which cost me quite a lot as I was navigating my undergrad. It was a combination of laziness and a fear of failure that really held me back and I am working on improving these skills.

It's my final semester and I aim to try to apply either this year or the year after and plan to give my first attempt at GRE this August. But I need to know how I can approach this process?

Any tips on how I can plan out this semester and the following months to increase my chances at getting an admit?"

I've been trying to apply to entry-level software engineer jobs and don't seem to be getting any leeway in receiving any interviews.  Maybe my experience doesn't hold up against other candidates and maybe my previous employer doesn't ring too many bells.  I'm currently a web dev but don't feel like I'm doing much and not being utilized to my fullest. I graduated in 2018.

Should I also start applying to internships to receive a stronger pedigree of companies on my resume? What are some of your ideas on how I should move forward to getting an entry-level software engineer job?

I have kind of been in limbo since then having applied to get an MBA and even though i have been accepted, i dont think i will be able to go through with getting a masters. The reason i even applied was to see if i could use the business knowledge to get a job in a business field because as the time i graduated, programming was not it for me. I didnt want to hear anything about coding.

 In November i started looking into making a project to put on my resume because i have no projects and have not done any internships. I am starting with making a web app that connects to the Spotify API using react. 

The reason for all that is i want to know when employers will stop considering me a new grad. With my track record in coding I might need a lot of help and i feel like new grads are given some leeway(feel free to correct me). I am applying to entry level positions and hoping that they wont be bothered by the huge gap between May and whenever-they-see-my-resume-and-hopefully-offer-an-interview."

(Fall 2020),OMSCSThrowAway1984,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/el1m5n/objectivestatement_of_purpose_review_fall_2020/,"If anyone could take a quick look at my essays and tell me if there are any glaring problems I would really appreciate it.

**Objectives**

To gain a deeper understanding of Machine Learning and its applications in Computer Vision and to use my knowledge as a research engineer/scientist.

**Please describe your background (academic and extracurricular) and experience, including research, teaching, industry, and other relevant information. Your space is limited to 2000 characters.**

My undergraduate studies started by perusing dual degrees in degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I was always fascinated with every level of computing and strove to understand how everything worked; from a single transistor all the way up to programming language abstractions. My interest in complex systems led me to working as a research assistant writing agent-based models for research focusing on the evolution of multi-agent interactions where I eventually went on to co-author a paper published in ‚ÄúPhysical Review E‚Äù.

During my studies I also completed several industry and academic internships. Most notably an internship at REDACTED where I wrote applications used for conducting aviation research. I was responsible for writing an REDACTED application in Swift that emulated REDACTED to be used to test REDACTED.

After my graduation in 2018 I accepted a software engineering position at REDACTED. Here I worked on a team creating the storage layer for REDACTED , the REDACTED. My work has been centered around the design and implementation of algorithms to REDACTED within a multi-tiered distributed system while optimizing the speed of operations such as REDACTED.

As I continue to gain more experience I strive to branch out and learn about new contemporary research topics in computer science, namely Computer Vision. The courses that OMSCS offer will allow me to dig deeper into the field of Computer Vision and allow me to contribute to the growing field.

Statement of Purpose

**Please give a Statement of Purpose detailing your academic and research goals as well as career plans. Include your reasons for choosing the College of Computing as opposed to other programs and/or other universities. Your space is limited to 4000 characters.**

Ever since participating in research during my studies I knew that I would like to continue my education after I had finished my undergraduate degrees. During my senior year I took classes in machine learning and artificial Intelligence but because I would soon graduate, I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to explore that area in depth through more advanced classes in those subjects.

As I started my career REDACTED, I continued to casually explore the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning through my own projects. Most recently I‚Äôve been heavily interested in the area of computer vision. As an introduction to the problem space I‚Äôve taken the Computer Vision Udacity course offered by Georgia Tech.

Having enjoyed the course so much and after working several years in industry I‚Äôm ready to continue my education in computer science. I‚Äôm seeking the tools to allow me to push the boundary of what‚Äôs possible in computer vision and artificial intelligence and I believe Georgia Tech is the place to provide the guidance to do just that.

The questions I want to answer is; How do we create and utilize new techniques in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in order to truly benefit people. I want to explore the possibility of making life better for everyone by using computers. The more advances I see in artificial intelligence the more I believe that it might be the best way to accomplish that goal.

I believe Georgia Tech‚Äôs Online Master‚Äôs in Computer Science will be the ideal environment for me to gain the knowledge needed to seek the answer to this question. The online format allows me to continue working and doing what I love while also allowing me the chance to grow my knowledge and explore new areas of interest to me."

I have been working as sys admin in this company for almost three years. I have three other colleagues:
-first is a senior of  almost 15 years with the company, very good IT knowledge and very reliable,
-second a guy who is almost two years at company but has questionable knowledge and is completely unreliable, 
-third a new guy with what seems decent knowledge but is too early too tell.

My boss has been at a company for more then 20 years, he lacks people skills, can be very obnoxious, his IT skill are tied to core program we use and his other IT skills are a decade behind, is very suspicious of new tech/ideas and has trouble understanding some today basic things like virtual machines. We lack a lot of written procedures and things are poorly documented. 
 
Last year my boss implemented a table with job responsibilities. After one year result is that me and the other colleague are responsible for almost 70% of work being done with me being involved in almost all projects. Boss said his plan was to relieve senior guy of some work but only thing that happened is that the unreliable guy is getting less work assigned to him while things he can‚Äôt handle are being assigned to me. Now he is mostly doing intern level stuff while being same title as me as well as similar pay.
I tried pointing out that work should be distributed in a more reasonable way because if the senior colleague or me goes MIA there are serious doubts about how our department is gonna run. 

During these three years I have become a go to guy for majority of people including the upper management. It seems to me that they appreciate me more then my boss who at last years review gave me an average grade even though I completed all my assignments and projects on time. I have asked for a promotion and am awaiting what will come of that. How many have been in a similar situation and gotten a positive result out of it?"

So basically I have this co-op at this medical device company where I‚Äôd be mostly working with the manufacturing team but getting experience with the process design, packaging, QA aspects as well. I thought it would be helpful experience as my main goal for a job after graduation is something in pharma. However a huge negative is the fact that the commute is an hour and a half each way with traffic (the way back today was actually 1 hr 45min Bc of an accident Idk how often that would be). Also one thing to note is that I graduate in the spring of this year and this would‚Äôve been my only internship experience since I‚Äôve only done research and non relevant work up until now. What do you all think is this worth it or would I be fine finding a job without any experience at all and quit this?"

I just graduated with a CS degree in Australia (Sydney). I bombed a few subjects in my last semester so my average mark is down to about 71 and I didn't do any internships. I'm concerned about my prospects of finding a job and am wondering what I can do to improve my situation. I know I should start working on personal projects and learning new languages/technologies/frameworks etc but I find it quite overwhelming deciding on what exactly I should be doing. I've looked at job ads to find skills that are in demand but there seems to be quite a range of different skills companies are looking for and I feel as though focusing on one could end up being a waste of time.


So I guess what I want to know what sort of skills/projects I should be working on to help get a graduate job given my situation. Also I'm wondering if interviews where you need to grind leetcode style questions to prepare for them are common in Australia?

Over the next year I turned that part time internship into a full time hourly, and then a full time salaried position with the title ""software engineer"". At the end of 2018 I got a 15% raise and my first bonus (~14% of my original salary). This year I got no raise and the same size bonus as last year.

We're a small development team building a pretty expansive product, so over the last couple years I've gotten a ton of experience in a lot of different areas. I've gone from writing e2e tests to writing React UIs to writing backend code, to writing and managing cloud native infrastructure code, CI/CD pipelines, containerization pieces, microservices, you name it. I even got to branch out and write a couple Go libraries. Essentially I feel like I've gotten more experience being on this team for two years than I would've gotten in five years at the average tech company, and I'm supremely grateful for that.

But that may be part of my dissatisfaction. I feel like I've now been doing the job of both a full stack developer and DevOps engineer for a year. I'm not gonna lie, I was expecting another raise this year. Don't get me wrong, my salary is competitive, but based on my research (linkedin, glassdoor, etc) it's right in the middle of the average for software engineers in my city. I was hoping I'd get SOMETHING, at least a title change to DevOps engineer, or senior engineer or something like that.

Now to start out the year, our lead engineer has moved to a different project, and since I was the second engineer on this project after him I was the natural choice to take over as tech lead. Now I KNOW that ""tech lead"" isn't really an official title, and rarely comes with increased compensation or anything, and I'm really excited for the increased responsibility and possibly increased influence over the direction of the product. But here I am now adding project management experience to my growing list, and here I am again wanting more.

I'm wondering what kind of raise/promotion I could talk myself into if I started looking elsewhere now that I have all this experience. I love the company and people I work with, but I also want to be sure I keep moving forward where I can. Maybe I just got spoiled in that first year with all the big progress I made, and if so I'm hoping someone here will tell me that I just need to chill the fuck out. I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice on where/when I should be looking to progress and whether or not I'm getting ahead of myself. Thanks."
el4dhj,11,2020-01-06,TIFU - I was fired from my job,throwawayheyheyhey88,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/el4dhj/tifu_i_was_fired_from_my_job/,"Not today, but the beginning of December. The frontpage post today made me reflect on this.

I worked for a buddy at a web design firm. I'm habitually late by about 5-15 minutes, but sometimes I'm right on time at 9 or a bit earlier. A few times I've been later. I was late by nearly 2 hours twice. I was working a 10-5, and had switched to a 9-5 with lunch that I'd usually spend in the office.

I have sleep problems, and I'm deaf in one ear - sometimes it happens and I have no excuse other than ""I didn't wake up"" - I have multiple alarms set and I just didn't wake up. This is how most days are, and I have to set multiple alarms that go off at the same time. As soon as my eyes are open I get up. I use to work a 4 am shift, and I was late for it once. I've been late for work, but I have good work ethic and can be a valuable employee. I don't mean to take advantage of that. If I don't wake up at the time I'm supposed to - I just wake up when I happen to wake up. This isn't his problem - I certainly didn't want to make it his problem, either.

I had a week off at one point to 'do whatever I needed to do' after being late too often over a few weeks. I was honestly stressed and overworked - it's a new field for me, we had a php developer graduate and leave for a new job opportunity (offer from a client), and I had roommates who did shift work. My sleep was just fucked up and I was stressed out. I still managed to get my work done, answer tickets, and no complaints from clients were ever brought to my attention - I talked to most of our regulars daily and had a great rapport. I'd do content updates, sometimes redesigns, and set up the sitemap/ssl/layout/forms/etc. of the site. Sometimes I'd build a site, and my boss would polish it for the client.

We mostly have Wordpress sites that were built with marketplace themes and plugins - it's honestly not super technical work despite what our clients assumed. He was a graphics design major who worked in marketing/commercial stuff, and knew html/css. We had two different interns at different points to handle some routine menial tasks like updates, and I was able to focus on tickets a bit more. No issues for awhile, and I was coming in on time. I know html/css, and I have struggled with JS and php for what I needed - I could have put more effort into a better foundation - but it wasn't my wheelhouse when I started.

I was riding a bike to work for the majority of the 2 years, and was saving some money. Eventually I had my vehicle, and it was fine. The last month before I was let go my vehicle had broken down, and I didn't have the money to put it in the shop. He was gone almost the entire month, and it was me either borrowing a vehicle, bumming a ride from someone, or paying for Lyft to get to the office to work alone all day. We don't have clients come to the office often, and there wouldn't be any while he was out of town. Some days I was able to work from home, but he didn't want me doing this too much because the office would literally be empty - because I was the only person at the office. I had been 10-15 minutes late pretty often due to the vehicle situation, but if I had any work left at the end of the day I'd stay and finish up. Most days I only had 4-5 hours of billable work, and some days an hour and a half or less. I completed whatever I needed to do, and the nature of our field doesn't require me ass in seat at 9 am for anything other than professionalism. I had access to our ticketing system and my email via my phone, and if anything needed to be responded to asap I was on it. He would often be gone for hours - sometimes half the day - in actual meetings or 'going to lunch' and 'meetings' - ndb, he's the boss and I do not really care. I had my tasks and kept busy.

That month had me thinking about how I wanted to find a way to tell him after the beginning of the year that I thought I'd move on. It was a good opportunity, but I'm not a 9-5 white collar office worker type. I can't pretend to be busy when I have nothing to do. I dislike the culture and 'business minded' kinda marketing &amp; professional folks we dealt with - though they were nice people - and I wanted to take some time to myself to realign my goals. He's been a friend for years - it was right before the holidays - and he was closing on a house with his wife, too. I didn't want to put anything else on his plate, and it could wait.

The week I put my vehicle in the shop was the week he came back from being out of town, and one day I woke up late - almost 2 hours late. I texted him, got a Lyft, and was at the office asap. He was visibly annoyed, but nothing was on fire - I got to work and handled everything I would have. I fucked up - I didn't deny that. I woke up late. Later that week it was a Friday morning - no critical tickets and no emails - and my Lyft wasn't going to have me to work until about 9:15-9:25 - ended up much more like 9:30. I didn't text him, but I probably should have - I figured I'd show up and be like ""sorry I'm late, car is getting out of the shop this weekend. last time i have to lyft"". He texted me on my way there and told me to just not come in, and I told him I was already on my way. When I did get to the office he basically told me I had no respect for the job, and getting there at 9 am was the time we were scheduled to get there. I didn't even give him an excuse other than an apology for being late before he cut me off. He also said he wasn't going to pay someone for 9-5 if they were going to track an hour of time (the day before was slow). To me that was unfair - if I had no tickets or client emails that means I'm doing my job - we had that discussion before when it made me anxious that I felt like I wasn't doing much when we were slow. I understood his point. It was rehearsed. I was irresponsible, he felt disrespected - fair. I went home and that was that. My inbox is still connected, and I had a few email notifications for overdue hosting since then - so I don't know if that was part of the reason, too. It honestly doesn't matter - he had every right to do it. I've reached out since then and heard nothing back - so it is what it is for now. Some web devs have told me it's ridiculous to not have a more flexible schedule, red flag was the developer leaving, but they also weren't my boss - and they aren't being coached by others on how to run a successful business. If I had texted him before 9 it'd probably have not been a 'go home' kinda deal. I was leaving regardless, but it'd have been nice had it happened differently. I take responsibility for it - because my problem isn't his problem.

Regardless - it doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're irresponsible or whatever reason. Don't make it a habit, and don't make it a problem. Communication is easier than radio silence, too. Take the consequences. I'm not deflecting any responsibility for this - more just getting it out.

I've been spending some time not working for the first time in a decade, and I'm looking at low-responsibility part time stuff over the next few weeks. I just feel crappy about how it all happened. It wasn't a job I didn't care about, but it wasn't the direction I want to go. I can work on a deadline no problem - I'll probably just bust ass and freelance or something on the side so I can make my own schedule.

Throwaway because this is kinda specific, and I'd rather keep my main account free of personal info.

    I am currently an undergrad at UCLA majoring in Physics with a GPA hovering around 3.5. I was able to get about 9 months worth of internship experience doing front-end development, and I have since decided I want to pursue graduate studies in CS. However, this has been posing me some problems since most grad programs want people with an undergrad in CS. Based off the OMSCS website, this program seems to be more lenient than most when it comes to admitting non-CS majors. Do you guys think that I have a decent shot of being admitted given my educational and professional background?"

My concern is that I've messed up any chances of me landing a good internship. Right now I'm majoring in stats and math and I don't have much experience coding, so I'm pretty limited in the types of jobs I can apply for, and I'm not sure where to start when it comes learning applicable skills on my own time or doing side projects. Also, I tried to work two part time jobs this semester in order to cover tuition after the osap cuts, which ended with me not having enough time to study during exams, and I tanked them as a result. I have received the marks back and it has brought my gpa down to a 2.85. I've already decided to quit working and am confident that I can do well this semester if I put the work in, but I feel like any employer who looks at my transcript is going to laugh and throw my application away.

These comments are usually terribly exaggerated or have very little basis in truth, and they're typically by interns, who often have not even interned at a hedge fund or prop trading firm.

It's not just finance-related. I often see posts bashing FAANGs or specific companies by people who have never worked at these places, bashing the Bay Area or NYC by people who have never lived in the areas, interns talking about how to become CTOs, etc. Furthermore, my suspicion is that some people making these comments do not even have second-hand knowledge of these areas.

Also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.

- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being ""larger"" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.

- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.

- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
 They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.

- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for ""letting him into the house"". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
 She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.

- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.

- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.

- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. 

Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. 

To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to ""get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit"". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.

Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. 

There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

My university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........

I can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can't get a job without experience and I can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn't help as I can't even stick my foot in the door.

I just don't want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I'm not around."

26 year old freshman, doing an Advanced Diploma (3 years) at a college in Canada, for computer programming analyst.

I have an internship coming up this summer, I've been applying for some good names in Canada, but I would like to try and land one in the States.

I have other educations but they are business related and so I know I can't get a software visa based on that.

My question is, does anybody have any knowledge regarding my question or would know of a tech recruiter capable of providing a straight-forward answer? 

My courses contain some of the follow amongst others:

\-SQL, Java, OOP Java, Advanced OOP Java, HTML/CSS/JS, Client-Side JS, C#, C, MainFrame Environment, PHP, Math (Circuits, Boolean Logic, Truth Tables, Binary conversions, Bitwise Rotations/Shift, Statistics)

I am aware that employers care more about what you KNOW (I am trying my best to learn as much as I can on my own time as well), but Visas are ultimately upto the government as well and I am wondering if this can land me a visa.

As mentioned, this is a 3 year advanced diploma, and I do plan on using the bridging to complete it into a bachelors at a university in a short manner of time afterwards, but only if I cannot learn/land a career without it. 

I appreciate anybody taking their time to answer my question. THANK YOU :)"

Questbridge gave me all this hope that I, a low-income URM, was desirable to top schools. As I went through the questbridge process and learned more about who actually got matched, I began to feel inadequate. Why did they pick me when there were much more qualified applicants. It felt like everyone who was matched had much better stats. Additionally, I didn't want to ""play the black card"" or ""play the poor card"" because I figured they knew all of that because I applied through Questbridge. 

I still feel like the hardest part of being a first-gen is that you don't know what you don't know. I didn't know there were so many free online resources or how to play the admissions game. Part of that is because I thought questbridge was my Hail Mary and would equip me with everything I needed to know. Maybe they did, I know I did not take advantage of all of the webinars, articles, and emails they sent. It was almost information overload but I was also in a depressive episode at the time. 

I went to a private, all-girls, catholic high school. You'd think they have resources, that's what my mom thought when she enrolled me. But she actually enrolled me when it was a different school, because my school and my sister school ""closed"" and merged for my senior year so all of the administration was busy and stressed out in the transition. Any who, my counselor had never had students apply or attend top schools. Actually, I believe a girl two years before me had applied to Dartmouth, but she was rejected. Therefore it was still a rare occurrence. I know other schools like mine on the other side of town that have Upenn admits and high test scores. The highest score at my school in recent history was a 34 two years ago. (For context I had a 27 ACT, at the time, and only me and one other person took the SAT I and SAT II) (My SAT is a 1270, I do not feel like looking up my sectional scores but I had low scores , but high for my school where a 24 is the average I believe)

Okay, I got a little rant-y and off topic. For some reason my school always had lower stats. We had roughly 10 APs offered before senior year but after the merge they upped it to at least 20. So now I look like boo boo the fool. Also our sister school had higher stats (but also grade inflation, they went off the ten point scale and we used 92+ = A, something along those lines)  and more AP offerings. 

&amp;#x200B;

My freshman year my house was foreclosed on so my sophomore year my family was homeless and I moved in with my aunt. I hated the lack of privacy and other stuff but I don't dwell, I had a roof over my head. Also I got super involved in school that year to avoid the house so that's a plus.

&amp;#x200B;

Junior year I peaked, I was treasurer of a statewide classics organization. I was a questbridge CPS. My grades were fantastic and life was grand. 

Senior year (I had to dip my balls into thousand island dressin cuz) I got depression (pls tell me someone got the reference I'm using humor to cope). I had a good rapport with most of my teachers so when I wasn't performing as well, they kind of gave me a pass. I was absent at least 30 days senior year. I already struggle with math so uh bitch failed AP Calc (should've just taken regular calc in the first place, The calc teacher grades easily and a friend who usually has similar math scores as me graduated with a 100 in the course, also I was lowkey chasing the prestige I don't like math and I wasn't necessarily going STEM, so I was just doing it because I wanted that ""rigorous course load"" and to say I was taking 6 APs senior year. ) Which like yeah that would've fucked me over enough as it was. Even better, my mom didn't believe I was depressed and wouldn't help me. Because we had no insurance and 18 is a limbo age in my area where children's psych won't take you and adult psych is all inpatient, I had almost no resources. I got put on meds that made me tired all the time. Oh yeah and I forgot, my grandpa died 11 days after my birthday and on the day of my Upenn interview. My first grandparent to pass and I had to go to work right after I left his funeral. So yes January, after I sought out own psychiatric help, I was put on meds with no therapy because there was 3 month WAITLIST for therapy. Gang gang. I was suffering from insomnia but was couldn't get out of bed and crying everyday. So I miss the brunt of 3rd quarter. I get back two weeks before 3rd quarter is over ( I went to my local children's hospital and spent one night there because ha not even the hospital had resources available for me, they said there was some sort of spike and they'd just keep me in the regular hospital for a few days, I just cried more). They did give me a social worker who was able to get me off the waitlist for therapy, which was good except the therapy at the facility isn't that great, never worked through any of my trauma just did talk therapy about school. Back to 3rd quarter, had one teacher straight up refuse to let me take the tests and quizzes I missed so even after spending 40+ on AP Gov, he gave me a thirty. Yay! Another failing grade, but this time, it is required to graduate. Other than that I had a class that met once a week, something my school introduced as ""tea bells"" well I literally had missed all but two classes up until that point and the teacher was pregnant and said if I don't get everything in by the time she goes on leave, I get a zero. So I got a zero after spending 30+ hours on her work. I was also still depressed so I cried everyday, just weep in class, had breakdowns in the bathroom and none of my teachers cared, well a few cared. I hated the new school and it reminded me of my failures. I do be bawlin right now but i think this will be cathartic. So I don't get my diploma on time because I don't have the credits to graduate in my state. I couldn't do summer school because I had an internship at one of the top 3 children's hospitals in the US. I finally cashed the settlement check I got from an incident where I was accuse of shoplifting and was patted down at 6 which then gave me nightmares. I spent half of that check on tutoring so I could graduate. Came in, took the exams, one of them I had already taken once and they did regarded my previous 96 because they had to ""test my proficiency"" k yeah. passed, got my credits. My summer after senior year was no summer because I had tutoring until mid-july and was working 40+ hours a week on top of that (it was for my internship though). O yeah and my dad left my family in may so yay cool. I had committed to Duquesne University on a full ride but my mom kept taking about a gap year to give me time. I reflected on the school and I didn't like the school. (relevant sidnote my mom is physically and emotionally abusive, typically when under stress but my therapist also thinks she has an unhealthy attachment to me. But I bring this up because she kept kicking me out of the house over the summer and college was going to be my escape from her but I caved for many reasons and took the gap year. On a related note, I was r\*ped in august and she kicked me out for that, so that was fun and traumatic I think I've just stopped processing my emotions.) My mom has been working three jobs since august but even before that, she worked night shift and could not get my brother to school without my help once she started at a job an hour away or when she worked out of town. I stuck around to help. My mom and brother have since moved and I've helped with that and I've basically taken over as primary caretaker of my brother, which I have been for a decent portion of his life (he is 12 currently) even when my dad was in the picture, he was unemployed for 50% of my life then switched careers to be an on the road truck driver so he was barely home anyway. But yeah without his income my mom had to pick up the slack because she can get paid like 3x as much as I can with her experience. 

But how will they survive if I go to college in fall 2020, my therapist and caseworker theorize my mom will find another way to keep me home. I do all the cooking, the cleaning, the laundry, grocery shopping, etc. My brother does garbage, and my mom pays the bills. I only stay because I know my brother needs someone (and rent is free). He wants to do online school for many reasons and my mom was hesitant but it would mean he does need rides to school and basketball (maybe).

&amp;#x200B;

got wayy off topic from why I started this post. I got my act up to a 30 which defies the odds for my high school, and possibly for people from backgrounds like mine. Granted I knew nothing about subreddits like this or college cofidential but I don't see anyone like me represented in the stories colleges share of their students. I don't see anyone like me on these subs. I don't see anyone like me in college reaction videos. I am starting to feel  like maybe people like me aren't supposed to go to top schools or have a voice. People like me are supposed to just work low wage jobs or go to community college (which I'm not dissing, it's just not what I wanted). Maybe I'm never destined to own a home and I'll have a bad credit score like my mom because that's what I'll have to do to survive. I see people from privileged backgrounds thriving, not people from backgrounds like mine (though I admit I have many privileges myself). Maybe I am destined to continue to live in poverty and continue the cycle. That seems to be what the system is good at.

Good evening all. I am a 27 year old working full time as an Aircraft Mechanic for a major U.S. airline. I have always been interested in programming and software development but somehow always been pulled away from pursuing it. I am currently pretty unsatisfied with my career choice, even though I am good at what I do and the pay/benefits are better than I ever expected.

Being that I am unhappy in my field, I cant see my self doing this for the rest of my life. I have a B.S. in Aviation Management but I was thinking about going back to college and finally pursuing what I always wanted to do. Except I don't really know the best way to do this.

\- First idea (not sure if its a bad idea or not) : Get a M.S. in Computer Science online. Through my research and phone calls to college counselors I would have to take 3-6 prerequisite course because I don't have a degree in a related field. I cant help but to think that I will feel extremely behind in graduate level courses with only 3-6 prereq. courses and no programming experience. Any opinions on this?

\- Second idea : Get a B.S. in Computer science so this way I will wont feel so behind. (This is my second choice because having a graduate degree will obviously take me further. Ultimately I plan on going back for a M.S. degree so it would be nice if I can skip this idea to save ALOT of money and time.)

\- Third idea : Try to learn on my own. (I really don't like this route because I believe that school and having a formal education will help me in the long run. I also think that I will have trouble learning on my own so this is truly my last resort.)

I have almost no experience in programming so I recently started Complete Python Bootcamp on Udemy to prepare for whats to come.

I plan on continuing to work full time and doing any college courses on my days off or doing an entire online program. So I am curious how hard will it be to find a good job after college with no internships and no experience in the field?

Any input or opinions are appreciated."

I was hired as a Data Entry Clerk/Administrative Assistant, but there‚Äôs a whole side to my job they haven‚Äôt taught me yet (I‚Äôve been here a month). So, I can pretty much get done all of the stuff I do now in literally a day, and I‚Äôm stuck here for 5 days a week. I either sit in my office and stare at my phone, or I get sent to so busy work (organizing papers from 10 years ago.) I get it, I‚Äôm the newbie and I‚Äôll take the busy work, but at this point it‚Äôs getting to be like 80% of my time.

I‚Äôve only been here a month. I started here on a Monday and the Friday before I started, I went on a second interview for a different job. This job pays more (pay still isn‚Äôt great, but it‚Äôs a much larger corporation, so there‚Äôs the possibility of raises) but it‚Äôs a great starter job for the field I want to get into. I‚Äôm planning on mastering in Healthcare Administration, and the program I‚Äôm looking at requires experience. But it seems that all entry level Healthcare Admin. jobs still want experience in a clinic. So I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for the opportunity, which is working directly with patients, nurses, and doctors in a clinic. The healthcare corporation is huge and my boss specifically stated she wants me to start in this position so I can grow into bigger positions. Even if I decide to leave at this Healthcare organization, the experience will be incredibly useful on my resume. So, I went on the second interview Friday, started at the non-profit on Monday, and then that Friday I got a call for the job offer. I had planned to give my notice the next week, but then HR informed me I wouldn‚Äôt be starting until late January.

Now, I‚Äôm incredibly fortunate to have my parents support me and help me out. Theoretically, I could have quit then, but I like money and I didn‚Äôt want to sit at home all day, so I worked here for about 3 weeks knowing I had another job offer. This kind of makes me feel like I‚Äôm stealing money from a nonprofit since they give me very little work to do and I know I‚Äôm going to leave.

Anyway, yesterday marked the 2 weeks before I start my new job. I plan on handing in my 2 weeks (well, slightly less than 2 weeks) tomorrow. I don‚Äôt know how my bosses will take it. They have mentioned that they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to stay too long because I‚Äôm young, but this is also a very short stint.

My boss‚Äôs office is right down the hall from me. Do I tell her in person? Do I send an email? I could stick a letter in her door, but her door is almost always opened. I don‚Äôt even know how to start the conversation. Do I tell them what I mentioned above about my future goals and how this new job aligns with the goals? Should I go to HR first? The HR assistant is the one who hired me and, to be honest, I would feel totally more comfortable talking to her first.

I don‚Äôt plan on using them as a reference or putting this job on my resume. Good news is that I finished my degree/my internship in December and will start my new job in January, so there‚Äôs pretty much no gap on my resume. But I also don‚Äôt want to be a rude person even if I don‚Äôt plan on using them in the future, just because my boss and coworkers have been nice to me."

I've spoken to some people that said getting a computer type of degree from a community college would be a bad idea. going to University to do computer science or engineering is not an option because I won't be able to pass calculus or physics no matter how hard I try, so talking about it would just be a waste of time. once I do a few internships and have a good GPA, I should be able to land a job right? I mean there's a lot of people that go to a coding bootcamp and they're able to get jobs as a programmer.

I live in London (Zone 4) and am debating going to one of UCL or Kings to study CS. I would certainly be living in halls for first year and then would have the flexibility to live at home if I want to save some money or whatever, I think studying in London would be fun, i'd get to live more centrally which would be great and would enable me to get to know my city more.

I just want to know if there is any extra benefit to going to uni in London when it comes to internships, that I wouldn't already have due to living here, i.e. do universities prefer to recruit from London unis, may they not want to offer me an internship because of how far out I live etc.

Also the two universities I am looking at outside of London are Manchester and Birmingham, does anyone have any input when it comes to opportunities and the quality of the four unis I have mentioned, perhaps a comparison or ranking best to worst. As far as I seem to understand it goes something like UCL&gt;Manchester&gt;&gt;Kings&gt;&gt;Birmingham. Would really like some more info on Kings and Birmingham especially.

Also just reading over my post, I don't know how but it seems to be written in a very annoying way, so sorry if anyone feels the same.

elefhg,20,2020-01-07,"Doing computer science and premed, considering dropping one. Would like some advice if possible.",shakasammy99,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/elefhg/doing_computer_science_and_premed_considering/,"Title basically.  I‚Äôm considering one of these to drop, and maybe my views of computer science are disillusioned but I would appreciate any input you guys have.

As the title says I‚Äôm reconsidering a career in medicine.  Medicine used to interest me a lot, and it still does.  However I‚Äôve always wanted to work in computer science, but the more classes I take I find that most of them don‚Äôt seem the to terribly relevant.  

However the more I hear about a profession in medicine the worse it gets.  The stress and studying in Med school, long hours in residency, and the fact that you have to give up almost a decade of your life before you start practicing.  Sure the pay is good, but I‚Äôm starting to think that the stress associated with medicine.  My grandfather and father worked in high stress jobs, and it‚Äôs taken a toll on them and I‚Äôd rather avoid a similar fate if I can.  The thing is I do enjoy working in medicine.  I worked as an EMT as well as an ER tech, and they were pretty interesting jobs.  Biology and chemistry were interesting courses as well, not too much trouble with them.  But it‚Äôs mainly the fact that you put in so much time and stress to become a doctor that‚Äôs really deterring me.  Seems like lots of doctors regret losing out so much of their life, at least what I read online.

Which leads me to Cs.  I do like Cs, but I can‚Äôt imagine myself working a desk job for the rest of my life.  In fact that‚Äôs what pushed me into medicine; everything is interesting and new.  I definitely would consider myself above average; I did one research stint and one internship and a large company.  I enjoy pursuing projects in my own time, but can‚Äôt see myself slaving away at a desk for the rest of my life (that‚Äôs what my uncle does).  The thing is I don‚Äôt enjoy upper level computer science courses; they aren‚Äôt very relevant to the fields I enjoy working in.  But I‚Äôm hoping in the end I‚Äôll get a nice, not too stressful job that pays decently.

This brings me to my dilemma.  It‚Äôs becoming difficult for me to pursue both paths.  My school has a lot of computer science prerequisites, so it‚Äôs difficult for me to fit in premed classes.  To fit in everything I‚Äôve had to cram in multiple science classes on top of my Cs and math classes; I‚Äôm maxing out almost every quarter.  At this point I feel like it might be better for me to go with one or the other.  I don‚Äôt have time to do all the science classes I would like for premed, and I wouldn‚Äôt have time for premed research/shadowing (I don‚Äôt even have anyone to shadow with) with CS internships and side projects.  I‚Äôm just unsure of what to do at this point.  Should keep going and try to do both at the risk of spreading myself thin?  Even if you don‚Äôt have any recommendations on what I should do any input on my perceptions of the computer science field would be great."

I've been applying for full time positions in both the USA and Germany since July (\~5months), and I just can't seem to get people to even consider me. Admittedly, I've already applied to 150+ jobs... I read job listings and know I could do them no problem. I have about 4 years of programming experience using both Python and Java, 3 years using frontend tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and also internship experience as a Graphic Designer and Web Developer. I even have a handful of personal projects and group projects listed on my resume and GitHub account.

I'm specifically seeking a role as a software developer/engineer or a React frontend developer. I guess all I'm writing this for is just to get some advice and maybe hear similar stories. Any words of wisdom?

Here is my resume if interested: [https://imgur.com/m8cguvO](https://imgur.com/m8cguvO)

I will just go ahead and answer some of the questions I've seen as I'm reading these comments:

Located in Birmingham, AL but looking all over USA and Germany for positions. I'm looking in Germany because ""Why Not?"" and because I speak German and love the culture. It's less likely I'll get a position there, but what's the harm in trying. I graduated from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (not a prestigious CS university). I am specifically seeking to relocate, and I'm applying all over the US, not just tech hubs. 

Just to clarify, I've already successfully gotten a job offer on a much worse resume. I had to decline that offer though for personal reasons. My soft skills are not the problem as I interview very well, and leverage humor, humility, and eagerness to learn. I have had technical interview experience as well, but not so great at coding challenges."
elewzg,5,2020-01-07,So I'm here. But what do I do?,GooberDanger,InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/elewzg/so_im_here_but_what_do_i_do/,"So this is my first IT job. I'm in college for a 2 yr. tech degree and the final part of the curriculum is a 3-month internship at a local business. I guess you could say I'm helpdesk, but I don't really have a title here. It's an unpaid internship so I'm not really being supervised by anyone, but I still need at least 30 hour weeks for the credits. There's no IT department here, there is however a Network Admin. that works remotely to upkeep their network. It's a smaller place, no AD, no VoIP, nothing really requiring servers so there are some smaller switches and that's it. It's a 120 person Christian youth org. with about 60 Chromebooks, 20 HP laptops and 8 HP printers, 1 brother printer and 1 Xerox printer. A few IOS devices are floating around too. 

I've only been here a few days but the most tickets I've seen in one day was 6. Pretty much everything so far has been password resets, people unable to log into the WiFi (did I mention there are 4 ethernet ports in the building, which are plugged into nothing? The only things using ethernet are the damn WiFi AP's Literally everything runs off of WiFi here, there are 18 access points) and a driver issue. Oh, there was also a mouse in a printer, fun. 

I don't know, this almost sounds like I'm venting or something but I really am asking a question. What in the world am I supposed to do with this low of a ticket flow? All of my previous jobs have had a great workflow where I knew what I was doing and what was expected of me. Is this really what IT is? Do I just hang out and keep reading this damn certification book all day waiting for a ticket to come in? Even though I'm unpaid it feels like I'm just dead weight and providing no service to the company. And I have actually made efforts to stir up work too. I've inventoried all of the devices, started checking them to ensure they are up to date and have started to make documentation of important things and my tickets. 

Thanks, guys."

I applied for IBM‚Äôs Front End Internship 2020 role, and all started off pretty great. I completed the ridiculous IQ test and lots of forms and then was sent a coding challenge. Coding challenge was a little tricky with some binary tree implementations (which is a bit in depth for a front end position) &amp; some multiple choice about development. 

All went well and I received an email a week later from a recruiter scheduling an interview with one of the developers. My interviewer was a programmer himself and asked me a lot of behavioral questions. I was then able to ask him some questions, but since they didn‚Äôt know which team I was going to be assigned to nearly all of them went unanswered. 

Following this interview I received an email to fill out my university information (graduation date etc) which I thought was a great sign! A week after this I was scheduled for a second ‚Äúbehavioral/fit‚Äù interview. This is when things get bad. 

When it comes time for my interview, I log in and wait in the video conference lobby, and wait and wait. After 15 minutes (of what was supposed to be a 30 minute interview) I gave up and emailed my recruiter and asked if the person i was meeting with needed to reschedule. This email then bounced back to my inbox because they apparently ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt exist in the ibm system‚Äù ...

My next step was emailing the person I was supposed to meet with, and then calling my recruiter by phone. The recruiter told me she no longer worked for IBM &amp; had no contacts for me to reach out to or next steps.

The man I was supposed to meet later emailed me back apologizing saying the meeting was scheduled while he was ‚Äúon vacation‚Äù and that if he has a role that would be a ‚Äúgood fit‚Äù the new hr member will reach out to me.

I can‚Äôt help but feel I went through all of that to basically be back in stage 1 and waiting for them to see if they have a role? How did he miss an interview and then suddenly not need to interview me? Very disappointed in IBM‚Äôs organization, and even more frustrated that I had to be the one to reach out to right wrongs. 

TLDR: Interviewer didn‚Äôt show up for a 3 round interview, my recruiter left IBM and never told me or assigned me a new one, and now I don‚Äôt even get to be interviewed


EDIT: After reading replies both positive and negative towards IBM, I want to say that this situation was most likely a result of a bit of disorganization from a few particular people and doesn‚Äôt represent IBM as a whole. I have reached out to the manager of IBM recruiting and hope to hear that he is willing to respond and set a new interview and get me in touch with the right people. I‚Äôll post updates if I hear anything!

Should I stick with the full-time gig because it's not far off from what I want &amp; full-time/stable, or follow the federal route which would take longer to get to where I want to be, but pay better and put me in an area that I'd prefer to live?

&amp;#x200B;

Hello hello. So, I just graduated college with a B.S in Natural Resource Management and am starting to get job offers and trying to weight the pros and cons of two main options. A wee bit of my job history, I've been working for five seasons at a local county parks system that's regarded as one of the best in the country as their Trails specialist. Basically doing everything from designing trails, hiring and leading trail crews to build these trails, creating management plans for the trails, and a fair amount of GIS work (developing procedures for the trails division and overseeing a trails specific GIS intern).  This past summer I managed to only do remote GIS work for this county park district and took a trails crew position with the National Parks. Ever since I've been conflicted as to which organization will prove to be the best for my long term goal of overseeing some sort of natural resource based division in a place that isn't in the midwest.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1:** **Stay with the county parks as I am promised to have a full time job here in a few months if I want it.**

Pros: With the county parks I have exponentially more say in what goes on and pretty much free reign to design and build whatever trails I want. I'm a big time mountain biker and most of what I do at this job revolves around creating mountain bike trails. Along with this, though I do think I am decent in this more managerial position, I think I need more experience to truly excel and this job gives me a great opportunity to work out the kinks and get one step closer to my dream position. I'm able to manipulate this position into just about whatever I want it to be. Cost of living in this area isn't \~too\~ expensive. More stable than a federal job (tax levee has past with 80% of the vote pretty much since the parks inception).

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: There is no potential to get any sort of promotion. I'm stuck where I am in this organization. They pay is meh compared to option 2. It's in an area that I do not want to live the rest of my life in (it's grown on me the past 5 years, but I can't see myself being happy here in 5 more years). The work place culture is at times toxic, though it is starting to change for the better. Not a lot of like minded individuals within the organization, most see it as a cushy government job and aren't really enthused about the outdoors whatsoever and its been a struggle to find friends within the workplace

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2: Work for a federal agency seasonally until I am hired full-time (Or maybe just stay a career seasonal, either is fine depending on the job &amp; location).**

Pros: The areas I have been offered jobs at are in pristine locations (well known national parks/forests etc etc) and in one of these areas is ultimately where I want to end up. The pay is better even if it means taking a lower position. Working in National park this summer resulted in the best summer of my life and made me an exponentially happier person, motivated to do more inside and outside of work. Allows for the option to stay a bit more nomadic and bounce around the country chasing jobs and seeing/living in several different areas. The potential for promotion is much higher, the pay is better, and the benefits are better. I still get to do what I love, it's just not quite as exiting from a strictly work standpoint. Generally, I fit in with the people I was able to work alongside in the NPS.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: Full time jobs are still hard to get even with lots of experience, could never get one (I am totally happy with a career seasonal type of thing). The actual work I would be doing isn't as stimulating and exciting as the county parks.

As the title suggest I am a math major soon to graduate in May, I have some experience in Python and Java but not near what I feel would be adequate to be successful at a full-time position.  I don't know exactly what field I want to go into either within CS, but that's another story.  I know I enjoy coding problems, and I've been working through ctci.  With that said, it seems like it's a no-no to get an internship after graduation, do you think my circumstances cause an exception to that? or would i still be better off looking a full time position?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty new to coding in python and, as part of an internship interview, they want to see how quickly I can pick things up and learn new things.

The project, in essence, is to create, copy, frankenstein together a web scraping tool. I opted to create a sort of frankenstein script that I altered from *Automate the Boring Things* and here is what I have so far

&amp;#x200B;

    #imfeelinglucky
    #python3
    #to generate google urls from the first page of results for scraping
    #current edition
    
    import requests, sys, webbrowser, bs4
    print('searching...')
    #should retrieve google results from front page 
    #insert query into blank ' '
    
    url = ('https://www.google.com/search?q='+' ')
    res=requests.get(url)
    res.raise_for_status()
    results = bs4.BeautifulSoup(res.text)
    
    #all google search results urls are prefaced with a .r classifier folllowed by &lt;a href= then the url
    #error could also result from incomplete code after storing linkElems
    #text is not making its way into linkElems for some reason
    #could be because bs4 is altering the way the text prints, and then it no longer contains '.r'
    #bs4 is dumb and for some reason changes the .r classifier to .kCrYT
    #issue resolved
    linkElems = results.select('.kCrYT a')
    print(linkElems)
    #not sure how to further clean results into just urls

This script works well, but I can't figure out how to clean the results so that just the URLs are left and able to be separated  individually into a list.

Any help/tips/resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

At this point, I'm hoping the knowledge I've gained so far is enough to at least qualify me for an internship or apprenticeship, but I just can't seem to get my foot in the door when it comes to the employers I'm applying to. I've been automatically rejected from internships for not being a college student and rejected from junior level roles for not having a CS degree relevant work experience. Many don't even ask for a GitHub page or portfolio project, which makes it difficult to make a case for myself when I'm reduced to saying ""No, I don't have relevant work experience. No, I don't have a relevant degree"".

I'm hoping the situation is not such that I have to build up work experience by freelancing for years before many of these employers will even let me in the front door for an interview. I'm confident I can interview well, I just need to get in the door. Any self-taught developers here have some wisdom to share with me on this? Thanks."

Help!,RosehipAnon,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/elslug/panicking_prospective_transfer_got_a_d_in_major/,"I received a D in my Linear Algebra / Differential Equations course, which is a transfer prerequisite for Berkeley's Computer Science in the College of Letters &amp; Sciences, which is the major I applied for. I had an A in the class until the final, which I will readily admit that I did not do my best on, due to extenuating circumstances.

(I will do the obligatory thing of verifying my final grade, just to cover all my bases. The course is an online course with physical exams sent in the mail, and I suspect that I inadvertently not abided by my instructor's instructions on how to take the final, nor the instructions on how to deliver the exam packet. Of course, though, I both *expect* and *accept* that my grade is, in fact, accurate.)

More than just Berkeley, however, I am worried that I've jeopardized my chances for *all* UC universities I've applied to. A ""D"" is bad. It's an indelible stain on an application that postured myself as a worthy applicant by virtue of my ""upward trend."" I will be interning at NASA this upcoming semester, so I will not even be attending remedial courses to make up for the grade. The college does not allow me to re-take this particular course, either. I am, in short, freaking out.

If you've endured my melodrama up to this point, I'd like to ask: **what should I do?**

* Do I email each UC I applied to and inform them of the situation?
* Do I do this before sending my TAU (Transfer Academic Update)?
* Should I tell them about NASA, and how I will be demonstrating proficiency in linear algebra in other ways? (The internship is a machine learning internship, lol. Yes, it's a meme‚Äîbut a meme involving linear algebra)
* Is there any value in the fact that I got 3 A's for the rest of the courses I took that semester, one of which is an equivalent to Berkeley's intro CS course (which not many colleges offer and Berkeley does not typically expect from its applicants)?
* Do I outline how I intend to do better if I take the course at their campus?

I would appreciate any and all insight. Thank you all for your time and understanding &lt;3"

I  did a BSc and then a MSc in Biochemistry. I loved my Master's (thesis  on a fairly niche area of genetics). I moved to London for personal  reasons and I soon figured out that most jobs for my background were a)  around Oxford or Cambridge and b) badly paid. I knew a bit of Python so a  friend suggested I could be a Data Analyst, so after a few months of  applying I got a job at a startup. I had quite a bit of anxiety (was  going through SSRI withdrawal, long story), did not get along with my  manager, and felt that my job was not really necessary ([what this author calls a ""bullshit job""](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/)).  Things were going ...okay until my contract was terminated a week  before my probation ended (later on they also fired the entire  Engineering team). I decided I would rather build than report so data  science/machine learning looked like the next logical step, so I started  looking at junior positions in this area.

A month later, I got a machine  learning internship at a tiny startup. I was very excited but quickly  picked up that my manager (the only ML engineer in the company) was the  poster child for Dunning-Kruger effect (think not using version control  or terrible stats skills). I know enough to know that what he was doing  was wrong and sooner or later it would all implode, but not enough to  basically build their entire ML product (which was somehow expected of  me). After a month it was decided I was not a good fit. Around this  time, I went to a pair programming interview for a Data  Scientist/Backend engineer at a fairly well known company, which I  bombed. I realised I've been coding for a few years but fail to grasp  simple concepts -I have more difficulties than I thought I had and I'm  rethinking if a tech job is for me.

I  took this week to regroup and think about what to do next and what to  apply for. I would love to do bioinformatics or something with genetics  but it seems like what little jobs there are need a PhD. In my spare  time I like to write and read, I looked at scientific editing jobs but  can't find many either. Can anyone else give me some ideas on career  paths? It doesn't necessarily need to be biology/science/tech related.

tl:dr, be very careful what S you pick in STEM!"

\---


*‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù, Grande asked.  The captain‚Äôs face was grey and his eyes bloodshot.  He drummed his fingers compulsively on the table in front of him.*  


*‚ÄúTwenty-seven,‚Äù Sandy replied solemnly.  ‚ÄúEveryone that was sleeping in the easternmost tent.‚Äù*


*Grande shook his head angrily.  ‚ÄúWhere the hell were the guards?‚Äù, he growled.*


*‚ÄúThey‚Äôre included in the twenty-seven,‚Äù Sandy said.  ‚ÄúIt happened in the interval between radio checks, by the time we got a patrol sent over to investigate the missed check-in everyone was gone.‚Äù*


*‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù, Grande shouted, slamming his hand against the table.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre picking us off like fish in a fucking barrel, more every day.  We don‚Äôt know who they are, we don‚Äôt even know what they are.‚Äù  He looked back at Sandy with a haunted expression.  ‚ÄúWe have to leave,‚Äù he rasped.  ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay here any longer.‚Äù*


*‚ÄúWhere would we go?‚Äù, Sandy asked.  ‚ÄúThe merchants said there were people to the West, but not how far-‚Äù*


*‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Grande said brusquely.  ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay here.  Two, three more days of this and they‚Äôll whittle us down to nothing.  We need to load what we can into the MRAPs and head away from the mountains before they have a chance to grab more of us.  West, for all I care, as long as that takes us away from here.‚Äù*


*Sandy nodded and rose to leave the tent, but stopped at a sudden motion from Grande.  ‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù he hissed, a thin glint of terror in his eyes.  ‚ÄúSlow down, lieutenant.  We can‚Äôt be too obvious about it.  If they see us preparing to leave they might try to stop us.‚Äù*


*‚ÄúYou think they have eyes on us right now, sir?‚Äù, Sandy asked, keeping her voice low.  She looked around the tent, seeing nothing out of the ordinary.*

*Grande sighed, looking defeated.  ‚ÄúHell if I know,‚Äù he replied.  ‚ÄúBut as soon as you started prepping the civilians to evacuate yesterday they took our exit.  That kind of response requires constant, precise monitoring.  They‚Äôve got something on us, I just don‚Äôt know what.‚Äù*


*‚ÄúRight, so‚Ä¶  what?  Load up casually?‚Äù, Sandy whispered.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get a few teams to shuffle supplies around, have every fourth box end up in one of the MRAPs.‚Äù*


*‚ÄúJust be sure to move fast enough that we can leave this afternoon,‚Äù Grande said.  ‚ÄúEarly afternoon.  I want to put several hours of daylight travel behind us before we stop for the night.  If we can‚Äôt stop-‚Äù*


*‚Äú...then you don‚Äôt want to be traveling at night close to here,‚Äù Sandy finished, nodding.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of it, sir.  We‚Äôll shoot for around-‚Äù  She checked her watch.  ‚ÄúCall it 2100, that should put us a bit after noon local time.‚Äù*


*‚ÄúSounds good,‚Äù he replied, giving her a thankful pat on the shoulder.  ‚ÄúThanks, Sandy.  I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôd be without you.‚Äù*


*‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs anywhere but here then you probably should have shot me a while ago,‚Äù she replied wryly.  ‚ÄúTry to catch a little sleep, sir.  This is going to take us a while, you have time.‚Äù*


*Grande chuckled grimly.  ‚ÄúOh, I have time,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs never been the problem, lieutenant.  It‚Äôs the back of my brain telling me that I‚Äôm being watched, the eyes in the dark that I can‚Äôt quite see.‚Äù  He shivered.  ‚ÄúNo, I think I‚Äôll sleep on the road.  I‚Äôll sleep like a goddamn baby, trust me, but not here.  Not here.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhat?  He wants us to what?‚Äù, Jackie said incredulously.  She darted a look past Mark‚Äôs shoulder at Tesvaji, seated at the longhouse‚Äôs low table with his family.  Strings of glowing coins lit the hall, and the last vestiges of twilight glowed a rich purple-blue outside the window.  


Mark gave Jackie a warning look, motioning for her to keep her voice down.  ‚ÄúHe wants us to drive him out to a location in the deep desert so that he can check on one of those big stone pillars, like the ones scattered around the village.  He says they‚Äôre important, and that one of them may be damaged.‚Äù


‚ÄúBack the way we came?‚Äù, she hissed.  ‚ÄúIs he insane?  Did you tell him what‚Äôs out there?‚Äù


Jesse nodded.  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he replied.  Jackie gave him a flat look, and he sighed.  ‚ÄúI used the same name the merchants gave us,‚Äù Jesse explained quietly, his eyes fixed on the floor.  ‚ÄúHe seemed to know it but wasn‚Äôt concerned.  He said that ‚Äòthe old ways were safe‚Äô and that we would be traveling far from the mountains, in daylight.‚Äù


‚ÄúAnd did you tell him time of day doesn‚Äôt make a difference?‚Äù, she scoffed.  ‚ÄúSeriously, you two almost sound like you‚Äôre considering it.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know for sure, and that‚Äôs why we should be considering it!‚Äù, Mark said, a touch of irritation in his voice.  ‚ÄúListen, you don‚Äôt have to come if you don‚Äôt want to, but remember our priority list - arcane fucking mysteries.  This *definitely* applies.  From what Tesvaji said, it sounds like a lot of what they know about the land to the east of here is wrapped up in stories, myths.  This is a chance to learn the lay of the land *and* to help him determine if his village is under threat.  Even if it amounts to nothing it could earn us more credit for supplies.‚Äù


‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind going,‚Äù Arjun said.  ‚ÄúThe monoliths in the village were fascinating.  I would be interested to examine another pillar close-up, especially if it has fragmented.  There may be clues in the surrounding rock or the pillar itself that an untrained eye could miss.‚Äù


‚ÄúHow about it, Jack?‚Äù, Mark wheedled.  ‚ÄúWe could use an extra rockologist.‚Äù


‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Jackie sulked.  ‚ÄúBut if I see even one of those god-awful, dried-up-‚Äù


‚Äú...then we‚Äôll all be right there with you running the fuck away,‚Äù Mark soothed her.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not looking to fight.‚Äù


Arjun scratched his chin thoughtfully.  ‚ÄúDid you ask him what function the pillars serve?‚Äù


Jesse nodded.  ‚ÄúWe did,‚Äù he replied.  Jackie looked at him expectantly, but he didn‚Äôt elaborate.


‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know much,‚Äù Mark said after a second, rolling his eyes at Jesse.  ‚ÄúHe said that they‚Äôre old and that they protect the land from something, but‚Ä¶‚Äù  


‚ÄúBut?‚Äù, Jackie prompted.


Mark sighed.  ‚Äú...but that‚Äôs just because their name for the pillars literally translates to something like ‚Äòrocks that are old and protect stuff.‚Äô‚Äù


‚ÄúEver-protecting stones,‚Äù Jesse mumbled.


‚ÄúOld fuckin‚Äô protecty-rocks, and if you don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt delegate,‚Äù Mark retorted crossly.  ‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs not much we couldn‚Äôt guess.‚Äù


‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Jackie said.  ‚ÄúSure, fuck it.  Life is overrated.  Tell him we‚Äôre in.‚Äù


Mark nodded and turned away from the group to face Tesvaji.  ‚Äú*Ademen aeva sas isin,*‚Äù he said, drawing a happy grin from the Madi.  


‚Äú*Sasimyn taiv asade gasi*,‚Äù Tesvaji replied, inclining his head to the group.  He stood from the table and gestured to the back of the house.  ‚Äú*Ademen eivaa-et,*‚Äù he said.  ‚Äú*Co sejhecen cecisa qime ahisiva he u ademen cecisa jhume raujhis‚Äôen.*‚Äù  He gestured to the back rooms, then inclined his head once more and walked towards his quarters.  His family stood and dispersed as well, although Gusje paused to flash a smile at them before she left.  


Mark gestured helplessly to Jesse, who shrugged and scratched his head.  ‚ÄúHe said thanks,‚Äù Jesse explained.  ‚ÄúAlso that we should get some sleep.  I think he wants to leave early so that we‚Äôre back before dark.‚Äù


‚ÄúI can get behind that,‚Äù Mark agreed.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to top up the truck batteries, so we should have the range to go all-out for a day trip.  Out and back, no detours.  Anything more than that and we‚Äôll be dipping into our fuel reserve.‚Äù


‚ÄúBetter to spend fuel than bullets, if it comes to it,‚Äù Arjun said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs less risky, and the guns don‚Äôt have a solar option.‚Äù


‚ÄúLogic,‚Äù Mark said approvingly.  ‚ÄúMy personal philosophy is that most problems are easily solved by being elsewhere.  Besides, I think we could do something about fuel if we really had to.  The truck‚Äôs combustion engine is diesel.  You guys research oil, right?  Do you know how to make biodiesel or something?‚Äù


‚ÄúWe‚Äôre *geologists*, wiseass,‚Äù Jackie sighed.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking of chemists, or possibly hippies.‚Äù


‚ÄúOr chemical engineers,‚Äù Arjun said thoughtfully.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, but I read chemical engineering in school.  At Delhi, then at Stanford.  I‚Äôm familiar with the general theory.  All we‚Äôd really need is a sufficient quantity of alcohol and oil, although those pose their own-‚Äù


He paused, looking around.  The others were staring at him, and Jackie‚Äôs mouth was working soundlessly.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to promise anything,‚Äù he insisted hurriedly.  ‚ÄúIt was all the way back in the eighties, after all.‚Äù


‚ÄúHey, man, in the land of magical midgets I‚Äôll take what I can get,‚Äù Mark said, clapping a hand on Arjun‚Äôs shoulder and ignoring Jackie‚Äôs disapproving frown.  ‚ÄúWorst case scenario we‚Äôve got booze and fryer oil.  We can introduce the locals to fried chicken.  Well, whatever the fuck kind of bird that was at dinner, anyway.‚Äù


‚ÄúI just want to know how you got the senior consultant spot with a degree in the wrong field,‚Äù Jackie groused.  


‚ÄúAh, well,‚Äù Arjun sighed.  ‚ÄúThere was a period of time where western-educated scientists who spoke Gujarati were relatively hard to come by.  I was approached by a very loud Texas oilman looking for a local team coordinator - apparently he was running into issues with his crews and needed someone who spoke ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô to liase.  There were some miscommunications, perhaps a few assumptions I failed to correct‚Ä¶‚Äù  He waggled his eyebrows and grinned.  ‚ÄúI did get my doctorate in petroleum geosciences eventually, so it all worked out.‚Äù


‚ÄúI was born too late,‚Äù she lamented.  ‚ÄúIt took me five years of internships and temping to find a real job after I got my doctorate.  Where were all the oblivious Texans when I graduated?‚Äù


Arjun gave her a sympathetic smile.  ‚ÄúThe eighties were a different time.  If it makes you feel any better, I had to do the first draft of my thesis on a typewriter.  When I ran out of ribbons or needed a particular journal article, I had a man I could bribe with a jug of whiskey to make a run to Ahmedabad.  Normally it took him a week to come back, but sometimes it could take even longer.‚Äù


‚ÄúChrist, I can‚Äôt imagine,‚Äù Jackie said, wincing.  ‚ÄúBad roads?‚Äù


‚ÄúStrong whiskey,‚Äù Arjun said, chuckling.  Jackie gave him a scrutinizing look, but found herself unable to tell if he was pulling her leg.


‚ÄúWell, this should be nostalgic for you,‚Äù Mark coughed.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to find you a typewriter.‚Äù


Arjun laughed, stretching his neck.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not tempt my carpal tunnel,‚Äù he said wryly.  ‚ÄúFor now, I‚Äôm inclined to take Tesvaji‚Äôs advice and turn in.  It should be an interesting day tomorrow.‚Äù


‚ÄúInteresting in the Chinese sense,‚Äù Jackie grumbled.  ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre right.  Time for bed.‚Äù


They filed toward the back, but Jesse paused a moment to look around the dimly-lit hall.  Strings of glowing coins hung here and there from the rafters, their light noticeably dimmer than when the conversation had started.  They swayed gently in a draft, orange and red embers floating around him.  He stood quietly for several long minutes, listening for something that seemed to hover just beyond the range of his hearing, then blinked and walked back to join the others.


---


It was still dark when Tesvaji shook Gusje gently awake.  His cupped hand shone with dull red light, and she raised a hand to grumpily shield her eyes.  ‚ÄúAwake, now,‚Äù he said, his smile evident in his voice.  ‚ÄúYou and your brother are coming with us.  Dress for desert travel and meet me outside, quietly.‚Äù


She blearily sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.  ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me earlier?‚Äù, she grumbled.  ‚ÄúWe were all together when you were discussing the trip with the travelers.  You didn‚Äôt seem like you wanted us to come along.‚Äù


‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Tesvaji said conspiratorially.  ‚ÄúAll of us were there together - including your mother.  By deciding to take you both after the meeting had ended, we‚Äôve never discussed it and she‚Äôll have to content herself with skinning me alive when we‚Äôre back.‚Äù  He flashed her a grin, setting the glowing qi coin in his hand beside her.  ‚ÄúQuickly, now.  Meet us by the chariot when you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù


She picked up the coin as he left, shaking her head at the smudge of ash it left on her bedding.  Her mother would probably be too angry to care about a little ash, but Tesvaji certainly wasn‚Äôt making things easier for himself.  Sighing, she used the wan light from the qi to guide herself around the room as she pulled on her desert gear and good running sandals.  


Mevi was already at the travelers‚Äô chariot with her father by the time she made her way there.  Mark and Jesse were in hushed conversation, while Jackie and Arjun looked like they would very much like to be asleep in the truck.  


She was the last to arrive, and as she approached Jesse held the door open wordlessly for the rest to file in.  There was space for all of them inside - Gusje couldn‚Äôt help but be acutely aware of her small stature in the cavernous interior of the chariot, built as it was to accommodate traveler-sized bodies.  Her feet swung high above the floor when she sat and she had to strain to look out of the high windows.  


The chariot whirred to life at Mark‚Äôs touch and they were off, although she was quickly forced to look away from the blinding glare of the forward lamps.  Gusje realized with a start that Jesse was sitting next to her - her father had taken the other front seat.  The tall man was looking studiously forward at the narrow slice of light that the lamps revealed.  She tapped his shoulder gently.  


‚ÄúThe chariot,‚Äù she began hesitantly, searching for the proper question.  She frowned, then shook her head.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not familiar with saon draim,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúHow then does the chariot move?‚Äù


Jesse‚Äôs eyes flickered to her face before shifting forward again.  When he responded his voice was whisper-quiet.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the words,‚Äù he muttered uncomfortably.  She watched him expectantly but he didn‚Äôt elaborate further.  Eventually he turned towards her and spoke.  ‚ÄúWhat can you tell me about saon draim?‚Äù, he asked quietly.


‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the words,‚Äù she retorted crossly, annoyed at his deflection.  


His eyes widened briefly before he smiled and shook his head, seeming to lose some of the tension he carried.  Several long moments passed where only the crunch of stones beneath the chariot‚Äôs wheels interrupted the gloomy silence.  ‚ÄúStrength,‚Äù he said tentatively, ‚Äúor‚Ä¶  heat?‚Äù  He gestured helplessly, saying a word she did not know.  *Ener zhi.*  ‚ÄúThe thing that heat and light both are.  We take it from the sun, or from burning certain things.  The chariot can use it to turn the wheels or make light.‚Äù


Gusje shook her head confusedly.  It was more words than she had ever heard the big man say at once, but they only raised more questions.  ‚ÄúSo you do know saon draim,‚Äù she objected.  ‚ÄúWhat you said, it‚Äôs the same.‚Äù  She fished the qi coin from her pocket, holding it up to Jesse.  It still glowed dimly in the darkened cabin, and from the side she saw Arjun sit up to watch her closely.  ‚ÄúSee?  Qim take heat and light to give light.‚Äù


Jesse held his hand out, and she placed the coin in his giant palm.  His hand was warm where her fingers grazed it, and she pulled back to watch him examine the tiny disc.  He turned it over a few times in his fingers, running them over the tiny whorls of script around the edge.  ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù, he asked.


She gave him a puzzled look.  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, how?‚Äù, she asked.


He looked past her for a moment, considering, then reached beneath his shirt to withdraw the necklace that he and Mark both wore.  He slid it off his head, handing it to her, then pointed a finger at the thin metal plates.  They were straight-sided, shiny, with embossed blocky script set into them.  


‚ÄúThe qi makes light,‚Äù he said, holding up the glowing coin.  ‚ÄúWhy does the qi make light and those do not?  What is the difference?‚Äù


She turned the plates over in her hand, then shrugged and handed them back.  ‚ÄúThe qi is a qi,‚Äù she replied.  ‚ÄúThese are not.  What do they do?‚Äù


Jesse cracked another slight smile at that.  ‚ÄúNothing special,‚Äù he replied unhelpfully.  He slid the necklace over his head once more and it disappeared below his collar.  ‚ÄúWho makes the qim?‚Äù, he asked.  


She shot him another look, this time of exasperation.  ‚ÄúWho makes the rocks and the sand?‚Äù, she retorted.  ‚ÄúWho makes the warding stones and the cereimyn?  They *are*.‚Äù


She turned to glare at Mevi, who was chuckling amusedly at her frustration while Jesse conversed with Arjun in low tones.  Gusje couldn‚Äôt understand them, but she got the distinct impression that she had just failed a test.  The conversation left her feeling unaccountably frustrated, and she did her best to tune out Arjun and Jesse‚Äôs quiet conversation.  Jackie had fallen asleep behind her, and Mevi was staring silently out the window as the morning twilight began to reveal the shape of the desert around them.  She contemplated both for a moment before joining her brother in watching the land slide silently past.


After a long while the sun made its way above the horizon, coloring the sky with a brief burst of flame before the dull blue of another cloudless day took hold.  Gusje had seen clouds before, pale wispy things clustered high over the cerein or hugging the land around the fields before dawn.  She had a memory of seeing a particularly large one as a young girl and racing to tell her father.  He had laughed and lifted her onto his shoulders before regaling her with stories of Tinem Sjocel and their sky-spanning banks of clouds so thick that they blotted out the sun.  She could never disbelieve her father, but try as she might she had never been able to envision the sight in her head.


Up front, Tesvaji raised a fist and Mark slowed the chariot to a crawl.  ‚ÄúThis is one of the old ways,‚Äù her father explained.  ‚ÄúIt should ease our travel both there and back.‚Äù  Gusje stood up to look out the window better.  The chariot was resting on a flat, smooth stone surface that stretched off towards Sun‚Äôs Birth, marred here and there by drifts of sand.  Behind them, it extended as far as she could see towards Sun‚Äôs Rest.  A feeling of awe and reverence grew in her as she looked on it, the same grandeur she felt gazing upon the cerein of her home.  


The others had gone very quiet, she noticed, and both Jesse and Arjun were staring wide-eyed at the view.  ‚ÄúJesse?‚Äù, she asked softly.  ‚ÄúIs something wrong?‚Äù


---


‚ÄúMotherfucker,‚Äù Mark whispered.  ‚ÄúSomeone tell me I‚Äôm not the only one seeing this.‚Äù


‚ÄúWuzzat?‚Äù, Jackie said sleepily, jarred from her nap by the tone of his voice.  ‚ÄúWe there?‚Äù  She looked around with bleary eyes before their situation registered, comprehension dawning on her face.


Arjun leaned forward, practically vibrating with excitement.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a highway,‚Äù he breathed.  ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be natural.  Look how flat it is, how straight.‚Äù


Jesse nodded.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve cut through a ridge up ahead, look,‚Äù he said, pointing at a low rise that was neatly bisected by the path of the roadway.  


‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Mark said, slumping back in his seat.  ‚ÄúThis raises all sorts of fun questions.‚Äù


‚Äú*Vaeta ra evi vaa?*‚Äù, Tesvaji asked warily, noting their reactions.  His children tensed up, and Mark quickly shook his head.  


‚Äú*Vaa, vaa,*‚Äù he said reassuringly.  ‚ÄúNo problem, just‚Ä¶  *tsa ra gorid sve?*‚Äù


Tesvaji gave him a quizzical look and shrugged.  ‚Äú*Tsad evit,*‚Äù he replied.


Jesse chuckled, and Mark looked back at him questioningly.  ‚ÄúGusje said the same thing when I asked about their coins,‚Äù he explained.  ‚ÄúNobody made it.  It just is.‚Äù


‚ÄúSuper helpful,‚Äù Mark drawled.  ‚ÄúStill, he was right - this is going to make our trip a lot easier.‚Äù  He put the truck into gear and shot a mischievous look back at Jesse.  ‚ÄúSecure the sword, and maybe explain to our friends about seatbelts.‚Äù


The three locals quickly settled into surprised silence as Mark urged the truck faster, then faster still.  Jackie smirked to see Mevi‚Äôs hands tightly gripping his seat while his father and sister stared wide-eyed.  The ground began to blur past, the low whine of the tires against the ancient roadway interrupted only by the bump of an occasional drift of sand snaking over the pavement.  


‚ÄúNow this is more like it,‚Äù Mark sighed contentedly, slouching with one hand draped over the top of the wheel.  ‚ÄúShit, this is smoother than driving down I-25.  Whoever made this road, they knew what they were doing.‚Äù


‚ÄúI wonder how old it is,‚Äù Arjun mused.  ‚ÄúIn a desert environment with little water, its condition doesn‚Äôt tell us much about its age.‚Äù


Jesse slumped forward tiredly.  ‚ÄúOld,‚Äù he muttered.  


‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù Jackie replied.  ‚ÄúHow long does it take for a civilization that builds something like this to forget what a highway is?‚Äù


Arjun beetled his brows and leaned back in his chair, considering.  ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre aware of roadways,‚Äù he muttered, ‚Äúsince they seemed to know what the truck was right away.  This, though, this is *infrastructure*.  It was built for volume and scale that goes beyond anything that we‚Äôve observed.‚Äù  He shook his head.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to form a rather dire picture of this world‚Äôs history.  Poor Dr. Yin may have been on to something.‚Äù


There was an unsettled silence in the truck, underscored by the insistent noise of their passage down the ancient road.  Tesvaji once again seemed to note their unease, but said nothing.  He and his children were engrossed in their rapid pace, staring fixedly at the near-distance blur of rocks and sand whipping past.  


Mark drove for some time, pausing only occasionally to negotiate a particularly large drift of sand that had subsumed the roadway or a rock that had tumbled onto the path.  Never did they see a crack or discontinuity in the monolithic road surface itself, nor did the highway deviate even slightly from its course.  The effect was oddly hypnotic, lulling the truck‚Äôs occupants into a contemplative silence.  Tesvaji would occasionally point out one of the warding stones as they passed, standing grey and unworn in the blistering heat.  


Suddenly, Tesvaji sat up and frowned.  They were approaching another pillar by the roadside but this one‚Äôs surface was dark, its profile uneven.  Mark slowed with a high whine from the brakes as they rocked to a stop beside the weathered stone.  It was tall, perhaps ten feet from the desert surface, and like the stones from the village it was covered completely with flowing, circular script.  Opening the door to the furnace breath of the desert outside, Tesvaji stumped up to the stone grimly and reached a hand out to trace his fingers over its surface.  Flakes of stone skittered down at his touch.  He jerked his hand back quickly, his fingers coated with dust.  


‚Äú*Asaa-et, draad ta ven‚Äôa,*‚Äù he muttered, showing his hand to the others.  


‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Mark muttered.  ‚ÄúShit.  I guess Mosidhu was telling the truth.‚Äù


Arjun bent down to examine the base of the pillar, brushing handfuls of sand aside.  ‚ÄúSome of the writing is worn almost entirely away,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThe other pillars showed no signs of wear at all, it‚Äôs like they were carved yesterday.  This one looks properly ancient.‚Äù


‚ÄúI wish we knew what it meant,‚Äù Jackie said.  ‚ÄúI mean, this seems important, right?  Ancient stones all over the place suddenly falling apart?  They wouldn‚Äôt have put them up for no reason.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs possible,‚Äù Arjun grunted, his focus still on the pillar.  ‚ÄúIf this is a religious shrine they could have raised thousands of them for no real secular purpose.‚Äù  He paused, blinking.  ‚ÄúThen again, who‚Äôs to say that religious artifacts aren‚Äôt more functional here?‚Äù


Jackie shot him an incredulous look.  ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù, she snorted.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one hell of a leap to make given what little we know.‚Äù


‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù Arjun shrugged.  ‚ÄúBut it seems prudent to keep an open mind.  We can‚Äôt - oh, hm.‚Äù  He frowned as a large flake of stone came off under his thumb, crumbling into splinters atop the sand.  A low hum grew around them.  


‚ÄúAnyone else hear that?‚Äù, Mark said nervously, shifting his rifle on its sling.  


Jesse walked over to stand closer to the pillar, resting his hand lightly on its surface.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the pillar,‚Äù he said wonderingly.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs vibrating just a little.‚Äù


Arjun stood up and looked askance at the stone, taking a step back.  ‚ÄúPerhaps we should-‚Äù


A sharp crack sounded and Jesse lurched backwards as though shocked.  Fractures spidered up the length of the pillar like vines, pieces dropping to the sand below until the main column itself slumped sideways and fell to the ground in a splash of dust.  Low rumbles issued from below the sand, and dust gouted from the base of the pillar as a rush of hot gas hissed upward.  


Then, silence.  The dust settled downward slowly before being tugged sideways by a sudden gust of wind.  Mevi and Gusje stood together by the truck, gazes darting around the landscape nervously.  


Mark walked over to clap a hand on Jesse‚Äôs shoulder.  ‚ÄúHey, you good?‚Äù, he asked, peering at Jesse‚Äôs face.  ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù


‚ÄúDunno,‚Äù Jesse mumbled, shaking his head dazedly.  ‚ÄúFelt like I touched a live wire.  Hand‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù  


‚Äú*Vijhad jala evi,*‚Äù Tesvaji said, sounding uneasy.  The desert suddenly seemed to be holding its breath around them, lingering particles of dust hanging in the preternaturally still air.


Jesse‚Äôs head came up to look at the Madi.  ‚ÄúThe wind?  *Vid ra?*‚Äù, he asked confusedly, looking around.  He paused, staring past Mark‚Äôs head.  ‚ÄúTime to go,‚Äù he said grimly.  


Mark whirled around.  Standing a few dozen feet from the road was a still figure.  Its hair hung in ragged clumps over its face, its clothing a patchwork of desert-drab tatters.  With quick, spasmodic jerks its head wrenched upright to stare at the group, eyes glittering darkly in its withered face.  


‚ÄúOh God, they found us,‚Äù Jackie moaned, staggering back towards the truck.  ‚ÄúOh no, no-‚Äù


‚ÄúIn the truck!‚Äù, Mark yelled, unlimbering his rifle.  Jesse did the same, walking backwards to the vehicle.  ‚Äú*Is-et uda!*  Get in and close the doors!‚Äù  Jackie and the others needed no urging.  They piled inside and flung themselves back towards the cargo area with panicked vigor.


Sprays of sand erupted from the roadside as more of the ragged bodies burst upward onto the pavement.  Arjun was the last inside, half-leaping through the open door of the truck to land across Jesse‚Äôs lap.  He yelled and grabbed at the seat as one of the dark figures snagged his pant leg with its dessicated fingers.  Jesse tossed his rifle behind him and hauled Arjun inward, struggling against their attacker‚Äôs dusty grasp.  


The wheels spun against the sandy pavement as Mark slammed on the accelerator, his sudden turn flinging Arjun‚Äôs attacker into the doorframe and breaking its grip.  Gusje leaned in to pull hard on Arjun‚Äôs shoulders while Jesse slammed the door closed, returning the interior of the truck to silence but for the low hum of the truck‚Äôs engine and the winded panting of its occupants.  


Behind them a silent crowd watched as they sped off, their slight bodies dark against the weathered roadway until a cloud of dust obscured them from view.  When it cleared, only the road remained.  


Arjun looked up at the ceiling of the truck, still sprawled across Jesse with his head in Gusje‚Äôs lap.  She looked down at him with wide eyes, and the old man flashed her a sheepishly exhilarated smile.  


‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI believe I‚Äôve just figured out what the stones are for.‚Äù

elwgnx,4,2020-01-08,"Screwed up during college, missing a lot of what I'd need to get a job, where do I go from here?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/elwgnx/screwed_up_during_college_missing_a_lot_of_what/,"First, this isn't a ""woe-is-me"" post. I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm looking for hard advice on where I should go with what I already have.

In college, I was dealing with psychological issues for most of my time there. I originally wanted to do Neuroscience, that didn't work out, switched majors to ""Digital Communications"" which is basically a catch-all for biz-tech sort of things, includes UX design (my original plan for concentration), Design, Videography, Business, and Programming. I discovered I had a knack for programming, so I changed my concentration. I took 4 Computer Science courses, revolving around Data, Java, and Python. In Digicom, I learned web dev, which I grew to hate after I found Java and Python. Everyone in the major needs an internship to graduate, but since I was not a CS major it was hard to find anything, especially being in rural PA. I was also unable to drive at the time due to the aforementioned issues. So I got an ""Internship"" at my Mom's place of work migrating items to a new website. No programming whatsoever but it counted for my graduation. 

I was a loner throughout college, had no friends, have spent the last 4 years playing video games. Despite that I have a 3.5 gpa, which is ok, but doesn't seem to matter now that I'm job searching. No extra-curricular, no charity events, nothing to say for myself.

Now I've recently graduated, still can't drive, have an unknown major which basically equates to a Minor in CS, No real internship experience. All I have is my portfolio website, containing all the code I can say I'm mildly proud of. Yet as I've looked at others' resumes, mine comes nowhere near their's even at entry level.

So what are my options? Do I shotgun applications to everywhere and everything? I've seen people with resume's 10 times better do that and still get 1 bite in 100. Do I go to a coding boot camp, do I try to get a real internship? Do I move somewhere where I could actually commute to something by bike? I'm still young and I don't want to spend my days wasting away at my mom's house. I'm deathly afraid of that.

Here's my portfolio website if you're interested. kyleriner.com

If you were an employer, how would I look to you? Based on the resume and portfolio website?"
elwt7o,2,2020-01-08,Should I wait or follow up right now?,wildnothing99,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/elwt7o/should_i_wait_or_follow_up_right_now/,I applied to a bunch of engineering summer internships about a week and a half ago and haven't heard from any of them. Should I follow up or wait a little bit more?
elwuez,1,2020-01-08,"Returned to College for CS. Two years until I graduate, looking for advice.",wade678,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/elwuez/returned_to_college_for_cs_two_years_until_i/,"Hello all.

I graduated high school in 2012. I was in and out of college up until Spring of 2018 when I finished out my Associates degree. I was in and out due to depression and ended up taking two separate medical withdraws in the process. After a small amount of time post-Associates, I decided to go back for CS.

I just finished an easy semester of required 'fluff' classes and a prereq that was required to start my CS classes. If all goes to plan, I will graduate in the Fall of 2021. I currently have very little programming experience. I know some Python and was able to automate some tasks at work, small stuff. I understand that getting an internship soon is pretty important and will be very beneficial. 

My questions are:

1) What should I be doing during this Spring semester to be more marketable? I know getting some projects out would be helpful for my experience and resume. I just learned that Java is going to be the language of focus in my upcoming CS classes. I assume building projects in Java would double as preparation for these classes, and good to build projects with for actual experience.

2) Should I be worried about the gaps of missing school on my resume? I worked during those times, so I was never doing nothing. But I am worried that my poor grades and break periods will reflect poorly on me now. I am in a much better place, no depression, etc. I really don't want my past mental health struggles to come back and haunt me.

Any advice is welcome and appreciated.

TL;DR: Took breaks in college for mental health. Got my associates in 2018. Just returned to get BS in CS. Will need internship soon. How can I prepare and how can I keep myself from having my past mental health struggles (breaks in school, poor grades) keep me from succeeding in the future?"

There are two unfortunate circumstances that make me want to get my Masters before entering the career field.

One, I'm in the military so its troublesome to intern (still looking to try to do short term internships by building up 60+ days of leave) somewhere for experience. While I finish up the three years left in my enlistment, I figure I should put the time and benefits to good use. Secondly, I'm currently attending Liberty University. Almost everyone I talk to questions my choice in university and says it'll negatively impact my job selection out of school. To combat this, I was going to try and get a Master's online at a well regarded school, such as Waterloo or Stanford. 

Any thoughts or advice? Should I just focus on projects instead of trying to get a Master's?"

I was just told that I will not be extended an offer at my dream internship on the basis of the behavioral interview, where I didn‚Äôt fully explain the technical aspects of my independent project well enough.

I just want feedback from others because I feel that this really isn‚Äôt a fair assessment, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong. This is for a DATA ANALYST INTERN position.
The feedback was regarding my work-in-progress twitter scraping/cryptocurrency prediction project and cited that I was unguided, irrational, and uneducated in my decisions and didn‚Äôt have an understanding of machine learning. He also felt that I was wrong in thinking that I could predict cryptocurrency prices based on twitter.

During the interview, I was asked to explain an independent project. I prefaced by saying I have a more elaborate work in progress project that I could explain, but the machine learning model choice, and the future steps I am still working on to improve. I then gave assumptions I made and the rationale behind all of them and what the basis of the project was going to be. While the interviewer thinks it‚Äôs bs that i can predict cryptocurrency on tweeting volume, there are research papers doing so that inclined me to research this, albeit with a slightly different hypothesis. I feel adamantly that it isn‚Äôt fair to discredit a project because he thinks it‚Äôs not possible, instead of repeating something that has been done repetitively. (I chose to use number of tweets per day mentioning keywords, instead of real sentiment, which is also far harder) I stated the model I used, how I tested a few to start, but had a deadline to present for a club and landed on one that my friend helped me choose and had already coded. I then explained that I don‚Äôt fully understand it, but gave areas of improvement that I am considering, and emphasized again that it‚Äôs a work-in-progress. The final notes said ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt understand ML‚Äù, when I pointed this out myself and said I‚Äôm working on it.

Everything I did in this was entirely self taught. I reflected on mistakes, pointed them out, and explained how I would fix them. Not to mention, this is millions of floors above what the expected work would be. Should I have been less modest about what I didn‚Äôt know? Is this a fair assessment? 

I‚Äôm just truly at a loss for words."

1. are any employers actually going to care that I'm leaving a job so soon?
2. how difficult will it be for me to find a new job there? I did well in school but I imagine I'll be competing with new grads from LA for jobs.
3. am I basically starting fresh or does this year give me enough experience to set me apart? I think I've gotten a solid grasp of my tech stack but nothing crazy.

em0hgh,72,2020-01-08,Untreated ADHD's impact on my self-esteem and why I got treatment,persnicketypeacock,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/em0hgh/untreated_adhds_impact_on_my_selfesteem_and_why_i/,"*TLDR: 27F. Untreated ADHD lead me to progressively feeling shame and self-doubt, which later developed into alcoholism and depression. Getting treatment (adderall XR 20mg) has been the greatest help in  rewiring my mind and re-instating my mental health.*

**Age 14-18:**

I was diagnosed with ADHD at 14 but discouraged to medicate by my mother, for what I realize now was a fear of having two kids on pharmaceutical medication (my sister is bipolar/ depressive/ also ADHD.)

After begging in the name of better grades, she allowed me to try it for three weeks by giving me extra pills from my sister's adderrall batch's. (Which I realize now was reductionist to my concerns.) I played my first-child ""golden child"" role and reported back that it made me ""too serious"" and ""unnaturally better.""

Without treatment at that point, I was still confident, bright and inspired to accomplish lofty right-brained goals. I have a gentle yet sharp way with words and was able to leverage approval from authority figures through participation and sudden burst of verbalized insight.

Candidly, I felt proud about not treating my ADHD. **I thought ""sure I won't ace math or become an engineer but I'll make a great impression on the world with my sensitivity creativity.""** But with incoming harder curriculum and increasing pressure to comply with what it takes to make a life navigable (an education, financial competence, etc) I quickly noticed an inequitable amount of energy necessary to simply survive.

**Age 18-25ish:**

I made it through high school with the minimum GPA to go to the least competitive college in my area.  I didn't achieve a GPA that would have qualified me for career-enhancing internships. I hadn't developed any organizational skills to take with me into ""real"" adulthood, because I was neck above water in stress the entire time, just to barely make it.

I was the first in my family to graduate college and envisioned a feeling of satisfaction from receiving that diploma for years.

I did not feel that. I felt shame. I felt deep, isolating frustration.

I had horrible cystic acne from the stress and packed on weight from overeating to self-sooth.

Once alcohol was accessible at 21, my emotional binge eating turned into binge drinking that would progressively replace all methods of rewarding myself and coping with stress.

I started automating strong negative thought patterns, which I now understand to be basic neurology. ""Neurons that wire together, fire together."" - Donald Hebb

Here are some examples if anyone might relate-

**HS/College thought patterns:**

* *I can't follow most people's jokes enough to authentically laugh and connect to them.* ""***I'm not relatable or easy going.""***
* *I've rarely ever scored a C or higher without obsessively studying.* ""***I must lack the intellectual gifts to be educated.""***

**Early career years thought patterns:**

* *""No technique or habit keeps my room or closet organized for more than a day.* ""***I am a natural slob and will just need to manage that.""***
* *I don't pay my bills on time, even when I have the money.* ""***My financial future is doomed.""***
* *I lost track of the interviewer's question during several interviews for jobs I wanted.* ""***I will probably never have, or even fit in at a job I truly want.""***
* *I can't sustain organization at work and my boss has noticed multiple times.* ""***I will probably be fired from this job and multiple jobs in the future.""***

Perhaps your negative thought patterns may be different based upon your routine during your early adult years. My point is that these negative thoughts bind together and trigger increasingly as life becomes more vigorous.

As more regrets and ""failures"" piled up and costed me actual money, my ""reward system"" was fully deteriorated and nothing was bringing it back. I spent copious amounts of time on self-help and even addiction treatment and they only made me feel worse because I couldn't long-term implement any of the tools they offered. I couldn't care anymore.

At 26, I was officially emotionally dependent on alcohol. My skin lost its suppleness. I stopped recognizing my reflection and thoughts. I started a nicotine habit, despite promising myself I would never. After my rowdy company's holiday party, I ended up in the ER for blood deficiencies and elevated liver enzymes. That was my rock bottom. After some time hibernating and ruminating on the way my life is going, I revisited my ADHD with a no-bullshit, no woo-woo attitude.

Credit to the Youtube algorithm, I found the channel ""How to ADHD."" I had never felt more seen. I took aggressive steps to ensure would try medication. I am taking 20mg of adderall XR in the mornings now as a first experiment and fingers crossed, have found the right tool to bridge myself to a better mindset. The last month has been full of successes and hope.

**Here's the shortlist of my changes thus far:**

* Zero major errors at work in a time span I typically have 5-10.
* The alcohol triggers are less frequent and more manageable. It's easier to discern which moments are compatible with drinking and which are just destructive curiosity
* My room, car and bathroom are staying cleaner for longer periods of time.
* My morning routine takes half the time, leaving me room to enjoy reading or meditation
* My email inbox is organized
* I'm using a calendar and it's not annoying
* I've making appointments with academic advisors to discuss grad school.
* My hygienic habits have never been better.
* I feel more connected to my partner than I did when we first fell in love.
* My speech is concise and more engaging
* I'm lighter hearted and connecting more easily with friends, colleagues and even strangers
* I'm starting to notice that challenges sound exciting more than dreadful
* I'm starting to feel those negative thought-patterns end, and starting to forgive myself for the shame I felt.

This post isn't meant to be pro-adderall. This is pro-getting-real-about-mental health. I'm aware that adderall tends to have it's negative effects but so far for me it's just occasional trouble sleeping. (Totally cool with the decreased appetite.)

Whatever might work for you is worth discovering.

It's hard to say that I regret not treating my ADHD earlier. It could be a great advantage down the road to know that my depression just might be the gap between tasks and the feeling of joy and reward."
em0oce,1,2020-01-08,[Help!] Thinking about studying CS in a government funded program,illbefinewithoutem,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/em0oce/help_thinking_about_studying_cs_in_a_government/,"Hello,

I have recently found an opportunity to study CS for 2 years, where about 6 months is on a work site where you get to work on actual projects (not just ""internship stuff"") as a way to prep you for future employments. Most students get employed there after as well, and something like 95% of the students are at least employed within a year.

I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what I want to focus on though. I have studied web design, both on college level and as a hobby before, as well as having dabbled in coding from time to time. I'd say I could understand HTML, CSS and JavaScript farely well, Python and PHP too. Made some personal Android apps in high school. Definitely nothing that would get me a job, but some grounds at least. Right now I'm having some fun getting into Godot (game engine) and Python again. I can't really say I would enjoy the front-end stuff as much as back-end, even though my HTML/CSS/JS could use some refreshing. 

I'm not quite sure I'd enjoy the industrial side of things either, but would probably enjoy working more on common-user/market projects, even though I realize those are probably rare. I don't know though. The industrial IoT-classes do seem very interesting. And then again, the HTML/CSS/JS bit in the .NET course will probably give me some time to dive into C, C++ or Java on the side. Anyway, these are the two different curriculums: 


**Software Development in Industrial IoT**
+ Embedded C,¬†
+ Embedded C ++
+ Industrial IT &amp; Communication
+ Advanced PLC Programming
+ Industrial Cloud Solutions
+ Integration and Surveillance - IoT
+ Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence
+ Industrial IT Security


**.NET Web Development**
+ C#
+ ASP.NET¬†MVC
+ ASP.NET¬†Web API
+ HTML &amp; CSS
+ JavaScript
+ Software Analysis
+ Agile System Development (Scrum)¬†
+ CMS
+ Code Patterns
+ Web Security

I would love to hear, if anyone's got the time, about your educational background and your current employment. Maybe something about why you do what you do, and what kind of projects you are working on. Anything would be helpful, as I'm feeling rather lost. Maybe it doesn't matter as much as I think it does, but some guidance would be nice either way if anyone feel like they could help me sort out my opportunities. Hopefully I'm in the right subreddit..

Thank you for reading!"
em0shq,4,2020-01-08,"School lied about accepting my transfer credits, grant money, and wasted my time and are still trying to collect money. What to do?",pvgf,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/em0shq/school_lied_about_accepting_my_transfer_credits/,"Background on me first,

Recent Texan University graduate with a bachelor‚Äôs in Kinesiology  
Looked into a trade school for a Massage Therapy license  
24, \[M\], Brown Eyes, Black Hair, etc.

After graduating college in Dallas, I moved to Houston to get a License in Massage Therapy (LMT) at a trade school (for all intents and purposes, we‚Äôll call this school ‚ÄúMT‚Äù for massage therapy). Compared to other vocational schools, MT stood out above the others because they offered exam retakes, dedicated review days, an internship program, and was contracted with other massage therapy businesses in the area that gave students at MT tuition reimbursement opportunities. It was more expensive, but my tuition is covered by the VA so I‚Äôm not pressed about that.

Plus, the advisor was telling me initially that my credits from my Bachelor‚Äôs degree would likely transfer over since it‚Äôs from a university to a trade school (although in their business name, they‚Äôre marketed as a college). 

Sounds like a great deal, right? To top it off, since I am military, they gave a 20% discount off tuition, so that‚Äôs even more money in my pocket. AND TO TOP THAT OFF, the financial advisor that they appointed me said that I qualified for the Pell Grant which was an addition $4k&amp;some. Like, why would I turn down this offer?

Well I didn't. I enrolled and went through the first module of the program with near perfect marks, granted it was Anatomy 1, Physiology 1, and Pathology, all classes that I've taken before. These were some of the classes that should've transferred but didn't along with Anatomy 2, Physiology 2, Kinesiology (what my degree was in), and Health &amp; Hygiene. Come to find out that the only reason that the department head wouldn't accept the credits is because the courses were only 3 hours and the MT program required 90 hours. 90 hours! Turns out, what they meant was 90 contact hours, hours logged in class, and they were looking at the credit hours.

But that isn't what the department head told me at first. He said that it's because courses in a massage therapy program are different than courses in a university. In my head I'm thinking that it's a complete bs excuse but whatever. I wasn't paying for it and I needed contact hours apparently.

Like I said before, a month into the first module of 3 classes, I have near perfect marks and am literally teaching some of the material on my own, I meet with a financial aid advisor from corporate that was filling in for the week. She tells me that I actually am not qualified for the grant because I already have a Bachelor's degree, and that there has yet to have been correspondence between the VA and MT and ended up asking me to take out a loan to pay the total of the course.

I already have loans and don't need to add on to my unsubsidized loans that accrue interest, despite the fact that ""the VA will essentially pay for it"". This wasn't the plan that we agreed on in my initial enrollment, and now I'm out $4k that was supposed to go towards living expenses on top of whatever amount they were requiring me to pay until the VA benefits start to roll in.

So I withdrew from the program. Come to find out a couple months later, my professor teaching the course was let go a week after I left, and that the department head was let go over this past christmas break, and that the LMT program at this school itself is being shut down by the end of this year. I was also met with an email from their head offices saying that I have an outstanding balance from October for $1125 for the time I was there.

So my question to r/legaladvice, do I have any grounds to sue if they insist on having me pay this balance? Should I forgo that idea entirely and just try and get the situation remedied somehow? I have documents saying I was entitled grant money before I enrolled as well as another document after the first month saying I was no longer getting it, plus any other documents I have signed with the school and email correspondence amongst admin and staff in relation to me personally. 

tl;dr: Went to a trade school for the benefits and the grants and the overall affordability after graduating college, turns out they lied about the grants, the money back, and wasted my time retaking classes that was evident in my grades."

This is one of my biggest reasons for wanting to move in the first place. But not the only. 

‚Äî2. Needs to be safe for a brown skinned person. My parents are from India, I am tan. I‚Äôve been ok in US so far with this (don‚Äôt want to jinx it). I‚Äôve heard that Europe might have some racism I should worry about.

‚Äî3. Allows dual citizenship. I don‚Äôt want to give up my US citizenship in case I need to go back. 

‚Äî4. Generally has currency exchange/salaries comparable to US so I could still save up for living/retirement in US if I want/need to go back. I‚Äôm afraid of countries like Switzerland that require 10yrs to apply for citizenship but often just give visa it for 9 yrs and not allow back. 

‚Äî5. 4+ week vacations. This is another big reason for my wanting to leave North America. I have a lot of strong personal dreams that I want more time off of work to accomplish. US is not the best for work life balance, allowing you to hold a second job or vacation time. For me having multiple weeks at a time for travel and personal goals is a big goal. 

6. Preferably not very hot weather at any time of year, I can handle mild heat but even typical NJ US heat is too much for me. I get dizzy and drained and hate it. but I know can‚Äôt have everything. 

7. Preferably one that doesn‚Äôt have a heavy drinking/drugs/sex culture. Maybe I‚Äôm asking for too much with this one.

8. Eventually I might want to be a freelancer/content creator or do something arts but less stable. A country that supports people with less stable jobs would be nice, but not a requirement I guess. 

Any suggestions for what countries would be best? And any other advice?"
em1v11,5,2020-01-08,What is my best option for graduating in May with a degree in Communications with no internship experience and a 2.9 GPA?,owlnothere,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/em1v11/what_is_my_best_option_for_graduating_in_may_with/,"I am beginning to get scared and kind of depressed when I start thinking about graduation. I am starting to realize that I'm about to get my degree in Media Communications and I haven't really done much to support it. I joined a business fraternity and that's really it. I've been working at the same retail job for about 3 years now. Depression really hit me hard when it came to applying for jobs and thinking of better career moves.

My saving grace is that when I was 17 I started a tumblr blog and gained 70,000 followers. I was able to work my way around and I ended up becoming apart of tumblr blog with 2 million followers. I created gifs and post for them. From doing this in high school and being successful at it I decided to pursue a career in social media communications. 

I want to get into social media advertising but I can't help but feel like I've missed an opportunity to do something bigger. but if I'm being honestly I really want to work for a media company like Buzzfeed or working as a video producer. 

I thought about working on a Youtube channel as a side project to use as a portfolio and maybe use that to submit for an internship after I graduate. I'm just conflicted and scared about what to do. I live in Ohio and those job offers aren't really everywhere. I'm not sure if I should just completely rethink my career and give up on a media job

What can I do with this last semester? My grades aren't really the best and I don't know what my options would be outside of my ""youtube side project idea"". If nothing works out would it be best to just apply for some marketing/advertising jobs around my small city. or should I make start something like a meme instagram account to showcase my abilities with social media humor and using that.

My biggest fear is that I end up staying in my hometown of 200,000 people and I end up struggling with debt and have no job. I want to know if its wise to think I could do something like create content for youtube or if i'm being incredibly delusional and should rethink a different career"

em2of2,1,2020-01-08,"Undecided major, should I withdraw and work for a semester?",weaselorgy420,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/em2of2/undecided_major_should_i_withdraw_and_work_for_a/,"Hey guys, sorry for the wall of text.

I‚Äôm in an awkward and very stressful situation and I‚Äôd like some more inputs for advice. I have just finished my 3rd semester at a public university studying biology, although I don‚Äôt quite see what I personally would do with a biology degree. I looked into medicine but after some hospital volunteer work I decided not to pursue medicine. Teaching isn‚Äôt my passion, and research doesn‚Äôt sound much better. I also didn‚Äôt really like my school, it‚Äôs very lacking in the social scene and traditions as it‚Äôs essentially a glorified commuter school. Decided I wanted to reapply to other state schools for a better college experience. Managed to somehow get into a very good engineering school for Industrial Distribution, which at the time just sounded interesting to me because it seemed to have a mix of business and engineering which intrigued me. Didn‚Äôt expect my grades were good enough so I was surprised to see they took me.
Just came down two days ago for my new student conference and I‚Äôve been having second thoughts since getting accepted. I have been afraid about leaving my friends behind and I know that in high stress situations I tend to hermit as a coping mechanism and I don‚Äôt feel like I can make friends in such a state. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was going to like the major, since everyone I told (including some old high school teachers who knew me well) told me that they didn‚Äôt think that sounded like me. I always agreed with them and was like ‚Äúoh well I‚Äôll probably change again‚Äù. Came down here and instantly my stomach dropped and I felt like I was out of place. The school is pretty gnarly and cool, much better than my old school but it‚Äôs very intimidating and I still felt more out of place than ever before. 
As soon as I walked into my new student conference to check in, I got a text that my dad had just lost his job. Great way to start an already stressful situation. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll impact me going to school too much, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt help. I was shaken for the rest of the day and still felt like I may be making a mistake. Day 2 comes and I have my individualized major conference, where they tell me how lucky I am I got accepted in and that it‚Äôs a great degree with fabulous outlook. The problem is, it doesn‚Äôt excite me at all. In fact it sounds incredibly boring to me. They were saying almost everyone goes into sales or supply chain management, both of which do not sound like something I‚Äôm interested in. 
Then they show me my schedule and I have 10 major specific credits and 2 engineering credits. This is where my real concern is. I really don‚Äôt think this is a degree I will stick with, and I already have all of my core classes done, alongside many elective hours from my last major. I don‚Äôt think taking 10-12 credits that will become wasted elective credits is a good move. It will push me to junior status, while I still have no idea what I want to pursue. I have 52-58ish hours currently and I know that a lot of programs try not to admit anyone with over 60 hours in fear that they will not graduate on time. One of my biggest fears is deciding I‚Äôve found a degree I want and having too many hours to be admitted into it.
Now I‚Äôm thinking my best move is to take the spring semester off to work and maybe find an internship, then return in either the summer or fall when I have a better idea of what I want to study. At 19 years old I‚Äôve never actually had a job so I feel like this would be a valuable experience that could help me figure out my next move. My worry is that somehow I don‚Äôt get accepted to the 2 schools I‚Äôd like to attend again, although all that will be different is that my GPA will be higher (3.286 to a 3.487) from last semesters final grades and I‚Äôll have some work experience under my belt. My parents are afraid I‚Äôll never go back to school.

Also to be a little superstitious, I actually applied to this same school in my senior year and got the same sinking feeling in my stomach when I visited the first time. Ended up in such a bad state that I switched schools last second and needed a therapist. Now this all happens the second time. I don‚Äôt normally feel this sinking feeling when anxious, sort of feels like the universe sending a message, especially with all these bad things happening to me at my conference. 

What do you guys think? I spoke to advisors and they told me it‚Äôs probably a good idea to take a break and not add all these credits if I‚Äôm not going to use them. A man in the career center really had a lot of nice things to say about the major and wanted me to try it but he understood my concern.

I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm a good student, just don‚Äôt have a direction yet. Got a 4.0 last semester to prove to myself I could do it. The advisor told me my GPA was competitive to get readmitted to engineering, but I‚Äôm still worried (she said 2.5-3.5 is where most are admitted to this specific part of the engineering school). I could also take 2 or 3 classes at community college to fulfill more recommended courses for admission.

I really just want to get a degree in something I like studying and apply myself to the highest extent. Industrial distribution doesn‚Äôt feel like the right choice. My dad has told me for years to not be like him and study something he didn‚Äôt like and then work a job he doesn‚Äôt care for for 24 years. Is working for a semester a good idea? Are there any downsides that I‚Äôm forgetting? Will it be harder to get admitted somewhere?

TLDR: Have 52 credits from last institution, transferring to another school but don‚Äôt like the major and don‚Äôt want to add 12 major specific courses that will be wasted if I switch majors again. Want to take a semester to work instead."
em3fmm,1,2020-01-08,How do I integrate myself with groups better??,Substantial-View,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/em3fmm/how_do_i_integrate_myself_with_groups_better/,"Hey guys -

I have a problem where I keep self-isolating myself from any groups that I'm a part of, both at work and at school.

For example:

* I'm interning at a company. 
* All the interns get together for lunch, chat w/one another, make plans w/one another, etc. 
* But for some reason - when other interns ask me to join them, I always say no because I think I will have a bad time as I'd be forced to chat in groups with people I don't know well. 
* Over time, the interns stop asking me to do things (because I barely speak to them, and unwillingly turn the cold shoulder to them). 
* Later, I think to myself ""why do no interns want to talk to me"", etc, and feel really bad about this.

The same thing happens at school with people in my program, any groups I'm a part of at work, hanging out w/friend groups I don't know well, etc.

Any advice on how to break this, and integrate w/groups better? I understand that this sounds like a silly problem - ""just go talk to them and try to become friends with them, and you'll break out of this vicious loop"" - but for some reason, I will always think that the members of any group I'm a part of, are ""better"" than me - i.e. they are more extroverted, cooler, talk and make jokes about things that people my age would typically talk about (I'm out of the loop on almost all of these things) and as a result won't want to talk to me, I'll be seen as the awkward / boring one there, etc, which makes it really hard for me to break out of this loop.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."
em3uth,12,2020-01-08,Help deciding between 4 offers,rogersbored,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/em3uth/help_deciding_between_4_offers/,"I have four internship offers for summer 2020:

Atlassian: $49/hour, $6k stipend, 12 weeks, Mountain View/SF

Samsara: $45/hour, $5k stipend, 12 weeks, SF

Splunk: $54/hour, $6k stipend, 12 weeks, SF

Roblox: $55/hour, $6k stipend, free lunch every day, 10 weeks, San Mateo

Some thoughts... I am leaning toward Splunk because it is in SF proper and compensates well, which is probably a more exciting place to be long-term (if I return for full-time). The company is making major infrastructure changes to cloud computing and a subscription model, which is projected to make its product accessible to more businesses. Roblox is also very enticing because of its recent explosive growth and forthcoming expansion into China, which I believe will further propel the company's growth. The office's location, however, is an hour's drive from city life. Samsara is the lowest in compensation, but there is a lot of faith in the company's future and I wonder if I am missing out by not hopping on Samsara while I have the opportunity to. Atlassian is... great, but somewhat overshadowed by the other three.

Would love to hear the community's thoughts."

Somehow, I'm even dating one. I just wanted to say, kids who flaunt money and branded things should be bitch slapped. 

I'm tired of listening to them judging people who don't wear branded clothing. They don't treat them poorly to their faces but when I listen to their back talk, it makes me sick. Ironically, they also hate on rich people for their materialism, yet, they don't realize their own shallowness. 

I once lost my patience and pointed out how they also judge people by their clothing and appearance, but they try to reason it's not a bad thing to be aware of these hints of their character.

One that really pisses me off has a full ride scholarship and full support from their parents. He get more than 2 times as much money as any college student in my school and likes to buy new computers, shoes, gadgets every other month. This guy happens to be my boyfriend. 

After meeting him for sometime, I realize he's really judgemental and has an inferiority complex that manifests in his hate for people who seem to be better than him. Racist and classist.

When we walk the streets he puts pricetags of what people own and wear. He comments of women's appearances and calls some cheap looking. Overall, he shows classic rich mama-boy characteristics. I've pointed it and watched him get angry and bring up shit examples of his ""independence"".

It's more mind boggling because he also rants about how people think he's a bad guy from appearance. How they don't want to be with him because he doesn't fit in. How he understands poverty because his family has lived through it. When we meet, it's all about money and how to make money. Mind you, we equally pay for the dates. I pay for my tuition and lifestyle while working my ass off in multiple internships. He can sleep in and play video games, yet, can't take me out on a nice date. 

I'm getting tired of his materialism and shallowness. I'm getting tired of these lazy rich asians who will make alot of money after graduation. Fuck their asian work ethic with cheap shitty value system.

* IB Robotics and coding club; the school didn't give us (the IB class) club hours in the week, so I founded my own club. I arranged a lab for after school hours, and taught coding and robotics (mostly arduino) to my friends (started it in mid junior year, at my first year in my new school)

I know some Python, C, Bash, and HTML/CSS/JS and I am exposed to Kali, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian [and now Raspian].)

I was asking about finding a job as an analyst and the majority of the responses were help desk and get my basic CompTIA certs during then.

Here I am now in hopeless mode. I feel overqualified for help desk. Certs are self-learning which I have a hard time with. I need an instructor guiding me all of the way from the very start to taking the exam, but I can't afford to buy classes online. 

So now, I am in the mindset where I feel I should've just pursued education or something. I love tech so much. First used tech when I was two. And I am really interested in networking and security, but it seems that won't be possible for me... 

Is there any sort of website where I can, for free, talk with a virtual mentor to help me figure out my future?

Edit: I had two networking classes, but having ADHD unmedicated and a professor who was quiet and hard to understand, I did not get much from them."

This would require me to attend a community college for the 2020 year, take some courses, and then reapply for admission. However, even if everything worked out according to this plan, this would only allow me to graduate in December 2023, which is another 3 years of tuition. Additionally, I have an offer for an swe internship lined up for this summer and am in the interview process for a Big N firm. So I have a few questions regarding this situation. Should I go to community college and then reapply and graduate in December 2023? If this plan isn't favorable for me, can I still get internships and a full time without a completed college degree?

I've got so many issues I don't even know where to begin. A very long story short is that I moved to Japan to live with my husband, I had a career in London for the past 10 years but I gave that up as I couldn't get any sort of job in Japan at all as I became stuck in this catch 22 situation where my Japanese level isn't good enough for IT jobs and any other sort of work, even washing dishes figured that I'd leave as soon as I got an IT job and so I've been pretty much unemployed, not really doing a lot for the past 9-10 months or so. I have an online freelance writing job that I do occasionally whenever they give me any work but it's few and far between, that's it. 

If moving 6000 miles away from my home and trying to learn an entirely new different language and culture wasn't enough, I've just had such bad experiences with companies and recruiters that I've come out a bit scarred from the process, for example, having 5 interviews and 3 tests for one company and then being dropped... this kind of thing happened numerous times, being offered internships for people with 5+ years experience... what is this? I don't really have any money at all, the thought of paying for my own transportation and my lunch and having no time... and no income, essentially paying to work for a *bank* just seems insulting and makes me a bit angry that this company is even doing this to be honest. I've also generally been strung along by what seems like every recruiter in Tokyo and those 'work remotely' companies who keep interviewing you for 3+ months, only to be offered a 1099 contract at really low pay - so low that it's not really worth doing and nope, teaching English companies aren't interested in me either. There's been multiple instances of this kind of thing and more that I've forgotten to even mention, I've just become disheartened, downtrodden and depressed. 

It got so bad that I couldn't even speak to any recruiters at one point, I'd just end up in a mess, heck, I'm a bit of a mess just typing this stuff out now. I decided I wouldn't even apply for anything for a while because I needed to just relax and try not to stress about being unemployed, my career dying and generally being a liability in a foreign country. I would only do one thing, my profile is out there and if someone wanted to contact me and talk about something then... alright, I'd speak to them because I feel it'd be rude not to and I'd be doing myself a deliberate disservice if I didn't at least reply. 

That's kinda how I got myself into this mess, lol, I met a supremely optimistic recruiter (they normally ditch me in 5 seconds when I tell them my Japanese isn't very good and that it's a work in progress - I don't have money to go to actual classes so I study at home, whilst my reading/writing are kinda ok, my speaking sucks as well, I've had no practice and my husband is at work all day) and now I've got an interview with a company and I've no idea what to do. 

TLDR: How can I explain my situation, not self-sabotage? (I do this a lot because... depression) and give a good impression? Also my anxiety isn't specifically related to the interview itself, it's more related to speaking Japanese in the interview... something which I don't do very well."

I have gotten the most traction with recruiters in Denver. I have a brother who lives there and have visited twice. tbh, I love CO. I've never visited Charlotte or Raleigh, but CO is right up my alley with outdoor activities. I was hesitant on moving to Denver, but after visiting again I love the place.

Many recruiters are asking me when I will be moving out to CO. I originally thought it was foolish to move without a job, but I'm learning how much of a disadvantage I am in for living states away. They tell me that If I was local I could find something much faster.

Here is my thought. I have money saved and have thought about renting a place for a month or two (roommates, airbnb, etc). I would fly out there and get my car later (flying makes an escape plan much easier). I would get any job in the meantime while I look for an IT job.

If I really want to move out there I feel like I may need to just do it. Any thoughts on this? crazy? I could get a job at SB through my brother to cover most of my rent.

With the way the entry level IT job market is there, I would think I would land something before to long? I have an BS in IT and a 4 months internship on my resume.  


edit: I could do this in Charlotte or Raleigh too and it could work out better? more options technically, because there are so many cities nearby."

emdiv1,0,2020-01-09,After years of being in school I'm finally graduating in May with a BS in Computer Science and I feel utterly incompetent.,anteedum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/emdiv1/after_years_of_being_in_school_im_finally/,"A bit of backstory, I'm 25 and spent what seems like an eternity at community college. CS wasn't the first choice I fell into it. I initially started college to study music which then promptly changed to Electrical Engineering. Since a lot of the prereqs to transfer overlapped with CS a lot of skills I picked up from those CS classes I found practical and was able to use them (relatively speaking right away). When it came time to apply to transfer and acceptances came in. I got accepted for CS and figured since I was decent at it (better then Electrical I'd imagine) I'd pursue it. 

Don't get me wrong even though CS wasn't my initial choice I do enjoy it. But because it wasn't my initial plan I feel I missed out on a lot of time that I could have spent studying and sharpening my skills in terms of development and technical interview skills. 

Professionally speaking, I've spent roughly 5 years as ""sysadmin"" in quotes because I was doing everything from setting up small servers, fixing computers/printers, etc. for a small firm. I spent 2 summers teaching coding and cs topics to high school-aged children at a tech in which I was promoted lead at one of the company's major campuses'. This past summer I landed a phenomenal and pretty lucrative internship at a big bank. While not as software-intensive as I was hoping (more on the data science side) I learned a lot and was given a return offer that I accepted.  

Present-day: I'm currently a CS senior starting my last semester before I graduate. I've been spending my final year while busy with school work and such but also learning more modern technologies and frameworks such as javascript/flutter, web development, more OOP languages such as java (fundamentally I use Python predominately and know C/C++), etc. 

I'm also going through Princeton's Algorithms 1&amp;2 course to get a better grip and understand data structures and algorithms (when I initially took Data Structures at CC I was still set on EE and thus didn't take it as seriously as I should have). After completing those 2 courses I intend on grinding through leetcode and working on small side projects. 

As far as the offer I accepted, its a 2-year rotational program in which upon conclusion I can choose to stay with the firm and pick a team or part ways. While there I intend to push for more dev heavy roles and projects. I'm also prepping for the GRE to apply to either UT Austin's or GT's online MSCS. 

Frankly, if you asked me where I'd like to be in my career 5 years from now I (like anybody on here I'd imagine) would want to be a Senior (if not near to) Software Engineer at a big tech firm. 

so r/cscq's after a wall text, what guidance do you have for me?"

Recently got my CCENT and aiming to take ICND2 towards end of this month for the CCNA. And ideally Sec+ early this year.

That being said I want to get **SOME** kind actual IT job/intern experience. Apparently from what I keep reading even just a single year of experience or more can make all the difference when applying to places.

**My current situation:**

I applied around and currently have done 3 interviews (its possible I get no jobs offers at the end of all this, but I feel that all the interviews went really well so far.)

**Amazon IT Support Engineer I** : Passed the video interview waiting to hear back in few days about onsite prep interview. Job entails Cisco,Windows and Linux but the job description does not get very specific. The questions I had were pretty straightforward/basic. I was told good experience but likely will be worked to death. Not sure if I  like that as a full time student.

**School District internship (paid) for their 1 to 1 laptop program:** Just did this interview today. They said first 90 days they prep/train and that sometimes it can go into other positions but they do expect interns to view it as experience/stepping stone. Sounds like I won't be touching much of Networking or server side, they have dedicated teams for that I was told which is a bummer. Possible I could do some basic configuring or troubleshooting but that would be it.

I had an interview for another place that I went to, it was contract work where I would basically be the proxy for Microsoft engineers to be told what to do for clients. I essentially don't touch anything just the middle man so to speak. Not sure if was good fit for me or not. Mainly deals with Windows only i.e. AD, Domains, Exchange server, PowerShell. But again I don't personally attempt to fix,configure, etc. what I understand.

Not really sure how to proceed or if anyone has suggestions?"

Now that my rather un-glamorous motivations are out of the way, I guess I should introduce my skills. I acknowledge there isn't a lot. Because most of my free time and ""leadership/club"" experience is through video games, my programming skills and projects are limited to what I've done in class. 

Most of what I have learned is Java, and I actually think I'm pretty good at it. Truthfully, I have experience ***editing*** HTML, CSS and JavaScript from a website template, not writing from scratch. And don't get me started on PHP and SQL. My familiarity with that is basically me having a conversation with a group member responsible for coding that stuff while trying to appreciate ***how*** he does it.

My complete resume can be found here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ORH4ta3txXkjFBmfAzzHN\_2w2N3VqGPT/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ORH4ta3txXkjFBmfAzzHN_2w2N3VqGPT/view?usp=sharing)

So what can a CS major that's only fluent in Java do? It seems to be that with these qualifications, I can probably only get a summer internship, and the problem with that is quite evident: I don't have enough money to make it to summer. I don't seem to qualify as a full/part-time Junior Developer, and most internships only want current students, which I am technically not one since I'm in debt.

What can I do just short of going outside of CS/IT/Business? Do I even have a choice? I don't have time to keep getting ghosted by employers, and getting my foot in the door feels like I'm getting the door slammed on my bare foot."
emgi29,2,2020-01-09,TFSA vs RRSP vs RESP vs unregistered - check my understanding,IndolentStudent,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/emgi29/tfsa_vs_rrsp_vs_resp_vs_unregistered_check_my/,"I think I've gotten an understanding of the differences between the 4 types of accounts (TFSA, RRSP, RESP, and unregistered), but I thought I'd check. I'm primarily still confused about RESP, especially in the case the beneficiary does not go to school.

I'm interested in long-term investment (say 10-15 years), so let's suppose the following setup. Alice invests $10,000 in 100% equities, the money doubles, and then she withdraws. For simplicity, I'll assume her marginal income tax rate is 50% (higher than my real one but makes calculations easy). I don't think Alice's province matters, but assume it's Ontario in case you need a province. Here's my understanding of what happens.

######TFSA

If she puts the $10,000 in TFSA, the gains are tax free, so Alice has $20,000.

######Unregistered

In an unregistered account, Alice pays tax on her gains ($10,000) at half her marginal rate. If she withdraws when her marginal rate is 50%, then she pays $2,500 in taxes, and has $17,500.

Alternatively, if Alice withdraws in early retirement when her marginal rate is 30%, she pays $1,500 in taxes, and has $18,500. This is always worse than TFSA.

######RRSP

For a fair comparison, in order to put the equivalent of $10,000 (post-tax) in RRSP, Alice actually puts $20,000 in RRSP and gets a $10,000 tax refund. By our assumption, her money doubles, so she has $40,000 when she tries to take it out.

If she takes it out before retirement, her marginal rate is 50% and she pays it on the whole amount, so she gets $20,000 (same as TFSA, except unlike TFSA this permanently consumes contribution room).

If she takes it out in early retirement, her marginal rate is (say) 30%, so she has $28,000, which is significantly better than TFSA.

If she takes it out past age 65, then she might suffer GIS or OAS clawback, depending on her post-retirement income level and on the status of GIS and OAS at the time (things can change). This can cause her de facto marginal tax rate to be very high - say, 70% - in which case she she would get as little as $12,000. Or she might avoid the clawbacks and get closer to $28,000. So RRSP in retirement can be way better or way worse than TFSA.

If she withdraws past age 71, she might be forced to convert the RRSP into an RRIF, and not be able to withdraw except in regular amounts.

######RESP

Say Alice puts the $10,000 in an RESP for her child. The government matches 20% (assuming Alice puts it in gradually), so the account has $12,000 to start. By our assumption, the money doubles, and Alice tries to take out $24,000.

Suppose Alice's child goes to college. Then Alice gets back $10,000, and her child withdraws $14,000 at the child's marginal tax rate. If that's 0%, the total withdrawn amount is $24,000. If that's 20%, the total withdrawn amount is $21,200. In both cases, much of the money is in the child's hands instead of Alice's, but if Alice doesn't mind giving money to her child, this beats TFSA.

Suppose Alice's child does not go to college (and Alice has no other dependents to move the RESP to). In that case, Alice gets back her $10,000 and the government confiscates its $2,000 matching. The remaining $12,000 is taxable. Alice has two options: (1) she can withdraw it, paying her marginal tax rate plus 20%; if her marginal rate is 50%, she gets $13,600 total, and if her marginal rate is 30%, she gets $16,000 total, in both cases worse than an unregistered account. (2) Her second option is to convert it to RRSP, effectively wasting $12,000 in contribution room. She still pays her marginal (retirement) tax rate when withdrawing that $12,000 from RRSP. If her rate in retirement is 30%, she gets out $18,400 total (but it gets much worse if she suffers GIS or OAS clawbacks). Note that this is STILL worse than an unregistered account, despite the $12,000 RRSP contribution room that was used up.

Finally, consider the case where Alice puts in $10,000 into RESP but this is not matched (because she already maxed out her matchings). Then this doubles to $20,000, and when she tries to take it out, she gets $10,000 and her child withdraws $10,000 (assuming college). The latter is taxed at the child's marginal rate, say either 0% or 20%, meaning the total withdrawn amount is either $20,000 or $18,000. This is strictly worse than TFSA, and in the case where the child has 20% marginal tax rate (due to some income from internships or even due to other RESP withdrawals), it's not even better than unregistered.

######Conclusion

* TFSA is always better than unregistered (duh).

* RRSP crushes TFSA for early retirement, loses to it when withdrawing before retirement, and is complicated/uncertain when withdrawing after age 65. It can even become worse than unregistered if GIS/OAS clawbacks hit you just right. Or it could be very good; it's complicated.

* RESP is only worth it if (1) all the contributions get the 20% match from the government, and (2) the beneficiary goes to post-secondary education. If either of these fail to happen, RESP typically becomes worse than unregistered; if (2) fails to happen RESP is *significantly* worse than unregistered. But if both happen (and if you don't mind giving money to the beneficiary), RESP beats TFSA, and loses only to early-retirement-RRSP in efficiency.

---

The above is my current understanding. Did I get it right? Is it true that RESP really sucks unless the beneficiary goes to college? Is it true that RRSP used for early retirement is way better than TFSA?"

emgql2,0,2020-01-09,Junior Programmer who loves programming but sucks at it and cant hold down a job.,gilfoyle321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/emgql2/junior_programmer_who_loves_programming_but_sucks/,"Now before I post this, I want yall to know that Im being honest and if you are just to talk down to me, then dont post at all.

I am a Junior Programmer who has had a bit of bad luck entering the world of working.  3 Internships and 3 Full-Time jobs. Every time I get fired just before my probation ends and hardly ever get any real feedback. Because the CEO who is handing me my resignation usually has NO idea at all about programming. Only once I got some technical feedback and that was from this a\*\*hole manager that told me that I lack basic programming skills, concepts etc (He was right). He then advised me to either do a low paying apprenticeship or maybe change careers. 

Because even though I studied CS in College, they didnt prepare me for the real world. I personally keep believing and keep trying and trying till I succeed. However, if you place all these short time periods on your resume it becomes more and more difficult because companies think your a job hopper. I mostly worked in small companies who have no HR or anything. 

Now, since I had some time off. I have studied and invested a lot. Learned what I should have been taught in school i.e. fundamentals of CS, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, OOP etc. Most of my career I have been doing web development with JS &amp; PHP. But now (thanks to my cousin) I work in a large IT Consultant Firm with 250+ members (keep growing) they have a HR department, doing an internship for the 1st 3 months to get settled in and then starting as a staff software engineer. in April.

The companies clients use Java so I have practiced a bit of it, but the problem is that I have been given a ticket by my mentor and have very supportive team but am feeling insecure again. Hence, the title...I love being a Software Engineer, I love programming, learning new things, solving problems and computers. But I just am not good at it (IMO). What can I do?"
emh0cc,2,2020-01-09,Is there something wrong with me?,amibrainsick,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/emh0cc/is_there_something_wrong_with_me/,"Dear Reddit people, I am writing this to you without any shame or concern. I wanted to write before but decided not to do because I was anxious about my English level and hope I can be able to express the things as they really are. 

I am having hard times since the secondary school with my own thoughts and identity. After doing some thinking, my conclusion was that all those depressive vibes were related to moving a lot because of my father's profession. Because I wasn't able to really connect with someone, and my parents were having arguments all the time. My dad used to hit me but it was a thing that most of the people had to deal with when they were growing up in a third world country like that. Some of my friends had been treated even worse. And I am aware that getting hit by your dad is nothing compared to all the brutalism in the world.

During my high school years, I studied for the university entrance exam but didn't have any plans or wishes for the future. I sometimes did, but it didn't last long. Because to me, I was never smart, attractive or social enough. Being 23 y/o and still writing stuff like this supports the 'not being smart' part I guess.

Then I started university, things didn't get any better. In fact, they got even worse. I was procrastinating all the time, and never happy with myself. Always felt never good enough for anything. My first romantic relationship started with the other person saying that he only wanted to get physical and I accepted that to be with him. However, I always expected more and that caused many problems and the result was multiple breakups &amp; getting back togethers.

After a year, he said he was in love with me but even though I said the same, I didn't really believe/trust him. Because in the beginning of the relationship, he used to want to break up due to sexual problems we were having(premature ejaculation, not being able to have vaginal orgasm). Those were serious problems for him when we first started having sex. But I believed that the solution  was taking time and being willing to discover our needs. Because we were each other's first sexual partners. And the funny thing was, I was not aware of myself as a sexual being and never touched myself or felt horny before him. I just didn't have that instinct. That was also what he thought: I was lacking some basic instincts.

With the realization of lacking some basic instincts, I was sure something was really wrong with me. I went to psychiatrist, had 10 mins talk, got prescribed prozac, didn't take it. The doctor said I need to take it to function as before, because I was studying engineering and she thought I was 'smart' and 'functioning' enough as my real self. I don't support that idea, getting above average grades alone is not a sign of intelligence or proper functioning. 

I continued living as before, had many more breakups &amp; getting back togethers with the same person, and graduated. He is now working in the same country and I am doing an internship abroad. I still have the same problems with myself, our sexual problems are kind of solved, but there are some other problems.

I think the biggest struggle I am having now is the basic understanding of things. For example, when the people I am really close to(my partner and my mother) think I did something inconsiderate or hurtful to them, I usually do not agree with them. I either think they are being too sensitive or too demanding. But I always end up being the selfish, careless, and horrible one in their eyes. I have been told those so many times and it came to a point that I can't understand what is the reality anymore. I have never thought of myself as that much of a disgusting person. Maybe that is the problem or there are some problems on their sides as well. I really don't know what to do, what to say, what to think anymore. Thinking on myself doesn't help at all because I think I am so dumb to make the right connections to understand what is really going on in my life. Maybe I should read more or experience more. I really don't value myself or my thoughts and stuck in my own little head. 

I may sound spoiled for making those kind of things as my biggest problems in life. I am sorry if I made any of you irritated with my immature thoughts or broken English skills.

I have loved Computer Science since the 7th grade, and have been programming for some time. Whenever I have free time, I try to learn new software stuff, and it for the most part paid off.  I had a paid internship last summer (freshman year) at a mid-sized tech company in San Francisco, and I learned a lot about how a company works, and I decided that I wanted to be in Industry in the future. I have contributed to a few open source projects, and have done a few projects which have had some impact. I also went to tons of hackathons, and won a few. That was the good part. School for the most part bores the shit out of me. I enjoy some subjects like math and chemistry, but other subjects I couldn't give a shit less about.  My GPA is not the best out there, last year a cumulative of 3.5, and this year around a 3.3 if I don't do well on finals. I have friends who have better GPAs and I keep getting told by parents and other people that those are the people that will be successful in life. I also do relatively well on the SAT, but it is GPA that is concerning me. Does the college I go to in the future matter for my career in the future for computer science?"

I have a year long internship at a largeish regional bank working with Software Dev and Sharepoint Systems currently. I haven‚Äôt decided if I want to try to get into B4 public accounting and do the 2 year route and get my CPA or try to become a financial analyst and go that route. Anyone have any advice on things I could do that would be beneficial to both paths or any advice on what I should be doing instead?"
emjl5i,26,2020-01-09,"I was fired, what do I do now?",Mad_Tub,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/emjl5i/i_was_fired_what_do_i_do_now/,"Sorry, this is going to be a long post because I feel like a failure, I feel lost, and I feel like my reputation is ruined. I was fired from my position as a social media strategist at a small digital marketing agency. I was with the agency for about 16 months, I started in September 2018 as an intern, I graduated in May of 2019 and was brought on part-time in July of 2019. Before they hired me they suggested that I would fill the full-time social media position that had just opened up, however, when I was offered the job they said that I would have to start out part-time and if/when we grew I would be brought on full-time. 

Honestly, I never enjoyed what I was doing there, I hoped that I would be doing more creative work, most of what I was doing was creating and managing Facebook ads. I had planned to immediately start applying for new jobs in October but I got lazy and comfortable and decided to hold off and just focus on saving money. Anyway, I will be the first to admit that my work wasn't up to par, but I also felt lost and overwhelmed most of the time because I was never properly trained. While I was there I did earn my Facebook Blueprint Certification, but I still wasn't sure how to utilize what I learned in a way that would benefit the company. 

My 90-day review wasn't awful, my CMO had mostly positive comments and recommended that I pay closer attention to spelling errors and stop asking so many questions and not be afraid to fail. He said that if I improved in the next 3 months I would be brought on full time. The day after my review the head of my department messaged me privately and told me that the CMO asked her to watch me very closely for even the smallest errors and she offered to help me out a little more, I was grateful. She would review my work but rarely told me if she fixed anything or why she corrected certain errors, but around mid-December, I knew that something was off because she wasn't being helpful at all and seemed annoyed with me. She also brought on a new intern that she knew personally and the new intern was almost immediately offered a full-time position after being there for less than 3 months, this is when I knew things were not looking good for me.  

So Monday (01/06/2020) morning was the intern's first day of paid work and when I entered the office the CMO, HR, and head of my department were in the conference room and I knew it was coming and I was kicking myself for not beating them to the punch by putting in my two weeks. I have never been fired from any job I've had, granted they were only part-time retail positions and unpaid internships, but still, I was a little shocked. The CMO said that everyone in the office loved me, I was a joy to work with and my creative contributions were awesome but I just wasn't showing a complete understanding of Ads manager. He also added that he and the head of my dept. would give me ""glowing recommendations"" for future job apps. He also suggested that I seek out jobs in organic social media or a social position for in-house advertising for a single brand. I am not a fan of organic psoting but I am good at it.

I have a bachelor's degree in Advertising with a minor in interactive media design, I am also thinking about applying to grad school but all courses will be online. My ideal job would be a Brand Strategist or a copywriter, I enjoy doing research and then creating a strategy based on that research. I know that I am not qualified for a position as a brand strategist but I am willing to work my way up to it. I am currently still working as a part-time brand specialist for a popular makeup company, I have been with this company for almost 5 years. I live in a small rural state and there aren't many opportunities in my field, but I would like to live in a larger city anyway so I am willing to relocate. 

Also, I have no hard feelings for my old agency and I understand where they are coming from, but I can't help but feel I have already ruined any chance of finding a job in the advertising industry. 

My questions: What do I tell potential employers when they ask why I left my first digital marketing job? 

Do I have to tell them I was fired and if so how do I word it without sounding like a screwup? 

Do I really take my CMO and head of the dept. on their offer to write me recommendations? 

When I am writing my cover letter for an out-of-state job should I mention that I am willing to relocate? 

In my portfolio can I include the brands that I assisted with even if they weren't my clients?

Thank you in advance for any advice you can offer!"
emjxwn,68,2020-01-09,The dissolution of hobbies as we age,PM_ME_YOUR_TUTURUS,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/emjxwn/the_dissolution_of_hobbies_as_we_age/,"I was having my daily anti-work thoughts the other day when I realized something interesting.

During childhood- if you have a decently well-off and loving family- you are typically thrust into many different extracurricular actives to promote your growth and provide opportunities to explore different hobbies and interests. This could be anything from school sponsored sports, debate teams, science and math clubs, to music and art lessons, community service, youth groups, etc.

As we get older, there are slim pickings for these types of experiences, as they are quickly replaced with 'resume building' activities and the gradual fabrication of a pristine professional persona- rather than continuing to foster a curious, exploitative outlook on life that promotes learning new skills, passions, and information whilst  growing as a person.

I would say around late high school age is when you are expected to be proficient in one single area that will either land you a job or university acceptance. Activities outside of school/your part time job/family obligations become sparse and competitive. Children in sports are expected to be varsity all stars so they can score scholarships. If your debate or science fair club isn't continually successful, most schools will siphon funding until you become 'competitive'. This prepares you for the rat race of fighting for a job offer.

Despite barely being on the cusp of adulthood and still trying to figure out who we are as individuals, what our place is in this world, our perceptions on life, we are expected to be talented at the arbitrary age of 18. Pursuing exploratory hobbies and developing new interests becomes practically nonexistent when you become an adult. Instead, your interests are replaced with building up an 'employable skillset'.

I am barely 20 years old, and I've noticed this phenomenon nearly everywhere I go. Working adults have no time to do things they enjoy due to a grueling 40+ hour work week, on top of commuting and chores. University students like myself are discouraged from studying things outside of our major, or applying to internships, clubs, etc that deviate from their intended career field, as it, ""makes you look scattered on a resume.""

I started learning music when I was 18, and have began to stagnate in my studying of string instruments the past two years because I simply cannot find someone who is willing to teach an adult who is not already a concerto master. Your interests and passions are expected to be solidified by adulthood. No growth for you! Unless it's a career change, of course.

Orchestra and band groups for adults are basically nonexistent. Finding other like minded adult learners is rare, because society seems to discourage picking up new hobbies because it is ""too late"". I was a dancer when I was in middle school, and wanted to pick up the sport again, because I do not like going to gyms and prefer dancing to deadlifting any day, but there are no dance/gymnastics groups or teachers whatsoever for adults. It's like once you turn 18, your access to many hobbies is closed off or limited due to work or societal attitudes that adults shouldn't have interests that aren't profitable for a career. Doing math problems is one of my hobbies, but I've been told many times that learning math on Khan Academy is a waste of my time and I should be doing something more productive.

At my university, we have several speech and debate societies, which are all very competitive. I find speech and debate very fun, engaging, and beneficial towards becoming a more well articulated person. The competitive aspect of the organizations drive me insane. It is all about ""winning a competition so that I can put it on my CV/resume"" rather than competing for fun or to better yourself as a person. However, many seniors lament the day they graduate, because they can no longer participate in clubs like speech and debate once they are out in the working world.

I think this world would be a lot better off if we continued things like music groups, art classes, dance lessons, debate clubs, sports, and so on and so forth into adulthood, without the expectation that you are already an Olympic professional and going into it for the money. I see people getting scorned all the time for having hobbies like TV, video games, social media, etc that make them more reclusive and sedentary. However, there are simply not that many alternatives for enriching activities in adult life, there are few chances to go out and get involved in new things when you mature, either due to absence of opportunities or work schedules.

I think if we stopped putting an emphasis on our jobs as the hallmark of our existence, humans could move towards enjoying hobbies again, having more opportunities to go out, be social, and learn new things as we did in youth. Just my two cents."

emlzr2,1,2020-01-09,Trading Internships,ripgraduation,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/emlzr2/trading_internships/,"So, I've always wanted to do a trading internship at a finance company (interested in both investment banks and funds). However, I don't have the math/computing/physics olympiad experience that a lot of the trading interns at these places have. Would it still be possible to prepare for these kinds of interviews in a reasonable time frame (e.g. 6 months) or would I just be wasting my time?

Regarding background, I'm a CS major at a top-20ish state school that's doing well academically. I've completed one software internship at a midsize Silicon Valley tech company and have two more planned at similar companies for the upcoming summer and fall. For completeness, I'd characterize my LeetCode ability as medium (~50 questions so far).

However, I think I'm a little weak on the math side. I've taken the standard calculus I/II/III, linear algebra, discrete math, probability, algorithms courses along with electives in number theory, mathematical finance (options theory), and cryptography. I'm also scheduled to take more math courses like combinatorics, graph theory, theory of computation, and advanced algorithms this semester, but I don't have exposure to standard math classes like real analysis or abstract algebra. More importantly, I'm not too good at brainteaser probability questions.

For anyone that's familiar with trading internships, do you see a way in for me? If so, how would you recommend going about it (i.e. topics, books, study plans)?

P.S. I'm specifically asking about roles that are tagged quantitative trading intern or similar. I know that I don't have the research background to make the cut for a research role and I've already interviewed with a couple of these places for standard software internships."

After that, there are internships and high paying jobs.- I don't think that I can get in an industry-oriented PhD right now because of the competition.- I have 3 years of industry experience + 3 academic publications.

Personality:- I have an entrepreneurial mindset and I would love to build something of my own later on.- Europe only goals for now.- I love working with people and leading teams BUT I also love research.- I don't mind performing research but I would prefer it to be around the industry.

Sidenote: I see that more and more, there's the notion that a PHD is not worth it anymore for the industry. That trend also worries me because I sense that it's going to be like that.

emp0ib,22,2020-01-10,GIS Career via certificates and little experience possible?,dylan21502,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/emp0ib/gis_career_via_certificates_and_little_experience/,"Greetings,

First post here, folks.. Wish me luck.

**Objective:**

Find an office job working with little GIS experience via certification.

**Background:**

I am 28 years old with an associate‚Äôs degree in forestry. I took one (yes, uno..) GIS course in college. Although I was in a class full of partying baboons (love them guys.. could never keep up with em partying..), I was the go-to-guy for GIS (take it for what it's worth- not much). I also completed a virtual, GIS internship during my enrollment (an enjoyable experience). After graduation, I did another internship which had some focus on GPS/GIS (mostly arboriculture) but not exclusively GIS. I then began logging (not much GIS use... lol).

Full disclosure- I'm anything but a logger (more of the nerd type); I took the job to overcome this. Initially, the plan was to get a ""job"" logging to gain experience and meet Forester contacts to eventually jump on board with a timber consulting business. And that's exactly what I did! Not to go into too much detail but my life kinda hit a rough spot.. My driving license was suspended, (+) got in some trouble for driving on a suspended license....(=) and eventually got ""let go, ""laid off,"" fired, essentially, under the condition that I can return to work once my ""s\*\*\*'s together."" I haven't yet gotten it together and actually went back to logging. Also........ as much as I loved that job, I *can't* go back. I'm tired of driving. I commute (3 hours, one way, daily) *waaay* too much (I'm currently sleeping in my Jeep to save money.. the other night, my window was frozen shut!). Thus, *office* job. I'm now saving money for an apartment I can move in to upon my yet to be received job offer. The plan is to find a place to live within 45 minutes-1 hour biking distance (rain or shine) of thee office to reduce costs of living (I don't want a vehicle).

**Questions:**

\-How do I translate my experience?

\--I don‚Äôt really know which GIS abilities I hold.. nor do I know how to describe them properly on a resume. I will try to describe my skillset below.

\-Certificates?

\--I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôs a plethora of attainable GIS certificates available. I do not, however, have any idea which ones to get! I‚Äôm extremely limited financially so, the seemingly \[very?\] credible ESRI GIS Technician Certificate is still unfeasible. I recently passed two ESRI courses and obtained the certificates ~~shown in the photos of the post~~ here \[EDIT: I tried to post pics in addition to the post but had some..technical difficulties.. I did not send the error report I'll try to add the photos of certificates if possible\]. My plan is to get as many of those as possible to build something of a GIS portfolio. Is this a good idea? Will employers take them into consideration?

\*If this is a good idea, PLEASE give me examples of search words and which filters to use for the following link: [https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/search/](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/search/)

\--Would anyone be willing to list certificates (or types of) that might be desired by potential employers?

\-Jobs

\--What kind of jobs do I qualify for (if any)? I emailed my GIS instructor from school asking about the certificates (didn‚Äôt really get much info) and job qualifications. Her email response:

^(""I think you should just reach out to some place that is hiring and ask about their expectations of someone they would hire because it really varies by agency. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know if I would even be qualified for a job at ESRI, but I could certainly do other GIS jobs.)

^(As far as the online courses, I don‚Äôt even know where to start! They all look good. I would say some of the ‚Äúgetting to know‚Äù or ‚Äúbasics‚Äù courses would be good to take if you have time and want to do something productive.)

^(I think your first step is to ask your target employer what they are looking for and go from there.) **^(I also think that you are qualified right now for some GIS jobs.)**

^(I hope this helps! Keep me updated!"")

\--What can I expect in regards to work duties? GIS is only a minor component of forestry. Therefore, I can‚Äôt really imagine a business that focuses exclusively on GIS. What the heck would I be doing all day?!

\--Ideally‚Ä¶ Dream job: collect GPS data (preferably out in the woods.. or anywhere away from people haha) &gt; transfer data to Arc &gt; analyze data &gt; make a B.A. map &gt; call er a day! Does this job exist? Are you hiring? :)

**GIS Abilities:**

\-create/digitize shapefiles

\-produce professional quality map layouts

\-acquire spatial data (baselayers mostly, tax data, web soil surveys, etc.)

\-queries (not very well I‚Äôll add, I always get errors)

\-unique search processes (by location, centroid, intersecting)

\-join/relate/import/export data (honestly, I forget what exactly a relate is..)

\-buffering

\-clipping

\-collect GPS data, modify it, and import it into Arc.

\-modify the symbology of raster data

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I know the basic operations of ArcMap.. My question is, how do I translate this properly on a resume?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

**Priorities**

""The Black Death. The Bubonic Plague."" The General shot up from his chair at the end of the conference table. Across from him Lieutenant Commander Miller sat in a comfortable chair, with his bionic arm rested, inside up, on the table. On Millers left Lieutenant Colonel Harris sat, her eyes were skimming through whatever documents her bracelet was projecting directly to her retinas and across from Harris sat Agent Smith, with three desk projectors feeding her Intel simultaneously. The General slammed both his fists down on the table. ""You do not ignore me, dammit. I outrank everyone in this room, I am the presidential advisor in tactical matters."" He shouted. Both Miller and Harris shot him a brief glance and then continued with their displays.

""I demand that you focus on the task at hand, we're dealing with the single most dangerous disease mankind has ever endured. And you're just SITTING THERE STARING AT SCREENS!""

""General"" Miller began ""This is USL Tactical Command"" The generals eyes flashed across every face in the room. ""Almost everyone in here is trained in making decisions. Some short term, some long term."" Miller caught the general's eyes with an icy dagger stare.

""You're demanding a fast decision, a quick fix."" Harris interjected. ""This requires a long term solution"" Smith added. ""And long term solutions require informed decisions, we're gathering as much intelligence as possible before we start throwing ideas and tactics on the table""

The silence that followed the trios short, but polite, lecture was short lived when Miller calmly added ""Besides, there are a couple of issues we need to address before we can tackle that particular problem"" Millers integrated access point, intended for Entee to access his arm also gave him a couple of distinct advantages. One of them was access to every interface in the room and he was pleased to see that both of his subordinates had arrived at the same conclusion as him.

When Lieutenant Commander Damien DEAMON Miller was promoted, he was put in charge of USL Tactical Command and entrusted with the safety of humanity. He could no longer directly command his beloved Marines. Instead he commanded every ship, soldier and division that fell under USL jurisdiction. When he received his new post, he was given choice of any ship available to the USL to establish as the Tactical Command Flagship. He had chosen AEGIS. For numerous reasons.

""What 'issues' could possibly take priority over the survival of humanity?"" The General demanded.

""I'm glad you asked"" Miller beamed his friendliest smile across the table. ""The first issue is the function and rank of the presidential military advisor"" Garonov's stare could melt ice. ""You seem to have managed to construct an illusion of power and authority within military ranks"" Miller kept his voice at a pleasant and friendly level.

""I am a general of the UTD and you, Lieutenant Commander, will remember that"" Garonov returned the calm and friendly tone.

""You, Mr. Garonov, are appointed as presidential advisor. Not by the president, but by the elected body of continental representatives. These are civilians and as is the continental congress. You are a civilian, chosen by civilians, to advise the president, who is a military strategist, by function, mind you. Not by experience or training."" Agent Smith managed a calm, but stern tone as she lectured the room.

""Your rank was appointed to you as a part of the US army. Which doesn't exist anymore."" Harris interjected.

Garonov was looking at each of the three in turn. Trying to spot the opening, the weakness.

""Which leads us to the next issue"" Miller said whilst keeping his friendly facade up. ""There are zero instances in the past two hundred years, of a general with zero combat experience."" He continued.

""My records show plenty of engagements, look them up"" Aleksej offered his evidence with a casual hand gesture.

""We have"" Harris said.

""But digital records can be manipulated"" Miller continued.

""So we've been digging up the handwritten reports from the operations."" Smith finished the sentence.

Damien was immensely impressed with the ease that his team worked together, the effortless flow between them and their ability to, not only work as a single unit, despite three very different backgrounds, but also their deep and respectful integrations and acknowledgement of each others opinions, views and strengths.

""It seems that there are some inconsistencies between the digital reports and the originals."" Smith presented pairings between the two types on the room projector.

""This is the Euro-asian conflict operation 'Girdle' where a corporal Aleksej Garonov is supposedly defending a field hospital from hostile ground forces."" Harris highlighted the digital report.

""The original, however, has no mention of a corporal Garonov, instead it names an entire squad of soldiers, identical to the squad in the digital version, except Garonov."" Miller explained.

""That is a single clerical mist-""

""If it were an isolated instance, yes, it could just be a clerical mistake"" Harris cut off the general.

""But the same issue pops up in the Panama insurgence"" Smith continued.

""And in every single one of the engagements on your record. Which leads to either identity theft or outright falsifying documents as being the reason you hold any rank in the first place."" Harris concluded the evidence chain.

""It was a well hidden lie through"" Miller was still smiling. ""You only made one mistake""

Mr. Garonov leaned back in his chair, smiling.

Miller kept his friendly tone of voice as he continued. ""You haven't SEEN combat and it shows.""

""It was believed that if I held rank, you would be more inclined to confide in me"" Garonov offered.

""Yes, well. We don't confide in anyone. We are trained to spot details, especially those which doesn't fit."" Smith was not using a friendly tone anymore.

""Like the DNA screening"" Harris was using a reserved, but stern tone.

Garonov kept smiling. ""My screening was supervised by the presidential medical team.""

""Which, yesterday, turned out to be lead by a Greylock infiltrator"" Smith didn't leave much room for thought as she shot up from her chair. Garonov jumped in his seat, but didn't leave it.

Miller raised his right hand. ""Agent Smith, please take your seat"" as she returned to her seat her eyes never left the advisor.

""With all the inconsistencies we've seen with your record, we decided to look into your screening as well. It turns out that the DNA does indeed belong to Aleksej Garonov."" Harris explained.

""There, you see"" Mr. Garonov seemed exceedingly pleased with that conclusion.

""Who was a three-month old baby, suffering from foetal-alcohol-syndrome and double sided pneumonia, when his mother, who was high on cocaine, funded by prostitution, threw him at at the reception desk at the Aa Maximov hospital in Moscow."" Harris was reigning in her indignation. Damien could see the woman suffer through describing the events.

""Now there is no record of his death."" Smith took over. ""But the candle light wake held by the staff at the neonatal department at the end of shift is documented on the internet. It was an open casket event.""

""So you see."" Miller did not need to use the name of a dead child to get the advisors attention. ""We don't need to cut you to reveal the truth""

The Greylock looked at the three intelligence officers and jumped towards the door, tearing at the handle to force it open, desperately palming the interface to unlock it, all in vain.

It turned around and stared at Miller ""So what now? Are you going to grab me by the throat and toss me out of the airlock?""

""Not at all"" Miller kept the eery, hollowed out, tone of friendship in his voice and beckoned at the empty chair. ""It is not for us to decide your fate. But for now, do your job and keep a critical mindset. The president will decide if you can redeem yourself in the eyes of humanity.""

‚ÄúI see‚Äù the advisor shuffled back to its chair and slumped down on the seat. ‚ÄúIndentured service‚Äù it finished the sentence.

‚ÄúNo, never"" Miller‚Äôs voice had changed. The alien cringed under the unspoken promise of devastating pain. ‚ÄúWe just need you contained in a safe environment until we can properly present the evidence to the president.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere will be no evidence, and no one to present it to. She will be dead by the end of the day‚Äù there was no signs of victory in the Greylock‚Äôs voice. It sat in it‚Äôs seat, staring at a spot on the table, just below it's nose. Miller raised an eyebrow in query, but said nothing.

‚ÄúShe received a ‚Äòuniversal‚Äô antibody injection this morning. It was a clean plague injection. nothing else‚Äù it mumbled.

‚ÄúGood to know‚Äù It spun around on the chair as the new female voice rang through the room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see that you‚Äôre offering this information willingly‚Äù The hologram of the President of the United Territories shimmered into the visible range behind the advisor. ‚ÄúIt, at least, shows that you have some remorse for your actions against humanity.‚Äù

‚ÄúMadam President‚Äù Miller offered with a nod.

‚ÄúCommander‚Äù She returned the nod. ‚ÄúI did, in fact, not receive a shot this morning. The Chief Medical Assistant was ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô, I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù she shot a stern look at agent Smith, who simply returned a warm smile. ‚Äúbumped into by an intern holding a pair of open scissors yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù Miller added. ‚ÄúSo, now we just have to wait for the last bits of information, and then we can deal with the crisis on hand.‚Äù

**Plagued**

Tac-Comm was bustling, at least it was as bustling as a relatively large room could be with only four occupants physically in it and a fifth fading into and out of view as the President's attention was needed elsewhere. There was a polite chime as entry was requested from the corridor. \*Doctor Pierman. MD.\* the system voiced out.

‚ÄúEnter‚Äù Miller wanted nothing more than his old friends to have free access to Tac-Com, but there were a very limited number of people with the clearance for that, and for good reason.

‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù the presidential hologram offered. ‚ÄúPlease skip the official bits and get to your report, we have much to do and not much time to do it‚Äù the leader of humanity finished.

‚ÄúErhm...As you wish...Ma‚Äôam‚Äù Pierman looked, first at Harris, then Miller and Smith and finally at the slumped figure of the General. His eyes returned to Miller, who simply offered a gesture towards the projector interface and a smile. The gesture had included a short series of ANGEL exclusive signals that told RAPHAEL to ignore the ‚Äòtwo‚Äô and address the ‚Äòfive‚Äô. He nodded a thank you to DAEMON and stepped over to the table and slid his datacoin onto the tactile interface of the table.

A series of medical projections sprung to life above the table, including a DNA/RNA sequence and numerous studies.

‚ÄúBy analysing samples, taken by high-altitude probes, we have concluded, with no doubt, that we‚Äôre dealing with the Yersinia Pestis bacteria‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúThis bacteria is the cause of the Plague. which can manifest in three variations: Bubonic, where swelling of lymph nodes occur, Septicemic, where tissue will turn black and die and Pneumonic where coughing and shortness of breath occurs. In addition to these variation specific symptoms general symptoms include: Fever, weakness and headache‚Äù

‚ÄúSo anyone that has a cough is a carrier?‚Äù the hologram looked very worried.

‚Äúerhm...Potentially‚Ä¶‚Äù RAPHAEL was thrown off course by the interruption.

‚ÄúWhat kind of casualties are we looking at?‚Äù the president continued.

‚ÄúWell, historically we‚Äôve had a good sixty percent of the population die over a four year pandemic but-‚Äù

‚ÄúOh god‚Äù the hologram sat down on a chair that wasn‚Äôt projected and buried its face in its hands. ‚Äúthat‚Äôs four point three BILLION people‚Äù The President looked up at the room. ‚ÄúYou‚Äù she pointed at the Greylock and stood up. ‚ÄúYou are going to pay for this‚Äù she looked at RAPHAEL ‚ÄúTell me Doctor‚Äù her voice was Ice cold and brimming with bile-filled hatred. ‚Äúwhat is the most painful way to die?‚Äù

‚ÄúErhm‚Ä¶?‚Äù RAPHAEL looked at DAEMON. Then at the Hologram.

‚ÄúI have taken an oath to do no harm, Madam President. Giving you that information at this time would be harmful‚Äù

The hologram spun to look at Miller. ‚ÄúCommander...Kill it slowly‚Äù the order was given directly from the presidents mouth.

‚ÄúWith all due respect Madam President, I believe we should focus on hearing the Doctor out before we start acting out of frustration. If you still stand by your opinion when we‚Äôre done, I will carry out your order with no hesitation then.‚Äù DAEMON was calm, controlling every urge he had to blindly follow orders. But somewhere in the back of his head Miller was shouting that blindly following was not his job.

‚ÄúVery well, My apologies...Doctor.‚Äù The president sat back down on the invisible chair. ‚ÄúAnd thank you, Commander‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure Madam‚Äù

‚ÄúRight...where was I? Oh, yes. Sixty percent‚Äù RAPHAEL cleared his throat into the inside of his elbow joint. ‚ÄúPardon. This is the high end of the estimate, please keep in mind that the last Plague pandemic was in the fourteenth century, 1347 to be more accurate and we still see active outbreaks in minor areas, up towards six hundred cases every year, world wide.‚Äù

The puzzled looks that grazed both the President and the Advisors faces brought a hard-to-conceal smile to RAPHAEL‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúTreatment is readily available and we also have vaccines. This is not a dead disease and the fact that it‚Äôs a bacteria means antibiotic treatments are effective.‚Äù

He offered a soothing smile to the president, who seemed a lot less desperate.

‚ÄúRegarding the current situation we have taken several factors into consideration.‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúOf the forty-six missiles that were launched only three were shot down early, this has caused them to have a much smaller spread of their payload. The rest reached high altitude before releasing the bacteria. Seventy percent of earth is covered by water, and the vast majority of that is saline. As salt water is not drinkable, it holds no immediate threat of being a cause for contamination. There are zero cases of sea creatures contracting the disease. Due to the randomisation of the spread we can, carefully, estimate that only thirty percent of the bacteria will hit the landmasses and since the bacteria does not have the capability to move on its own accord, the vast majority will simply die on its  own.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur casualty estimate is fifteen deaths out of every ten million cases and the high risk groupings are the very young, the very old and those with autoimmune deficiencies.‚Äù

RAPHAEL finished his presentation and indicated that it was done by snatching the datacoin from the Tac-port.

‚ÄúSo at the most we will be looking at nine point seven five million casualties over a ten year period?‚Äù Harris had run the numbers and was requesting confirmation from the medical expert.

‚ÄúFour years, and no‚Äù RAPHAEL smiled.

‚ÄúThe biggest enemy of any bacterial infection is hygiene‚Ä¶ so if people wash their hands, sneeze into their elbow-pits and cook their food we could be looking at numbers as low as one in one hundred million cases.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe main reason the Plague is as notorious as it is was due to the lack of hygiene and antibiotics.‚Äù The doctor sighed.

‚ÄúToday it is as dangerous as regular pneumonia, and equally treatable‚Äù

The Presidential hologram looked at the Doctor with a facial expression that shifted between elated, concerned, relieved, angry and mildly constipated.

""So...it's...harmless?"" She asked carefully.

""Mostly harmless"" RAPHAEL added.

""So what‚Ä¶?"" The President was clearly thrown by the revelation.

""Don't panic"" the Doctor offered with a large friendly smile.

""Which is the whole idea behind this attack"" Miller added. Every eye in the room snapped to look at him.

""Panic‚Ä¶ It is how this attack is supposed to work. The population is informed that it is the plague and then panic sets in. Fast forward a bit and a Greylock ship appears with a 'cure' in return for vassalisation and the population demands we take the deal."" He explained.

""But how would they know‚Ä¶?"" Harris had understood the tactic. Her question was rhetorical, to clarify for the three uninitiated parties in the room.

""There is evidence of Greylock presence in Earth as far back as three thousand years. They have probably been here much longer than that. Influencing science, societies and religions to guide humanity towards one simple conclusion.""

""What do you mean?"" This time the President was asking, she had shook off the initial shock and composed herself.

""Everything we knew about science and reality told us that faster-than-light travel was impossible. In any way, shape or form."" Miller projected the faces of the multitude of scientists that had studied the possibilities.

""The most predominant religions on the planet are monodeitical. Only one, omnipotent, god. Placed in heaven."" He took a deep breath. ""These religions have replaced the older religions, where the Gods are equal to humanity in certain ways. Supportive of humanity or even protectors of humanity. All of the ancient religions have deities who are either flawed, like humans or have weaknesses, like humans. The monodeitical ones have none of those traits.

These ideas have been planted and enforced in order to shape a mentality that all things powerful and benevolent come from the skies. In Short: God comes from the heavens, flawless and invulnerable. Traveling using magic we could never possess. With salvation to those who would serve him.""

He leaned back in his chair and looked, in turn, at the Doctor, the President and the Greylock.

""So how do we deal with this? What are the advice from USL Tactical Command?"" The President leaned back in her chair. Clearly calmed by the situation and simultaneously disturbed by the fact that her beliefs were the result of manipulations of an alien species.

""You have two main avenues to walk down:"" Harris began. ""First one is the path of Lies. Tell the public that it is a variation of pneumonia, advice them to go to see a Doctor if they show signs of infection and then leave it at that.""

""The second one"" Smith continued ""is to tell the truth. It's the Greylock attack. It's the plague and the best way to let them win is to panic. It is as dangerous as pneumonia, so get your inoculations up to date, use basic hygiene measures and cook your food. Keep calm and 'V' the bastards.""

""Regardless of which one you choose, madam President. There is a Greylock ship inbound to our system. It will arrive in three days and we will need to know what actions you want to take ASAP."" Miller finished off the recommendation.

""Thank you for your advice. I will deal with the matter of public reaction. You tell them 'no thank you' as impolitely as possible.""

""Yes madam President"" Miller snapped a salute.

""Oh and Commander? Before I forget: ship the bastard surface side. To the Antarctic prison. I feel that spending the rest of his life never seeing daylight again is a fitting punishment, for now.""

""Yes ma'am"" Miller smiled at the hologram as it faded from view. Once the connection was broken the Greylock looked up at it's adversary.

""Did you know that the Tower on my homeworld that was to be the monument to celebrated the addition of humanity to the Greylock sphere is built out of ivory‚Ä¶ We literally took as many mammoths off the planet as we could in order to build it, as well as five different species of rhinoceros. Now it will become a derelict building, a memorial of our failure. The extinction of six species from your homeworld, all in vain, because you wouldn't accept the inevitable."" Their eyes locked briefly before Miller burst out laughing.

""Did you really think that was going to Work?"" He managed to ask through the laughter.

""It was worth a shot"" the Greylock replied. As it got up from the chair and extended a hand at Miller ""Please allow me a final handshake with the man who broke a five millennia long plan in less than an afternoon."" Miller shook hands with the alien. ""I know you do not feel this way, it would be treachery if you did, but for me, it has been a pleasure to fight you. You truly are DAEMON: Defender of humanity."" It said as it calmly accepted the restraints offered by the marines waiting outside the door.

Once the door had closed again and the room was down to three occupants, Commander Miller hailed the bridge.

""Simmons"" the captain answered the hail immediately.

""Captain, take us out to the arrival point for the incoming FTL signature. If it is Greylock, eliminate it on arrival.

""Yes Commander, Simmons out""

Smith looked at her commanding officer. ""If it is Greylock?""

""There are Seven Sovereign Species. This was the sixth attack"" he replied calmly.

""Entee, can you get TEA TIME ready? I have somewhere else to be.‚Äù

**First Fleet**

As Commander Miller stepped out of the airlock of TEA TIME, he noticed the two ranks of marines in the landing bay snapping to attention. At the end of the rows stood three uniformed officers. Miller walked down the path between the marines and made sure to notice the insignia of every last one of them. When he reached just past the halfway point he stopped at a marine on his right. Turned to face the marine, who was standing at attention, and snapped a salute. ""Mars Defence"" he offered. ""Thank you for your service""

The marine returned the salute ""Thank you for yours, Commander"" Miller nodded and returned to his walk and inspection of the marines.

At the end of the line the three officers snapped salutes to him, which he returned. The middle officer presented herself. ""I am Admiral Consuela Ni√±es, this ""she gestured to her left ""is Captain Koljek and you should be familiar with Lieutenant Jensen"" she finished with a gesture to the officer on her left.

""Admiral, Captain"" Miller offered a nod to each of the officers ""SKYRIM"" He grasped the Marine's lower right arm in the greeting of the SPAWN. It was just enough outside protocol to attract attention, but not enough to warrant complaints.

""DAEMON"" SKYRIM reciprocated the greeting and every marine in the bay snapped the SPAWN salute.

The admiral raised an eyebrow. ""I really Hope they Will be as ruthlessly efficient as your SPAWN has turned out to be, Commander""

""With SKYRIM in charge i don't see any other option"" he returned the compliment.

""Welcome to the CANBERRA, Commander"" Captain Koljek used a formal tone for the greeting. ""Let me give you the tour before the general brief""

Damien quickly noticed that the Captain was very proud of his crew and his ship. He had something positive to say about every crewmember he had and knew them all by name. He understood enough of the technicalities of the various systems to give him and edge in most situations and held an aura of accept and mutual respect around him.

Damien had intercepted First Fleet on the rendezvous point between Sol and Alpha Centauri. The fleet was waiting in the void, to receive it's final orders.

Commander Miller stepped up on the podium in the landing bay. In front of him was the entire crew of the CANBERRA, save for the ones who were operation critical. His face and speech would be broadcast across the entire fleet. He looked out over the crowd.

""First Fleet was first conceptualized three years ago. In the time that has passed, the ships that make up the shell of the fleet were designed, built, tested and crewed. There was only one final test to conduct: Faster than Light travel. This test was successfully concluded three days ago, when First Fleet reached the rendezvous coordinates without incident.

We, at USL Tactical Command, knew that the ships were capable of FTL. We knew that the mechanical to make it happen worked. We hoped that the crew were right for the job.

You were.

First Fleet is the pride of humanity, it is the shining torch that will guide us into the future. It is a concept that requires a strong back and broad shoulders to carry. The fleet is crewed by volunteers, who did not know what the mission would be, How long it would take, or how many lives it would take to complete it.

You are those.

We were prepared to reduce the original size of the fleet if it would prove to be necessary, if it turned out that there were not enough with the dedication necessary to crew it.

You were enough.

We stand today, at the farthest point away from our home any human has ever been. Tomorrow it will be the first step in a long, and arduous journey.

The mission of First Fleet is two fold:

Firstly: you are to explore space outside the Sovereign Council's influence, any system you find devoid of life, you mark as human territory and deploy an auto miner in addition to surveillance drones. If you find life in a system, it falls into two categories:

Category One: life currently incapable of communicating with us. You will deploy a crewed Defender class to protect the system against hostility.

Category two: life that is capable of communicating with us. You will offer a full membership of the USL. If this is accepted, you Will deploy a Defender class to protect the system. If it is refused, you will offer diplomatic relations and withdraw from the system.

Under no circumstance may First Fleet intervene with the natural technological development of a species. Technology can only be traded at equal levels and First Fleet may only intervene if there is adamant proof of alien interference.

We, as humans, have a responsibility to answer by the morals against which we judge ourselves. So judge yourselves harshly. First Fleet is how the Galaxy will know us.

We hoped that the crew, that would make up the soul of First Fleet would act with the highest integrity.

You will.

Your second objective: If Earth falls, if we are unsuccessful in repelling the Sovereign attacks. You will become the resistance. Liberate vassalized systems and retaliate against those who see themselves as rulers.

First Fleet is our second basket of eggs.

You are our second chance.

I would ask that you go out there and make us proud.

You already have.""

When the applause had died down, Miller headed to the Admirals ready room. The entrance was guarded by two marines, who snapped the SPAWN salute when he approached. ""Gentlemen"" he greeted them. ""I fully appreciate the honour, but i must ask that you strive to serve a different purpose than the SPAWN."" The marines shot each other confused glances. ""The AEGIS marine division exists to protect humanity"" he began ""the First Fleet marine divisions protect existence."" He smiled at the pair and offered a proper salute. ""Do what we can not and do it better than we would have, if we had been given the opportunity"" The marines echoed a ""Yes Sir"" and returned the salute, with just a tinge more pride in their posture than there had been earlier. Miller entered the room.

CE Sabron shot him a glance from the presentation area as he nodded to the gathering of people, mostly officers with a sparse sprinkling of those who have a passing interest in the technical side of things. As he took a seat next to the Admiral, she leaned over and whispered: ""I was hoping she'd join First Fleet. But she refused the offer. Saying something about 'other obligations'. You're a lucky man, Commander."" He smiled. ""That I am.""

""Ok people, eyes front and center please."" Sabron was itching to get the presentation going. Everyone who needed to know the intricate workings of the system were already fully informed. This was for the curious.

‚ÄúAs you are all aware, First Fleet is fitted with the latest version of the Particle Acceleration Field technology. The current version, for those who are curious, is 4.0. The main differences from the initial setup that we used against the Illianum are as follows:

The field functions on a dedicated projector array now, instead of the on-the-fly sensor suite adaptation of the prototype. This allows for a wider frequency spread and a better power-to-efficiency ratio, Essentially it increases the Mass capacity of the field and reduces effect loss when discharging, both for defensive purposes and maneuvering. the operational tolerances are 3% mass for sub-luminal maneuvers and 25% mass for superluminal travel.

In addition the communications suite and sensor array have been upgraded to operate in both real-space and quantum-space spectrums, meaning the field will not disrupt the sensors, regardless of mass or velocity.

The Weaponized discharge of the field, has received an official designation as the HELL-CANNON. This was suggested and, annoyingly i might add, enforced by the HELLSPAWN on the AEGIS.

On that note i must add that the HELL-CANNON has also received an upgrade.‚Äù this caused the room to erupt in murmurs. Admiral Ni√±es turned to the Tac-Comm Commander ‚ÄúWho in the world thought that this weapon needed an improvement?‚Äù she muttered. Commander Miller straightened himself from the lean-in with the admiral and raised his voice just above the level of the murmurs. ‚ÄúChief Engineer Sabron, a question?‚Äù he queried as the room immediately went quiet. She looked straight into his eyes, those bright blue orbs of hers, bore right into his soul, where the furnace that was his feelings towards her was fed the energy of a thousand suns. ‚ÄúYes, Commander‚Äù she replied with professional courtesy.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúDue to the, frankly abhorrent, inefficiency of the energy expenditure when firing the weapon‚Äù her reply earned her some smiles and muffled laughs from the engineering-staff.

‚ÄúThe initial discharge used the entire mass-value of the field, leaving nothing for maneuvering or inertia-isolation. which meant that the AEGIS suffered tremendous impact damage when attacked, not from the weapons but from the transfer and conversion of kinetic and explosive energy from the attacks to the field. With the improvements, we now have control over how much of the mass to discharge, in which direction, and with multiple discharges capable at once. This is a huge improvement, especially when engaged in point blank defence, or something as mundane as maneuvering.‚Äù One of the navigators scoffed in agreement.

‚ÄúTo optimise the energy expenditure, we isolated the electron layer and gave it a direct feed into the ships capacitors. This resulted in immediate replenishment of all power used to operate the field and a fairly large surplus, when needed. It also gave us a mass with an positive ion charge of N lifted to the potency of N. Where N is the mass in protons. Essentially, once this positive hydrogen Ion charge is released from the field, it will violently react with any electrons it encounters until the mass is at neutral charge. This translates into-‚Äù ‚ÄúProton Disruption Bombs...You‚Äôve made a..‚Äù Captain Koljek was the first to grasp the weapon capacity.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Sandrine gave an apologetic shrug. ‚ÄúTo be more specific it is a positive proton charged null-stabilizing singularity discharge.‚Äù The word ‚Äòsingularity‚Äô caused the room to go dead silent. Miller could hear the pulse of the Admiral. ‚ÄúWe call it the VOID-CANNON.‚Äù He offered. ‚ÄúIt's easier to say than ‚ÄòMini-Black-Hole-Pistol‚Äô, but please...use it with care. The Sovereigns don‚Äôt know that we have it, I‚Äôd like to keep it that way...For a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you Commander‚Äù Sandrine held a polite tone, but Damien knew how much she hated being interrupted. ‚ÄúThat specific function of the weapon is isolated and can only be engaged by the Captain of each ship.‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThe final improvement of the field technology is due to the frequency range on the new emitters. They allow us to tune the field to a degree where anything travelling at less than 1.01 luminal is absorbed by the field. Effectively negating the solid wall of light we would encounter when reaching a velocity of 1.0 luminal. Enabling us to reach superluminal velocities but using the field as a form of ‚Äòaerodynamic‚Äô shell but instead of slipping past reality, we absorb it and then eject it behind us in order to further accelerate. Anything outside the field moves at a maximum velocity of 0.99 luminals and the accelerated particles are ejected at 1.01 luminals. The ‚Äòwall of light‚Äô that was our headache when trying to break lightspeed has become the springboard that accelerates us to superluminal velocities. The theoretical upper limit is non-existent. Thank you for your time. Any further questions you may direct to your local Field engineer.‚Äù She took a bow to the enthusiastic applause and managed to ignore the crowd that gathered around the poor sap in the engineering uniform. Her face had an expression that to Damien said ‚ÄòCool women don‚Äôt look back at explosions‚Äô as she walked down to greet the leaders of First Fleet.

Three days later TEA-TIME was making the journey back to Sol, with three very pleased passengers. Damien was busy in the kitchen, preparing a small meal for two, meanwhile in the common area of the private quarters, Sandrine and Entee were playing a game of their own invention: A fusion of Chess, Checkers and three-deck poker. As usual, Sandrine was winning.

‚ÄúOh, come on. How can you be that lucky? The odds of pulling that card right now are-‚Äù ‚ÄúIrrelevant.‚Äù she interrupted her ward. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play on luck‚Äù she continued ‚ÄúI count cards‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù The AI had showed remarkable difficulties with abstract problem solving. ‚ÄúYou have the ability to predict every move for the next one hundred, on both boards.‚Äù She began. ‚ÄúBut you cannot rely on predictions, you need to grasp every aspect of the unknown factors to play the game‚Äù

‚ÄúVictory is the goal‚Äù Entee presented it's argument carefully.

‚ÄúMaybe for you, I play for a stalemate.‚Äù she smiled.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I cannot beat you, but if I can prevent you from winning, neither of us loose.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo by not playing to win, you prevent me from being able to win, and as such neither of us can lose?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly‚Äù

‚ÄúI will have to think about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúDinner is ready, my love‚Äù Damien walked into the common area holding two steaming bowls of instant-noodles.

‚ÄúWow, you really know how to spoil a girl‚Äù Sandrine beamed at him.

‚ÄúI figured that since all we‚Äôve been doing for the last week is eat and sit still, you might enjoy a light meal.‚Äù

‚Äúfollowed by some vigorous exercise‚Äù she added as her dilated pupils filled him in on the few missing bits of info his nostrils hadn‚Äôt picked up.

The two bowls sat on the table, patiently waiting for their content to reach room temperature as the lovers were busy elsewhere. Entee withdrew from the system and resigned itself to the backup array, secretly pleased that it no longer had to change the whereabouts of any of them.

‚ÄúCommander‚Äù the Navigator pinged through the intercom. ‚ÄúWe are arriving at Sol in fifteen minutes. There is a message for you from the AEGIS‚Äù

Damien slowly opened his eyes with a muffled groan. he was lying on the bed, stark naked, with an equally naked engineer sprawled somewhat across, but definitely on top of him. the long blonde hair had, magically, found a way into both his ears, nose and mouth and somehow, they had managed to displace all of their clothing in a neat arch around the bed, just outside arms reach. He prompted the arm-comm and opened the message.

‚ÄúGreetings Commander‚Äù the hologram of Captain Simmons saluted him ‚ÄúThe Greylock ship arrived yesterday. I would report the events to you, but I‚Äôd prefer to just play the recording of the communication.‚Äù another hologram started. ‚ÄúGreetings humanity, We: The Divine Greylock Community, have arrived. We bring to you a cure for the devastating and near-apocalyptic Pandemic that is currently sweeping across your world. The price-‚Äù ‚ÄúAttention Greylock vessel. You have entered USL territory. This system is off limits for all Sovereign Council members. Turn back or be destroyed, you have eight seconds to comply.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we bring the divine cure to the-‚Äù ‚ÄúNo thank you, Goodbye‚Äù

The first hologram faded back into focus ‚ÄúA simple ‚Äòscoop‚Äô maneuver against the outer layer of Neptune‚Äôs atmosphere gave us enough mass to handle them in a single HELL shot. I know you won‚Äôt be here for another three days, but there is a new incoming FTL signature. Identifiers indicate that it is a Primarch Ship.‚Äù

Damien jumped out of the bed, which resulted in a somewhat groggy Sandrine doing an improvised, and fully involuntary cartwheel to the foot-end of the generous sized furniture.

‚ÄúEeep‚Äù

‚ÄúGotta go, love you, kisses.‚Äù he was dressed and out of the quarters before she had regained her bearings.

‚ÄúGood morning Sandrine‚Äù she monologued in an approximation of his musky-sandpaper-on-sexy voice ‚ÄúI‚Äôd hate to miss breakfast, coffee and a quickie, but apparently the world is ending again and I‚Äôm too important to miss out on it.‚Äù She let out a sigh, knowing that the only thing that could drag him from her embrace was work. Specifically: World is ending-related work. And she knew that he was too important to miss out on it. which probably was why the pilot had increased their speed.

‚ÄúPrimarchs‚Ä¶‚Äù she sighed. This was gonna hurt.

emqtva,20,2020-01-10,Do you have time to think?,cancelthat1,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/emqtva/do_you_have_time_to_think/,"Happy Friday!

I just finished my internship at an MBB and thoroughly enjoyed the team, project and company itself. Since my finish, I have been reflecting a bit on my internship and am quite impressed by the manager and partner on my project since they were able to remain calm all the time, showed strong decisiveness and structuring capabilities.

However, the one thing I noticed is that once one becomes a manager, their calendar completely blows up with countless meetings and calls. When do these people have the chance to think about the future of their industry, the project or about their own career development?

I'm sure most just use blockers in their calendars to make sure to have some time in their day to do actual work and thinking, but I believe that it should be a company-wide policy to promote and allow for some thinking time. 

What's your opinion on this? How do you do it or how would you make sure to have enough time for reflection and just good old fashioned thinking?"
emquqn,7,2020-01-10,"Rejection email from dream job - but no opportunity to submit references, cover letter or portfolio...",AncientCityGator,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/emquqn/rejection_email_from_dream_job_but_no_opportunity/,"I applied to a job with a company I am extremely interested in about a month ago. I'm a mechanical engineer who just graduated from college. Everything I see about what the company does I am excited about (videos on their YouTube page, articles about new projects), and it's in an industry I am both passionate and knowledgeable about (I spend lots of time researching it in my spare time). I loosely know a guy who works there and he's told me about how great the culture is and how enjoyable it is to work with the people there. It's also a company that is currently expanding somewhat rapidly. 

I check off every box on the job description, except for the amount of experience. It wanted 3+ years of experience with manufacturing, fabrication, assembly and testing, and internship experience can supplement it. I have almost exactly 2 years of experience with all of the above, coming from a part time job I've had at one of my school's engineering labs for 2 years (16-20 hours per week) and a 12-week summer internship. 

The problem is, there was only an option to submit a resume on the application on the website. Usually I like to submit a cover letter explaining how I am a good fit for it (especially helpful in my case, trying to make up for less experience than they want) and references that they can easily contact. My friend also recommended that I try to include a portfolio of work I've done. However, there wasn't any space for this on the application. About ten hours after I submitted my resume I got an automated rejection email saying my experience didn't line up with what they were looking for but they would keep my resume for the future. 

My question is this, is there any way to salvage this? I found the HR manager on LinkedIn. Is there an appropriate way to contact him and explain this? How could I contact him and send him at the very least a cover letter and references? Is there a better way to go about this?"

I'm from northern africa with bachelor in biology, and currently enroled in a master's program in bio too. Obviously I chose the field because I thought it would be great to follow your passion, until I realised that there is log(1) job prospects. Funny thing is ; I majored in Physics in high school and I was more of a math guy, and  every single professor that I met, even my biology professors were like : "" What the f are you doing in biology ?"" and yea it kinda bothers me that people around me tell me that I should've been somewhere better. But anyway I guess it's fine to regret a decision as long as i'm not sticking to it.

Now, I've been in some career coaching meetings and a lot of coachs told me to switch to CS, which in a way kinda suits me better as a problem solving guy. I have three choices :

 (1) Enroll in a private engineering school : This one is impossible financially. 

(2) Enroll in a webdev bootcamp : Financially challenging but doable, but the probably the only plus side of this  is getting the certificate which gets you past HR in my country (Companies only believe in certificates/degrees here according to a career advisor) 

(3) Self-teach CS: I'm very used to self teaching myself a lot of things that helped me stand out in some situations and which i've been doing for a while but not consistently due to being annoyed (I mean it) by the degree i'm trying to finish.

The problem is that I need free time to do (3) and work on projects, which from a career point of view is going to be a gap in my CV and the only solution seems to be working part-time at some tech support call center (ugh!) and spend the rest self-teaching.

I'm really obssessed with how I'm spending my time since at my age  I should already have had professional experience and I have none, not even internships. 

So far, the only solutions I have is either directly go through a bootcamp (and also self-teach while doing so) after graduating, or work part-time and self-teach part-time, but not sure which one would be the best solution.

Thanks in advance for any advice, I really appreciate it."
emruf0,52,2020-01-10,"Poor physics student, Poland ‚Äì career, future pivoting",A_happy_koala,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/emruf0/poor_physics_student_poland_career_future_pivoting/,"### About me:
Hello!  &amp;nbsp;  
I'm a **21yo applied/technical physics student** in Poland and will get a title of BEng (that's roughly how it translates to American standards) degree next year at top #1 technical university in Poland.

I know you might think: wow, top #1 equals a decent job. However, here schools aren't elite like MIT or whatever. They're just a little better than others. I am from a small village, and a small village in Poland is a dark place. Having lived between nature, animals, poor people, and some of the dumbest people I've seen bullying the weak, I've managed to escape the latter one and get accepted to this place ‚Äì big capital city, which is a decent tech hub. Feeling weird.

### My skills so far:

* Usual Python for DS&amp;ML (spending a lot of free time on it to learn it well right now) 
* Basic but solid object oriented: C++, Java, Python
* Maths, Physics, Statistics
* I can be extremely hardworking when life forces me (which for example is now - better find a job or internship...)

### My portfolio
As for now, my GitHub isn't great but it'll be filled according to what I focus on. What I have currently, aside from hidden personal courses and so on, is:

* (in progress) A small report about a small competitive game community which analyzes six top players. Using pandas, visualization, cleaning very messy data. I'm sure the community will like it so I could even say on the resume that it had impacted the game. 
* (older) small, really minor contributions to a very popular game rewritten in C++
* (older) A C++ simulation of movement of two planets, small circling the bigger one, with okay graphics.
* (hidden) A jumping game in Java GDX, a simulator of particles in a container ‚Äì these are too simple so I don't want to embarrass myself.

### My dream jobs in 30 years

(I know industry will change, but it's what intrigues me now) 

* A ML Engineer / Data Scientist
* Scala (I guess Big Data) Developer
* Any stable SE which is not front-end

### My Questions / Problems
(I'm considering Masters but definitely not PhD, also not planning to move to USA - no chance for me) 

I am aware that due to my choice of physics I'm at a disadvantage compared to CS guys. I know that the area in which I'm not at such a great disadvantage is DS/ML (fortunately I like it) which is why I am polishing my skills in it right now.

My problem is that I also am interested in Scala, I'd love to get a job in the (far) future using it. I have no experience in it, but I know in my heart I'll take it up in the future even as a hobby. However I am aware that data engineering, Spark and so on is way more Software Engineering than DS/ML, which puts me at disadvantage. In summary, I am torn between these two paths. It's a blessing maybe that they are a little connected.

1. Do you think it's a good path to catch whatever job is available in DS/ML and if I don't feel good in it, study hard and try getting into Scala/Big Data?
2. Is there any other decent path you would recommend?
3. Do you think, assuming I'd have a few years experience in some DS/ML jobs, that I would have to prove my Java skills to employers VERY hardly in order to jump into Scala? Will it change in the future? Because many offers are Java/Scala Developer. And I accept Java but don't love it with all my heart. And I'm not skilled in it.
4. Any other general tips, or what am I lacking to get that first job or internship?"

I‚Äôm afraid that if I don‚Äôt land an internship soon, my career is absolutely screwed even with research experience and leadership and a good GPA.

This isn't really a brag post, but a reassuring one that once you get that first job, all the struggle and hard work you put in will pay off. Never stop honing your skills! That means leetcode every once in a while, or wipe the dust off the cover of some books.

Turns out once you have the work experience, things like your GPA or internships or the things you did in college start to matter a lot less. I'm not saying they're unimportant but try to keep that in mind as you're progressing or about to finish your degree.

Most of these positions were applied from Glassdoor or LinkedIn or Angelist but I noticed Google base actually collates the majority of open positions from various sites, so I would recommend starting there for new job searches.

I'm not sure what the specific breakdown was as I was only tracking whether I was currently interviewing or not in my spread sheet, but out of the 7 rejected, only a few of them were after the technicals or onsites, the others were a straight out rejection after the initial application submission. The 4 I rejected were places I interviewed at that I didn't believe would be a good fit for me or didn't think I would enjoy the tech I'd be working on.

With the 3 offers I had, I was able to negotiate what amounts to roughly a 30% increase on my current base salary, and that's not including any benefits either.

Anyways, I hope you find some encouragement. If you have any questions you want to know about my new grad process, and what I've done before graduating and since then, I'd be happy to answer them."

My parents make me want to kill myself every single day and I don't know if I can handle this anymore. 

I was always a skinny kid until I went to middle school. In middle school I struggled with depression and I could only resort to food to stay sane. My parents have been body-shaming me almost every single day since high school. During every meal with them my mom would comment on how my clothes were too tight and that I look like a human pig. My dad just talks about my weight with my mom when I'm not there, then my mom delivers these comments to me. I know I'm fat. I've been trying to change this by changing my diet and working out 5 days a week with a personal trainer. I lost 30 pounds this year, but I gained it all back when I started drinking alcohol almost every day during office dinners(I'm an intern at a company) . I'm from a country famous for its toxic drinking culture so it's hard for me to resist when my bosses give me shots. Also my depression kicked back in December when I got rejected from my first choice college. Parents won't let me seek clinical help again so I'm seeking a therapist on my own. 

Parents think I got rejected because I'm fat. I had a college interview through skype and mom thinks I got rejected after the interviewer saw my fat face and thinks I'm a lazyass student. I have another college interview coming up in 2 days; this time it's an offline interview. Mom starts shouting at me that I'm going to get rejected after they see how fat I am, and I should have been on a diet beforehand. I'm really not in the right headspace to be working out and caring about what I eat. 

My brother is living abroad because of work and he is also on a diet so he talks about how much he weighs everyday with my mom through facetime. My mom then calls me over and tells me his weight and then berates me for weighing more than him.(""How can a girl weigh more than a boy? You're so fat you're embarassing me when I go outside with you"")

My mom keeps on telling me to kill myself if I don't listen to her. Today morning while I was doing my makeup she told me to do something but I couldn't respond because I was too focused on my makeup: She tells me I should go kill myself. My mom is the main reason behind my suicidal thoughts. 

Parents are devout Catholics. I was forced go to church until I ran away from home in middle school. Before that, whenever I told them I wasn't going to go to church my mom would throw objects at my face or throw everything that was on my desk to the ground and breaking them. When I was emotionally abused at church I begged to my parents to not let me go. Parents said ""not until you get your Confirmation"". They purposely talk about their faith in front of me all the time to make me come back to church. They keep telling me that I'm just a lapsed Catholic and one day I'll be back to church. I'm part of the LGBTQ community and Pro-Choice. I'm not stepping foot on a community that doesn't support the communities that I support. 

Just watching my parents' face gives me pain and agony. I wish I made enough money so I can move out of this house but reality sucks. Everytime my mom tells me to go kill myself I actually want to go kill myself now. Ironically when I attempted to suicide a few years ago when my depression was at peak they reprimanded me. I used to break pencils and use them to self-harm in middle school - my mom called me a lunatic psychopath when she saw what I was doing.

TLDR; Short on money each month, can't really scrape stuff off the list to save money. Can't work during the week. Parents (stepdad and mom) are disappointed with my way of handling things. 
Can't find a job that allows me to work Saturday and Sunday on normal shifts without requiring the Thursday evening to work.

Anyhow, where I'm currently at is that I follow a Bachelor of Science in the IT field and I like it and have completed a degree lower than that in the same field.
I currently work as a mail carrier for the local mail delivery company and I like working there, except that the physical and heavy work environment is holding me back from working more (even if I could).

I can't work more, thus earn more, because of my studies and in a 4 weeks my internship.
I'm having problems with paying off my health insurance fees (monthly debit of ‚Ç¨35) and other fees I have to pay are:

- Phone
- Gas
- Bowling
- Insurance when I would die (or whatever it's called)
- Work phone number (second phone number)
-  Health insurance (standard fees of ‚Ç¨127,-)
- Spotify (discounted student premium)
- And any birthdays that come along.

The point is, I'm coming out negative in my end statement every month simply because I'm not making enough money.
The second problem is my parents (mom and stepdad (dad doesn't care and says cannot contribute)) they don't like it how I handle things.
We had a conversation about it tonight and they were kind of disappointed in me for handling the things that I‚Äôm handling them in.

For example:
I work as a mail carrier on Saturday, but I had another job in the same company as a sorter, in June last year I had to quit that job due to contract issues. They wouldn't hire me full time, but they said if I wanted that I could come back in December.

The reason I haven't gone back is that they required everyone had to come in at 6 AM (previously 7 AM) for work.
I'm young (23) and I might act like it's a huge deal and perhaps a stupid reason, but 6 AM is way too early for me whilst also being a mail carrier that has to take extra shifts to even earn the same money as before they changed something there.
When it was 7 AM, I could get up around 5:45 or 6 AM and start making breakfast with a cup of tea and watch some YouTube or TV. If I went and go back and had to start at 6 AM, which would mean that I had to get up at 4:45 or 5 AM whilst being a mail carrier as well, that would just ruin my Saturday evening and sleeping rhythm (which is gone anyways).

*Back to the mainline with work.*

I have no problem with working on Saturday or Sunday, but most stores (which I would also like to do) require that you have the Thursday evening free as well, which I don‚Äôt. 
Thursday evenings are for bowling, which I play team-based and in a club, so that‚Äôs the downfall of that. Bowling is my hobby/sport.
As I said, the weekend is no problem. As stated I now work Saturdays, but work *can* start as early as 11:15 AM but lately it‚Äôs being 11:45 AM and that‚Äôs just when I leave the place where we all start from.
Sundays are for now my days off, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind working an 8 AM ‚Äì 5 PM shift at all on both days to be honest.

*Now my education*

I enjoy what I‚Äôm studying, but sometimes I feel empty and think in a way like ‚ÄúWhy do I even do it, I get courses that I‚Äôm never going to use at all. What‚Äôs the point?‚Äù that sort of stuff.
Sometimes I think of becoming a teacher to high school kids or something and wanting to teach computer stuff and basic knowledge about them, but having to go through another study/degree to become that also puts me off that idea.
I am already seeing a therapist, for a whole other reason than that is stated above but I will discuss it with her as well.
I‚Äôm also genuinely interested in the advice of people who don‚Äôt know me, how I work, act, etc. Kind of a third-person perspective with fresh insights.
Anyway, I feel like I‚Äôm forgetting a part to type out here but for now, I can‚Äôt think of it so this is going to be all.
If you have any advice for me, please, please, type it. I will try my best to follow or use it."
emutf2,1,2020-01-10,Idk how to take this,C4rlosGS1409,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/emutf2/idk_how_to_take_this/,"Hello Guys,

To make the situation clear, here is some context.

Since last year, in June I started working on a Spanish company as a SysAdmin and studying (In order to get my sysadmin). And since the beginning, I wasn't a threat as a sysadmin or at least this is what I think.

Yes, of course, I have full access to everything that my current two bosses have. But I am not helping on projects like there are deploying new things to the cloud and making good stuff with k8s and I am just doing some help desking helping the User Call Center in order to tell them if a ticket is for us (well me) or any other dep like development.

Another point is the fact that I have two bosses, one is the main dba and he takes charge of all the big things, and the other one nevertheless he is doing some project work, he is more an administrative guy. So the relation is quite confusing with them as with the dba one I have a very good relation he even ask me for help choosing new firewalls (he might don't care my opinion but at least I was there) and he even say me that when the new ones (firewalls) comes we can add them together (as we are going to switch our internal hardware). 

And with the admin guy well, I don't know he gives me work and I am learning that's okay, but the main decision to take me out of the department and take a new seat next to the UCC was from him... so I don't know what to thing.

---

I might be complaining too much for being a junior, but things are clear for me:  

* I am not one that can be in a user call center all day, I like to make new things and do project work.

* I would like to become a DevOps, I even started (here is my repo on [git](https://github.com/CarlosGorrochategui/Road-to-DevOps)).

This internship ends on the 9th of June, and I have been looking for something on a Linux side as I am preparing for the LPIC-1...

As said, it isn't a big complain, just keep my mouth closed and keep working, but there are some days that I don't really know if I am really considered a SysAdmin or just a random guy that knows some IT things...

Have a good day!"

emwa02,1,2020-01-10,Wondering if I made the right decision,Darr23,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/emwa02/wondering_if_i_made_the_right_decision/,"So I did an internship in engineering last summer (2019) and that company (we‚Äôll call them Z) offered me a full-time position right after which I accepted. The location of the job is far via car and there‚Äôs no train stop that drops me off close enough. so going there would cost so much money and time or i‚Äôd need to move closer there but housing in that suburb is pricey. The internship was tough because of the commute but luckily I was with my boyfriend at the time and he lived much closer (still an hour drive) so I stayed at his place but that‚Äôs no longer an option. So while finishing the fall semester at school I‚Äôd been searching for other jobs and a consulting position came through (we‚Äôll call them C) which I accepted. C is right downtown in the city that I live, pays more, and has more people my age. It‚Äôs a very different position to the job at Z which is in manufacturing engineering. While waiting for C to give me an official start date (they take so long) I turned down the job at Z less than a week before I would start because I wasn‚Äôt sure when to tell them that I was rejecting the offer and also, C had told me that I‚Äôd be starting in late January or early Feb but I‚Äôve now come to find out that it‚Äôll be early March (even though I pleaded to start earlier). I didn‚Äôt tell C during the offer letter process that I had another job (Z) starting Jan 6 and I‚Äôm wondering if I should have and/or if that would have made C speed up the start date.
I graduated in December and would really like to start working asap to start saving and paying off loans. Should I have sucked it up and worked for a couple months at Z or is it better that I rejected the opportunity before starting and quitting in less than 6 months?"
emwh2f,3,2020-01-10,Reality Check on Grad admissions chances,7Buns,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/emwh2f/reality_check_on_grad_admissions_chances/,"Hey all,

I graduate in Fall 2020 so while I don‚Äôt have to worry about graduate applications right away I do have some concerns. Mainly my low GPA especially since I am coming from a STEM field. I just need some brutal honesty how likely it is I can get into a graduate school at top schools. 


* I am a Computer Science Major. My research interest for grad school is primarily EdTech. However all my undergrad research is in Artificial Intelligence or Bioinformatics. 

* My GPA will end up in the 2.9 - 3.1 range when I graduate (cumulative). My Major GPA will be 3.2 or higher. 

* I have 2 papers being reviewed right now. Ideally I‚Äôll have 2-5 papers out before I graduate. I‚Äôm actively working on 3 research projects currently. 

* I am confident I can get a 3 or more letters of recommendation. 

* For work experience I will graduate with 5 internships. 3 of those are AI related. One of them at a large well known company. 

* My writing is weak but I believe I can improve that. 

* I have A‚Äôs &amp; B‚Äôs in all but 2 of my CS classes. I imagine I can keep that up. 

* I have already started studying for the GRE. I am aiming to earn stellar scores on it. 

My low GPA comes from me not caring much when I first started Community College. I had to work near full time to pay for my classes and I got C‚Äôs in majority of my classes. When I transferred to my university my outlook on school drastically shifted and all my work experience / research has happened in the past 2 years. 

I feel as if everything but my GPA is fairly strong, but I know next to nothing about the graduate admission process. I worry my low GPA will severely hurt my chances. 

I appreciate any advice or insight


Thanks,

An anxious CS undergrad."

Seems like I've sent 300+ applications with not even an interview, maybe it hasn't been long enough to hear back?

What would these employers be looking for? Should I learn whatever language the position requires and throw it on my resume? I got a call once saying they were looking for people who know .net and denied me, or some other language. I've always thought once you know how to program learning a new language wouldn't be too hard, but it seems to be a filter anyway. It doesn't seem realistic to make a project for every single language hoping you get more responses. Should I just apply to jobs with languages I know?

I have research and projects on my resume.. should I double down on projects?

It also seems like a lot of positions want internships.. and I apply to internships but they want experience or people already in college(I graduate in February though.) I'm really find working hard at any position I can get, I just can't get that position.

What should I work on? Maybe a github full of projects? A webpage? Is my degree even worth anything?

It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty good fit for the industry needs at the time.

It will be a long read I guess.

Here is my background:

 I am a full-time employee in a production company and also doing some freelance editing/vfx/director jobs. Furthermore, I studied film and made my MA in filmmaking. I have a very good portfolio in film. However, I got really bored of working until late hours, almost no holiday, working without any day off for straight 3 weeks and 16 hours of film sets nearly each week. I have minimal social life due to work and paid is really bad if you compare it to how hard the work conditions are. So right now I have a feeling that, I work for people that just cares about money and I feel like I only work for, to get my bills and rent to be paid. Because of these main reasons(also there are tons of other reasons) I got overwhelmed in the film industry and now I want to change my career to a field that has bright future. I read about the guy who changed his career while working in a film industry to programming in reddit and It's really motivating for me.

I was always afraid of programming in general since I have no good background in math and at the first glance it seemed  to me very complicated and complex. My software developer friend motivated me enough to start to learn a programming. I started with Python, bought some Udemy courses but those were not enough for me since they were skipping some of the crucial parts of logic of programming, then I jumped to a book which was really helpful.When I start to learn and understand to logic, i really started to enjoy it. It was the first time I was really enjoying something after so many years and feeling accomplished even I solved a very simple problem. I am learning coding, when I have a free time from work so compared to other new learners I am not progressing fast enough. It's really hard to maintain learning process everyday while working film industry but still I am motivated enough to do it and as I said it's very rewarding and it pushes me more. Now I am looking for different sources to learn, I read a lot and working my own simple projects. I think it's the best way to learn programming by doing projects. So it's been 2.5 months since I have started to learn and finished 6 simple projects.

Today I finished my first proper program in Python which is a Telegram Bot that answers like my friend in random intervals from a random quote list and it pulls some random lines from his tweets as well, if someone write desired words it pulls it and replies with that. Anyway I finished my project and deployed the bot to our telegram group, feedback was superb. Funny thing is, I shot more than 30+ films(some of them had a selection of film festivals) and never felt so accomplished after finishing this simple project.

I had a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS before, I am learning JS right now, soon I am planning to learn node and react. Meanwhile when I am free I am reading about algorithms and data structures. I am looking at other people's code as well but I feel bit discouraged while looking at experienced programmers codes since I may not have those kind of thinking skills, there was a post about this one as well, I feel the same. Yet, it's teaching.

Now my question is : My friend's old boss who has a software development company, is very interested in me, I can start to work as an intern in his company with almost no pay for 3-4 months until I get in a level of a jr.software developer . I will learn much more faster and more reliable since working environment consists full of developers. Also I will have more time to learn it by myself. My future plan is to be a full stack developer If I can. On the other hand, I have to pay my bills and my rent, I can ask to my family to support me for 3-4 months but there is no guarantee that I will start as a full time employee in his company. Also I am 28 years old and I heard that many software companies do not recruit 24+.I know it's up to me but still it is a gamble. I can wait for one year to get to at least adequate level for a jr job in programming but It will be a slow process and due to my work it's really tough and it gets harder each day to spare a time for programming because of the shootings and work schedules and often when I get back to home, I don't have the energy to do anything, yet I am trying to learn and push myself more.

&amp;#x200B;

I need an advise from experienced programmers or people who had similar story. I am in a big dilemma and I don't know what should I do right now."

During my first year, I was a biology major. I switched to study computer science during my second year. Since I only completed intro courses at the time, I did not apply for any internships for Summer 2019. After some advanced coursework, I was able to apply to internships for Summer 2020. I recently accepted a summer internship at Motorola Solutions (description [here](https://motorolasolutions.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Careers/job/Software-Engineer--2020-Internship-_R2763)). This summer will be my only summer for internships, since I still plan on graduating within the four-year plan. I feel like I'm at a disadvantage in opportunities since I technically only have 3 years to build myself as a CS major. I want to make the most of out the only internship I'll probably get, so please let me know any tips! Or even any tips for the remaining year and a half!"
en0ycc,2,2020-01-10,What is your guys opinion on WGU or community college for people who want to break into IT but have a degree that is nowhere near related to this field?,j450n_1994,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/en0ycc/what_is_your_guys_opinion_on_wgu_or_community/,"Been interested in this and am working a job that is IT but not strictly help desk.  

My friend has told me that employers are now more stringent on people having specific degrees now more than ever and that help desk jobs require that and two years experience.  I‚Äôm not sure how much stock to put in this but he has had his struggles with the degree.

He has no internships, but does have customer service experience and the comptia trifecta, yet he still rarely gets interviews even from temp agencies regarding this field.  

My immediate thought process was his area or his resume is horrible or one of the two.

My reason for asking for this is I have an unrelated bachelors.  I don‚Äôt want any potential future employer to use that against me in an interview.  I want to have all the reasons I can control that I might not get hired under control."

But after some thought now I want to change it before then and major and try some else besides psychology. 

I‚Äôve was targeting into what our university has Business (BA,BS) and Hospitality, Tourism and EVENT management(BS) and I want to stick with a BA so I‚Äôm well rounded academically. 

Today I put so much thought into it and when talking to my mother she was kind of giving a discouraged face since she informed me that one of our cousins was in that Hospitality field ( graduated from same college ) doing an intern at Disney just working in a restaurant. 

It discouraged me about the opportunities so I‚Äôm looking into maybe to go back undecided or choose a major I‚Äôll be interested in maybe. My math is not up and I‚Äôm probably below average with understanding it so I‚Äôm worried about it but I know I will be taught and just need to learn myself and study to understand. 

I was interested in criminal justice and  my first choice was computer science (so much math I didn‚Äôt want risk failing classes). 

I was looking into nursing at the start but I don‚Äôt have good scores to take the test and pass it so it shot me down. 

I might be interested doing Business or I may look into Economics (BA). I may just go undecided.

Any advice about these fields?"

I'm currently taking my masters degree in clinical psychology and I'm doing an internship in one of the most popular psychiatric hospitals in my country. Because I love working with children, I applied to the pedopsychiatric ward. 

When I first started my internship, the director of the hospital showed me where I would be working, and where the kids stay while they are hospitalized. The psychology offices weren't like the ones I was used to. They were very small and had this huge metal doors with a tiny window on top. It looked like a prison cell.

When I got to the hospitalization place... That office seemed like a piece of cake. I mean, don't get me wrong, they are not in bad conditions or anything like that, but the vibe there is just.... Off. They sleep in this small bedrooms and they usually share them with one or two kids. 

When I entered the living room the kids that were hospitalized were doing an activity with one of the nurses, but once I got in they all stopped and stared at me. That's when I understood what I would be dealing with. There were 3 girls (around 13 years old) with anorexia and they were so thin that I felt sick just by looking at them. I could literally wrap my hand around her legs.

One of the boys had his wrists all cut.
Two boys were psychotic and they were just in their own world, looking terrified at the sketches that the kids were making. Suddenly, one of them got up and turned up the TV volume. That's when the director told me - ""he's hearing voices again. That's what he does when he hears them. It's his way of shutting them up."" I remember getting chills down my spine.

There was this other girl, let's call her Alexia for the sake of it. She was separated from the group and seemed pretty normal, so I asked the director what was wrong with her.

""Mental and sexual abuse"" - he said. ""It has been incredibly hard talking to her. Every time we try to speak to her, she gets into this horrible mutism. Sometimes she's in pain and doesn't even tell us. Last night she had a horrible stomach ache, and wouldn't stop crying, but never said a word to the nurses. It was a nightmare trying to figure out what was wrong with her."" 

I looked at her for a while. She was reading a book and giggling a bit, from time to time. 
""That's another thing we don't understand. This laughs and giggles out of nowhere. We're starting to suspect she was some type of psychotic disorder."" - the director added.
I felt so sad for her. For all of those kids. It wasn't their fault. Almost all of them had a terrible childhood, filled with neglect and abuse.

We continued our tour and that's when I saw a dark empty  room, with nothing besides a mattress on the floor. And did I forget to mention the door? It was exactly the same as the ones in the offices. But this one had lots and lots of locks.

""This is the seclusion. Sometimes... This kids are harmful. Not only to other people, but to themselves, as well. They're medicated but things can get out of hand and they lose control. This is our last resort, but it's needed, from time to time."" - the director told me, with a sad look in his eyes.

I took a quick glimpse at the room one last time. It was so dark... So lonely. I started feeling overwhelmed with sadness. How could anyone be locked in here? I tried to ignore my thoughts and proceed the tour.

The rest of the rooms were pretty normal. They have a kitchen, some bathrooms and a beautiful garden (although it's fenced all the way up, it was big and had a lot of flowers).

The first week of my internship was pretty normal to be honest. That was, until one Thursday night, around 9 p.m., when I started hearing a lot of thumps. 

I was in my office with my internship advisor (let's call her Diana), and I didn't make a deal out of it because I thought that someone was doing some type of construction in the building. 

After a long time of hearing those thumps, Diana put her hands on her head, toke a deap breath and said ""There's a kid in the seclusion..."". 

That's when my heart dropped. Those thumps... They came from a desperate teenager that was being locked up in that terrible room. They weren't frenetic like the ones you would do with your hands. They were loud and just one at a time.

""He's probably banging his head against the door. I don't know which kid is in there, but he's probably having a psychotic crisis"" - Diana said. 
They lasted for about an hour. And I can guarantee you, I couldn't concentrate on anything else. It was like torture to me. 

When I got home I told my parents about that incident and they were shocked as well. I barely ate and I couldn't sleep that night.

The next day I was assigned to talk to some of the kids that were staying there, in order to get to know them better and facilitate the therapeutic process. I spoke to the 3 anorexic girls : Julia, Martha and Lydia. They were really sweet but couldn't seem to understand why they were there.

Louis was the one with his wrists cut. He was so kind and thoughtful and talked to me about the things that happened to him. He had a horrible childhood, with a drug addicted mom, that failed to take care of him, but wouldn't let him be taken away from her. She would manipulate him to skip school, to run from foster care, and one day he was just tired of everything she put him through, so he tried to end his life. We talked for a while about his goals, what he's passionate about, and he seemed a little bit happier than he was before. 

Mich was one of the psychotic boys (not the one that turned on the TV), but I wasn't able to have a conversation with him. He just looked at me with every question I made and said something random, that had nothing to do with what I was saying. Nonetheless, I painted for a while with him and he seemed to enjoy it, as he started asking me to paint ""more trees"" and would smile when I painted them. ""Trees are safe."" - he said. So I smiled a painted a whole bunch of them. He kept my drawing.

Kevin was the other boy... He was rumbling through the corridors while a nurse was calling him and asking him what was wrong. ""The voices. Make them stop. MAKE THEM STOP"" - he yelled. I was kinda scared to approach him, but I did nonetheless. This kids are sedated with Valium so I should be safe.

""Kevin, if you try to explain to me this voices I might help you."" - I said. Kevin looked at me in disbelief - ""No you can't. Because you don't want to hear them. None of you.""
I was so confused. What was he talking about?

After thinking for a while about what to say, I told him that I wanted to hear them so I could help him. And that was my biggest mistake.

""You don't want to hear them."" - Kevin said, laughing with tears streaming down his eyes - ""But since you asked, and you're the therapist, I'll show you."" 
We went to the painting room, so we could talk in a more secluded place.

""You know why I ended up in this place? Suicide attempt. That's a story for another time. But I never heard voices of any kind. I started hearing them HERE. And I should've kept quiet. But they were just... Awful. It all started when I spent my first night in seclusion. I had sharpened one of my toothbrushes and tried to cut myself.... Anyway."" - he shook his head, trying to get something out of his mind - 

""The entire night I spent there, I heard this scratches on the walls, like there was someone with long, sharp nails just doing it over and over again. As the night went by, the scratches got closer and closer to my bed. That's when I first heard that evil laugh. Like a mean little girl. The meanest child in this world. I was so scared that I put the blankets over my head and tried to get some sleep. When I was almost falling asleep, someone... Or something whispered ""why don't you play with me? It's so much fun"".

Kevin stopped talking. His eyes started to scan the room like he was looking for something. ""I gotta go."" - He said, as he run out of the room.
I tried going after him but when I got to the living room he was putting the TV volume on blast and bouncing back and forth on the ground.
I didn't know what to do. I was so confused by everything that happened. 

The nurse that was calling him before, looked at me and said ""oh sweetie, this kid is complicated. Don't push him too far or we'll shut you down completely. When he's acting like this, just let him be.""

Despite feeling sad and guilty about his sudden breakdown, I told myself that I would do anything I could to help him. This boy was in so much pain. Not a physical one, but an extreme emotional pain. It was almost time for me to leave, so I went on with what I was told to do. 

I tried to find Alexia but she was nowhere to be found, so I just went to their bedrooms. And there she was, sitting on a bed, reading a book and giggling as she flipped through the pages. ""Hey is it okay if I come in and talk with you for a while?"" - I asked, peeking my head through the door. She nooded, so I sat down beside her.

""So, do you want to tell me what's so funny about that book of yours?"" - I smiled and she just laughed, shaking her head repeatedly. ""Oh you won't tell me? so there's a secret in that book... Can I read it?"" - she handed the book to me and there was nothing out of the ordinary about it. Just a children's book. 

Alexia is 8 years old, so she's the youngest in the group. After I browsed all the pages, I closed the book and pretended to look sad."" Well, looks like I'm not lucky enough to know what secret lies behind the book. Maybe if we hang out a bit more from now on, you'll trust me enough to tell me! Pinky promise I won't tell anyone""

She stopped for a while, thinking about something. Then, she pulled my shirt in order for me to get closer. 
""It's not the book that is funny"" - she whispered to my ear.

 I had so many feelings. She was talking to me! And all I did was sit beside her and chat for a while. I couldn't believe it. Anyway, as I wanted to keep the conversation going, I looked at her as if she told me the biggest secret in the entire world. ""Oh really? Then what is? Can you tell me?""

She got up, took my hand and started leading me somewhere. After a while she stopped, in the middle of a corridor, smiling at me. I was even more confused than I was before. ""Hmm so we're in a corridor"" - she laughed as I said that. ""What's so funny about this?""

As I was looking around, she lifted her little arm and pointed to the only place I wish she didn't - the seclusion. I looked at it in shock. The darkness of that room seemed to consume it. Before I could ask anything else, Alexia just ran back to her room jumping and laughing as she dissappeared."

I solved the problem in O(n) fairly quickly but struggled on producing an O(log n) solution and proving it. A solution, which my interviewer showed me at the end, using recursion was MUCH cleaner but was less space-efficient than mine. We also went over the time limit by 15 min and I could tell my interviewer was interested in seeing me complete the problem. However, they seemed a bit grumpy throughout. Does any of this matter?

INTERNSHIP is ""IT ""...also not very helpful since it can refer to anything in IT

I'm interested in security...but this part-time gig is very..broad cuz its IT and IT is itself very broad (again, what I said earlier)

my analysis:  

part-time --&gt; good...its stable??

internship --&gt; looks good for resumes?????, it's temporary for the summer?

IT Security internships are a bit more difficult to get...CUZ EVERYONE WANTS TO DO CyBer sEcUriTy !!!

 is an IT Auditing internship worth it? ...it is a dOmAIn oF CyBer sEcUriTy after all."

I'm in a research lab at a top CS university, and while I recognize how fortunate I am to be in my position, I can't shake off the constant urge to quit. I've been working with my grad student on this project for several months, and to be frank it's such a drag. I joined because I wanted to gain research experience, but most days, my work feels so dry and boring. Maybe my lack of interest is an indicator that I need to read more papers, idk? The thing is, I don't particularly love reading papers in this field. Also, I'm aware that debugging is a big part of CS research, but as of late, all I've been doing is debugging, and I'm frustrated because I don't think I've made good progress. BTW, my grad student is a fantastic mentor, and all the profs and PhDs at this lab want to get undergrads as involved as possible. So as you can tell, the guilt of leaving a great opportunity has kept me from quitting.

Early on, I thought about working in academia, but the past year (as well as a couple Bs and B+s) has killed my PhD pipe dreams. Metaphors aside, I'm fairly certain that I'll work in industry after graduation. Although this sounds really self-degrading, I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a mediocre student. This motivates my decision because I see software engineering as a field where it's not hard for average students to land good jobs. Also, I simply don't think I have the brains, curiosity, and drive to do CS research for life. This makes me wonder: if I'm not planning to get a masters or PhD anytime soon, is there even a point in doing research?

I'm well-aware that I may be overthinking this, that it may not be a big deal after all. But my time is running out, and I absolutely need to get a software internship before looking for full time positions. Since I don't have any internship experience, it seems like the best course of action is to go HAM on recruiting: Leetcode and Hackerrank, personal projects, etc. And by that logic, I should probably quit my research position, but I would love to hear a second opinion.

tl;dr: doubtful undergrad unsure whether to quit research or not"

I was graduated in 2018. Last year i went to another city and worked as an IT Trainee for 4 months but have to resign due to my health condition. After that i went back to my hometown in which an IT company is almost non-existent and due to my health condition and current financial problem of my family i can't go to another city.

There's one small startup on my hometown in which i worked as an intern for 1 month, but i didn't continue it because the payment was way below the average salary rate on my hometown while my job was to make a fully working iOS application from zero by myself (it's around 0.076 USD/hour). I'm sorry if i was too picky here, but i feel like it's kinda not balance.

Due to this i'm thinking to try a remote work, but since i'm not confident with my skills and experiences i think to build my portfolios by doing a remote internship. Is this a good idea, or are there any other suggestions as to what i should try? Thank you for reading this, i'm sorry if there are some grammar mistakes or confusing words in my post. Any thoughts and suggestions will be very appreciated.

EDIT: another question, are there any remote coding bootcamp in which if we graduate with good marks then there's a possibility that we'll be hired as a remote programmer on a company? Thank you."

This year when I got back to campus, I changed schedule. Now I'm up at 4am, I do a question or 2 on codewars, then shower, breakfast, and then either go to class or work on a personal project. 

What I realised was, I'm actually happier now. I am talking a lot more to my friends, drinking less and I even sent out a internship application earlier this week. 

What I think I'm saying is, much as we're told and educated about the signs, sometimes, they're so subtle you never realise till you are out of it, or if someone tells you. So always try to keep a journal, tacky  and played out as it sounds, it's what helped me come to the realisation I was legit out of it."

The issue is, the only professor teaching it is mostly deaf, yells at students for asking questions during lecture, and is generally a really bad professor. 

If I wait a semester and take it next fall,  there's a chance (no guarantee) that I'll get a better prof, but that also means waiting a semester, and I'd be taking algo as I'm interviewing for internships when I really prefer to be done with the material before interviews (I already have an internship lined up for this summer so that's not an issue)

I'm getting mixed reviews from people at my school, some are telling me to wait, some are telling me to just go ahead and take it because since the professor can't teach, the curves are really nice.

Is it worth waiting a semester to take algo or should I just take it since I'm already registered, even if the professor is really bad?"

The most important examination of my life, STEP 1, is coming, less than 4 months away. I will have only one chance to take it. TLDR: STEP 1 is the test of ALL your medical knowledge, lasts an entire day, and if failed once will put a permanent red mark on your CV. This single 3 digit score can determine if I get the internship in the field of my dreams in 2 years, or be forced to settle, or worse: not get matched to a residency at all and be left with 200 grand of debt with only myself to blame (upon which I might as well kill myself). Thanks to lovely ADHD, I spent every waking (and actual productive) moment trying to keep up with med classes these last 1.5 years (only to end up in the lower fourth of students and have to re mediate quite a few of my exams). So I have no volunteering, no major research papers, no officer positions, no friends, no networking connections to show. This score is my only chance to prove myself, to set myself apart. I meant to start studying for it a year out. then 8 months out, then 6.

I don't see how I can accomplish this but I need to make each day count so I have a chance. I should see each minute is precious. 

So why the fuck can't I turn off my ps4, put away the distractions, turn off the old shows I keep on for company, and actually study? I am lying to my loved ones about how much I'm studying when they check because this is my first week ""prepping"" and I've gotten barely anything done. I don't want to talk to anyone, I am a big phony. Instead I've put hours upon hours on my video games while screaming at myself in my head the whole time. I am behind on lectures. Why can't I just fucking start. If I'm simply scared of failing and its paralyzing me, why do I let the time tick by knowing full well it will just get worse and worse?  I have my medications finally sorted out after a year of trial and error,  and they are some of the best available, yet they just seem to help me focus on my distractions more on my classwork. I have no obligations or responsibilities. I am properly medicated (despite forgetting my depression meds, the ADHD ones Ive been diligently taking). I am alone and free to focus. So essentially, all is aligned, so the only problem has to be me? So why the fuck cant I take my head out of my ass and just DO IT? I know my life will be a disaster if I don't. I thought it was just a day of slacking after finally getting to be alone. But that was 5 useless days ago. I don't understand. I know it has to be my laziness and avoidance because my ADHD should be under control now right? So I hate myself even more. Tell me I need to grow up. Tell me I am being an idiot and throwing away my life for momentary gratification that I don't fight with any self will despite totally being able to. Maybe thats what I need to hear. I just don't know what to think, how to motivate myself, how to keep myself from giving myself little breaks that turn into hours despite meds and timers. The fear of joblessness/failure and love of medicine used to work. Now it doesn't feel as serious despite being more serious than ever before. Something is wrong with me. I can't do therapy right now (long story) so I need to figure my shit out and FAST. Anyone have any suggestions on getting out of this stupid bog of my own laziness and stupid decisions? Anyone get into these quagmires before that can give me some perspective on how to start? How do I kick myself in my own ass?  Thank you for reading this mess, and thank you in advance if you respond. You're all wonderful, this community has been a blessing."
en8luy,3,2020-01-11,How long should I wait for a job offer?,ShroudedChasm,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/en8luy/how_long_should_i_wait_for_a_job_offer/,"I've been working for a software company for about 3 years now while doing college (Computer information Systems major). I was at first an intern. The company was acquired the first year. I remained - but would remain as an intern. Not many people from my office were laid off (international company).  

The 2nd year they pushed for me to be an actual employee - part time with benefits. It didn't happen. I felt like they kept making things up. I asked this in March 2019, and it was supposed to happen by the end of the quarter, June 30th. Nothing happened, no offer. They claim they wouldn't give me a position until I have the degree. Now I'm considered a ""Consultant/Intern"". Many of my coworkers argue I'm not an intern AT ALL - I'm just being taken advantage of. 

Now I HAVE my degree (just graduated in late December). My boss/HR was hammered alive by some of my coworkers to give me a real position. My boss and HR spoke with some of the higher ups last Tuesday and are hoping to make it happen. One of the biggest reasons why I don't want to leave is my coworkers. The other reason is that the place has a good retention rate. Almost everyone in my office (except me) has been there for more than 10 years. 

One of the reasons that I've stayed there so long is because there is an overall lack of software companies/IT jobs where I live. I'd have to move at least 2 hours from where I live to find a decent job. I make $15/hr. They make 80k+ salary. Should I quietly try to get written recommendations from my coworkers who support me? 

My previous manager from this company found another job (about 2 hours away) might have an open position. She was a great manager - and it's probably my best bet. Is it best to just apply for the job myself or message her about it first, and then apply? 

As for how long I should wait.. should I give it a month? My plan is to talk to my previous manager/apply for the job next week, wait to hear back, go through the process of interviews (hopefully). I intend to WAIT until I get an offer letter from my company or their company. I'd definitely get paid more at my current company if I actually get the offer letter. If I hear back from the other company before my company, should I just take it? I feel like there's a lot of angles to this and one slip up could tank my career. Any advice is appreciated."

enap8z,2,2020-01-11,Career fair and struggles with internship hunting,cheezyhamster,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/enap8z/career_fair_and_struggles_with_internship_hunting/,"I'm a chemical engineering student, junior year, Honors and I'm seriously worried about my career prospects as I haven't received any internship offers yet. I've applied to around 100 jobs, with some rejections and about 5 interviews (one of which I recently received a rejection from). The interviews were at pretty big, competitive companies like J&amp;J and CVS who tend to hire early on in the fall so I suppose it's not the worst thing, but I'm getting worried since I'm afraid it's a bit too late to find anything as it's the middle of winter already.  


A career fair at my school is coming up in February and I'm preparing for that. Updating my resume, networking, doing some research, all that stuff. But I'm still really worried, and I'm having nightmares that if I don't land an internship this summer, my career upon graduation will be absolutely screwed. My resume isn't terrible, in fact I currently have a research position and have worked as a children's tech instructor, and I'm in a couple clubs, one of which I'm a leader in. I have a 3.9 GPA at my university's Honors College program. So with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I've been messaging/emailing HR and recruiters, some of which have emailed me before from previous career fairs or interviews. It's a form of networking, but is it useful? Has anyone been successful doing this?
2. Any specific career fair tips? I know the basics: Update your resume, practice a short ""pitch"" depending on the position, apply/look up positions beforehand, have something specific to say about how your skills match the position, and ask for LinkedIn/business card/email or some form of contact afterwards.
3. Even with research, a techy summer job, some EC's and a leadership position, and a high GPA, will I be screwed upon graduation with an engineering degree if I don't have an internship? I understand it will be harder with less experience but I don't want to be working at fast food or retail just because I don't have a lot of industrial experience. And since it's January already, is it too late for a summer internship?  


Thank you so much for your help in advance. I need some reassurance that I will be okay, to be honest.  


TLDR: Chemical engineering junior with research, good GPA, EC's, summer job, have \~100 apps and some interviews but no offers. Very worried about not having an internship. Want to know if contacting HR people works, if there are any career fair tips, and if my career is screwed upon graduation if I don't land an internship."
enauf4,2,2020-01-11,Help narrowing down and fleshing our senior synthesis and project ideas for a soon-to-be graduate,t_hood,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/enauf4/help_narrowing_down_and_fleshing_our_senior/,"Hey guys, first post here but I frequently lurk here and on the datascience sub as well. During my undergrad I've had 3 internships and have had tons of exposure to data engineering, data science and analytics, and data modeling. Because of this, I want my senior project to incorporate at lease some of these techniques into it. Specifically, my project must pertain to my majors (applied mathematics and computer science), but I have a lot of headroom when it comes to how I choose to present my topic and relate it to these areas. I'm still in the brainstorming phase of what I want to do and I'd like help narrowing down my ideas and possibly fleshing out a few. Here's what I have so far:

1. E-Commerce platform that tracks all activity and records it in a DB. 
   1. From here I'd like to use the captured data to drive an analytics program or platform that can easily create dashboards and models. 
   2. I'm not really sure how to begin implementing this though, and I want to try and use methodologies and languages that are actually in demand (i.e. used in production and industry). 
2. IoT device that captures data of some sort of information or data and relays it back to a web server where the user can interact with it.
   1.  I've been exploring TensorFlow, RaspberryPi, NodeMCU, and a few others to see what I can build with these (they seem very versatile). 
   2. For this I'm not sure what specific area I should go for in IoT. Smart cities really intrigue me, but the solutions been discussed for smart cities appear to be on a much larger-scale that what I can feasibly achieve as a student. 
   3. Devices that monitor or track health data also intrigue me. Potential areas I have looked at are blood sugar levels, heart rates, and weight, exercise, and sleep patterns.
3. Anything related to ""buzzwords"". I can use this project to learn about buzzwords that I'm relatively inexperienced with, such as: 
   1. block chain
   2. cryptography
   3. centralized crypto-currencies
   4. AI (specifically autonomous vehicles, image/object recognition)
4. Finally, if it helps at all, here are the languages, tools, and frameworks I am familiar with
   1. Python
      1. Pandas, Numpy, PsycoPG2, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Apache-Airflow
   2. SQL
      1. PostgreSQL, Google Big Query, MySQL, MS SQL Server, GraphQL
   3. R (still pretty novice, but I understand the basics)
      1. RShiny, Caret, Tidyverse
   4. Web (still pretty novice, but I understand the basics)
      1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap
   5. Visualization
      1. RShiny, Tableau, SpotFire, Excel, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   6. Others
      1. C#, C++, Java"

However, I have a disability that directly impacts my ability to remember ""not relevant"" information, like random shapes in addition to a processing speed deficit. My short term memory is impacted when dealing with abstract stuff like shapes, so I don't think I did particularly well.  

The email states that they are committed to ensuring fair hiring practices for those with disabilities, so I'm wondering if in this case, it's better to just look for other positions that don't have such abstract questions, or email and ask about getting accommodations? I've heard the banks do well for computer science internships, so I'd like to maximize my chances."

2.	When should I start applying to FT jobs? 
3.	 I‚Äôm guessing I should start applying as soon as I start my internship because that gives me 4 months until graduation, but won‚Äôt me missing time to go on interviews look poorly and lessen my chances of getting a return offer?

So it is common for the company to finance a master or postmaster. However recently it came to my attention that the management is trying to steer the employees to only Data Science masters.

Personally, I would prefer a master which incorporates both business/economics aspects as data analytics/IT. Also due to my current bachelor Business Administration.

My question is, how to write a kickass proposal where I will be able to convey how this MBA will result in my personal and professional growth and development. Which will enhance my ability to adapt to different situations where I will be able to converse with (client) managing partners and CEO's which will have direct results for the department and company. 

Does anybody have any experience in convincing management to finance their MBA?"
encs5a,1,2020-01-11,Where am I heading?,By2299,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/encs5a/where_am_i_heading/,"First of all I want to say that I am not a native speaker so excuse the bad English. 


I (m20) have been struggling a lot recently. I am currently working as an intern and I love what I do. I am going to hand in my Bachelor thesis in June. I got a scholarship at the end of school so I could study at a very good university.
Even though this all sounds like my life is running smoothly I find myself feeling lost very often. I am second guessing my life a bunch and I don't know   whether I am on the right track or not. I'm afraid to make a wrong decision and consequently spending my life trying to reach the wrong goals. Then one day I will realize that I wasted so much time and that it is too late to start again. 
Also I have been single for two years. Since then I have been dating around a little but nothing really worked out. That didn't bother too much at first but now I feel like I am ready to persue something serious again but I can't find a girl with whom I can imagine a serious relationship. Lately I don't even get to know new girls. Apart from romantical relationships I had to leave behind a lot of friends because I had to move because of my internship and now I'm feeling very lonely since I just made one real friend in my new town and lost a few in my hometown. 

In summary I want to say that I am not sure where my life is heading and that really scares me. I'm afraid that I qm not where I am supposed to be striving for something I shouldn't persue. I am afraid one day I will wake up and realize this. I am scared of the future. Am I on the right path in life? Where does this path lead to? Should I start something new? Am I where I am supposed to be right now? I am really struggling with this. 

I hope somebody can relate to this and maybe give me some advice. Thank you in advance!"

I have been working with Power Electronics for the past year and although it promises a good future I have felt that a career in it wouldn‚Äôt mean much to me. For now I am planning to switch to IT as it goes well along the Job Market in a country I am planning to settle in where IT seems to be the only thriving field.
I have started to take interest in embedded systems and have successfully completed basics of the ARM M4 architecture through online courses and it is kind of interesting and I am confident that my electronics knowledge will fit in well to what I am planning for.
For the Germany embedded market however, I am trying to realize what are the actual industry requirements when it comes to embedded systems and what tools one should have to get a placement in this domain. Besides I would love to get some feedback on how can I build up some practical embedded C skills if I have a STM32 board to practice on?
TIA"

enhhrj,38,2020-01-11,Traumatized by my internship. Not sure where to go from here.,timetickingrose,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/enhhrj/traumatized_by_my_internship_not_sure_where_to_go/,"About a month ago I finished my 3 month long student teaching internship. I got paired up with an 50 something year old man (I'm 23 F). He's ex military, and he really treated the high schoolers and myself like we were in the military. Here are a list of all the shitty things he did to me/ the students during the internship.

1. Told me I was only nice to the students because I'm a woman and it's ""In my nature."" 
2. Told the students that if they wanted to get feedback on their work they could come to me if they wanted to be told how great they were and to come to him if they wanted ""The truth"". (I gave students many of the same criticisms that he gave, just in a MUCH kinder way.)
3. Told me that I shouldn't teach the students about myths because it had nothing to do with creative writing. Told me it was a terrible idea.
4. Told me that Of Mice and Men is only about friendship and when I told him I wanted to go into workers struggles during the great depression he told me that if I wanted to get into politics I should teach ""Grapes of Wrath"" (Written by the same guy btw.)
5. If I asked for help he told me I needed to figure it out on my own.
6. Told me he didn't think I could handle the students.
7. A student had a disability for anxiety and he told the 14 year old to ""toughen up"".
8. Told a student that wrote about himself that he was playing the ""My my grandparents were in a Japanese internment camp card."" for pity points. (I told the same student that I also thought he should take that part out, but only because the essay could only be 500 words long and the essay was supposed to be about HIM and not his grandparents.)
9. Told me that everyone had to turn their assignments in, but that I also couldn't extend due dates. (Impossible task.)
10. When I brought food for lunch he would criticize me for what I was eating. I brought a 400 calorie salad and he commented how big it was. I bring yogurt and granola and he would comment ""Again?!"" because I would have it quite often. 
11. Told me my ideas didn't make sense, but then stole the same ideas the next period. For example, in a poetry class I wanted to show students some music, but he told me that music wasn't poetry. The next class period he had some students listen to some music. 
12. In the same creative writing class I brought in a poem about Peace, because the theme was ""Peace Poems"". The poem I brought was about nature, and a quiet atmosphere. He said my poem didn't count cause it wasn't ""fighting for peace."" 
13. Wouldn't use the correct pronouns for a transgender student. 
14. When I introduced myself to the students he laughed at me when I asked if they had any questions about me.
15. Yelled at me when I said I didn't get his email the other day. He checked and saw he sent it to the wrong person. Didn't say he was sorry. 
16. Asked me if I felt stupid when I did something wrong. 
17. At the end of the day he would rip into me for literally 15 minutes at a time after school. He would tell me everything I did wrong and ask me rhetorical questions meant to embarrass. He also did this to the students. 
18. Told me in the creative writing class to only teach poetry because their short stories were going to ""be bad"". When I told him I felt sorry for the students because they signed up for a creative writing class he told me to ""do whatever you want, but I'm not going to clean up after you.""
19. Constantly betrayed the students. Saying things like ""All of your essays were terrible."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there are more but these are what I can think of off the top of my head. The experience was alienating, I would cry all of the time, and it gave me temporary IBS. I would wake up at 4 am with panic attacks and I had to be put on tranquilizers to get though the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

With nearly 100 days of constant put downs the idea of going back to work, or trying to work at a school really scares me. The students really loved me and were sad to see me go, but I can't handle the stress. This last month I've just been on the computer or in bed. It's been so depressing, I feel weak, sad, and lost. I have about 10,000 stored away in the bank so I can take a bit of a break, but I don't have to go to school anymore. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life now. The idea of ANY work right now is daunting. I've worked before, but the idea of any job right now puts me in a panic. I don't want a boss or working environment like him again. This entire situation reminds me of being in an abusive relationship. While I can take a break from dating for as long as I want, I can't take a break from bosses for as long as I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a therapy appointment soon. What should I say to them? How to I get passed my new fear of bosses and/or  teaching?"

I want to study further to aim for higher roles like researcher or research scientist. I want to join a masters program in C.S with specialization in ML . I already have the exact experience that my grad school expects. However I don't have any recent letter of recommendations.

My last letter of recommendation was from a university professor , with whom I worked for few months as a research intern on a NLP project. other recommendation also from past include one from NGO and one from a failed startup owner ( this was all during my college days , around 3 - 4 years ago ) 

I am currently trying to work hard so that I can get a letter of recommendation again which is more relevant towards my master specialization subject, but I cannot guarantee if my boss ( also a professor ) will write it to me, because I am working in sort of a recruitment company which places engineers like me to big client companies. So even though I am working with my client company and making great contributions , I am not sure if it's fair to ask for a LOR , or how should I approach him. These things are constantly bugging me.

Also the whole process can be very overwhelming, does anyone know a good starting guide  which covers details such as scholarships etc ?

Just a little background to understand my situation and what I‚Äôm asking. 

I‚Äôm a senior from WA state. My family and I are extremely poor. Therefore, my EFC is 0. I‚Äôm having trouble choosing between these two colleges which are vastly different. I will be living on campus for both of them. I‚Äôm majoring in CS.

The first one is Eastern Washington University. It‚Äôs mainly a commuter school, which I‚Äôm not a fan of, but don‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs pretty near where I live. I‚Äôm not a fan of the rural living area, and the largest city close to it is Spokane which I‚Äôm also not a fan of. The estimated net price from their calculator is $14,271. I haven‚Äôt been accepted yet (but 100% I will, because I fall under their assured admission, just having issues with them receiving my transcript). I‚Äôm majoring in CS. There isn‚Äôt many opportunities to put yourself out there for potential internships or any other things because it‚Äôs a small, regional school. However, it is cheap and close to home and most of my friends/family are here (but it honestly isn‚Äôt a big deal to me).

The second one is University of Massachusetts at Boston. I was accepted as a CS major. I just received their financial aid package today and they are offering (this includes direct loans and work study) a total of $42,795.00 of gift aid. That brings down my total to(as estimated by them which includes housing, meal plan, and other fees and excess tuition that may not be covered) $17,613. Without housing, it would be $712. I feel Boston has a lot of offer career and socially/lifestyle wise, and is pretty much everything I want that EWU isn‚Äôt. However, I‚Äôm having trouble justifying the extra costs of flying there, paying the few thousand extra and taking out loans, as well as just the process of having to start new (which is scary, I admit). However, the East coast is a dream for me. With EWU, I feel as if I‚Äôm just settling.

Even though UMASS almost offers everything that I want, EWU is convenient and a little bit cheaper. Almost, there is also a lot of indirect costs associated with UMASS, such as plane tickets and a short term car rental. I‚Äôm also afraid that while they did offer that much gift aid for my first aid, it will diminish greatly the following years and I‚Äôll be left with a huge lump-some of debt. 

I just need general advice on what you all would do if you were in my situation. Thank you!"

The title might make this sound straight forward, but actually I am not entirely sure it is.  For context, I am close to graduation (this year) and I am an Economics major.

I did a bit of coding last semester in an econometrics class and I liked it, so I  signed up for an intro computational-Econ class this semester (Python and R mainly).  I have done some of the work and I have really enjoyed it so far. 

Anyway, just out of curiousity, I wanted to ask this sub about any jobs/classes I could look at now, in the scenario I end up really liking the course and come graduation want to do more.   

Is there any jobs I could look into that would consider someone with a semester and a half of coding experience? (The classes center around data manipulation and modeling).  And if not is there any utility to taking a class over the summer once I graduate to learn some more?

I know I don't know much and missed chances to do any internships, so if I go this route I may be looking boutique / small firms, but I figure if I like it then it will be worth it."

**First a little background on myself:**

I've never been employed in an IT position. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Biology and worked in Environmental Science for 2 years before I decided that I wanted to make a career change. I'm currently back in school working on my associates degree in Information Technology and will be graduating in a few months. For those interested, I returned to school at the age of 25. The only background in IT that I had prior to studying for this exam was a help desk internship that I held for a few months over the summer. This is also my first certification.

**Resources I used to pass:** 

1) Darril Gibson Get Certified Get Ahead SY0-501 Study Guide

2) Jason Dion - Udemy CompTIA Security+ (SY0-501) Complete Course &amp; Practice Exam

3) Jason Dion - Udemy CompTIA Security+ (SY0-501) Practice Exams with Simulations

**Study Process:**

When I began studying for this exam, I had some background knowledge of the concepts covered in the Network+ exam from the courses that I took as part of my associates degree which gave me a good place to start. I started with Darril Gibson's GCGA book and read the whole thing through while taking any notes I felt necessary. Because this was the first time that I was exposed to a lot of these security concepts, this was the longest phase of my overall studying process. It took me about 3 weeks to go through this book and complete the end of chapter exams. After completing the book, I went through Jason Dion's entire course and this went much faster as I had already been exposed to a majority of the concepts from the GCGA book. It took me 4 days to go through his course. I think both of these resources were instrumental in my passing the exam and I can't recommend them enough. Jason Dion's course includes 1 practice exam and the practice exam bundle includes 6 additional exams. I only took Jason Dion's exams once as I wanted to know what my true score was without the effects of memorizing the answers. Of all 7 exams, I scored a 78 and the other 6 ranged from 80-88. After going through and understanding why my answers were incorrect, I scheduled and took the CompTIA exam the next day.

**Top Tips:**

1) Study at least 2 different resources - there was material that I learned in the Jason Dion course that wasn't covered in the GCGA book and vice versa.

2) Understand how the concepts work together - Just knowing the definitions and acronyms won't be enough to pass (although still important), the questions really test how well you understand how to best implement what you've learned according to specific scenarios.

3) Take practice exams - Jason Dion's practice exams were very close to the real exam and allow you to become comfortable with the type of wording that you can expect to see. Don't skip out on taking these before the real thing.

4) Go through the CompTIA Security+ Objectives list and make sure you are comfortable with everything on it. It will all be tested.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if you have any questions. Good luck on your exam!"

enqrgn,3,2020-01-12,Doing an MBA after a PhD --- does it make sense?,insipid_programmer,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/enqrgn/doing_an_mba_after_a_phd_does_it_make_sense/,"Like the title says, I've been wondering about this a lot lately. I graduated with my PhD (in theoretical computer science) a few months ago and I'm doing a postdoc now. I've been feeling frustrated with the low pay and uncertain future (uncertainty in getting a faculty position in the future). Unfortunately my PhD hasn't provided me with any skills that can be monetized outside the academia. So I've been thinking hard how best to make a fresh start in my career.

My question, in a nutshell, is: Would a good business school accept a candidate with my background? (Assuming my GMAT score is good) ... My biggest weakness is that I've got exactly zero industry experience. I've never even done an internship in my entire life that was not in the academia."

I am in need of some perspective from hiring managers in computer science, any other advice would still be really helpful and appreciated.",AlzorTheGrey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/enrrpj/hello_i_am_in_need_of_some_perspective_from/,"Bit of background first:
I live in the UK. 
I was at university studying Computer Systems Engineering, which is basically Engineering with a sprinkling of Software / Hardware. I didn't find the course interesting but still managed very good grades in the 1st year. During summer I acquired an internship in the Digital Services department of a utility company, my internship was basically testing out a technology they were looking at bringing into the company - PowerApps. By testing out I mean the whole process of gathering the User Requirements, designing the database, frontend and putting it all together. 
After this I managed to get a part time role in the same company to learn the ropes of software dev and continue to do PowerApps, this was alongside doing my uni course so was 1 day a week in the office and 1 day a week at home. In December I finally (After thinking the course wasn't my thing 4 weeks into the 1st year) left. I've still got the role with the utility company and I'm getting plenty of work from it so I'm able to work full time and it doesn't look like it'll slow down in the future. I'm collecting skills in C# backend, Angular frontend and a variety of other skills every single day.

At the moment I feel as though I have 2 solid options: continue to work, gathering more skills and experience with opportunities popping up all the time. Or go back to university to study computer science. A subject I genuinely enjoy and find interesting and not a course I would be doing to get a good job at the end of. 

My question is:
In the future if I were to change jobs which is going to look better - a degree or 3 years of experience in a software development role?"
ent609,6,2020-01-12,[META] Friendly reminder that enough is enough!,ConquerorCahlos,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ent609/meta_friendly_reminder_that_enough_is_enough/,"But not in the 'I'm done putting up with this' way, and more like the 'At peace with where you are at' way.

Let me explain. 

Also, I should preface this by saying that this was more just a reminder to myself that I figured I would share in case anyone else also needed to hear it.

We are two weeks in to the new year and for myself (and I assume for many of you as well), this means two weeks of attempting to learn programming, build projects, grind leetcode problems, interview prep, repeat. Last year I made it a resolution of mine to 'Get a job as a developer' (spoiler: I do not have a job in development, yet). However, this year my goal is to simply 'Be a developer'. Looks the same, but there is an ever so slight, very important distinction between the two. Allow me to elaborate.

The first resolution is an end goal. Some achievement that can be reached and as such, I consider a boolean value. Do I have a development job, yes or no? This time around the resolution shifts from this boolean to a process in itself. Be a developer. What does that entail? It differs for each person, job, role, etc, but for me this just means to code. Code every day. Or at least try to. It means, think logically when you can, and creatively when you can. Solve problems daily. At home, your current job, in the kitchen. To me, being a developer is a lifestyle, one that I have been actively working towards trying to achieve but have come to the realization that it is something that you never achieve. Time and time again we see questions posed here discussing the end goal of trying to get a job, work at some Big N company, get an internship, and so on. However, we rarely see discussion around when enough is enough and why that should matter. Of course, for a majority these end goals are paramount in why we bother to pick up programming in the first place. You left your job for greener pastures in a booming industry, you spent 4 years of your life getting an education in the field you are now seeking employment from, or you even just built something awesome and decided you wanted to make a life out of it. There are definitely valid reasons for having these end goals, but that doesn't mean we should gloss over an important aspect here: reflection.


Close your eyes. Think back to last year. Were you programming then? Think about how far you've come since. Were you doing something completely unrelated? Well look at you now, even by just perusing this subreddit you've taken a giant first step. I say this to illustrate the fact that learning will never stop. This is evidenced by the amount of users here that actually work as programmers. They've reached this 'end goal', yet they are still learning each day, and sharing their wisdom (or lack thereof) with all of us. Ask yourself this, if you had everything you wanted out of programming right this second. Would you feel any different? If your first day at a Big N was tomorrow, would your desire to continue to learn about programming just cease? 

The point I am trying to make with all this is that enough will never be enough, but it can and that is okay. Enough should be enough. Enough is enough! It is okay to be content with where you are at in this moment in time. It is okay if you are not where you want to be. It is okay to be smack dab in the middle of the two. This shouldn't demotivate you to stop trying though, in fact it should do the opposite! You should take time out of your day to reflect. Behind the code we write each day there is a reason. Some external or internal force that pushes us to pursue this. All the time spent worrying about the future can and should be used to appreciate the present. You will code yourself straight in to a meltdown if you don't take the time out to recognize and appreciate what it is you currently have. The good, the bad, the ugly. Appreciate the mediocre job you currently work at, as it allows you the opportunity to recognize where your true passion lies. Appreciate the four year degree you are in a hurry to pay back, it gave you the knowledge necessary to tackle what lies ahead. Appreciate your family that you are working to try to take care of (seriously though, go hug your kid). Appreciate the struggle, as it is what will allow you to grow in to the person you wish to become. But above all else, appreciate the now, as there is no other moment in time that exists."

I‚Äôm male and 24 now, I have little to no friends (probably only about 2-3 actual friends currently - I have had some fall outs with previous friends over the years) and these friends of mine already are a lot more popular and have heaps of their own friends anyway when they‚Äôre all I have, so they have much less time for me than I do for them and half the time I feel like these friends just use me anyway, therefore I don‚Äôt really end up socialising much unfortunately even though I would like to. I have been single for about 7 years now since high school (this was my only relationship ever) and even over these past years I haven‚Äôt really had many hook-ups or been on many dates either and I‚Äôm pretty lonely these days. I‚Äôve mostly tried dating apps over these years so many times  over and over to the point at which it's embarrassing, since I don‚Äôt really have the opportunity to meet people in person much and this has had very little success (tinder, bumble, hinge ‚Äì you name it). I‚Äôve probably been on only about 2 dates in this whole time and after each date I've been ghosted or cut off. So quick description of me, I try to take relatively good care of myself, I work out and am reasonably athletically built, decent face I guess and average height and Im usually pretty ok with talking to people too if that and can be confident where necessary if that helps to describe me a bit.

What makes this even worse is that I graduated college (business degree and want to get into marketing) almost 2 years ago now and have since really struggled to land a graduate role or job or even experience in my field (I currently still work my part time hospitality job which I‚Äôve had for years so I at least have some income ‚Äì I hate it but need the money). The worst part about this is I‚Äôve almost graduated too long ago to be eligible for any graduate positions let alone jobs and I‚Äôm not even a very favourable candidate for internships either since I‚Äôm no longer studying (I tried to land interns while studying but still wasn‚Äôt successful after a countless amount of applications) ‚Äì so now I‚Äôm slowly falling into more and more debt etc. 

It's hard considering all my friends a lot of people I know are quite successful at this point, doing what they want, are in relationships and have plenty of friends and I feel like I keep getting left more and more behind and that Im getting nowhere.

Over these years I‚Äôve tried various hobbies, through my last few jobs and tried making friends when I was at college but never really had any luck and also of course dating apps with my relationship issues which has also been pretty much successful too as I find people just don‚Äôt like me, and in terms of work its practically been a second job for me constantly looking for work, applying, reaching out, seeking advice etc.

If anyone is or has been in a similar position or has some ideas, I would love your advice, as I‚Äôm kinda at the point where I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore‚Ä¶ Thanks :)"

 I've see posts' here where people had some work experience or work experience not related to what they're pursuing but for me I have absolute NO work experience whatsoever. I have nothing to put in the resume but my degree and my name. 

How does one get an internship with nothing to for them to review?

I went to my college advisor asking for help and she said ""internships is a on your own type of thing"".

After February I'm going to start taking classes to get my certificate in ""Network &amp; Information Security"" that my college offers but I know I'll still be back at square one when I get that certificate.

Any advice would be helpful, I'm doing all fo this on my own. Thanks."

I finished with a 4.0/4.0 GPA (Like a 4.2 if you weighed A Pluses but IDK if Tech does). I currently and doing IT Audit for a really big tax firm, but I've already come to realize that I despise the travel, and the work is monotonous as hell.

 I did my internship doing software development work at a regional insurance company. I took classes in Java, C#, SQL, web dev (HTML, CSS, JS), as well as many classes focused on project management (so like agile and stuff like that). I was a TA for the class that does the introduction to project management (learning about Agile Scrum and things like that). I was also the team lead for my last semester project where we built upon a .NET core application for a client. The highest level of math I have is business calculus and I haven't done any algorithm classes.

I have developed a passion to learn programming at an even higher level in the short time that I have been out of school and have taught myself Python, Linux, and a bit of C++ (though I am ass it C++). I have realized I want to move into a software dev role and thing that this degree would be a great gateway into it. Do I even have a chance of being admitted, or would it be best for me to try to get my masters in a more MIS leaning program?"

College has honestly been a pretty stressful and lackluster experience for me, but I don't want to make any rash decisions, so I am trying to ask around and get as much advice as possible. 

I am currently about to enter my 2nd Semester of Junior year as a Computer Science Pre-Major. My school has competitive admission into the full Computer Science program, in which you have to score at least a B average between 4 core classes. I ended up doing pretty well with the programming courses, but when it came to Discrete Structures, I was only able to pass with a C and have been prevented from getting into the rest of the program. 

I could re-take the class and try again for a B, which would allow me to start the major in my senior year, however, student loans have me worried, as I would have to graduate 1-2 years later than my target graduation year of 2021. My university only allows you to take up to 2 CS classes at a time, so I would have to spread out the remaining 10 required classes over an additional 5 semesters (assuming that I dont fail any classes in that time). The scholarship that I am currently under pays for about half of my tuition, but it only lasts for 4 years, so I would have to take out an additional $12k-$20k of federal loans to pay for the additional years. I am currently sitting at around $17k in loans and I should be around $24k by the end of my senior year, so the thought of doubling that shocked me a bit.

Throughout this time, I had decided to also take classes in Information Science and Technology as a sort of back-up plan in case I didn't make it into CS. That degree program focuses a lot more on statistics, data visualization, and data science, with some other optional programming-related courses on the side (web development/design, Machine Learning, HCI, Neural Networks, etc). It also requires you to take an internship somewhere as well as a CS or Math minor. While I like the things that I've learned so far, this degree is considered ""easier"" than CS and lacks some of the theoretical classes that can only be taken by people in the CS majors (data structures and algorithms for example). I was worried that employers might look down on me for having this degree, however due to the courses I've taken so far, I should be able to graduate on time and not have to worry about taking on the additional loans. 

I don't really know what to do at this point and I feel completely lost. People have been telling me that I should be fine switching into IST, including my CS graduate friends, but I can't help but worry about this might affect my career in the future. I want to work in either Web Development, Mobile Development, DevOps, or QA (though mostly web development) and I've been told that as long as I have a decent portfolio I should have no issues getting work in any of those fields, but I often wonder if that advice is actually true. 

I'm not gonna lie, I'm not convinced that my absolute ""end goal"" is to be a programmer (its just another potential option for me). I've always had a love for technology and I've definitely come to enjoy programming throughout my time in college, but I wonder if I might be better suited for another position in the tech industry (such as Sytems Admin or Network engineer).

With that being said, do you think the extra stress + student loans will pay off better in the long run with a CS degree, or am I better off studying a related field?"

I'm a non-traditional student, currently a sophomore, and I'm pursuing a BS in Management Information Systems. My freshman year was awful. I was in a different major then and was working a job that left me with little time to do schoolwork, sleep, do work around the house, spend time with my wife, etc. I was miserable. As a result, I came into my sophomore year with a lackluster GPA that is really quite embarrassing to me. I'm currently at \~2.5, but so far, things are going much better for me this year. My GPA is on the rise, but that first year is REALLY dragging it down.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't plan to start applying for internships until next summer/fall, when my GPA will be better than it is now (but still not amazing) and I'm working on improving my coding skills and gaining some professional IT certifications (trying to get into the information security field). Thankfully, as I waited a little while to start school, I do have a good deal of work experience under my belt, including a leadership role, and I know that some of my past supervisors would gladly be references for me. I'm also working through school, including two jobs currently.

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I going to be screwed by my GPA? Will my work experience help me out very much? I'm just afraid that that first year is going to doom me moving forward as I try to dig my way out of this hole.

I am currently two semesters away from graduating (June) with a Masters in CS with a focus in software engineering. I live in the Portland area. I did an internship last summer at as a developer and decided to transition to part time during the school year.

Right before leaving for Christmas the company offered me a full time job when I graduate. Initially I was excited because this is my first good experience in the industry. But I wanted to sit down and think it through first.

First off, they clearly state that they pay less than other companies with similar roles. Right now, I am on a hourly wage. I was offered 55k a year with decent benefits. I am new to the industry so I am unsure if this a good salary for a masters degree? Obviously, a degree has little merit on how great of a programmer I am, so I am wondering if I have any right to ask for more money? If so, how do I go about asking for more? Or will it backfire in my face? 

Additionally, it seems a little strange to me that they offered me the job almost 6 months before I can start full time and earn a salary. Are they trying to get me into a contract before I can survey my other options?

https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7ric75/psa_in_the_us_tech_internships_must_be_paid/

The only exception to this rule is if you're ""volunteering"" at a nonprofit.  Aside from that, if you're doing tech work for a company, according to US labor law you must be paid for your time there.

https://www.propublica.org/article/when-interns-should-be-paid-explained

Companies that offer unpaid internships are either ignorant of the law or are willfully breaking it, so I'd encourage you to avoid them.  Or if you're the vengeful type, go ahead and take an unpaid position and then [complain to the department of labor after the fact](https://employment.findlaw.com/wages-and-benefits/how-to-report-unpaid-wages-and-recover-back-pay.html), and you'll get a check that covers all of your hours.  Just keep close records of your time there."
eo4006,166,2020-01-13,We haven't run a backup in three years and now the computer won't turn on and just makes a grinding sound,ulfr,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/eo4006/we_havent_run_a_backup_in_three_years_and_now_the/,"I'm an IT guy, and at my current job I work mostly with doctors and others with similar interests. Waaaay back when I was still in college and this was just my part time job my boss was involved in some way with a clinical study. The doctor who was actually involved in data gathering in this study was sort of a dick in that non-doctors aren't people kind of way, but it was his fellow (a fellow what doctors call their interns) that provided the impetus for this particular tale. We'll call him Phil. Phil and his boss would come in and enter data about this fancy expensive study into one of two computers dedicated to this task maybe three times a week for an hour or two at a time. They'd been doing this since they started and kept right on doing it. I was mostly aware of them because the computers they used were next to my little patch of counter space. After six months in my (then) part time job Phil tracked me down and asked me to look at his study computer as it wouldn't turn on and was making a funny noise.

Upon further examination the funny sound turned out to be a cockroach stuck in one of the computer fans (did I mention I worked within a hospital?), and the not turning on was because the master boot record had been corrupted. Long story short, the data was probably fine but the actual allocation table was a loss. If anyone's recovered data from a dead drive before they know how tedious it is, because for the most part it involves running a program on the drive for a very long time and then clicking the OK prompt every once in a while after the program gets a case of the vapors. I tell Phil what happened and ask him if he's got a backup of the data and he brightens up and says oh sure! It's on this external, I have it set to update every week. (He got a demo copy of some kind of file-copy automator) He points out the external and I go to unplug the USB to see what we've got.

When the USB plug came out it looked a little funny, the metal part of the USB had stayed inside the computer while I held the plastic part. I found a cable to replace the one that had disintegrated and plugged the backup drive into my laptop, and there's no files on the backup drive. I'm not entirely sure how he managed to screw the pooch so thoroughly. So we've got a computer with a dead hard drive and no backup, I tell Phil there's no problem, I can get the data recovered for him in about three weeks. I was part time and only came in every so often, meaning the recovery software could occasionally sit for a couple days until I came back in. Phil then starts to hyperventilate because he needs to present the study findings using that data in five days in Toronto.

These discoveries were made on a Thursday, and he presented on Tuesday. I thought about it and then shrugged and said I'd see what I can do. I told my boss what was going on and he said he didn't think he was allowed to pay me for all the time I'd spend because of hospital payroll rules about part time employees. I shrug and say I'll do it anyway because I was still idealistic and impressionable at this age. Cue the montage music, I spend all day Friday at the office from about 7am till 10pm minding this, then come in at about 10am Saturday higher than a kite because I figure nobody was going to be there and I was mostly just going to hang out, eat doritos, and shoot zombies all day. Much to my surprise and dismay my boss is actually in and has a long talk with me about how much he appreciates what I'm doing. I didn't get in trouble and came in sober as a ghost Sunday, but nobody was in. I think I spent forty hours in three days sitting there clicking the OK button whenever it came up because this guy needed really his data.

Monday morning I tell Phil the datas on this new hard drive and backed up in half a dozen places and he says he can't thank me enough. I feel a golden glow of satisfaction knowing I saved the day.

Then Tuesday rolls around and Phil says hi, sits down, and starts entering more study data. I ask him what he's doing here, he's supposed to be in Toronto. He says something along the lines of ""Oh, the conference isn't for another two weeks, I just really wanted that data. Hey, why are you turning purple? Why aren't you saying anything? Where are you going?""

I track down my boss and tell him that Phil lied about when he needed the data, and my boss said, and I quote, ""What a dick!"" and then went back to what he was doing. I went home early that day.

TL;DR: A larval doctor is utterly negligent about how important data is stored and backed up and then lies about when he needs the data. I spend way too long covering his dumb ass for no good reason.

As an aside, Phil got fired a couple months after this all went down (not sure if there's a fancy Doctor word for that) for violating hospital network security rules. Someone who shall remain nameless told him about this cool new Remote Desktop thing and completely neglected to mention how many rules he'd be breaking if he used it at the Hospital. Shame about that."

I'm a rising Junior Electrical Engineering student.,Memelord1029,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/eo4gjz/would_anyone_mind_giving_my_resume_a_quick_review/," [https://docdro.id/yrCZFtp](https://docdro.id/yrCZFtp)

Hello folks,

I'm graduating from a community college in May before transferring to a 4-year university, and I want to apply for some summer electrical engineering internships (not too picky on the industry at the moment, but I probably want to go into either power or semiconductors). I redid my resume using a template I found online, and I'd appreciate any criticism.

I've heard mixed things about an ""interests"" section: some people say that its a good chance for you to find common ground with the hiring manager, while others say that it's too unprofessional to include. My current opinion is to delete or add it depending on the company culture, but I'm curious as to what people on here think.

I've had a lot of odd/ temporary jobs so far, as you can see. Should I drop some and elaborate more on a couple, or am I fine with the ""spread"" I have right now? Should I delete some stuff to make room for a summary that groups all of the skills I learned at each together?

I really appreciate any thoughts or opinions! Have a great day,

\~Chris

First, a little about me. I am 24, and currently a groomer at a mom and pop shop. I have about 3 years of college under my belt for an IT degree but had to drop out because a concussion that I got playing high school lacrosse left me unable to do all but the most basic math. Therefore I was unable to pass any of my math classes, so I left college as to not accrue any more debt than I already had. I have been passionate about computer systems my entire life and have always wanted a job in the IT field. I've built several computers, designed a few websites, and am very familiar with computer systems as a whole. I remember most of the html that I learned as well as some c++. That should be about all you need to know about me. 

On to my dilemma. I'm stuck. Both financially and direction wise. I know that I want to be in the IT field and that I would love to do system maintenance and just be the computer guy in an office building. I want to get my A+ and systems+ certifications but dont have the money and I cant afford the courses and dont want to go the route of going back to a university. I know that I could possibly do an internship and that some companies will help get the certifications. So that's where i need your help, a little guidance on what my next step should be, tips on what i should be looking for in a company, and to be my connection to IT. Thank you so much in advance for any advice that you can give."

I'm an undergraduate Mechanical engineering student currently pursuing a R&amp;D internship position. My employer asked me to research a few drones, compile their wingspan,payload,total payload,endurance, ceiling height and the effeciency. 

What he said, and asked me is to compare them using the efficiency for which he defined as being the following formula :  
  
[(Payload Weight * Endurance ( in french Autonomie)/ Total Weight ]  
  
Now he didn't specify the units I should use, and therefore I used Kg for the weights and hours for the endurance. The values I got range from 0.38 ( I guess least efficient) to 18.7 ( most efficient). Now I'm kind of not sure how to interpret the numbers. In school efficiency in textbook problems would range from 0 to 1, but here I'm getting values greater than 1. Should I use other units of measurements? What does for example an efficiency of 18.7 translate into, in terms of words? My reasoning is that I turn the 18.7 into a percentage, and therefore it means that its 1870% efficient. But I'm not sure if that makes sense .... 

I will attach a link to a picture of the data I have cummulated, and please let me know of any mistakes, wrong interpretations and things to fix.   

My supervisor is currently away, and so asking him about this is probably impossible for the moment being. Thank you

This post will be a bit lengthly due to background info. Just hang tight. Long long story long, I am a first generation female minority student, first to graduate from a university out of my immediate and extended family. I come from a crappy city with a crappy high school, a lot of the students lived in poverty. Only about 10% of my graduating class went onto 4 year universities (there were 400 students, so maybe 40 went to 4 year universities). I also was (am) poor, I was raised by a single mother working minimum wage. She is an illegal immigrant (hey, it's not my fault). I didn't have any siblings, you can already imagine the lack of role models I had. My mom worked while I went to school, I always behaved but I never really cared about my education. Education was not enforced on me. I didn't have to show my mom my grades, so I would just fall asleep in class. I did push myself, I went into honors classes (passed by but was never good enough). I didn't know what a GPA was or what the SAT was until my sophomore year of high school. It wasn't until then that I realized if I wanted to live a good life I would have to get good grades in order to get admission into a four year university. Life was too hectic at home, my cousins lived with me (their parents went bankrupt and most of my life was spent with them); if I would've went to a community college I would have dropped out. Even though my mom had smaller plans for me (go to community college and work a part time job) I knew what was best. Since my GPA sucked, (I was extremely involved but I didn't know how to express myself) I got into a crappy school. I did get into two other schools (I applied to four). I wanted to go to one out of state, the nicest of the three, but it was too much money. Okay lets speed this story up.  I was always fascinated by coding because at the age of 11 I started coding for my Tumblr page in HTML. My journey was extremely scary, I was on a stressful payment plan for school. Luckily I got a job that covered a lot of expenses my second year. I was struggling in school. Computer science requires a lot of math. I unfortunately was set back by my 8th grade algebra teacher, she never gave our class notes (students BEGGED for them; if that isn't telling you something then idk), she played Khan Academy videos everyday. She also gave us the answers to a benchmark test and she said if we passed our state tests we would get a B and if it was advance pass then an A. Back to my story, I had to retake college algebra, 3 TIMES!!! A lot of outside influences were part of this as well (I had gone through my first breakup the second time and I had no support, my mom did not know about my ex boyfriend). I somehow managed to pass all my math classes after that up until calculus 2, where I had to retake it. Anyways I am now a senior with a bad GPA 3.2 (this includes my grade forgiveness). My transcript is awful. It wasn't until this year, my senior year, that I wanted to be heavily involved in research. I want to learn more and more about the unknown and I am extremely upset that I will most likely get into a program because of my GPA and transcript. I am doing undergraduate research and I have attended multiple conferences. But I am still not good enough. I am thinking about doing an research internship this summer and applying to a masters program. But will I even get into a masters program? Is there anything I can do? Does anyone see any light for me? I settled when choosing my undergraduate school. I don't want to do that for graduate school, will I have to? My mother is old and my goal was to graduate with a good degree to get a job and to provide for her so she doesn't have to work anymore. Going to graduate school will make things harder and prolong my plans but it is a dream of mine. If nothing else, does anyone have advice?

Edit: I do currently have mentor under my research job. We are looking into taking a gap year programs, where I will be doing even more research and a workshop for the GRE. There is still a chance for masters programs, some of the ones I have been looking into have deadlines in March, April, and June. I do have recommenders. A lot of schools are dropping the GRE, I will most likely apply to some at random. My school has a masters program that could help me get ahead if I choose to go that route. I never really appreciated academia, before it was was a need, until now. Oh yeah, and I am interested in bioinformatics! I will be going for a Ph.D. in computer science."

I apologize for the formatting as I‚Äôm doing this on mobile

I was hoping to get some advice for a specific area. I live in the DMV area going to GMU for a BSIT with a concentration in information security (school is now calling it cyber security).

My background:

-A+ certification
-AS in IT from community college
-2 years (ongoing) of IT job experience (onsite tier 2 help desk essentially) working part time
-4+ years of customer service/retail/office
-currently studying for security+ certification

My current situation: I go to school full time, pay it through working and FAFSA. I rent a townhouse with other students and pay for it by working. I‚Äôm financially independent. I work part time doing IT 20 hours a week to pay for all my expenses. Because of this and school I‚Äôm usually not left with very much free to pursue many other things and I‚Äôd like to add to my resume as I get closer to finishing school. Leaving my job for an internship where I‚Äôm not guaranteed employee to afterwards is something I can‚Äôt do.

My question: For those of you who have lived/worked/studied in the DMV area, what are some of your regrets in terms of not taking advantage of the benefits this area provides?  

Especially current and former students. Occasionally seeing posts here about my area and hearing from my school is that this area is full of opportunities, I strongly believe it. Plenty of tech companies and government stuff around here. I know I‚Äôm taking not full advantage of what‚Äôs here and I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs open to me in this area for additional experience or learning. Any suggestions?

I‚Äôve thought about part time summer internships as I could make work with my current job schedule but is there anything else I could get into during the school semester that I could dedicate a few hours a week such as volunteering at non-profit tech organizations? I haven‚Äôt been able to find any. Im open to anything as I‚Äôd like to be exposed to as much as I can be so I can find what I particularly like and work towards getting into after graduation.

After making the mistake of not doing an internship while in school, I'm finding it quite difficult to find a job in my area. 

In my current role of a design engineer it would appear to hiring managers as if i have no experience in IT. Knowing how important it is two have 2 out of the 3 requirements for finding a position (degree, certs, experience) this is definitely the limiting factor. (Certs are in progress at this moment)

Anyways, for the past year I have been the unofficial ""Back-up IT Support"" whenever our IT manager is out of town. I'll provide help whenever someone is having issues with their computer, desk phone, cell, etc. If there is anything I can't figure out I'll escalate it to our outside IT source.

 Is this something I can list as a role on my resume? Or should it just be a bullet point under my official title?"

I've been one for 10 years, and I've been looking to go private sector for a while. A a minimum, I've been trying to move to a different office due to stagnation with where I am right now (10 years in the same seat).

On Friday, I received a tentative offer for a position in the same building, but in a different office. This one has a bit more growth potential than what I'm in now, but not much. The pay would be the same (again, federal). I haven't received a final offer yet, although I anticipate it'll be waiting for me when I go into work tomorrow.

On the other hand, an Intern position I've been waiting on for a couple months finally reached out to me today, and they've scheduled an interview for this Thursday. My current position has next to no overlap aside from things like working in an office environment and Microsoft Office, so I'm starting at the bottom experience-wise. I realize with it being an intern spot the pay is less, but I'm a year out from getting my GIS degree and this is in GIS, which is what I want to do long term.

I anticipate taking the intern slot barring anything unseen that I can't handle (unpaid mainly). That being said, how do I handle the tentative offer for the moment?"

So I'm the kind of person that tries to pursue most interests because I see a future in them, eventually hoping there's a breakthrough in one and I can direct my focus in it. This however leaves me vulnerable to not being 100% invested in some projects I do and my quality of work is lower. 

I want to discuss and bottom out wise options for me and to discover some career paths I havent thought about yet.

Background:

In my 3rd year of BSc Physics, currently in a 1 year internship in the global technology department at an asset management giant. Lined up summer internship in commercial banking at a large firm. Strong interest in tech, coding, business analysis, data, finance, trading, funds, etc.


What would next logical steps for my career be, if I cant decide between tech and finance?

eoaxrr,18,2020-01-13,Consumed By Ambition,nails119,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eoaxrr/consumed_by_ambition/," 

I‚Äôve worked hard to get where I am. After years of grueling academics I graduated cum laude from Georgetown and managed to snag an associate position for one of the most prominent law firms in DC. Five years later, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm in line to become partner whenever Attorney Teague kicks the bucket...I'm convinced some of these guys would rather die at their desks than fully retire. Most of my classmates would kill to be in my position and I couldn‚Äôt even blame them, but as I‚Äôm hunched in the airplane bathroom, I have to ask if they‚Äôd be willing to take it even further. What separates the weak from the strong, what demonstrates drive and grit and an appreciation for accomplishments: what would they *really* be willing to do for it?  

Last month the head of the firm invited me on a business trip with a wink, saying it was important for me to observe my superiors and to expect the unexpected in our field. According to Rayburn, one of the junior partners, once a month all three senior partners (Eagle, Adams, and Teague) as well as a handful of hopefuls would fly to east Asia to meet with one of our biggest accounts based in Kyoto. I‚Äôd picked up early on that they would be out of office for at least part of the workday on those Fridays and Mondays, stretching it out as long as possible when there was a long weekend. I figured they were worn out from the jet lag and since things seemed to be getting done remotely without a hiccup, I didn‚Äôt think much of it beyond, ‚Äúwow, lucky bastards‚Äù. I was too busy working late into the evening, sometimes close to midnight ensuring perfection in whatever I submitted. Over the years I guess it stood out because I‚Äôd never known another associate to be invited; I decided to keep it under my hat, both to prevent anyone from jeopardizing my future partnership or asking me questions I didn‚Äôt feel like answering. 

I didn‚Äôt have to think twice before telling Rayburn that I would go, by lunch that afternoon he‚Äôd had Claire, our head receptionist, send me my plane ticket confirmation code as well as an itinerary with instructions. It looked like a three day, four night excursion with two obligations set in stone: meet with our Kyoto client on Friday afternoon, and join the group at a private airport Saturday evening for dinner to presumably celebrate with them. I saw that I‚Äôd have most of the day on Saturday open and Claire had included a list of restaurants, tea shops, and small museums to occupy the time. I let her know I‚Äôd received everything and texted my live-in girlfriend, Hailey, that I‚Äôd be gone Thursday through Monday morning the next week. She asked if there was a companion pass and I said no -- I probably could have gotten one but I really didn‚Äôt want to push my luck with the bosses by asking for extra stuff on my first trip. In hindsight I should have found a way to bring someone in my corner, and not just because Hailey was pretending to pout over not going.

I arrived at the airport at 5 AM, the recommended two hours before departure, and was the first one at our gate. After going through security and grabbing a latte from Starbucks I saw Rayburn approaching. He was trailed by Adams first, the newest senior partner on the roster who had been included on these trips since around the time I was first hired. He was tall with tan skin and sun bleached ginger hair, which indicated a lot of time at the golf course and not a lot of sunscreen. Eagle and Teague followed, each leisurely pulling a rolling suitcase on either side of the other. Teague was the founder of the firm and had also graduated from Georgetown twenty-odd years before I did, he was a short man with a serious face and a stiff silver combover. Eagle wasn‚Äôt much younger than Teague, they‚Äôd met on an international law trip when they were both in school, but he looked at least a decade his junior. He was the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the firm with a strong jaw, salt and pepper hair that remained surprisingly full and combed into a sort of grown out crew cut, and piercing blue eyes. Behind them were Claire and one of the interns from the first floor, I think her name was Rebecca. She couldn‚Äôt have been over 23 and seemed on the quiet side, although the looks Eagle kept sneaking her way indicated that she might go far with us if she played her cards right. Both women were pulling a cart with several carry ons, most of which were already pink tagged. 

Rayburn, a tall, thin man with almost alarmingly white teeth and a voice suited better to radio than the courthouse, approached me and offered a warm handshake, expressing gratitude that I‚Äôd taken them up on the offer. I realized that they were all wearing comfortable lounge clothing while I‚Äôd put together my suit the night before, I was slightly embarrassed but felt a little better as the gate began filling with people in all manners of dress. I stood out a little less. We boarded priority, and took our seats in First Class. I expected to doze off until we hit LAX so I grabbed the bottle of Ativan I had left over from a trip to Barcelona the summer before. Rayburn, who was seated to my right in the aisle seat, quickly yet smoothly grabbed the bottle from my hand and stuffed it back into my bag. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna want a clear head, save these for getting to sleep when we get there,‚Äù he advised. He was smiling like they‚Äôd planned something I didn‚Äôt have the option of sleeping through so I didn‚Äôt object, and as the plane went into taxi and took off the conversation became a little more fluid. I did wind up dozing off for awhile since I was running on two hours of sleep, but no one seemed bothered. 

After one layover, a bumpy ride into Kansai Airport, and a train into Kyoto, my body was completely out of sync. It was somehow early Friday afternoon already. I just wanted to sleep but I knew we had to unpack and get ready to meet with the team from Kyoto in two hours. I picked up what looked to be an energy drink from one of the vending machines in the hotel lobby and cleaned myself up. Hailey had pressed and packed two other suits, which was a godsend with how wrinkled and grimy my current one was from the trip. 

The meeting on Friday was fairly dry, the only thing I was able to discern was that the client seemed happy at the end and I‚Äôd had no idea that Claire was fluent in Japanese as she provided translation throughout. That explained why she was with us, aside from being a pack mule, I thought. 

Teague pulled me aside after the meeting and made small talk as we made our way to the taxi bay. He asked which extracurriculars I‚Äôd done in school, a little about Hailey and my parents, the kind of stuff that‚Äôs personal without quite being intrusive. I took his interest as yet another positive sign. 

‚ÄúAre you an adventurous eater?‚Äù he asked, a smile starting to form around the corners of his mouth. 

‚ÄúI did eat fried alligator when I visited my girlfriend‚Äôs family in Louisiana,‚Äù I offered, wanting to give him a satisfactory answer without actually grossing the man out. I seemed to have succeeded, as he invited me to join he, Claire, and Eagle at a tiny cafe that evening. Again, I arrived first, but it didn‚Äôt take the rest of the group long to catch up. Our table was already reserved so there wasn‚Äôt the awkward text game to find out who had arrived and was seated where. 

‚ÄúDid you know Adams is terminal? Stage four melanoma, you‚Äôd never know it looking at him,‚Äù Eagle asked me after situating himself next to me at our table. My silence must have surprised him, as he laughed himself off and reassured me that nothing went beyond the table when dining with he and Teague. 

‚ÄúNo...I can‚Äôt say I did. He seems fine, I‚Äôm surprised to hear it.‚Äù I wanted to acknowledge the point without seeming ghoulish or giving the impression that my first thought was who would be taking his place.

‚ÄúYeah, the wife has him on some raw vegan diet that seems to be slowing the progress down, but he‚Äôs been opting out of our dinners ever since the diagnosis. We‚Äôve been paying attention to you, you know. You‚Äôre organized, punctual, and have yet to make an ass of yourself in front of a client. But I could say that about most of the people we hire, there‚Äôs a reason we only take the best of the best to the top.‚Äù Eagle was briefly interrupted by the arrival of a wooden tea preparation box. Watching the green powder so carefully measured out was almost hypnotizing, and I started to realize that I was ‚Äúgetting‚Äù this whole international dining thing now. 

‚ÄúWe accessed your personal statements from applying to law schools, as we do with all prospective employees. You‚Äôve climbed quite a bit higher than your peers, yeah?‚Äù he continued. 

I was shocked for a nanosecond before plastering a content, jovial look on my face and inviting him to continue. I thought Teague was asking me personal questions on our way to the taxi but this felt like a full on violation. What I‚Äôd written about years ago...growing up in a trailer park in Nebraska, one of four siblings to a single mother, being diagnosed with Asperger‚Äôs in middle school, the ugly past I‚Äòd gotten so accustomed to masking was all there. 

‚ÄúWell, yeah. I‚Äôm still friends on Facebook with a few of them but I‚Äôm the only one who bothered to move out of the midwest.‚Äù I left out the part where my siblings had all cut ties upon my moving to DC, still content to live in the same dilapidated house as my mother. She tried to keep a connection between us and I could make occasional calls from Hailey‚Äôs phone without being intercepted, but it was never long before she had to sprint to take care of one of their toddlers who was trying to open the oven door or lock themselves in the bathroom. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here with us, you‚Äôre courageous. You‚Äôre self-reliant. And that‚Äôs why all of this is a part of your experience, you‚Äôve earned it.‚Äù Right on cue, our server presented us with several plates containing foods I‚Äôd heard of but never tried: bird‚Äôs nest soup, a still-writhing octopus, sea urchin, and plenty of other delicacies I couldn‚Äôt identify or pronounce. I decided to punctuate Eagle‚Äôs statement by reaching for the octopus. It felt sticky going down my throat, I could feel some writhing that almost made me nauseous, but I managed to shift the focus away and saw him also smiling approvingly. 

‚ÄúAnd that, my man, is why you‚Äôre coming with us tomorrow evening. Meet us at the private airstrip at 16:00, I‚Äôll send a taxi for you so you don‚Äôt have to worry about finding the place.‚Äù

By the time the meal was over I felt like I wouldn‚Äôt need to eat for weeks. I took one of the Ativan upon returning to the hotel and was knocked out until my alarm started blaring at me the next morning. It was 8 AM, so I‚Äôd gotten a solid eight hours but it certainly didn‚Äôt feel like it. I tried to get my energy levels up by walking around town; despite the rain, it was a gorgeous city. After the previous night‚Äôs smorgasbord and figuring I was in for another in a few hours, I settled on grabbing a light lunch downtown. I took pictures to send to Hailey and a few more for my Instagram story; is it even a trip if it‚Äôs not instagrammable?

The taxi was waiting for me as promised when I exited the hotel at 3 PM, I confirmed my name with the driver before hopping in. His windows were tinted unusually dark, especially for the dreary weather so my vision of what we passed was limited. I was a little disappointed, but we arrived at the single terminal on an unmarked airstrip before I felt like asking to roll it down. 

I saw Eagle and Teague straight away, and Rayburn‚Äôs height made him visible as he quickly approached me. They were all wearing suits, so at least I wasn‚Äôt overdressed this time. Rayburn led me to the group and pointed at a private jet ready to board. 

‚ÄúJust look at her! Definitely an upgrade from last time, sometimes we just need a little privacy to conclude our visits,‚Äù he said. We boarded, I tried saying a quick hello to the stern faced captain but he remained unmoved. I hoped I hadn‚Äôt made a mistake before turning my head to take in the luxury around me: smooth leather seats, tables with champagne ready to be poured, and even four glowing pod-looking things later revealed to be beds. 

Teague gestured for me to sit in the seat across from him, which is when the questions began. I was a little glad I‚Äôd already gotten the shock of divulging personal information, but they went in a different direction this time. 

‚ÄúNow that it‚Äôs just the core team with us, I‚Äôd like to extend a proposal for you.‚Äù I steadied my breath and leaned in for him to continue.

‚ÄúYou know the deal with Adams. We‚Äôre guessing he‚Äôs got three months left with us. How would you feel about taking his place after the new year?‚Äù Teague asked, as if he wanted to know what I thought of a paint sample for the office. 

‚ÄúI would be beyond honored, sir. I hope I can continue to impress you‚Ä¶‚Äù I said before Teague cut me off, trying to appear composed and not visualizing what an extra zero on my salary line would mean for Hailey and I. We could buy a house, ditch the studio apartment we‚Äôd been sharing for two years, maybe even have kids. I could pay off my student loans. I could have a real life.

‚ÄúYou can accept the job once you‚Äôve shared a meal with us tonight and had time to digest the idea.‚Äù I nodded and tried to hold in a smile. Compared to last night this couldn‚Äôt be that different, and it wasn‚Äôt like it was out of the ordinary to take a plane to another area of an island nation, especially if you had the money to burn. 

The rest of the flight was surprisingly quiet, we were in the air for about two hours. I saw Rayburn looking at me stiffly, only for him to flash that wolf‚Äôs grin at me when he‚Äôd notice me looking back. As the plane descended I felt my stomach start to rumble, whether out of hunger or anxiety I wasn‚Äôt sure. 

We touched down and as I walked down the steps into the new outdoor air I felt how much warmer it was. Wherever they‚Äôd taken me, we didn‚Äôt appear to be in Japan anymore. This was what I remembered the landscape looking like from pictures of the Philippines I‚Äôd seen over the years, but there was no way we could have gone that far in two hours. Then again, I‚Äôd never been in a private jet before, it was pointless wondering where we were when I couldn‚Äôt read the language anywhere. We definitely weren‚Äôt in Japan anymore. 

During the drive from the airstrip to the small town we were destined, I saw coastline in every direction. We had to be on a small island somewhere in the South Pacific. 

The sun was still blazing and our driver, who appeared to be a professional chauffeur rather than your run-of-the-mill cabbie, pulled up to a large house on stilts, smoke sometimes wafting our way that I could taste on the roof of my mouth. It wasn‚Äôt the unpleasant kind of smoke, it was like being at an older barbecue joint tasting the phantasmic notes of cherry, honey, and something I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on. 

I was led through the front gate and onto the property with the rest of the group and several house staff that appeared to be in military uniform. Once we entered the house, it felt like I‚Äôd been transported a hundred years backward into history and the home of a world adventurer. Trophies from safaris, doubtlessly illegal, hung on the walls. I started to notice that each room we passed had a slightly different theme, after passing the fourth room that appeared to be Nazi haven inspired, I was ushered into the dining room. Dimly lit with shining mahogany on seemingly every surface, I made my way around and was firmly planted down into my seat. I saw my name on a place card in front of me, they must have recognized me coming in. As interesting as the home was, something had been feeling off since we entered the property. I blamed my anxiety again and regretted not asking for a drink on the plane to calm my nerves. There was a stillness in the air as my eyes adjusted and I started to take in the other faces filling the room. There were no windows or curtains.

There were two doors, one toward the back and the other we‚Äôd entered from. Several people at the table looked vaguely familiar but more than likely from the news or flipping through magazines at the doctor‚Äôs office than anyone I‚Äôd met in my day to day life. 

There was an older man with a long beard in white linen and a keffiyeh directly across from me, flanked by a blonde woman in a dark purple designer dress. It was hard to guess her age, based on her hands when she‚Äôd reach for her glass she must have been in her 50s but everywhere else couldn‚Äôt have been more than 40. On the man‚Äôs left side was like something cut out of a WWII film, a young man in a British air force uniform sat upright and expectant. The rest of the table featured an equally quizzical mix of people, from the woman appearing to be on her fourth incarnation of Liza Minelli to the three Korean men in white business suits on the far end of the table from me. I heard a clink behind me. 

‚ÄúI am so very pleased to see you all here,‚Äù a deep yet soft voice echoed from the glass behind me. A short, pudgy, swarthy man lowered his wine glass and cleared his throat.

‚ÄúAs you will have read in the invitation, I have prepared something especially innovative for such an elite group of connoisseurs. For those of you who have not attended before, you need only know three rules about dining in my home.‚Äù I tried to turn to meet the man‚Äôs gaze but he was focused at some point above my head.

‚ÄúFirstly, no one is to speak while food is being served or consumed. Secondly, once the meal commences, the doors will be locked and no one is to leave until we‚Äôve all concluded. Third, any mention of this location outside of this property is punishable by death,‚Äù the last of which garnered a few light laughs from several attendants. 

‚ÄúI will give you all a moment to freshen up. The doors will lock in 15 minutes. Please, for the courtesy of our guests, arrive back in your seat before.‚Äù

I decided to wash my hands and swish my mouth with some water, I was getting increasingly uneasy and jittery. I‚Äôd only sipped on the water that was served, wine glasses were out but had yet to be filled. It‚Äôs just a lot to take in, I told myself. All I had to do was finish this silent dinner and the job would be mine. I couldn‚Äôt wait to tell Hailey, but since we‚Äôd handed over all personal items including our phones upon entry, I couldn‚Äôt text her to tell her. It would have to wait. 

I heard something groan when I took a step back to look at the mirror. I looked behind me and took notice of the cabinets on the other side of the restroom. It almost sounded like an animal had gotten stuck inside, I figured it was the man‚Äôs pet cat. I went to open it and was greeted with wide, terrified eyes. A young woman stared back at me, grasping something against her chest. I leaned down to get a better look, scarcely believing my eyes.

She held up a finger to her lips as I was about to ask if she was okay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell! Don‚Äôt tell!‚Äù she repeated in a panicked whisper before pulling the cabinet door back. I heard something scratching on the other side and when I tried to open it again, I felt the tension of something having been wrapped around the lock. 

Unsure of what to do, I made my way back to the dining room as to not get locked in this house apart from my colleagues. Whatever I just saw wasn‚Äôt my business, I‚Äôd gotten used to thinking that way working at the firm. Unless it pertains to the business at hand and the end goal, it wasn‚Äôt mine to question. That didn‚Äôt make me feel any better about it or ease the tension that was quickly building and doubling over on itself. 

When I returned to my seat I felt like everyone was looking at me and could see the shock on my face, like I was giving something away without meaning to. One thing I‚Äôd picked up on over the last hour: these are not people you want to piss off. I took a sip of wine, as it had been poured in my absence, hoping it would calm my nerves.

The first course was a clear soup, I couldn‚Äôt tell what it was composed of. It was like consomme but with an earthier taste, almost gamey. The second was a salad with something that looked like shaved carpaccio, but was much redder and sliced thinner than I‚Äôd ever seen. A few other small dishes came out of the kitchen and were passed around; a fresh spring roll, dumplings, something resembling antipasto, but it all had that same indecipherable tone despite the use of ingredients I could already identify. It was starting to feel like a game -- if I guess the secret ingredient, do I win a prize? 

That was when our host returned from the back doors beaming with a covered dish on a cart.

‚ÄúWhat I know you‚Äôve all been waiting for...cover your faces from God and give your thanks.‚Äù One of the kitchen staff circled the table, handing us each a fresh napkin. The others proceeded to nod their heads and cover their faces, forming a tent over their plate. I did the same. 

Slid under my napkin was a dish that looked like pulled pork, and the smokey smell from when we arrived encompassed my face. There was a slaw on the side, not too dissimilar from what my aunt in North Carolina makes when we go visit. If I came all this way to be ‚Äúimpressed‚Äù by a plate of barbecue, I could pull that off. I brought some of the meat to my mouth.

It had the same earthy, gamey taste as the other dishes, but there was something else there. Metallic yet sweet, I knew it was familiar but I couldn‚Äôt place it. I gave it another bite, and another, but despite the perfect texture and flavor I could not name what was so different. Once the clinking of utensils on china subsided, our host began to speak.

‚ÄúAnd as we end this meal, we give thanks to those who sacrificed so much to give us a taste of life.‚Äù My napkin was pulled back.

In front of me, on the large metal platter, was a pile of more of the barbecue. What got my attention was the decapitated head of a young woman, very similar looking to the face I‚Äôd seen in the cabinet in the bathroom. Only this one was obviously dead with her eyes rolled back into their sockets and an apple stuck in her mouth. The others began reaching with their fingers for more of the barbecue, abandoning all pretense of etiquette to stuff it into their mouths as quickly as possible. Our host was beaming, he looked as though he‚Äôd won a major victory for humankind.

My senses wouldn‚Äôt allow me to compute until I caught Claire gazing at me steadily. I knew she was with us but I hadn‚Äôt registered her presence in such an alien environment until now. Her face said it all: blend in, or else. She continued to stare at me, not blinking, as she sipped her wine until I took another bite. I wouldn‚Äôt have felt my stomach lurch so badly if I didn‚Äôt also detect the silent stare from behind the lids of the head on the table in front of me. 

We finished our meal in silence and I managed to get three or four more bites down, enough to not raise suspicion. I knew this wasn‚Äôt just about the job anymore, this was a matter of life and death both for me and whoever was trapped in this labyrinth not protected by status or money. Once our plates were taken, the doors were unlocked and we were led to a large deck overlooking the beach. Several men lit cigars and began conversing as though we‚Äôd just had a few sandwiches, not seeming to think about the remains of the corpse we‚Äôd left. I quickly pushed it out of my head and grabbed a champagne glass from one of the servers passing through, I felt Eagle‚Äôs hand on my shoulder as he turned me around to face him. 

‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù He was testing me, I knew it immediately. He was smiling but his eyes were intent on taking me in. 

‚ÄúI admit it was...surprising.‚Äù I settled on that. Eagle laughed and shook my shoulder before letting go. 

‚ÄúSounds like you just need to get used to it! Once a month should do the trick.‚Äù He smiled even wider, hinting at me. Then it clicked. He wanted me to come back with them. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôd been doing every month I was working overtime, taking care of the mundane shit they couldn‚Äôt be bothered with. If I wanted to strike that bargain, now was the time to consider it. 

These people were already dead and thoroughly seasoned, it wasn‚Äôt like I knew before I‚Äôd chowed down. Was it really that bad, especially if other people kept coming back? It wasn‚Äôt just me, there were around a dozen more of us, all of whom looked extremely satisfied and much more relaxed than when we began the meal.    

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a bus, if you could even call it that, coming up the back entrance to the house. About ten people were unloaded, several were obviously related and traveling together. The staff lead them into a nondescript door that led to a basement not visible from the front of the house. Flashbacks of footage from slaughterhouse videos came to mind and I practically had to choke down my need to vomit. I washed it down with another sip of champagne, feeling disgusted with myself and trapped. 

‚ÄúTalk to Teague when we board later. He‚Äôll give you the terms. I do hope you‚Äôll accept.‚Äù Eagle came back into my field of vision, and gave my shoulder a final shake before departing to talk with the others. The rest of the evening was a blur, I remember being driven somewhere and climbing back on the plane. I wasn‚Äôt drunk, just completely terrified both with the situation and with myself. 

I‚Äôm in the lavatory of the plane typing this out, I‚Äôll post when we land so it doesn‚Äôt get intercepted by the on board wifi. Accepting this job would undoubtedly change my life, I could move my mom out of that disgusting trailer park. She could come and live with Hailey and I as I would be able to afford a much bigger house, with room for the family we wanted to grow but didn‚Äôt have the means for over the last couple of years. All that, doing the fraction of the work I did now, for life as long as I could dedicate one weekend a month to participating in...a unique dining experience? It‚Äôs not like anyone knows or needs to find out. Is one more mouth to feed really that bad? 

What would you do for the chance to live the life you deserve?"

eocaog,3,2020-01-13,Community College Student - Need Guidance on Resume for Math &amp; Statistics Research Internship,UndefinedSlope,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/eocaog/community_college_student_need_guidance_on_resume/,"Good evening everyone.

This is the first internship that I'm applying to, so I need a little guidance. I'm a second year community college student. After this current spring semester I will have completed my associates degree with (hopefully) a 3.95 GPA assuming I get A's this semester which should be doable. After which I will be transferring to a state university that has a locally renowned STEM program. I have already been accepted, so I'm pretty excited about that.

I'm a little insecure with me being a community college student and having to compete with applicants who are actual university students. Call it impostor syndrome if you will, but everyone always tells me that there is a stigma against community college students.

Regarding the actual internship, it's at a local pharmaceutical company looking for a ""Student Worker - Mathematical/Statistical Research""

From their website:

&gt;Students will be responsible for projects involving statistical analysis, related data review and programming tasks or statistical research.

Anyways, I've linked my resume. I would really appreciate any guidance that you can give me, especially if you have experience in the STEM or programming fields, but really any kind of critique will be helpful.

Thank you!"
eocckl,4,2020-01-13,Accidentally burned bridge at company where I did my best work. Should I still put it in my portfolio?,latenightt,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eocckl/accidentally_burned_bridge_at_company_where_i_did/,"TL;DR - worried my boss will be a bad reference because I had mental health issues and didn't know how to communicate it nor tell him I couldn't work. So I kind of got fired, but all my best work was at that company. Unsure if I should use that work at all in my portfolio now.

---

I did a user experience design internship during the summer of my senior year in college. I did great design work in a small startup. I mainly worked very independently with my boss, who was the Chief Experience Design Officer. He was impressed by work and attitude, so he asked me to continue designing for the company after summer. I accepted.

However, school came into full swing, and I experienced an intense mental breakdown. A lot in my life kind of fell apart because I bit off more than I could chew. Combined with my boss giving me a *very* vague design task, taking off for 2 weeks, and not giving great responses over Slack... I barely did any work. And he paid me a stipend, so I underperformed for what he paid and expected. It is largely my fault, but also mental health shit happens. I learned my lessons and have matured, as shown in future jobs.

I felt bad about it and offered to give back the stipend, but he refused. However, we did sit down and he formally let me go because I didn't produce anything. It ended professionally; they recognized that school was probably wearing on me, and this had happened to another employee before, and sometimes they hire them right back later. Because it can be a taboo, I didn't explain the full extent of the breakdown and how out of character it was for me. So I'm worried I left a terrible impression.

I'm much better now. I take care of my mental health and don't stretch myself too thin. I want to put that startup work in my portfolio, but I'm scared that a future employer might call my old boss, and my boss will tell them how unreliable I am. Even though it was a health issue that I didn't feel comfortable disclosing, and even though I'm much healthier now.

What should I do? Should I reach out to my old boss to talk to him about it? Should I avoid putting that work on my portfolio? Tell my future employer up front what happened?"

I graduated last April with a diploma in computer systems development. I used the languages C#, Java, Swift, HTML, CSS, SQL, Oracle SQL and also became familiar with software testing and systems design. Since graduating I haven't been able to find anywhere and have been applying. In August I had two interviews for two positions and at one I got to the technical test and I failed it since I wasn't able to build an entire CRUD application in an hour. I also haven't had a job since last January which was at a hardware store. Since I left it to focus on my last semester of school where I worked for an actual client and built an application for them. I also have no experience in any internships, but the closest I have to any was my last semester's main course.

What can I do to make myself stand out in applications and be able to get to the interview stage? What options do I have to get there? I'm confident I can pass technical tests from a potential employer unlike the one before.

I have also applied to go back to school in September to get the bachelor's degree that follows my diploma. The degree has an internship requirement for its second year to get the degree.

One last thing, should I add an image of my resume for review to see what I can change? I can answer any questions for clarification on what I mean. Thank you for your help!

Don't know if this matters, this is all in the Canadian job market."

I know I made the wrong choice going to uni and I'm not even sure if CS is for me, but I've spent so much money and time on my degree that I'd like to at least get a job out of it.

I am new to reddit, I've been told there is a lot of knowledge that is shared here! So I am hoping you can all help me out!

I am currently exploring the opportunity of moving to the UK or Europe in the future.

A little bit about myself that may be relevant. I am currently a 3rd Chemical Engineering student studying at a Canadian University with concentrations in Petroleum and Mineral Processing. I am going on a 16-month Engineering internship starting in May 2020 where I will gain relevant experience and further develop skills and knowledge in my field. After my internship I will return to school to finish my final year of study. I am wishing to move to the UK preferably, but would also consider Europe, shortly after the completion of my study.

However, I am interested in what would make it easier to get a job in the UK? For instance, would it be easier for me to move to the UK on a Youth Mobility Visa and then apply? Or should I try to secure a job before I move?

I am wishing to do engineering work in the UK, preferably somewhere in the energy sector as that is my area of study, and already know how the professional registration works there, and degree accreditation, so that is not a question in this form. I am also in contact with a professional advisor on this situation. If relevant, I plan on getting Interim registration that will indicate that I am working towards CEng registration in the UK, so this should help in the matter.

Also possibly relevant: I am also in the process of obtaining my Hungarian Citizenship through ancestry, so I should have European citizenship before my final year of study. I know this may not be very helpful if for employment in the UK if Brexit goes through, but should be helpful if I pursue a career path in Europe.

Is there anything that employers look for, or perhaps prefer, when looking to hire international employees?

Hoping you guys can give me some good information, advice and/or insight on this topic, and please share any similar personal experiences!

Thank you! :)"

I‚Äôm your host, Bobby Roswell, and this is the Game of Aces! I would like to apologize for any delays; our interns have been rather unproductive, but don‚Äôt worry. We disposed of them. After all, what are we (not) paying them for if they refuse to do their jobs?

For those of you just tuning in, [here‚Äôs a recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ekpcus/game_of_aces/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf):Our four protagonists have found themselves in an abandoned warehouse in the desert. They have two options to escape: a ride a dune buggy or take a walk through the sewers. They were also given a loaded revolver to create conflict between contestants and to protect themselves against‚Ä¶ well, you‚Äôll see.

Anyway, without further ado let‚Äôs dive right into those numbers! Last week, you voted for the path our contestants must take, and which one of our shady characters would be trusted with the revolver.

For the path our votes were fairly evenly split, but in the end the sewers managed to edge out the dunes. Great choice! And by that I mean terrible choice! The sewers will be dark, disgusting, and filled with terror. I can‚Äôt wait to see how our contestants respond to the little surprise we have cooked up for them‚Ä¶

On the other hand, you chose to give the gun to Lane. Very well played; I was secretly hoping for Molly to get it but I guess I can never have what I want around here, can I? Don‚Äôt worry though, Lane is responsible and level headed. I‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt end up killing anybody. Or getting killed.

In fact, because of her level headed-ness and interesting perspective, we have chosen Lane as our perspective for today. Enjoy the show!

&gt;Begin Transmission: LANE

‚ÄúTHE VIEWERS HAVE MADE THEIR DECISIONS‚Äù the voice screeches from inside my head, ‚ÄúYOU ARE TO TAKE THE SEWERS. LANE GETS THE PISTOL.‚Äù

I massage my temples, fighting back the headache that‚Äôs been throbbing since I woke up. William sighs in exasperation, thrusting the revolver in my direction.

‚ÄúTake it,‚Äù he hisses, ‚Äúbut I swear to god, Lane, I better not regret this.‚Äù

Molly snickers, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a choice. Viewers picked Lane. Suck it up.‚Äù

William mutters something under his breath and gives her the finger.

Earl paces back and forth a few strides before turning to face the rest of us.

‚ÄúI guess we have to open those doors,‚Äù he declares as if he has some control over anything.

The four of us creep over to the double doors set solidly into the earth. With a tentative yank, Earl pulls them both wide open.

Instantly, a disgusting odor wafts out from the passage way. Molly makes a face. I can‚Äôt blame her.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù William mocks, relishing in Molly‚Äôs disgust, ‚ÄúThe viewers chose it.‚Äù 

He pauses for a moment, then steps through the threshold onto the steps leading down into the earth. Earl follows close behind. Molly pauses for a second longer, looking at me irately. 

‚ÄúListen, I wouldn‚Äôt have chosen it either,‚Äù I say, tucking my revolver into my blouse and heading down.

William stands at the bottom of the steps, holding a torch in one hand. Several more are fastened to the wall; I grab one just to be safe. Beyond him, Earl stands shin deep in murky greenish water. The steps disappear completely, but the passage continues far beyond the light of Will‚Äôs torch.

‚ÄúI found the source of the smell,‚Äù Earl says, pointing to the sludge and forcing a smile, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better get used to this. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be a long walk.‚Äù

Molly lets out a snort of disgust.

William takes the lead, sloshing through the brackish water. Fortunately, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be actually sewage. Unfortunately, whatever it is isn‚Äôt that much better. Aside from the occasional complaint from Molly, we trudge one silence. 

&gt;Pause Transmission

Hello again, it‚Äôs me, your host, Bobby Roswell! 

Our production crew is inserting a slight pause here as our technicians fast forward the footage slightly. Because, really, who wants to watch two hours of Lane walking through water and contemplating life while Molly complains in the background? If you do, that will be on channel 12 for an added fee.

Instead, you get to spend time with me! It‚Äôs great! You get to hang out with your favorite TV personality, and I get to exposit information in the form of classified government documents. Wonderful! Now, let‚Äôs see, what article will it be today?

File 009807: Reanimation.

While both illegal and unethical, reanimation of corpses does offer some rather interesting practical uses in medicine. Of course, the process of medical reanimation is a rather finicky one. The cadaver must be fresh; any signs of significant decay will inhibit the activation and growth of [redacted]. Once the subject has been secured, inject twelve cubic centimeters of [redacted] directly into their bloodstream. Do not stimulate blood flow, [redacted] should do this on its own. Within twelve hours, the subject should have regained a pulse and forms of lower brain activity. During this stage, they are highly impressionable. Use of either neural implants (see: File 100984) or direct human to human contact can ‚Äúreprogram‚Äù subjects to behave in almost any way. Of course, the ethical dilemmas this present-

I have just been given the green light by the technical crew to continue with the show. I‚Äôm sure none of you cared about the ethics of it all, anyways. I certainly don‚Äôt.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù says Earl slowly, ‚Äúwhat did you guys do before‚Ä¶ all this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù growls William, still wading at the front, ‚Äúdoes that have to do with anything happening right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù says Earl, slightly hurt, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to pass the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right,‚Äù I chime in, cringing as my voice echoes in the tunnel, ‚ÄúI was a teacher. Loved my job. Loved the kids. Sure, it was a pain in the rear sometimes, the workload, the constant certifications and re-certifications, the low pay. I really loved it though, I really did, right up until‚Ä¶‚Äù

My head throbs suddenly, cutting me off mid -sentence.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Demands Molly.

‚ÄúI-I can‚Äôt remember,‚Äù I stammer, ‚ÄúSomething happened and I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I couldn‚Äôt bear to‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Ä¶‚Äù

The pain in my head begins to pulse. The memories are clearly hidden, locked away somewhere. Tears well up in my eyes.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt remember,‚Äù I gasp.

Earl rushes to my side, steadying me. My legs feel weak. 

‚ÄúI was a doctor,‚Äù he says, filling the silence, ‚Äúa surgeon. A good one too, before my arthritis set in. I guess I really should just settle down somewhere and retire.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout as far from it as you can get here, old man,‚Äù William jokes, but the humor is dead in his voice, ‚ÄúI was a‚Ä¶ freeloader, I guess. Of sorts. Did odd jobs around town, construction and stuff. It wasn‚Äôt much-‚Äú

‚ÄúGUYS!‚Äù Molly exclaims, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a door.‚Äù

She isn‚Äôt kidding. The tunnel ends less than fifty meters away in a pair of massive metal doors, similar to the ones at the entrance to the tunnel. 

William started, ‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre finally getting out of th-‚Äú

Something shifts in the water between us and the door. We all jump back, even Will. Molly slams into me, knocking my torch to the ground.

The thing rises. It looks like a girl. It‚Äôs wearing a tattered hoodie, soaked in the water it must‚Äôve laid in for hours. Strands of hair stick to its face, looping around eyes that are alive but not. A thin stream of black liquid trickles from its mouth. It‚Äôs neck appears to have been slashed. 

‚ÄúHOLY SHIT! RUN!‚Äù screams Will.

We sprint away from the creature; I can hear it‚Äôs wet footfalls slosh begins us.

‚ÄúLane!‚Äù cries Earl, ‚ÄúThe Revolver!‚Äù

I stop, whipping it out. It‚Äôs weight is comforting in my shaking hand. I turn, planting my feet and trying to steady myself. Squinting in the dim light of William‚Äôs torch, I am barely able to make out the shape of the wall.

Slosh.

Slosh.

I can hear it wading closer to us. Earl places a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúLane,‚Äù he says in a forcefully calm tone.

It steps into the light.

The eyes. The cheeks. The lips. The nose. My head is screaming. Screaming so loud.

‚ÄúLANE!‚Äù teams Earl, shaking my shoulder.

The creature rushes at us. I level the gun. My head screams louder. 

‚ÄúLANE!‚Äù he yells again.

I can‚Äôt shoot.

The thing slams into me. I fall into my back. The water splashes up around me, getting in my eyes and soaking me in its filth. The revolver lands somewhere nearby. 

I wait for the end, or whatever is coming.

Instead, the creature springs away from me, instead focusing on a new target. 

William.

Caught mid stride, he collapses under its weight. His torch hits the water. Everything goes dark. There‚Äôs scream; I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs Williams or the creatures. 

BANG

Earl stands over me, holding the revolver in his steady hands. The creature screams and dashes off into the dark, heading away from the exit. 

‚ÄúIt fuckin‚Äô bit me!‚Äù yells William, ‚Äúdid you hit the little shit?‚Äù

Earl doesn‚Äôt respond. He doesn‚Äôt lower the gun, either.

‚ÄúEarl,‚Äù I say, holding back tears, ‚ÄúI knew her. I must‚Äôve knew that thing. Before they took my memory. I‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt shoot her.‚Äù

Earl pauses.

‚ÄúWe should get moving before it comes back.‚Äù He murmurs.

The four of us limp up to the door. A heavy padlock sits holding it shut. A small metal box sits in the water.

‚ÄúOh Goody!‚Äù yells the disembodied voice of Bobby Roswell, coming from a speaker hidden in the walls, ‚Äúyou managed to survive! I‚Äôm rather impressed. Of course, you should probably get that shoulder checked out, William. The black liquid dripping from our friend‚Äôs mouth definitely wasn‚Äôt harmless. She bit you, and now it‚Äôs in your veins. It would be a shame if it was a neurotoxin that caused you to die a slow and painful death.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck off‚Äù mutters Will, grimacing.

‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôre probably wondering: how do we get through that door. It‚Äôs simple. Inside the box is a key‚Ä¶ just kidding. Do you actually think we‚Äôre nice? What the hell gave you that impression?

‚Äú Each one of you has a key surgically implanted slightly below your left kidney. Inside the box is a scalpel. One of you is going to have to take the scalpel and dig it out.

‚ÄúThe other useful item in there is a needle full of a highly classified regenerative medicine that might be stolen from the government (like the majority of the tech on our show). As you would expect, it makes the body heal faster than natural. There are so many uses for it; it can heal incisions, cure neurotoxins, or even restore memories to lobotomized game show contestants. Nifty!‚Äù

‚ÄúI need the serum‚Äù says William immediately, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not planning on dying down here.‚Äù

I nod in agreement, but Earl interjects.

‚ÄúWhoever we cut should get it. It‚Äôll be almost impossible to make a clean cut in this light, and I can guarantee it‚Äôll get infected from the water,‚Äù he says, pausing to think, ‚ÄúI can attempt the incision. My hands are a bit stiff, but I‚Äôm trained for it and-‚Äú

‚ÄúI can do it.‚Äù I say, at almost a whisper, ‚ÄúI have steady hands and took first aid as part of my teacher training, and if you guide me, Earl-‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it,‚Äù says Will, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm good with knives.‚Äù

We stare at him for a moment. He smirks.

With no warning, Bobby Roswell‚Äôs voice returns. 

‚ÄúOne more thing. The viewers are deciding who cuts, who gets cut, who gets the serum, etc. I hope you trust them with your lives, because oooh boy you better hope they choose well. Disobey them, you die. Same ol‚Äô same ol‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit‚Äù mutters Will.

I've been a huge follower of this subreddit, of WSO, of other forums, and I've tried to take to heart all of the advice that's given about finding a job. However, I'm completely lost on what to do because despite trying my best, I'm struggling to (1) get interviews, and (2) pass the interviews.


Some backstory, I'm a math major from a target school and a math finance masters from a non-target. I really want to break into a prop trading shop or a hedge fund in a junior quant trader role. I interviewed at these places heavily when I was at my target and managed to get a fair number of interviews, but had a lot of trouble passing because I am deaf. Mainly, it was hard for me to understand what interviewers said on the phone/Skype, especially when people have an accent. I also just struggled speaking on the phone in general. I didn't get any internships all four years of college and struggled with finding a full-time job, so ended up going to a non-target for a Math Finance degree. I ran into the same issue -- struggled in all my phone and Skype interviews. BUT, I was able to have two on-site interviews with companies that were willing to bring me in. I felt I was really able to shine in both technical questions and behavioral interviews and was able to get an internship at a regional bank and, later, a full-time offer at a different bank where I now work. However the full-time role that I landed was a risk management quant that's only tangentially related to trading in the sense that I review different trading models. Right now, I have been working full-time for 3 years in my risk quant role. 


I know that it's tough to break into prop trading/hedge funds, but I really want to try and go for my dream. I really feel that I have more to offer than people who just graduated from college, given the breadth of experience I have so far with different asset classes, and projects that I've done with interesting data. I feel like I would have a lot to talk about in the interview. I also truly believe that I have the grit and discipline to succeed. But, I'm having trouble laying out a plan on how to succeed in the interview process. Long story short, I know that being deaf has affected people's willingness to hire me. To put in bullet form, the issues I struggle with are:

*  I can't talk on the phone without accommodations (at work, I have a captioner who transcribes all my meetings in real-time). 
* Without accommodations, I really need to be able to see the person face-to-face in order to lip-read. 
* I have worried that asking for a captioner or ASL interpreter would put off trading firms or hedge funds from wanting to hire me.
* I always disclose that I'm deaf in the online application or cover letter. I worry whether this has impacted my chances of getting an interview but at the same time, I don't think I should hide it.
* I have done a lot of cold-calls and Skype chats with people from my alumni network for networking/learning about their roel, but really struggled during the calls and these calls usually ended early because I wasn't able to understand them. I feel like doing cold calls, Linkedin chats, Skype chats, etc is one of the biggest advice given on this subreddit but I'm having trouble making this advice work for me.
* I have attended several trading conferences, but have ran into issues where the conference wasn't able or willing to provide accommodations, or I found it difficult to hear/communicate with others in a group setting.

My location also isn't ideal -- I work in a smaller Midwest city and I've really thought about moving to Chicago for a few months and trying to apply for Chicago roles. The thought behind this is that I could try and network in person, and try to see if I could skip the phone and be easily brought on-site if I'm already in the city. During grad school, I tried to take the train/fly to Chicago to network and set up coffee meets, but ultimately it ended up being quite costly and time-consuming because I worked full-time while in grad school, although I did manage to get 1 on-site interview where I didn't pass. Does anyone have ANY ideas on how I can deal with my situation? Bonus if you happen to know any deaf people working in the industry -- I'd LOVE to try and get their advice on how they broke into whichever firm they are in. Any advice that anyone can share would help so much. I am to my wits end and wondering if I should give up my dream career altogether."

I've been in this role for almost 8 months, and I'm sick of it.

I took the job because the salary was much better than anyone else in a similar area, and I figured I had it made. I've been placed on 3rd shift since late October and my mental health is tanking. The culture between management (me) and the union workers is absolutely terrible, and has been for years. Trying to adjust workloads and enforcing anything is near impossible as it becomes a ""political"" mess. I've been called a slew of insults, had operators scream at me, and been told to go back to my office by operators, and it's considered to be the norm.

The management team I work with are a decent crew and I get along with them, but I look around at our full team and don't see positions I want to go into as it seems to be the same type of stuff, but at a higher level. The work/life balance is already tough on 3rd, but I have to work 10-12 weekends a year where I have to supervise every shift and can't do anything interesting during this time in case I have to go in.

My question is this, when is it too early to leave this place? I don't think I want to stay in operations supervision due to the work/life balance aspect (third shift and weekends) unless I could somehow get a day shift-ish role. This means I'd be looking for a new type of role. I have a degree in Supply Chain Management, so I feel like I have a lot of potential opportunities, but I only have this job and internship as experience. I'd even be willing to move somewhere else in the country for a job as I have nothing holding me back, but I don't know how well this would go as someone who's been in the workforce less than a year.

I know that some of the college hires in the previous year left within 6 months and found better paying jobs elsewhere, but if anyone has any experience in this, I'd appreciate the feedback."

I have a good work experience for a student (3 internships + 1 year remote freelance work with an infosec companie I was intern in, during my student exchange), mostly backend CRUD, ELK data analysis, network fingerprinting for bot mitigation, some front, a mobile app side project.

I am interested in getting into a devops / cloud position for my last internship, as I always have been interested in setting up infras / CI-CD / microservice architecture.

I mostly worked in small companies that have a strong tech need / product and feels like I learned a LOT there, and I am wondering what to chose next (company-type wise).

I have offers like:

\- specialized AWS cloud consulting companies that setup AWS architecture in 1 year missions that seem to have good expertise (known experts that do aws conferences etc) -&gt; would give me a good practice of building an aws infra from scratch or migrating a legacy one, work with experienced people etc

&amp;#x200B;

\- medium sized start-up with big tech dpt. like 100 employees and 70 techies, 5 devops that seem good at what they do (clever interviewers and interview process, state of the art architecture) (would learn for experienced devops but maybe do too specialized tasks)

&amp;#x200B;

\- small start-ups, with only a CTO or 1/2 beardies, including one from YCombinator 2019 (would have to do a lot, would give a wide panorama of building infrastructure)

&amp;#x200B;

\- big companies (not FAANG-likes, more like old, slow things) -&gt; I am a bit afraid as some interviewers seem dead in the inside

&amp;#x200B;

I did not try to get internships in FAANGS as I don't feel confident enough (and am too lazy to do LCs for now).

&amp;#x200B;

Have you more ideas to give me on the advantages of these different company sizes, an advice on how to chose, anything ?"

recently, i have had two internship offers.  one is what i expected, systems programming. but the other one is data science ??? and both pay well, although the cyber one is somewhat more. i told the company that i was dropping my math major, and that i wasn‚Äôt a good fit for the job imo but they kept telling me i would be fine.  i have to make a decision soon and i‚Äôm not sure.  the data science job has to do with machine learning or some sort, which i don‚Äôt know anything about. 

i am slightly more interested in data science because of the math, but i do think ill feel more comfortable/preform better with systems programming, esp in the long run since my major reflects it. but yet again, the data science internship seems more enriching. 

i‚Äôm having a hard time deciding and finding distinguishing factors. i‚Äôm really new to having more than one offer to choose from and i would appreciate any type of advice really. is it wrong to just decide based off of pay? i don‚Äôt see any other big deciding factors here

edit: another important is that i technically already signed since the systems programming was first. but i told them i was expecting more offers and needed more time to decide and they said that if i accepted i reserved the right to revoke my acceptance."

I'm going to graduate with a bachelor's in IT, and decided cloud computing is the field I'm most interested in. So I've been gathering info about enterprise cloud deployments, and thanks to my school I've got a pretty generous monthly credit with AWS until I graduate, and many of my classes have been centered around the cloud, so I have some more than basic knowledge.

One concern is that this wouldn't be taken seriously by any employers, like a traditional internship would. I feel like launching a product, even a fake one would help more in that regard.

I only have a limited amount of funds that could only go to one of the following: pay to get me to the destination for WWOOF, pay for my scuba certification, or pay for my yoga training. There is a possibility that I might be able to do both the scuba certification and WWOOFing but that‚Äôs only if I find a cheap flight.

Working FT, however, involves mostly doing operational work and bug fixes. I have at least one on call shift every month. All of this is monotonous and unfulfilling. I honestly can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life, and am considering other alternatives.

I've found passions, such as literature and writing. I want to go back to school to finish up a second bachelor's in philosophy. I'm unsatisfied with my education, since I only received a BS in computer science. I feel like I should've double majored in a humanities subject, as I would be better rounded than I am right now.

I'm 23, so I'm not getting any younger, and I'm at a crossroads right now. Due to my depression I'm not capable of putting in the work that is needed to succeed at this company, and I'm so apathetic that I'm thinking about quitting and moving home. It was my dream to move to NYC, but feeling so constantly and pathetically lifeless due to this job and my insecurities makes it seem like it's not worth being here.

I'm thinking if I deal with some personal issues and get some things out of my system I may be able to return to full time work in a few years. I have a solid resume: decent experience and a great GPA. I plan on furthering my bachelor studies in philosophy like I already mentioned. Would it be reasonable to gun for entry level roles again in a few years after I work on myself?"

This might be my hardest semester and I'm not sure if I should just put all of my focus into school or if I should start working on applying for jobs? Is it okay for me to start applying near the end of the semester or should I begin right this second? I have a ERP job at the moment where I implemented the ERP System known as PLEX into a manufacturing plant. I currently work from home while I focus on my studies, now I simply maintain and do bug fixes when they contact me. Do I have a better chance of getting a job with this ERP position on my resume? I never did get an internship specifically programming but I can say that I thoroughly understand databases and I kind of understand how to implement them into businesses and how to teach general floor workers how to use their specific section of the ERP system. Any advice on what I should be focusing on? I'd like to just work on school at the moment and graduate but if I need to start applying then I will.

Also, I currently smoke marijuana in a legal state. It's not illegal or anything but do I need to stop smoking weed as well? Do you find yourself getting drug tested often when it comes to getting jobs in this field? (I have no issue quitting marijuana, I just don't want to end up screwing myself)"

eoq32d,51,2020-01-14,My friend had a childish fear.,dogeman87,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eoq32d/my_friend_had_a_childish_fear/,"  

My friend Mike was a bit of a wuss, but not in the traditional sense. He was about as masculine a figure as you could imagine: he hunted, rock climbed, and canoed in his spare time. Unsurprisingly, he worked as a phys ed teacher in high school, coaching a junior football league in his spare time. His wife is also a fitness nut, joining him in almost all of his activities, no matter how demanding they may be.

You know where he went for vacation one year? Tanzania. He climbed Kilimanjaro with his wife, and both of them were equally excited. He‚Äôd not done any climbing outside his own ventures, which had never taken him above four thousand feet. Nevertheless, he did it, and he did it in five days, while traveling one of the toughest routes. I forget which one it was; suffice it to say that the path usually took seven days, if not longer. He didn‚Äôt even hire a guide.

No one really understood how he did it. He picked up skills much like us normal folk pick up a new TV show. It didn‚Äôt matter if he was experienced. As long as it was something physical, he could do it, and he‚Äôd do it better than almost anyone else. 

I was fortunate enough to know him from our time together in college. I‚Äôd been a chemistry major, the polar opposite of his own field, which even then was physical education. He wasn‚Äôt quite an Olympic athlete, and he hadn‚Äôt made the NFL draft, but I think what he called his ‚Äúbackup plan‚Äù was always his goal. 

Our meeting was improbable. I, a bogged-down science student, needed to get in shape, so I visited the campus gym. When I was struggling to bench eighty pounds- something that he had every right to laugh at- he instead helped me. Gave me ideas of how to pace myself, how many reps were appropriate, how much I should increase my weight each time. He even showed me other exercises, some of which I could barely do (I was never any good at deadlifts), and we became fast friends after that. 

While our interests were different, our personalities were not. He was as laid-back a guy as you could imagine. I was not quite on his level, being the major that I was, but I didn‚Äôt stress over class like other kids did. I also found time to relax, and, to my surprise, he did as well. While he spent almost all of his time exercising, he was not averse to the occasional movie or morning coffee. 

In perhaps no other platonic relationship of mine could I have had such easy conversation. The topic didn‚Äôt matter. Politics, exercise, movies, the latest celebrity fuckup- they were all equally interesting, coming from a guy with his enthusiasm. Our conversations were the kinds where you can lose yourself for hours, if you‚Äôre not careful. He was on my same wavelength. Yeah, we didn‚Äôt have the same interests, and we didn‚Äôt even have the same beliefs (I‚Äôm a Methodist, he was Jewish), but we approached things with the same casual mindset, enjoying every part of our lives, no matter how shitty it sometimes got. 

And it did get bad. Really bad, in fact; you‚Äôve probably figured that out by the title of this post. I was single at the time of this story, and I had no one to lean on but my ever-distant parents. It was a dark time. 

I suppose I never explained why Mike was a wuss. He was in great shape, an extrovert, had a girlfriend soon-to-be future wife‚Ä¶ and he hated scary movies. I mean despised them. He‚Äôd squeal at even the slightest musical note that suggested any horror was to come. He was even nervous about The Shining, and I watched that movie when I was nine. 

So what? Everyone‚Äôs afraid of something, you may say. He had a lot more courage than other people I knew. He didn‚Äôt hesitate to hang off a thousand-foot cliff, or kayak amidst class five rapids. No hesitation with women, either; he‚Äôd dated at least a dozen girls before meeting his wife. But none of that mattered, in the end.

No, what mattered was his mostly unknown fear of monsters. It would be his undoing, and quite possibly the only reason I‚Äôm still alive. 

\*

We were camping last August in Yosemite. There are lots of campsites in the park, and August was the perfect time of year for us: he‚Äôd finished his school stuff, and I had vacation days to burn. Plus, the park was a short three-hour drive from our homes outside San Francisco. 

It was a guy‚Äôs trip only. His wife would‚Äôve come, believe me, but she understood that we needed our space. No matter how much you love your wife, if you‚Äôre an outdoorsy type of person, you relish the time spent with friends, and friends alone. I guess I can‚Äôt speak from experience, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed of others, especially Mike. He loved those trips.

The previous year, we‚Äôd gone deep-sea fishing. I, having the higher-paying job, rented our boat and provided supplies. He insisted on paying me back; I insisted he pay back his student loans. He eventually relented. In any case, he soon forgot about our quarrel, because all he could talk about afterwards was the huge swordfish we ended up catching. His wife still has it on her wall; she can‚Äôt bear to take it down.

Yosemite was supposed to be a one-up. As you probably know, there are lots of trails in the park, so it was a better opportunity for exercise. Some of them are hard, too. He wanted to tackle the Half Dome, which issues a limited number of permits a year. It‚Äôs a long, grueling hike, up almost five thousand feet and back down in a single day. I persuaded him to take the milder trails instead. Our compromise was to go partway up Yosemite Falls, which itself isn‚Äôt easy for the average person, but I managed it.

The incident happened the evening after we climbed the Falls. We were lying in our sleeping bags, looking up at the night sky. It‚Äôs amazing, how much you can see from Yosemite. The arm of the Milky Way is often on display, along with about ten thousand stars. No description can do it justice. Look up some pictures if you want an even passing idea of what I mean. 

We were bullshitting about all kinds of things. He was saying how his wife wanted him to use his winter break for a hiking trip in the Sierra Nevada. He, on the other hand, wanted to ski in the Rockies. 

‚ÄúWhy not do both?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt,‚Äù he said, shrugging. ‚ÄúNot enough days off. We only get about twelve, if we‚Äôre lucky. Usually it‚Äôs less.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I forgot. Been a while since high school. You teachers must really suffer, having a week and a half off, plus spring break, plus summer vacation.‚Äù 

He chuckled. ‚Äú It‚Äôs quite the sacrifice. Worth the lower salary, though.‚Äù

That made me wince. He was always nagging me about that. I work for a big chemical manufacturer, and my success there- combined with a high college GPA and numerous internships- put me on the fast track. I was making six figures three years after graduation. Mike, meanwhile, couldn‚Äôt have made more than sixty thousand a year. Not bad at all, by any standards‚Ä¶ just not enough for where we lived.

I guess I must‚Äôve been silent after that, because he changed the topic. We started talking about sports. He was most into football, and he lectured me for a solid half hour on the Oakland Raiders. They were getting better, he insisted, despite their current standings. They weren‚Äôt the worst team in the league, but they were far from the best, and they definitely wouldn‚Äôt make the playoffs. 

I won‚Äôt go into his reasons for those things. It would bore you. It bored *me*, and I‚Äôd been watching the Raiders since I was a kid. Sports were one of the few things we truly had in common.

He was stopped mid-sentence by a noise in the woods. A couple branches snapped, and leaves rustled nearby. He blanched, shrinking into his sleeping bag, pulling himself back into our tent. I, on the other hand, was curious. There‚Äôs a lot of wildlife at Yosemite, and, while a bear could‚Äôve been sniffing at us, it was unlikely. They don‚Äôt bother people unless you leave food out like an idiot. It was probably something else, maybe a bobcat or coyote. Dangerous, perhaps, but I still wanted to see what it was.

I leaned my head out of our tent. He grabbed my sleeping bag. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúGet back in here. Maybe whatever it is will go away.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not gonna get mauled by a bear or anything. If I need to, I‚Äôll jump back inside. How the hell do you go hunting, anyways?‚Äù

‚ÄúDeer don‚Äôt exactly want to kill you.‚Äù

I suppressed a laugh. People may think otherwise, but animals really don‚Äôt want to mess with humans. If we feed them, provoke them, get them used to our presence- that‚Äôs when they come out. Barring those things, though, they‚Äôre pretty shy around us. And they definitely don‚Äôt mean us harm, at least in most cases.

Whatever had made the noise had vanished. I sighed. I‚Äôd brought my camera with me on the trip and had been hoping to photograph some wildlife. It was an expensive Canon, one that my previous girlfriend had bought me. Don‚Äôt ask why she dropped two thousand on it; I don‚Äôt know. I suppose that she thought I‚Äôd propose, at the time, up until‚Ä¶ well, I don‚Äôt need to go into any of that. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to bed,‚Äù Mike suggested. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm tired. And we have a lot of hiking tomorrow.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt deny that. He wanted to hike half of the Snow Creek trail, a twenty-one-mile behemoth that had a mile-high elevation gain. I say half because not even he could manage it all in one day. As you might guess, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to, either. He probably would‚Äôve left me behind at the ten-mile mark and made it back before me. 

The rustling noise jolted me out of my sleeping bag. Mike was a heavy sleeper- he hadn‚Äôt been woken by a goddamn earthquake once- and I wasn‚Äôt far off. I do, however, struggle to fall asleep, and I‚Äôd been drifting off when the noise returned. 

It didn‚Äôt annoy me at all. In fact, I was excited. I already had my camera laid out next to me. After making sure it was good to go, I leaned out of my tent and prepared the flash, ready to snap whatever photos I could. 

A small rabbit stood in our clearing. Its ears shuddered when moonlight glinted off my lens. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I‚Äôd really expected something bigger, or at least something less common than a rabbit. We have about a thousand of them in my neighborhood.

The bushes were still rustling, though. I‚Äôd tuned it out when I caught a glance of the rabbit. Now, I looked past its twitching body and tried to see past the shadows. A flashlight wouldn‚Äôt have helped, or even a phone light; I knew it would scare animals away. No, I had to be patient and let the thing come out.

In a way, I saved my life by doing that. Or, if you want to extrapolate, my ex-girlfriend did. I don‚Äôt care who or what you attribute. All that matters is that I saw what happened next.

Something emerged from the bushes. I almost dropped my camera, I was so startled, but my grip on it was like iron. As much money as I made, dropping that thing would‚Äôve broken my heart. Not as much as the thing did, though.

I refer to it as the thing because there is no better descriptor. It was a mishmash of a dozen shades of fur, covered in dirt and leaves, disheveled like my own messy mop of hair. The thing‚Äôs body was sleek, like a coyote, and that‚Äôs why I wasn‚Äôt too worried at first. It was big as hell, maybe eight or nine feet long, but I somehow ignored that. The eyes matched, too: they were large and black, following my hands as I carefully set my camera down.

The rest of it was not normal. It had massive fangs the size of a vampire‚Äôs. Its legs were bulky, like those of a bear, but disproportionately so. On its head was a set of horns that reminded me of photos Mike had taken in Tanzania, of a herd of buffalo grazing near the mountain. 

When it didn‚Äôt move, my first response was to sink into the tent and play dead. Not the smartest move, I know, but it works with most wild animals, especially bears. I didn‚Äôt have any other ideas.

The thing was fast. Before I could even lean all the way back, it was in front of me. The edge of the clearing was about twenty feet away. Somehow, it had covered that distance before I could blink, and that was enough to scare me.

I kept my eyes on the thing. Moving would do nothing, I realized. I‚Äôd be dead if the thing wanted to kill me. Even if we‚Äôd had a gun, I doubt I‚Äôd have had time to use it. My only hope was to maintain eye contact and hope it didn‚Äôt do anything.

It didn‚Äôt, at least not at first. I stared at it for a full minute, and it didn‚Äôt move. The rabbit had fled long ago; I diverted my eyes for a second as I noticed this, and I caught the thing stirring out of the corner of my eye. I immediately looked back.

My first instinct was to wake Mike. Bad idea, given his fear of monsters, but I didn‚Äôt want him to wake up and find me mauled. Worse, I didn‚Äôt want *him* to get mauled as he slept. It was entirely possible the thing would have left on its own‚Ä¶ but I doubted it. There was something in its gaze that seemed almost sentient.

I shook him awake, keeping my eyes on the thing the whole time. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he muttered. I shook him harder, and I could feel him sit up in his sleeping bag. He froze the second his head appeared next to mine.

He let out a little scream that, in other circumstances, would‚Äôve made me laugh. It was one of those girlish screams you‚Äôd expect from a middle schooler. The thing took the noise as a threat, I guess. One moment, Mike was sitting next to me, and then he was gone. His head was, at least. The rest of his body was still in the tent, spurting blood on my motionless form. I also noticed that the thing had vanished, presumably with Mike‚Äôs head.

It was my turn to scream. I probably yelled for a full minute before I could calm down. At that point, I was covered in my friend‚Äôs blood, as was the rest of the tent. It was all I could do to grab my phone and, with shaking hands, dial the nearest ranger.

\*

They didn‚Äôt know what to make of the scene. When I‚Äôd first called, frantic beyond belief, they thought it was a bear attack. That idea went out the window as soon as they arrived. No bear, the ranger admitted, would bite someone‚Äôs head clean off. And it wouldn‚Äôt have happened while I sat in the tent, unable to react. 

It had been bit off, though. That much they could determine. I don‚Äôt know exactly how they did it, but a medical examiner agreed as much when Mike‚Äôs body was returned home. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt want to know at that point.

They wouldn‚Äôt believe my story about the thing, instead chalking it up to shock and- later on- PTSD. Their explanations didn‚Äôt add up, though. What kind of animal chewed off a person‚Äôs head, fast enough to keep the other from reacting, all while vanishing within a second?

His wife was suspicious, too, though she didn‚Äôt admit it to me at first. She took the news pretty hard, as I did myself. My boss gave me a week off after the incident. I‚Äôd already used most of my vacation time, but he wasn‚Äôt an asshole. I would‚Äôve been more trouble than help in my condition.

I was still not the same when I returned. My coworkers hadn‚Äôt heard the whole story, but they knew someone close to me had died. They were pretty understanding, at least to my face. I heard them behind my back, talking in the breakroom or the bathrooms, asking how long it would take me to get over it.

They hadn‚Äôt seen what I saw. That thing had been unnatural, its abrupt killing even more so. Mike‚Äôs fear- which I‚Äôd so often laughed at- had proven to be true. Not only that, it had gotten him killed; and, as much as I was loathe to admit, it had probably saved my life, having him be the victim instead.

I still don‚Äôt know what it was. I‚Äôve googled descriptions of the thing, and I‚Äôve come up empty. I even talked to some Native Americans near Yosemite, figuring they might know some legends about it. Nothing. They could only shrug sympathetically when I told them my story.

I wish I knew more. As much as I don‚Äôt like to think of it, I couldn‚Äôt stop. You tend to revisit death when you least expect it. I could be watching a movie, or cleaning the dishes, or going out on a date with a beautiful girl. Any of those times, it could hit me again, that some monster killed my friend.

You may wonder why I‚Äôm even telling this story. After all, it happened almost half a year ago. Why withhold it for this long? Part of it was because I couldn‚Äôt bear to relive these events. Even making this post- a measly three thousand words, a drop in the bucket compared to the amount I write at work- has left me with a cold sweat.

The reason, of course, is that the thing has returned. In some capacity, at least. Last evening, when I returned from a night out with another friend, I found an eyeball at my door. Its iris was an icy blue, the same kind as Mike‚Äôs. I knew it was his the second I saw it.

That was it. No foreboding message, no visitor from the depths of Hell, no actual sign of the thing. Just the eye. But that was enough. I knew it was a message, and I knew what that message was.

The thing had followed me. Whether it comes for me next or merely stalks me for the next few years is uncertain. I do know, however, that it will not stop, not for a long time. Whatever its purpose, the thing is persistent. And, like myself, it will not forget about what happened."

There is still time left and I promise you there are many opportunities and many rocks you have left to turn over. 

Even if you don‚Äôt receive anything, don‚Äôt let it get to your head.

I worry I'm stagnating already. While I have learned some, I feel like I've learned a lot more at internships that I have done in the past.

What's most concerning is that the other engineers also seem to have not that much to do either and there are no new projects on the horizon.

When anyone searches online using Google Search, Google Ads gets triggered by the keywords used. Businesses use Google Ads to bring in more visitors to their websites or more customers to their stores. However, businesses have to understand how Google Ads works, which requires an understanding of complexities such as keyword triggers, keyword bidding optimization, and more.

At Ad Launcher, we use machine learning and natural language processing to find the optimal values for these parameters, based on factors like given a business' monthly budget. We also provide a simple and web-based user interface so businesses need only focus on the high-level overview of their Google Ads performance, not these parameters.

With Ad Launcher's machine learning models, businesses can get the most out of Google Ads without having to do much work.

Ad Launcher is currently funded by UC Berkeley's SkyDeck and is planning to apply to YC Combinator for their upcoming Summer 2020 Batch. The internship will start in Spring 2020.

**Qualifications**  
\- Experience in UI/UX Design and Research  
\- Experience with one or more the following design mock-up tools: Figma, Adobe, Squarespace, Webflow

**Preferred Qualifications**  
\- Front-end development  
\- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript experience  
\- Agile development experience (e.g. SCRUM)

We are the only developers in the company. We were assigned to the task of creating a marketplace website, starting from some code left by their previous developer.

The developer got to the point where he created the databases for products, users and companies. And a lot of datatables on the frontend for the user to see the data. Now we have to create views for products and single product, user profiles so they can edit their info, a new user role in vendor (and then all the pages related to the vendor such as dashboard, a way to upload products, change products info), payment, security and probably there are more than we are missing since both of us (interns) don't really know how to build a markteplace from (almost) scratch.

So here I am, I want to know what do you guys think about this. Is building a marketplace doable for two interns? If it is, does anybody has any pointers, guides, tutorials or simply tips that could help us? The codebase is in ASP.NET, so to use what the previous developer built we decided to stick to it, but it there is an easier solution we would gladly use it.

The only caveat I may fail to do so at one point and delay either my Chemistry series courses or perhaps just waste time in school. Before even going to college I knew my only college options in life because of economic reasons were only commuting to either SDSU or UCSD to have no loans at all. 

Past this, the scenario is my gpa is less than adequate for the screening courses (because of rough time of transit commuting, and dealing with lots of issues regarding familial ones) but they made a case to perhaps allow me into the SE in which states...

"" The department standard requirement is a 3.1 or higher in the screening GPA.¬† We will include any classes that can count towards that major in your screening GPA so taking SE 3/MAE 3, SE 9/MAE 8 can assist you in having more classes to improve the screening GPA.¬† We do not count summers as part of the 6 quarters so you have through the summer after your 2nd year to apply and change your major.¬† Our application is open at the end of every quarter including summer.¬†It is only if you are close to the screening GPA and have shown consistent dedication to SE that a possible exception would be made.¬† Exceptions are anything below a 3.1.¬† As an example we had students that were close and the Undergrad Chair allowed them to take additional summer classes and if they met a certain summer GPA they were admitted but this is not a given, it's an exception.¬† At this point I would focus on your Math 18 and Chem 40B classes.¬† If you feel like you are on track to get a B or high in Math 18 then when the spring schedule posts I recommend you make an appointment to speak with me about what spring classes would be useful to take. "" 

\-&gt;By the way Chem 40b=Orgo II and Math 18 = Linear Algebra. She told me to stick with Orgo II even I'd really just want to focus on Math 18 . 

\*This quarter I'll be taking math 18 then the next 20E (Vector Calculus II) in conjunction with SE 3 ( CAD software) and SE 9 (Matlab Algorithms/Programming) then summer which is 5 weeks (Statics + Mechanics Lab -&gt; I would need a 3.0 cumulative for both combined).\*

My choices would be...

1) Perhaps try to follow this path but it seems one mess up can just ruin things with such a high stakes gamble.

2) Maybe go to junior college and try to attempt to go to SDSU to do engineering (I feel I am way to maxed into my credits, and I may be wasting FAFSA)

3) Stick with Chemistry as this is clearly not worth it no matter if I dread only  due to circumstance stay with a Chemistry (B.S.), as I found out I like learning engineering topics more than Chemistry ones. Do internships related to composite materials/internships -&gt;land a job in it regardless of being an engineer.

4)  Ditch Orgo II against the contacts wishes to focus on these classes which may delay my graduation if I have to inevitably stick with a Chemistry (B.S.)

TL;DR UCSD Chemistry major (2nd Year) wanting to do engineering but realized that choosing undeclared was not ideal as he thought it would affect his chances. Now has 4 choices to make in terms of probably being considered into Engineering with a long road till the end of August. AKA I am lost."

I've been doing some soul searching lately and have realized that although I like learning about computer hardware, I see myself enjoying the software side of things much more. I'm considering switching to software engineering, but if I do so, I may end up extending my graduation by another year (so 6 years in total) and I'm already pressed for time. Also, I might get kicked out of co-op if I make the switch.

Don't get me wrong, I find my degree fascinating, but I'm also concerned that it won't give me the leg up in securing a great software/web development job offer by the time I graduate. The one benefit I see in sticking with computer engineering is the Cloud/IoT courses offered in my Senior year.

If you were in my position, what would you do? Graduate in 5 years with a better chance of securing internships through co-op but with a computer engineering degree, or spend an extra year in school to get a degree in software engineering, and possibly have more time to hone your skills? Are us ECE folks applying for software/web development roles seen as weaker candidates than CS/SOEN students? Any input/advice would be greatly appreciated."

Please know I wouldn‚Äôt be taking up your time if I had any energy left to power new thoughts on the the topic.

I have an executive level user who is his own worst enemy when it comes to his Windows 10 Pro Dell laptop. He refuses to reboot. He keeps all of his work in progress open. Dozens of email windows, 10 or more Excel files, half a dozen Word windows, plenty of pdf files, and so on. He also insists on saving his email as individual msg files in a file directory. 

He then gets frustrated blaming the laptop, IT, and so on. He postponed rebooting, delays efforts to update drivers, and otherwise disallows the first step in computer troubleshooting (rebooting)  for as long as he can. He makes do with things not working because he doesn‚Äôt want to reboot thus losing his place in his ‚Äúto do‚Äù list. Essentially, all the open files are his to do list. Surprise reboots, Win 10 remember, halt his productivity for like 90 minutes while he reopens everything.

I have clearly, bluntly, and otherwise made it clear most of his issues would be solved if he would just do a full shutdown on Friday at the end of the day. I even setup a reoccurring reminder for him to do so. Every time he asks for help, my first question is have you rebooted  (no). Yes, I am considering force reboots and feigning ignorance / blaming the intern. I am also looking into hiring a personal productivity consultant for him.

We push Windows updates Wednesday and app updates Thursday. This is an established schedule well known through the company.  We review Dell updates regularly. There are consistent GPO changes. 

Alright, that should be enough history. So here are my basic questions.

1.) How have you dealt with similar Executive behavior who run your company and sign your paychecks?

2.) Is there a script or app that can capture all open windows and reopen them upon reboot? I haven‚Äôt found one in several years of looking and have had in depth convos with developers on why is a nearly impossible dream.

3.) What additional advice or ideas do you have on this topic? I‚Äôm very interested. 

Rules: 
1.) Be nice. Folks of every make, model, and version welcome.
2.) RTFP
3.) Keep the fanbrat bs in your preferred vendor‚Äôs circle jerk threads.
4.) Add value to the discussion"

Now, most of my day will be spent being in an office. I will be treated as a 'coworker' by someone who probably will not care that much for my wellbeing instead of a student who brought up a really interesting point. I will be staring at a computer for 8 hours, knowing it's terrible for my eye sight. I will be sitting on a chair all day, knowing that the sedentary lifestyle is making me gain weight. I will take commutes that will barely give me any free time.

All these things I described above happened to me over the summer, when I had a 2-month internship. I don't want this to be the rest of my life. I feel depressed and overwhelmed just thinking about it already.

I don't want to tell my parents, they think that I should be excited. Well, I've seen what work has done to my family, where my parents look exhausted. I don't care about the money, a house, or any of that shit.

I'm thankful that I won't be in debt, but I want to find SOMETHING long-term that isn't soul-crushing. Shit, I'm even looking forward to have kids so I can raise a child to be intelligent and kind and be a stay-at-home mom, even though that probably won't be for at least 10 years and even though that will present its challenges.

So I guess I'm looking for tips to avoid the 9-5 lifestyle, signs of hope?"

I'm young, I'm fairly physically healthy. I have an attractive, supportive girlfriend, and right now my family is taking care of me. However, I'm having the same issue I've always had, all my life. I don't know what to do, and the things I think I want to do, I absolutely, and miserably fail at conjuring the will to do them.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's start with where I am. I graduated high school, without a car, and with roughly a C grade-point average and got a job at Walmart right out of the gate. I decided to avoid schooling because I didn't want to make a financial investment like that if I wasn't sure where I wanted my life to go. I worked there a year, it was shitty labor, where management doesn't respect you, but the minimum I was paid was 11 an hour so, it was hard to resist. Eventually, my sister (Who works at an Insurance office) asked if I'd be willing to be an intern at her office, and I accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

This led me to the last six months, where I worked first as an intern for minimum wage, then, when I impressed the office by being quick and efficient with all the tasks given to me (Their words), I was raised to 10 dollars an hour, and was allowed to study online for a license to start actually working as an Insurance agent. 

&amp;#x200B;

It felt like such a step up, especially from Walmart, where everyone was consistently negative all of the time (Myself included). I felt valued, and I was praised and everything was good. However, that wouldn't last long.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been working there roughly six months, and it was December. Christmas shopping galore, everyone was cheerful, I'd even helped set up most of the Christmas decorations, however there was a reoccurring problem that would resurface. You see, this was an insurance office. I didn't have a car, or a home. I didn't have insurance with the office at all. However specifically, I did not have life insurance. I, along with two others, my sister and our receptionist, were asked to come into a meeting with \[BIG BOSS MAN\] for an ""Employee review"". This started fairly standard, until \[BIG BOSS MAN\] got onto the topic of life insurance, you see, he went on a long rant about how people without life insurance couldn't be trusted, which ended with the phrase. ""You're going to buy one of these two life insurance policies at the end of today. Do you have a problem with that?"" to which I replied ""I'll decide that when I see these policies."".

Now after I leave,it's my sister's turn to go in. While I wasn't in the best shape after that meeting, because I can't financially handle purchasing life insurance on top of the car insurance I need to purchase.  (I only got paid roughly 12 an hour) She leaves his office in tears. I can guess by her reaction that she was told effectively the same as I. After she calmed a bit, I managed to get her to tell me exactly what was said, which she relayed to me as ""If you want a job, you will be getting life insurance."" Which to me was absolutely ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

So after a long discussion with my sister over lunch, I told her ""Look, I can't afford to buy this life insurance plan currently. But, if I was given a single dollar raise, I could possibly afford it. I'll ask them for a dollar raise, or tell them I don't want to work here anymore."" So, by the time I get into the meeting, \[BIG BOSS MAN\] has already left for the day, and I'm met with one of our nice managers, who has been having this talk all day. I ask her how she's doing, I tell her I understand that none of this is coming from her, and then we discuss the situation. It's mostly me playing out my exact personal budget, and asking her where on that budget I should detract money to pay for this policy. To try and make this ungodly long and poorly formatted/worded story short. I lost my job.

So I leave, I go to my girlfriend's house (She lives with her parents.) and I stay the weekend there. Then, I get sick. The she gets sick. We both mutually decide to just wait to figure everything out after we are sick. Well, turns out we're sick for 2 1/2 weeks, and then it's god damn christmas. So we agree to wait until after christmas to deal with everything. Then, here I am, living at her house for a god damn month, trying to figure out what the hell I'm doing. I know I need t find a job and a car, but I don't know what car or which job, and I only have like 4 grand to my name after everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So I leave and go back to my house. Now here I am, 1:23 AM, trying to figure out what to do with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled alot with depression in my life, and that's lead to alot of motivational issues. But I can't just sit here doing nothing, I can't just wither away now that I don't have a job. I need to pick myself up, but all I can do is sit here hating myself for doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I'm 19, I lost my job, I have no car, and I can't motivate myself to do anything. Fucking roast my pathetic self."

I was running this big data mining project from old books, scanned to PDFs, in multiple languages to map it and share in an exhibit (we did! And outside of the client being a nightmare, it was an awesome project). I run a start up social enterprise, we have a massive amount of demand so we really need a bit of funding to scale our capacity. A foundation approached me about this work and I was like ""great!"" -- if they had (or had not even) broached funding after, it would have been cool. But how this played out is absurd. I should note, I was the IT manager for this too with a small staff of software engineers and GIS specialists. Additionly, I did a lot of the front end work and design; which I have been doing professionally since 14, and have had top-teir media use my graphics and have exhibited in major venues.

After giving a design workshop at their HQ, the CEO of a foundation told me they wanted to fund the organization and to submit a proposal. A board member reviewed it, we submitted a proposal. Months go by, nothing about this. I have a operations director and other staff lined up. Foundation then gets back to me about funding and says they are going to make the last phase of the project a test. I told them I'd have to fire all of my supporting administrative staff (but not tech contractors on the project) during that time and had been anticipating support sooner (gaf on my part for assuming they were serious when they wanted to fund us - should have been looking elsewhere in retrospect). In the ""test"" they asked for and got over $100K in free work, and by the end they were demanding a $500K+ data infrastructure project and treated me like an intern and clueless for standing up and saying no. Also, we then of course didn't fit into their funding portfolio.¬†

I take responsibility for the free work, should have cut them off immediately, funding or not. The entire tech team (PT) contractors was enthusiastic and really wants to work FT for my org, we were really excited by their solicitation of funding and it made us stupid, and as the manager I should have been more cautious about the hype.

It was a data mining, development, and visualization project. There were two bugs in software we use for visualization, which they blamed on me, depite me sharing the report I filed with the software company about it and making video demos explaining these problems very calmly. I have zero control of the software in the back end of our visualizations. They blamed us for not being able to get rid of an accessibility feature (not a bug even, it actually helps with usability) in SaaS, once again, beyond my control. And someone with no experience in design was requesting things like changes in hue, and edits on edits (literally reverting their previous edits) that made no sense, after the final deliverables were shared but before the contract ended. Over six months after the data was delivered in a database, excel, and mapped formats with full documentation for future users and processes documentation -- when I asked for them to pay their overdue bill multiple times they responded by saying ""calm down, we'll pay you once you deliver the data. We realize there is a lot to organize."" Baffled. I made another video demo showing how to locate the data, metadata, and documentation and noted their timestamps for completion. To make this even crazier: they requested that I essentially falsify data -- there was a spike in numbers and the person I was working with would not let it go saying we needed to average it and did not believe me when I clearly wrote that this was (1) not a best practice (2) untrue to the original data source. I kid you not.


Even after I sent a report with screenshots of emails showing product delivery dates, the contract, links to delivered products, video demos of how to, like, open the neatly organized folders with their materials and the extra products¬†they continued to demand free work and refused to pay. I offered to bring in professional mediators and third party technicians, for free, to explain the very clearly laid out work to them and they refuse. I am really grateful for the people in my networks who reviewed the materials to ensure I was not completely missing something.

Thank God we have control over the vast majority of the IP developed too.

This, my friends, is the worst client experience I will ever have, because I will fire them next time, sprinkled with extremely questionable ethics. It's stupendously unethical for a foundation to solicit a proposal for funding and while it's ""under review"" demand significant amounts of free work.¬†

Looking back I realize that it was mildly miraculous I managed to get them to pay full, given their behavior. I also learned more than I ever have about REALLY difficult clients from this; and as an organization we survived. It could have been much worse. I thank God for all the awesome tech mentors that helped me navigate the situation and learn a tremendous amount.

Also solid FU - I won a very prestigious international award for my previous work towards the end of their BS.




EDIT: A few key details and typos 

Thanks for reading. Any thoughts about what you would have done are much appreciated. Huge learning experience, in over a decade of doing contract work (though I'm relatively young) I've never encountered anything like this."

I'm currently desperate for an internship, but at the same time, I don't want to apply for positions I don't like. A little bit of background, I'm currently a communication student. I need to do an internship in order to do my thesis. I'm currently having a massive burn-out with my study, and I don't want my internship to add to my problems. GPA-wise, I'm doing very fine. My grades are wonderful, I even got a 9/10 for my last exam. However, when it comes to internship, it's just a complete mess.

I've been constantly applying since November. The official start date of the internship should be February 10th according to my university. So far, I really avoid HR internships because I'm not exactly a people person. I prefer working things on my own, even though I can work with other people. Mainly, I apply for marketing and copywriting internships. 

Yesterday, a recruitment agency called me. I applied by emailing an associate there. The associate posted on LinkedIn saying that the company was looking for an intern. Since there were no positions mentioned, and the post was shared to me by a friend, I emailed the associate. I also mentioned in the email that I'm interested in marketing. 

I talked to the caller, and he explained what the internship position entailed. It was a working-placement (meewerkstage). The available position is in the financial department, and my daily job would be to call candidates and also interview them (with guidance, of course). I wasn't interested, but the caller invited me to the office anyway. I agreed to it, because why not. 

That recruitment agency was the first one to call me since i started applying for internship. Tbh, I don't want to take it. But my deadline is soon approaching, and no other internship has called me for interview. I want to decline the offer, but at the same time, i am so scared of not getting an internship. The thing is, if i don't have an internship, I cannot do my thesis. i might graduate late, which i cannot afford  financially. 

So, I'm asking for advice on how do I deal with this? I really appreciate the call, and I'm going to visit the company to discuss with the caller about the internship. But i think i'm going to decline the offer. However, no other companies had called me and I'm so scared of not getting an internship on time."

I have no experience at all with app development or any of those technologies. And Ive been given some tickets, but have not done any work so far. And the company is putting some pressure on me. Basically, things are going super fast and I feel really overwhelmed, plus me not knowing the work makes it worse because I feel useless and hopeless.

I am investing time outside work, learning programming tutorials at home but I still feel insecure and afraid I wont do so well here either and probably terminate my contract before I start as a Full Time Employee.

I‚Äôve always struggled with them and tried to work on improving them last summer while doing my internship. What my issue seems to be is I feel the pressure and totally blank on an approach, or I can‚Äôt find the optimal approach and get like 3/10 cases right. 

It‚Äôs been frustrating because I‚Äôve never been a test taker and having the time constraint, processing of the problem, and coding a correct approach hinders me severely.

Currently I'm working an internship as a computer technician, nothing too complicated. The internship has lasted 8 months, but I feel like there isn't much growth, or that it is very slow.

I want to study for a new certification and would also like some opinions on what to get. I have the CompTia trifecta, and was considering either the Cysa+ or moving away from CompTia and go for the CCNA. 

In my spare time, Im learning bash and dabbling in python. Also, recently I was able to throw together a home lab to attempt some projects on, but I havent done anything advanced yet. 

Im 27 years old just starting out, so I feel really pressed for time to learn as much as I can. I'm beginning to think I've taken on too much at once.

I‚Äôm only a college student, and yet I already do this. 

Every night I look back at my day and think to myself - was I productive? Did I get enough done? If not, I feel anxious, like I‚Äôm lazy, useless, a mooch to a society. 

I‚Äôve felt guilty even looking at my phone for five seconds at internships, even when there was absolutely nothing for me to do. I get it, they don‚Äôt like the millennials and zoomers wasting time on their phones, though I can tell you right now my bosses sure take time to sit on the couch and do nothing.

I‚Äôve worked at a summer camp before where I was so hot and overworked with these impossible children that I got a heat stroke and fell asleep. No one asked me if I was ago, all I got was a reprimand and a warning - and if you‚Äôre wondering, it was a 40 hour job with below minimum wage pay. I got a fever multiple times that summer, and was still required to swim with the children even if I was sick or having a very heavy period. Keep in mind, I was a minor at this time, so apparently that means I‚Äôm strong enough and have the free time to do this without a fuss, because I‚Äôm supposedly naturally energetic, and never have dealt with stress before, obviously. 

The level of work I put in for college classes is insane, and the competition to do well vastly overshoots the need to learn. Ask anyone, they‚Äôd cheat on a test or project to avoid getting a bad grade even if that meant they never actually learned the material or did their own work. Why? Because the fear that you won‚Äôt get the grades to graduate and get a good job outweighs any sort of desire to just...learn and be a better person. When I‚Äôve expressed this opinion to people they sort of just laugh, it‚Äôs too idealistic, I‚Äôll resent this type of thinking when I‚Äôm older. College is for a career, not to get a major in underwater basketweaving gender studies, or at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told.

Not to mention, I have to take so many hours that I usually don‚Äôt have time for more than one meal a day, or at least one meal where I actually can sit down and eat. 

I‚Äôm in an artistic field, though in a branch that‚Äôs supposedly more organized and lucrative. Everything is about what hustles I‚Äôve done to put on my resume. I‚Äôd rather work on less things and spend more time on them, but that doesn‚Äôt appear as productive (even if the hours are the same.) I‚Äôve been chastised by peers for dropping some things due to the stress they put on me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never get a job if you don‚Äôt hustle‚Äù is the mentality. 

Even my parents have made fun of me for spending time relaxing, even when I‚Äôm reading, which I thought was supposed to be intellectually stimulating and good for you.

Point is, all of this has led me to hate myself for simply wanting to take time off, for wanting to sleep enough at night and taking time for my own things. I want to unlearn this, and I intend to. I do want a job and I want to be independent, but I also want to live and be a human and actually enjoy the world around me. I know I‚Äôm not the only young person who feels this way but is told they just don‚Äôt know enough to make these types of statements. 

Ya feel?"
ep7gby,7,2020-01-15,"I'm not cut out for grad school, and I don't know how to handle it.",sorinash,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ep7gby/im_not_cut_out_for_grad_school_and_i_dont_know/,"To give a brief summary of my status; I went into graduate school wanting to teach neuroscience at a small liberal arts college. I did quite well during my undergraduate career (good GPA, GRE scores, had an internship and some psychology research experience under my belt)

I went through a Master's degree in neurobiology.  I wasn't happy during it, and I didn't get any major publications out of it, but I graduated and figured I would continue on to a PhD because A: I still wanted to teach, and B: nobody was happy in my old lab, so I thought it was just a matter my not being suited to the lab.

I picked up roots and moved to a different state. I quickly learned that I enjoyed data analysis and coding, which wasn't the main focus of the PhD program. I had a particularly good experience in one lab that was heavy on quantitative matters and coding, but it later turned out that they wouldn't have the funding to take in new students. I later joined a systems lab, which promptly kicked my ass.

At the risk of sounding like I'm making excuses, I have rather a nasty combination ADHD-PI and social anxiety; according to the neuropsychological evaluation I underwent, my capacity for sustained visual attention is in the bottom 1% of people my age, and it's sometimes difficult for me to talk to friends and family without freaking out a bit. The former tends not to be all that bad in classroom or coding settings, but it does mean I am often disorganized, clumsy and absent-minded. The result was that I was bad at the physical tasks required of me (ie, making tetrodes, working with animals, etc), and didn't work up the nerve to ask for help.

I started therapy and medication at that point, partially because the friends I did make down here had left the program.2 years into the program (and 1 year into my time in the systems lab), I switched labs to work with a PI who I liked. I promised myself I would ask for help, stay on my meds, etc.

I did, but it hasn't been working out. When I ask for help, my experiments still don't work out. I apparently lack the hand-eye coordination to not struggle at picking up a mouse. A number of my experiments don't even reach a position where I can reliably observe their results. It's reached the point where essentially anything that has a risk of failure causes me a considerable degree of stress; most notably, I regularly spend up to 15 minutes at a time  checking and re-checking my mice cages to make sure that they all have water nozzles in their cages.

The result is that I'm not doing particularly much and still feeling overwhelmed. When things outside of grad school come up, I wind up neglecting vital parts of my training. For instance, I recently had a minor health scare which led me to spend a rather-considerable amount of time talking to my doctor and health insurance company regarding a surgery that would be necessary. In turn, I neglected to send an e-mail I had written (all the while thinking I had sent it), leading me to miss a rather vital deadline for a program milestone and pissing off the people heading the program.

In spite of everything, there *are* things that I'm good at. I've maintained good grades during my time here. I've done particularly well in a bioinformatics/data science course that I've taken, and my coding-related stuff has mildly impressed my PIs and a few members of my thesis committee. I can do a decent job at doing presentations on the papers I'm assigned for lab meetings. Unfortunately, none of these are the bulk of my program's focus. I think I'm realizing, four years too late, that I'm not cut out for academia, and would do better elsewhere.

There's a data science consulting firm that's recruiting in my area; one of my friends that left the program is working for them in a junior capacity and she seems far happier. I have some experience in coding (and a minor amount of knowledge regarding data science), and said friend has told me that my technical skills would allow me to contribute to my would-be peers there.

However, I feel weird about bringing this up to my PI. I haven't recently had any major disasters in the lab that would lead her to question whether I'm cut-out for research. More importantly, the reason I got said training in bioinformatics and data science was because I'm supposed to do some analysis on some upcoming sequencing data. It's not the current focus of the project, but it will be the crux of a potential paper, and in all honesty, I don't want to have been a waste of my lab's somewhat-limited funding. I have no idea where to go from here.

There's also the matter of my previously-mentioned upcoming surgery, which kinda requires me to have my insurance. 

I guess part of this was just me wanting to get this shit off of my chest, but if anybody has any advice I'd appreciate it too.

TL;DR: I'm a bit of a mess, and it's messing with my mental health. I think there are places outside of academia where I'd be less of a mess and in better mental health, but I don't want to have wasted peoples' time and money, particularly the PI who gave me a second chance and has generally been patient with me."

I'll admit as a freshman I was in the same place but I wish someone had told me to relax and everything would be fine in the end. 

As a freshman I didn't land an internship. As a sophomore I didn't land an internship. As a junior I got rejected from so many internships but finally landed one that I wasn't so excited about. My internship turned out to be the best experience in my life and being rejected from Big N companies was the best thing that happened to me. This year I got full time offers from multiple Big N companies but turned them down to join the company I interned at and fell in love with. Don't beat yourself up about being rejected from Big N companies. 

I always took the easiest classes in college, joined social clubs and a fraternity, and had a lot of time with friends and family. Just by reading this sub you are probably motivated and hard working. Don't let rejection or a strive for perfection/prestige degrade your quality of life.

50 leetcodes a day and a 4.0 GPA might sound great but the effort to do that in my opinion isn't worth it. Enjoy your college experience, make friends, and believe in yourself. I can't speak for recruiters, but I would much rather hire or be on a team with someone who is social and I could see myself being friends with even if they aren't as smart as the 4.0 GPA candidate who can solve leetcode hards but can't have a meaningful conversation.

I hope this helps current CS majors, especially underclassman. Relax, everything will be fine."

ep9j6v,2,2020-01-15,Should I Drop Computer Science?,Abstray,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ep9j6v/should_i_drop_computer_science/,"I came into my computer science degree two years ago ecstatic and with little confidence in my math skills. I excelled far better than I thought I would my freshman year. Enough to become a TA for my CS class as a freshman and score a high-profile internship my sophomore year. Here is the issue. I started to fail and struggle greatly with Discrete, Calc 2, C, Data Structures and so on. Now, I know that these are typically hard classes, however, I am now retaking my data structures class for the third time. I failed out of Statistics (from just not going anymore). I got a really good internship, and emailed my manager for the chance to come back on his team. He suggested, ""that I look into other teams to help develop my skills."" I don't know if it means that I did poorly, but I wasn't too enthusiastic about my performance. He even mentioned that I could've done more tickets at our end-of-internship review. In addition, even though I have been interviewing with Big-N companies, I have been getting rejected in each of my final interviews.

Here's the thing: I was recently diagnosed with a depressive disorder, and grew up with what others have evaluated as an emotionally, sexually, and somewhat physically abusive childhood -- life if we're being honest. Which affected how I relate to people, myself, and my abilities. That is all I am willing to go into detail about. Typically it has always been very hard for me to focus, organize, and so on. I struggled greatly through this doing AP's and honors classes, but pulled out with pretty high marks. My therapist says that this is a result of a long time undiagnosed depressive disorder (11-15 years of my 21 year old life). It flared up bad enough during college from many different stressors, so then I could no longer continue belittling and hiding it with I had an energetic, positive, ambitious, and smiley personality.  I am now on antidepressants and ADHD medications while in weekly therapy. I have seen great strides in my ability to do tasks, sit down, and move through emotional storms. However, I am afraid that I only see that because I on winter break for school. I also known for years that I have a penchant and great interest for psychology and helping people with their own emotional issues (ironic, I know). I am considering pursuing the major, but I am a junior now.

My question is, should I drop out of my CS degree to pursue something else? I no longer know if I don't like the major because my depression flared up greatly, or because I am not passionate or interested in it. I don't know if I want give up the security of it, but also I don't want to go into this year of classes failing out as I did prior. I know that this is a question only I can answer, but I guess I just wanted some opinions."

I‚Äôm male and 24 now, I have little to no friends (probably only about 2-3 actual friends currently - I have had some fall outs with previous friends over the years) and these friends of mine already are a lot more popular and have heaps of their own friends anyway when they‚Äôre all I have, so they have much less time for me than I do for them and half the time I feel like these friends just use me anyway, therefore I don‚Äôt really end up socialising much unfortunately even though I would like to. I have been single for about 7 years now since high school (this was my only relationship ever) and even over these past years I haven‚Äôt really had many hook-ups or been on many dates either and I‚Äôm pretty lonely these days. I‚Äôve mostly tried dating apps over these years so many times over and over to the point at which it's embarrassing, since I don‚Äôt really have the opportunity to meet people in person much and this has had very little success (tinder, bumble, hinge ‚Äì you name it). I‚Äôve probably been on only about 2 dates in this whole time and after each date I've been ghosted or cut off. So quick description of me, I try to take relatively good care of myself, I work out and am reasonably athletically built, decent face I guess and average height and Im usually pretty ok with talking to people too if that and can be confident where necessary if that helps to describe me a bit.

What makes this even worse is that I graduated college (business degree and want to get into marketing) almost 2 years ago now and have since really struggled to land a graduate role or job or even experience in my field (I currently still work my part time hospitality job which I‚Äôve had for years so I at least have some income ‚Äì I hate it but need the money). The worst part about this is I‚Äôve almost graduated too long ago to be eligible for any graduate positions let alone jobs and I‚Äôm not even a very favourable candidate for internships either since I‚Äôm no longer studying (I tried to land interns while studying but still wasn‚Äôt successful after a countless amount of applications) ‚Äì so now I‚Äôm slowly falling into more and more debt etc.

It's hard considering all my friends a lot of people I know are quite successful at this point, doing what they want, are in relationships and have plenty of friends and I feel like I keep getting left more and more behind and that Im getting nowhere.

Over these years I‚Äôve tried various hobbies, through my last few jobs and tried making friends when I was at college but never really had any luck and also of course dating apps with my relationship issues which has also been pretty much successful too as I find people just don‚Äôt like me, and in terms of work its practically been a second job for me constantly looking for work, applying, reaching out, seeking advice etc.

If anyone is or has been in a similar position or has some ideas, I would love your advice, as I‚Äôm kinda at the point where I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore‚Ä¶ 

Thanks :)"

It's a stressful job with ongoing contract negotiations, burned out coworkers, a rotten codebase, and uncompetitive pay.  I thought I'd enjoy this career path, but the downsides (for me) seem to outweigh the positives.  But the worst part is that I'm staring at a screen for 8 to 10 hours a day,  doing 100% pair programming (remotely).  I have frequent migraines and I get home after the sun has set, so I don't have time for my biggest hobbies -- hiking and mountain biking.

Maybe it's me.  I was spoiled at my internship, it was a startup and there were only a handful of us.  It was much more interesting, challenging work, and we were all passionate about what we were doing.   I actually was excited to wake up everyday.  Then again, my workdays rarely went over 6 hours and the rest of the time I focused on taking classes and enjoying living in an outdoorsy small town.

Then I decided I wanted a ""big name"" on my resume.  I was way too optimistic about the job, too high on the feeling that I was even offered a position with the company.  Becoming a cog in the wheel was the last thing on my mind.  And here I am, listening to people talk about getting divorced over their jobs, not having taken a vacation in years, or how long they've waited for a request to be approved due to the layers of bureaucracy.  Finding another job will be hard, as I've moved to a state that has an extremely undeveloped tech scene -- the few jobs that show up on Indeed around here require 5+ years of experience in frameworks that I don't know.

Have you guys been in this kind of a situation?  What did you do?

Bonus points if you can name a career path that combines my love for the outdoors with my computer science degree."

I am a 22-year-old living in Chicago who has been getting my Gen Ed‚Äôs and a few Intro CS related class out of the way at my local community college at night while working full time during the day at an Account Manager/Sales for an industrial maintenance supply company. (In other words, completely unrelated to CS or Software Development at all.) My job pays me about $47,000 a year.  

I have been accepted to transfer to DePaul University this coming September as a Computer Science major and I am beyond excited for this opportunity.

The fork in the road I am coming to is, right now I am currently living with my Dad, I have bills to pay, but he does not make me pay rent. I am also really beginning to hate my job and I am starting to think I should stop killing myself over it since it is not even related to my desired career path.

Here is my plan as of right now, I am considering working at my current job for the first quarter of my time at actual University (if it becomes too much or starts to affect my studying or GPA I figure I‚Äôll have a 2 week out from the job If needed. I would like to quit around Thanksgiving and go traveling over my University break for 5-6 weeks to Southeast Asia. Upon quitting my job, I hope to have my car paid off this year and have $30,000-$35,000 in savings. When I return, I want to take the max amount of classes the college will let me take with my tuition those next 2 quarters before summer starts. I took nearly all of my Gen Ed‚Äôs at community college, but have a lot of CS classes to catch up on as a quite recently decided to declare this is my major and my community college only has what they call a CIS and CIT program so I can‚Äôt take a lot of the classes I want that will transfer to DePaul.  I would like to complete DePaul within a solid 2 years and nothing more even if it means taking summer classes at night or online while I intern. 

My main goal is to manage getting a Software development internship and being ready to do so by next summer. I would like to spend the 2 quarters (roughly equal to about one semester) not working and taking mostly all CS classes and studying to prepare for Software development interviews and the internship itself.

Does this seem like a solid realistic plan or a recipe to backfire and screw me out of a large portion of my savings. Would love to hear everyone‚Äôs suggestions.

Cheers Everyone! And Thank You!"

epdb1o,1,2020-01-15,What I should major in? Changed my major 4 times already,wizard-ry,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/epdb1o/what_i_should_major_in_changed_my_major_4_times/,"I am in my junior year of college and I've gone from Theatre Production to Film Production to TV and Radio to Journalism. 
*I changed my major in between breaks so technically I've only taken classes in Film Production 

Now I'm feeling stuck. The majors I chose were because they were art based and fun and not too difficult. My friends kept telling me to choose a major that I enjoyed and I did just that. But, then I changed it over and over and I'm realizing now that I kept changing my major because I didn't feel secure in that major. I didn't feel secure in my future. 

I grew up extremely poor and so when it came to college I knew I had to go. I felt like it was my only way to make it out and actually have financial stability when I graduate. 


So I've been looking through all the majors my school offers and I am stuck between these three. 

1. Multimedia Computing: This is a subsection of computer science. I will be taking computer science and math classes as well as digital and graphic design classes. 

2. Marketing: Self Explanatory 

3. Speech: Basically this is a communication disorder major and it's meant for those who want to become speech language pathologist.  


Here are my reasons why I'm unsure of each major

1. Multimedia Computing: There are alot of hard classes in this major and I'm not sure if I'm able to push pass it and not end up hating it. I used to be really bad at math until I got to college and I actually put effort into learning math and I ended up kind of enjoying it. I guess my big worry is if I'm actually smart enough for this major/career path. 

2. Marketing: I'm worried about the career prospects of this major. There's a chance that I could end up in sales and that's definitely not what I want to do. I like the creativeness of marketing which is why it's one of my options. I also think I could get alot of cool internships with marketing. 

3. Speech: I feel like this is a straight forward career path. I worked with kids before and enjoyed it and I do feel like I would be good in this career. I would need to get a Master's degree if I go this path and I'm not sure if I want to get my Master's. Also I've heard alot of mixed things about this career path and the high turnover rate worries me. I'm also worried about if I change my mind in the further future and I want to change my career path but being a speech pathologist wouldn't be transferrable I think. 


I definitely enjoy collaborating with people and I definitely wouldn't prefer a super corporate- suits 24/7 type of environment. I definitely want a business casual work environment. I want to be able to enjoy my job without it having to be my passion. 


TLDR: Changed my major too many times and those majors were art based. Now I'm looking for a major that will give me a secure future that allows me to be creative and collaborative. The majors that I'm looking at are Multimedia Computing, Marketing and Speech. I'm trying to figure which one should I choose out of the three."

Thanks in advance for reviewing my profile. I am from Australia and am considering going through the  R3 admission process this year else R1 for the next intake. 

**Background**

**¬∑ Work experience:**

10 months - Development Officer with a prominent Cricket club in the Big Bash League (BBL- Second largest Twenty 20 cricket league in the world) and Women's BBL

1 year ‚Äì Consultant at a Boutique Sustainability Consultancy

1 year and 8 months ‚Äì Senior Consultant at a Big 4 with their Corporate responsibility &amp; Climate Change services team (Clients included the largest property, energy, mining companies as well as government and NGOs) 

7 Months - Program &amp; Risk Manager for the Invictus Games Sydney 2018 

Currently (1 year and 2 months) - Group Environment &amp; Sustainability Manager for the largest transport and tourism company in Australia &amp; New Zealand

Other experiences: Internships at the largest Indian oil company and also the largest Oil company in the world (from Saudi Arabia)

**¬∑ School:**

Did my schooling from an International school in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (brought up in Saudi Arabia)

**¬∑ Undergrad degree/major:** 

Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from a top university in India

**¬∑ Master's Degree/major:**

Master of Engineering in Energy Planning &amp; Policy

Master of Engineering Management

Both from a top Australian University (not Group of 8) - Received admits from group of 8 but chose to go with the degree taught by a renowned industry faculty member

&amp;#x200B;

**¬∑ Extracurricular:** 

Black Belt and multiple time world champion in a martial art form (received black belt from the Grand-master of that martial art form)

Played professional cricket for 2 years

Level 4 FIFA football referee

Industry mentor and career mentor to business grads at my university

National level high school basketball player

There are other initiatives that I have been a part of that I can't disclose here but will include in my application to Universities

&amp;#x200B;

**¬∑ Race/nationality:** Indian /Australian

**¬∑ Sex:** Male

**¬∑ Age:** 28

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

¬∑ GMAT Score: 650 (cancelled score) - retaking in February to boost admission chances

¬∑ Undergrad GPA: First Class - 4.0 US GPA 

¬∑ Master's GPA: 
Masters 1- 2.25 US GPA
Masters 2 - 2.63 US GPA 

&amp;#x200B;

**MBA Info**

¬∑ Goal of MBA: Climate change and sustainability professionals have increased in number, but I want to take the next evolutionary step by using an MBA degree to step into the executive suite. Further learn business skills at school and also from the cohort, that are traditionally applied to for-profit organizations, be it operations, strategy, marketing and contextualize it towards a low carbon/carbon negative future. 

Post MBA industry: Sustainable energy, transport, tech industries. Sustainable Investment, consulting

¬∑ Target schools: M7 (main target is Stanford), Fuqua, LBS, Oxford Said

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Concerns**

My endgame is to return to Australia after working in the US for 2-4 years. Therefore require an internationally recognized MBA degree to facilitate my job search in Australia then.

Australians don't have to worry about H1b visa, as we have the E3 visa, which is comparatively easy to acquire. However, in the unpredictable world of immigration, do you reckon having a STEM accredited MBA is better? 

How tough would it be for me to get into HBS, Stanford and Wharton? 

Is it advantageous to be studying in Stanford or Haas over for eg HBS or Wharton in terms of getting an internship/job as California is at the forefront of sustainability?

I would prefer applying for R3 than R1 next intake, as I don't want to wait another year + myself and my wife want to start a family in 3-4 years time. Would love to hear your thoughts on my chances with R3. Hoping my non traditional background helps in R3.

Thanks!!"
epeopa,2,2020-01-16,Internship Final Protect,thisbobo,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/epeopa/internship_final_protect/,"I'm in the last semester of my AS for Computer Programming and Analysis. Aside from my Learning Objectives for the actual internship job I have a final project where I need to design a tech support ticketing system. I can use any language I've learned to create the interface and it needs to be connected to a database. It sounds like a good, viable project for what I've been taught overall; challenging but doable.

My concern is the database aspect. I took a SQL class, but that was nearly two years ago. It was not something I gained a great understanding of. Can anyone suggest some links I might start with to read up and gain some reference? Maybe just point me in a direction of what to work with? For the program I'll be designing I have working knowledge of Python, Java, C# and I'll be brushing up on C++. JavaScript is another language course I took, but that was a while ago and I'm in the process of re-learning it.

My understanding is that there are three basic parts to this:

 1. Front End (likely a GUI)

2. Back End (the structure of the program itself)

3. Database (and how it connects to the program)

With the languages I have to work with can I use SQL with any of them? I think I would be most competent with building this with C# or Python. I love Java, but my Java design skills with GUIs is very rusty.

Any help helps."

Due to my 1 class load I can work full time 8 months til August begins the fall semester.

 I finished up internship experience prior at a very large medical facility last month that has a lot of push power to get me a job once I graduate. As of now, however, I'm working a normal $15 an hour college kid job. It does enough to pay all my bills and save some as well. 

My roommate mentioned to me a position to work roofing construction these 8 months for $21 an hour. If I penny pinch just right I'll be able to save enough to pay all my bills and most if not all my tuition with that job in those 8 months. This means I can go to school fully and not need to work.

On the other hand, I have an interview on Monday for an internship at another equally large company as a Systems Analyst. I haven't discussed pay, but i can assume $11-13 is probably a good bet based on my last internship. That's a pay cut compared to either non internship job. This means I won't be able to save enough to not need to work in the school year. 

Is an internship valuable enough to forgo those jobs? Would skipping the internship be worth all the stress I avoid devoting all my time to only school?"

I hear my housemates/classmates/friends say things like: ‚ÄúSo-and-so is already applying for med school as a fourth year.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh yeah, you said you already got another internship for this summer.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting so-and-so club or volunteering for whatever.‚Äù

It also doesn‚Äôt feel great when I‚Äôm in discussion or something and people get the right answers when I can‚Äôt even start the problem, or if I try going to office hours for help, my prof or TA get visibly frustrated.

The worst part is I don‚Äôt even know what to do for a career except that I would like to do research but my prof said you have to be the best of the best and clearly I‚Äôm not there.

I know most of you guys will just tell me to change my mindset or try some different way to study, but what the hell does someone do when they‚Äôre completely lost in life (academically/career-wise)? Is it ok to feel ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù? It seems the amount of purpose I feel in life deteriorates as I get older. I just want to excel at something and turn it into a career, but I feel like I‚Äôm not smart enough to get there."

I went to college without knowing what I wanted, I just majored in computer science cuz it was a common major, but I didn't really know much about it. I started coding and liked the first class, then afterwards I hated it and started to just look up solutions to submit my school projects, kept doing that until now, and now I'm a junior. I feel like shit I can't even do interviews problems like leetcode, even though I have taken a data structures class. 
It is kinda like a love hate relationship.
I hate that I do not know anything in programming, but I would love to. It wasn't until know that I have realized I should really learn programming cuz I'm taking hard classes and I do not wanna use the internet anymore to find solutions.

So please, guide me what do I need to do to catch up? I want to work on my object oriented and datastrucuteres skills.

When I try to do interview problems, it is like I don't know how to start and I don't know what to write even the easy ones on leetcode.
What do I need to do to improve my skills and really be good at it?

Are there any good online classes? Good projects I can work on?
I'm taking this seriously I wanna have a internship in a big company in the next few months!

I'm in the middle of studying CS with one eye on grad school afterwards and another on going into industry. Due to some personal issues I'm going to have trouble being available enough to do an internship/RAship. I'd rather not go into details but think location/medical issues, inflexible hours, etc.

Anyway, what I do have the time for is working on my own side projects and/or getting stuck into an open source project and working with the community there. I'm keen to do this but I wanted to ask how much it substitutes for formal experience - whether as an industry intern or RA - when it comes to job hunting or grad school apps? If I graduate with no internships but solid personal projects/open source contributions would that be as helpful in getting a job? Or in getting to grad school?

Thanks!"

We talk alot for the next month, our first date was in August. I lied to my mom, I said i was only playing with a friend.

The date went fine, we kept seeing each other for the next month or two. It's september, I didn't I cannot lie to my parents anymore, I told them i will go to nottingham to meet M, I said i will leave nottingham at 9pm to go back home. As my house was 60 miles away.

9pm comes, I get multiple phone calls and text messages from both my older sister and mom. I took a uber home at 11 oclock, I lied to them saying it was a free uber ride. I get home, she started shouting at me, saying Im late and a 'good girl' will ask you to go home earlier. little did they know, I'm that bad guy.

For some content, I always had quite a sheltered life, i always wondered why during my secondary school period, I had so little friends. Only going to university did i have more freedom. In secondary school, friends will ask me for sleepovers and parties, I would ask my mom, she will immediately say no. I would have to go home straight from school, no afterschool socials with friends. After a few times of saying NO (because of my mom), they would eventually leave me out.

When i was 18, i started uni. I would party until morning, i would drink alcohol. I made some real friends. As there were no curfews, i could go anyways, I go london, I went to europe. i didnt have to tell my mom. Second year comes, I met this beautiful japanese international student, Y. 

Our first date was seeing black panther together, see then had appointment the next day in london, as i didn't have class i went aswell. In london, as we were crossing the road, I held her hands, which she accepts. we hit of from there. so for the next 3 months, we were at each other accommodation, we slept together, we were like married couples. then summer comes, she had to go Japan for 3 months.

I couldnt go Japan as i have found a summer intern, but Y did come back briefly, she was gonna come nottingham to arrange something. I asked my mom, I'm seeing a friend, I didnt specify that it was a girl. my mom wouldn't let me go, and shouted at me for wasting money. Y has bought chocolate from japan from me, which i could accept. I didn't have the courage to go. We kinda just went seperate ways after then. I knew it hurt her so badly. During friends gatherings, she would still completely ignore me. I'm so sorry.

one year later, I graduated, found a marketing job 9-5pm monday to friday job. Shortly, I met M online as mentioned above. I didnt have the courage to tell my mom, that I have already dated M quite a few times. During xmas period I lied again, to see her to treat her. We share the same airbnb room together, we even traded gifts. I gave M a necklace, she gave me a motivation box, with heartful messages, about me information, 18+ jokes etc. She is leaving in January to do half a year placement in canada, she is still a student.

Comes last week, I booked 2 days off from work. I told my boss my missus is leaving for 6/7 months so i'm gonna see her off in heath throw airport. which everyone in the office understood. I didnt have the courage to tell my mom, but i thought being honest was the best way to go.

After work, I phone called her. Mom i booked 2 days off for M and we are gonna share the same hotel room. Silent. I immediately knew she is mad. I drove home, then i met with WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR HOLIDAYS on a girl you saw since September ( she doesnt know i know her since July), A 'good' girl wouldnt invite you to a hotel room, You gonna end up having sex (we have already shared airbnb room together), M is just playing with you, she is scamming you, you know how much a broken heart can hurt, I won't let you go to see her off. We had a huge arguement for the next 2 hours, I was trying to say shes leaving for 7 months, I just want to see her off as a nice gesture. All i got back was, are you guys actually together yet? Are you that horny? You should be focusing on work first.

I thought the best way to approach this was to just say FINE i see her off at nottingham train station (i perpared a gift for M). This lasted 2 days with my mom. Today after dinner, she asked, Are you still contacting M, are you still going to see M. I said, of course. Again, my mom kept saying she is not a good girl, she is a whore she is a slut, how can a girl that only know you for 3 months giving you gifts and saying horny stuff to you?! She will only leave you, plus when she graduates she has a better job that you etc.

I threw the box that M gave me away, I didn't want to. but mom i want to tell you this.

no, im not a virgin

no, M is not my first love, in fact I dated quite a few people during uni, some I ghosted some just didnt click.

I drink alcohol, so much that i pass out, puke up. I tried smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

What very normal part of a western white upbringing, is seem to be a 'hellish' thing in chinese hong kong culture. I grew up in the UK when i was 4. Those things are normal to me, my mom and older sister has a very tradiational view, no sex before marriage, no holding hands before official relationship etc.

I held M hands already, it felt right. It felt comfortable, because i do like her. However it something i cannot tell my mom. Even meeting with friends, i have butterflies in my stomach because it will go through my sister and my mom.

those 2days holidays i booked for M, my mom said i should have asked her for approval, a family discussion, not me doing it first then telling her.

She is way too overprotective, overbearing on my life. she keep wanting me to be a standard typical asian boy. Im 23 this year, I took the easy way out. I agreed to her, I couldnt stop the shouting, the nagging, the guilt tripping from my mom.

Its not the first time. Im sorry Y, and im sorry M that i cannot make it to london. I know there is nothing stopping me from going not physically. I probably wont even be able to see you off at the train station next week before you go to canada.

I feel utter useless, during the argurments/shouting with my mom. she will always say don't lie to me. but has she once thought WHY I HAVE TO LIE. I'm so tired, I want to be honest, this is the second time now it happened.

I don't have the courage to move out, and even if i do i have to give 33.3% of my wage to her as ÂÆ∂Áî®. I miss my univerrsity days where there was so much freedom, no curfews.

Yes reddit, I will have to move out soon. idk. it just my western friends that are also 22 years old, they seem so much mature and free to do whatever they want.

Pretty quickly I‚Äôd be making over the average household income within the US. If I had some success and started making money off of commission I could be making 6 figures within 5 years. If one of my family members step down I‚Äôd absorb a portion of his $200,000 salary. Within 8-12 years I could see myself making $300,000+. If things don‚Äôt goes as well, a 6 figure salary is still largely expected. 15-20 years I could sell the company or hire management and make millions. 

Sorry to go into detail about the numbers but I wanted everyone to get an idea of the financials. Part of the issue is me and my father don‚Äôt have a great relationship. It‚Äôs not particularly bad but I don‚Äôt enjoy spending a ton of time with him. Also he holds over my head a lot that he has given me so much. He can be very degrading and has a large ego. I also don‚Äôt necessarily like insurance although I do like the the freedom you have as an agent. I‚Äôm having a hard time making a decision on wether I should choose to begin working at my family‚Äôs company or find a field I enjoy more. I‚Äôm interested in the marketing aspect of tourism, film (production) and am mostly interested in business as a whole. 

The family business offers security as well as the ability to set myself up for life financially. I also could quit at any time. But I‚Äôm not interested in insurance and I do think I would struggle at least initially being an insurance agent and working with my father. However I do have the freedom in insurance that many jobs don‚Äôt have. 
Paving my own path and finding a career field I have more passion in is exciting but obviously doesn‚Äôt offer the benefit that the family business does. 

I‚Äôm basically just asking for advice on my decision. I feel guilty at times thinking about not joining the family business. Many people would do a whole lot more for less money. What would you do?"

Her living situation is very volatile. She shares a room with her pregnant 24 year old sister who among other recent developments has threatened to send people to beat my friend up and kill her cat. 

Within the last year her brother tried to use nude pictures he received from a girl to blackmail her into sex and in a separate incident he almost ran over a 17 year old kid that he scammed in a drug deal. 

This is seemingly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for her and the area where she lives. Things came to a breaking point on Christmas when she had a disagreement with her father and he punched her in the face. I saw the results and it wasn‚Äôt pretty. 

Earlier last year her father moved out of the house due to fighting with his wife but still comes by often as the house is in his name (personally I think he just moved out as a stunt). 
Despite him always being there, my friend has tried to avoid him as much as possible after the incident on Christmas, which her father and her sister have labeled as ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù.

In what seems like something straight out of an abusers playbook the father is now threatening to force my friend to pay rent or leave the house unless she spends time with him and starts showing respect. 

He does own the house. I understand that completely but this girl is so close to being done with college and being able to just leave the area once and for all. I‚Äôm concerned that her only options are to defer her education and leave to a safer place or be economically forced to spend time with a violent person who‚Äôs excuse for hitting her consisted of telling her that he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt realize she was a grown woman‚Äù.

I don't want to decline the offer, because there is a very reasonable chance that both big Ns are going to reject me, but I know if I accept it and I get an offer from one of those companies I am certainly going to take the better offer (considering it will likely pay double what they're willing to give me on top of being better experience). 

What is my best option - obviously I am going to try and get a deadline extension if I can, but is it ethical to accept the offer knowing I might renege?"
epr9wr,0,2020-01-16,A rollercoaster of a story and a unique position. I'm an analyst in need of advice.,WhoisJohnFaust,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/epr9wr/a_rollercoaster_of_a_story_and_a_unique_position/,"I'm in a bizarre position. I'm an analyst at heart; I see patterns in data sets. I'm three credits away from an economics bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University (the Mormon church owns the school), but I can't go back because I no longer believe the claims of the church and that is a requirement.  While I was there, I started the website measurement department as an analyst and grew the department to a team of 6 I managed. I built a great team there. While I was doing that for 32 hours a week, I had also parleyed a policy analyst internship into creating a moderately successful podcast at a policy think tank.

My wife found a great job at Stanford, so I came out to the Bay Area to support her.  They weren't teaching the last class I needed for another year, but I lost my faith in the meantime. For the record, I don't regret coming out here at all.  After some time, I got a low-level contract analyst gig at Google on the Customer Service Incubation Team.

Essentially, any launching or pre-launch Google product with a premium customer service component needs SOP, metric benchmarks, and other resources before we outsourced the projects overseas.

At Google, there is a 20% rule. It means that you can spend 20% of your time on something you feel is worth your time. I noticed that the way they were hiring could have been more efficient, so I came up with ""Project Top Gun"" and presented it to my boss.  It was implemented and showed some real results in curbing turnover; they promoted me to the site-wide analyst for the bay area incubation team. Now I oversaw nine teams, which meant I crunched the numbers, built the reports, and counseled on the big decisions with the project stakeholders. It was pretty great; I was the guy in the chair they could point to and say, ""can you show us the customer satisfaction numbers for these channels for this period?: and then I would present it on screen.  I had some subject matter experts working with me and helping me as well for their specific products.

While there, I discovered a statistical anomaly and commissioned a deep dive into the root cause. It was probably the thing I am most proud of in my career. I don't want to get into the specifics, but it is a pretty great story that involved a ton of spreadsheets and translating the BMW infotainment technical manual from German. Long story short, we found the problem, and we gave the product team a pretty kick-ass report that led to actual change.

About this time, I received an accidental email from a director-level executive asking my opinion on a project idea document.  I figured that the email wasn't actually for me, but I had some ideas on the content, so I added a comment saying, ""I don't think you meant to send me this email, but I have some thoughts.""  The response I got was, ""No, this is absolutely for you; let's hear those thoughts.""  I posted my thoughts, and the director loved them. Three months of commenting back and forth on this design document, I decided to ask for the sale. I inquired if he was putting a team together and making the project a reality, and he said he was and that we would take a meeting to talk about it the next day. When I didn't see the meeting on my calendar, I knew that my suspicions were probably correct and that I had received the initial email mistakenly.  I contacted his assistant about the lack of invitation and discovered the mix-up. Someone else had a very similar name. I was a little let-down, but I knew I had to talk to the Director right away. When I spoke to him, we got through the initial confusion of who  I was and told him this very story up until this point. He had me meet with his right hand to see if there was a place for me in strategy for this upcoming project.

After some interviewing, I was in charge of digital badging for this project on a cross-functional scrum team as a diet program manager. We built the strategy, the design language, generated all of the design documents, etc. It was pretty great. We finished our assignment in 6 months, but the rest of the project wasn't ready. So for three months, we future-proofed the process and built all of the submission procedures for badges. About this time, we realized that my contract was about to be up. Due to my unique journey getting there, they didn't have a plan for when my team was finished and chose not to renew my contract.  I didn't even have two weeks' notice.

Each of my promotions doubled my pay; I started at $15/hr. It has been four months since I started looking for a job, and I need to find something, but I also don't want to sell myself short.  I don't know what to do. I was only a program manager for nine months officially. I was only at Google for two years, and no one seems to want a program manager with less than a year experience, even if it was at Google (also though I was a contractor, so my paycheck came from a different company). I am just really lost and need your advice. I am scared, and my unemployment is running out soon.

What types of jobs should I be looking for, and where should I look? What advice do you have for me?"

I'm still unsure of what to do next, although I'm interested in the areas of Cybersecurity, Software Development and Data Science. I'm starting to look into some jobs to do next semester(due to my school workload being very small), in order to gain experience in the area.

Now, a friend of mine told me about this Microsoft Internship program, called Aspire, and the application deadline is in a few months. This seems like a really good opportunity so I'm going to try hard to get into it, and I was wondering if any of you guys got any tips or advice in regards to how I can boost my chances of getting accepted. In terms of requirements they don't require much technical ones, it's mostly soft skills.

As I come from an IT course, I've been exposed to a lot of areas(Networking, Development, AI) but never had to focus on any in particular. Never had an internship(although in my country this is the standard) or any formal work experience of the sort. I'm planning to develop some side projects to upload to github, get heavy into linux and join HackTheBox in the next few months to strengthen my skillset. 

Thanks for the help."

I don't know how to start. So here goes. Just looking some type of assurance or something to help me with the fact that even if I spending 7 years in undergraduate engineering degree that I will have a career after. 

I'm supposed to be in 4th year  but in reality I'm still doing 2nd year courses ( it has taken me 1.5 years to finish my 1st year) This is all because I have gotten probation few times now. 
 
It's not like I'm don't understand the stuff and I do get it ( I know that my situation doesn't speak for itself) . It's just that I have bad study habits and I know that and I'm doing my best to fix it. 

Currently, I'm doing a 12 month internship at an amazing company , I'm learning alot and applying my skills. But there's a part of that feels like (maybe cause I'm brown and fear of letting down my parents expectations, I don't want disappoint them either as they have done so much for me )that I'm still a failure, even though my friends have said that I am not. 

TL;DR : Should be in 4th year but in 2nd year. Currently in a 12 month internship and still have to complete most of 2nd year courses and rest years. Will I have career even if I spending 7 years studying undergraduate engineering ( from the year I started) ."

Hi, I‚Äôm a U2 Computer Science student. Recently I am thinking about doing a side project for personal interests (or even better, to put on my resume). I have found some interesting open-source projects that use Python and react to scrape data from a sports website. I am interested in adding more juice to it. It‚Äôs still an ill-conceived idea but I would love to develop it to something real. Of course, we can think of something completely new but interesting.

Here is a little bit about myself:

1. I am currently taking a year off in Toronto working at a multi-national tech company as a software engineer intern (I‚Äôm omitting the company name cos I don‚Äôt want to be recognised by my friends)
2. My commitment to this project would be 10-15 hours per week.
3. My GPA isn‚Äôt at the top but above average.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope to find someone (1-2 partners) who has the following characteristics:

1. Having a strong passion for doing a personal project. 
2. Having 10 - 15 hours‚Äô commitment per week to this project.
3. Fine with working remotely, since I am in Ontario for the whole year.
4. Having experience in software development.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a good place to find a teammate but do directly message me if you are interested. Also, if you know someone who‚Äôs interested in doing a project, you may as well tell him/her to join me!"

So about three months ago my school had a career fair in which I got an interview at a well known healthcare company for a summer internship. I was pretty happy that i got the opportunity to interview because a lot of my friends didn‚Äôt get one. I had the first interview the day after the career fair with some former students who are currently working at said healthcare company and after they said they wanted me to come onsite and do a second round of interviews. 

At the second interview I was in a room with three people each person asked me a question and the first couple minutes went just as great as the first interview.  It wasn‚Äôt until The third person asked me a question, ‚Äúname a time you helped someone become healthier and how did you do it‚Äù.  I mentioned how I helped my grandparents get to a healthy weight by teaching them to cook healthy foods and excercise. His response is what bothered me, I‚Äôm an Black male and he said ‚Äúyea you can‚Äôt eat fried chicken everyday and try to balance that out with the occasional watermelon‚Äù. 

After he said that the room got really awkward and the other two people just looked at him and after a brief pause just said that they didn‚Äôt have anymore questions and asked if I had any.  I was pretty shocked for two reasons. One I honestly hate assuming everything comes back to the color that I am and I don‚Äôt want to be the person who just claims racism at everything so I honestly was thinking he has to be joking or maybe that‚Äôs just the foods his family ate growing up and it had nothing to do with my color and two I just couldn‚Äôt believe, even if he was being racist, that it would be so blatant, like this is a job interview there is just no way someone would say that. Anyway i just quietly said no and the guy then said ‚Äúgreat, we can finally get these interviews moving fast.‚Äù 

He then told me I could leave and to close the door behind me. When I looked at the clock my interview was 7 minutes long, I was scheduled down for 15 and out of everyone in my group I‚Äôm the only person that left early and I was the only black person interviewing( honestly not uncommon at my school there are very few Black CS majors). I guess my question is, should I learn to expect this kind of behavior and is it common? I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of racism in my life and just being a CS major.  Usually it‚Äôs just small comments about how well spoken I am and that I‚Äôm smarter than most people expect or that I understand things better than the ‚Äúother ones‚Äù. I just didn‚Äôt expect it from a billion dollar healthcare company. 

TLDR: am a black guy, had an interview where I got asked a question on how I helped someone get healthier, interview responded with ‚Äúyea you can‚Äôt eat fried chicken everyday and try to balance that out with the occasional watermelon‚Äù

Edit: I‚Äôm in America on the east coast

Edit 2: so I just woke up for my 8 am class and did not expect this many comments. I separated the text up a bit(sorry I was on mobile and very tired).

I have decided to do what a lot of the comments suggested and report his behavior. I set up an appointment with my career center and have begun composing an email to HR. I don‚Äôt want anyone else feeling singled out or hurt by someone else‚Äôs comment so it just seems like the right thing to do. 

For the people who messaged me and talked about how I should have responded violently. Responding in violence to racist comments is never the answer. The only thing you will achieve is proving the image they have of you is correct and you will hurt any chance of any real change happening. The best thing to do is be the bigger person and respond intelligently and appropriately. Is that fair ? No, but sometimes what is fair and what is the right thing to do, do not align. 

Thank you everyone for the encouraging comments and I‚Äôm excited to try again at my schools upcoming career fair."

Problem is I think this business is a hot mess. They‚Äôre a medium-sized business in a pretty niche market but most everyone on the administration side is a son/daughter/in-law of the founder.

epvd0h,1,2020-01-16,School or No School? What do I actually need?,AGingerOfReddit,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/epvd0h/school_or_no_school_what_do_i_actually_need/,"So I turned 31 last year. I graduated Uni in 2010 with a B.A. in English (minor in Multimedia Communications). I've worked several jobs since then, namely, Digital Content Manager for a small app company, Production Associate for a large (third largest in the world) book publisher, Middle School English Teacher, and, most recently, a warehouse manager for my friends' business. After failing as a Production Associate and just plain giving up as an English teacher (I can explain more about that if anyone asks), I've decided to essentially kick my B.A. degree in English to the curb and try something different.

I've always been into computers and after doing some research, I discovered that Systems Administrators can make some fairly decent money fairly quickly (better than teaching anyway). I decided to enroll into my local technical college for some networking courses and I'm currently in my second semester. I'm liking the courses so far, I'm learning a lot, and I've even secured an internship at a local school as an IT intern, but I have some nagging questions in the back of my mind that maybe someone could help me answer.

The plan I'm enrolled in is currently for an Associates degree in Computer Networking and Systems Administration, and, if I stick with the program, I ought to be finished in a year and a half. The way I see it, I don't need an Associates degree. I have a B.A. Which, granted, begs the question, ""Why didn't you go for a Master's degree then?"" Honestly, because I have no knowledge (no employable knowledge anyway) about computers and networking, and a Master's degree would assume that I had basic, working, Bachelor's degree level of knowledge in computers, which I don't have. I'm starting from the bottom. The way I see it, I need the knowledge, but not the degree.

This leads me to my next point. In the first semester, I took classes in A+, Network+, and Client OS. I passed each course well enough and now have sufficient resources and study materials to take my A+ and Network+ exams on my own. This semester's courses consist of CCENT, Linux+, and Implementing Network Servers.

My end goal is to cut my teeth in this industry by becoming a System Admin for a school district. I believe this is what I genuinely want to do. But would it be worth it to stay with my Associate degree program to secure that job, or would it be enough to get my certs and apply? Would the Associates degree open more doors for me in the future (should I decide to leave that future Systems Admin job), or would studying and taking cert exams on my own and my experience alone be enough to open doors?

Tl;dr, is it better to stick with an Associates degree in CNS for another year and a half, or should I just take my (eventual) certs and little experience and apply for a System's Admin job at a school district right away?"

I'm an undergraduate student at a Brazilian university that is well renowned in the country but not so much worldwide. I'm studying astrophysics but would like to work with AI related topics (which is something I'm already doing through an internship). 

My problem is: during my two first years I didn't get the best grades, resulting in me being a B-C student. And I'd like to go and study/work abroad, maybe getting a scholarship for my master's degree or something like that (looking mainly at China right now, I'm doing what I can trying to learn Mandarin :v).

Since my area of interest doesn't use so much physics, I was wondering: would it be better for me to change my major to computer science (something I'm really interested in) and have to go through the introductory courses again while trying to get at a more prestigious university. Or would I be better off just finishing the physics major (trying to get better grades :v) and then apply to a master's degree in an AI related area?

Thanks :)"

Recently I've been getting questions from people (I've got about 50 in total)  on LinkedIn asking for help with their careers. 

Some of them take the time to explain what exactly they want from me. If it's specifically about my alma mater or previous job(s), I do try and give a response. 

But many of them are random people saying ""sir i am doing MBA from xyz institute, please give advice for internships and jobs"". Or ""I am in my 3rd year of b.tech please give tips to apply abroad"" (I didn't do my master's in India). 

No where on my profile have I mentioned that I'm open to giving advice of any sort, btw.

I'm somewhat in two minds over this. On the one hand, I don't want to respond because... well it takes time and I have a lot of things on my plate. This is particularly true for those who ask vague questions. 

On the other hand I do sympathise with such people because I could have also done with some advice when I was in their shoes. 

I've stopped responding to questions for the time being. Do let me know what you think!"

We used our own laptops and I was pretty much working on the project individually, so right now only my machine is set up to launch the app. In other words, when I left, no one in the company has the app ""installed"".

Now they'd like to start using the app. To use it, it's just installing the packages and running the python script, so I added instructions on how to do that in the Github.

Problem is, they don't have a full time developer and since I left, they haven't really gotten an intern replacement. The ones needing to use the app are not familiar with installing Python, adding it to PATH, etc.

They're asking me to guide them through the entire process of setting it up. Right now they can't install the packages, so I'm guessing it's something to do with the Python installation or PATH.

Am I obligated (legally or morally) to help them out? This past month after I left, they had already gotten me to add a new feature, so now I'm wondering if I'm right to be annoyed."

The reason why I'm targeting March/April is because I'll be done with all the AP Computer Science A Curriculum , hopefully rise up in USACO placements, and get more experience in Python in general. I live in the Bay Area so I know there are a lot of connections and a ton of start ups near me. But when I look at job postings, they seem to have no deadline on the post so I'm unsure if companies will take down their internship posts when I look in March/April.

&amp;#x200B;

I am willing to work for minimum wage so yea. Also I have this one ""safety"" internship in which a good chunk of people get accepted into because they specifically accept high school students and they aren't really selective about it because I've known people with little to no experience in cs and business get those internships. But I want to try  (and hopefully succeed fingers crossed) to get into any other company like a startup/fast growing company. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I know that some companies value college gpa and some value programming experience more.  But I'll just do a tldr of my stats just in case (I know most companies don't give a shit about sat/hs gpa once ur in college) : 4.1W gpa, 3.67 UW gpa, 6AP's soph/junior year, 800 math 2, and 1500+ sat.

Wasn't able to get any internships because my GPA was too low (was battling depression and had entire semesters where I would just stop going). Spent 6 months looking for work/internships/anything using recruiters and hunting on my own. Couldn't get a single interview. 

Moved to Korea to teach English, partially because I wanted to live here, partially because I couldn't find work. Ended up really loving it here and have stayed.

This year, I applied to graduate school for my Masters but was rejected, again because of the low GPA. I again tried to hit up some recruiters (this time in Seoul), but none of them would take me because I have ""no relevant/marketable experience"". I'm 34 years old (which according to the recruiters was also a problem since companies want ""young junior developers"") and can't afford to go back to the states and take a year of no pay doing an internship (if I could even find one).

I have a modest portfolio and have been going through codebooks on the weekends learning new things, but with new grads coming out with more experience than me thanks to internships, etc. I can't seem to find anything anywhere.

Am I doomed to just be a dead end teacher forever?"

I was given 1 hour to print the fibonacci sequence for n integers input by the user.
For example, user enters 5 I print 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.

So that was all good and I got it done in like 6 mins, and the interviewers came in to review it.

. They said I shouldn't have created an array because its inefficient as I was only asked to print out the code.
. They also said the name fib for the array was kind of unclear and that I could have used the whole word.
. Also pointed out things like putting a space between ) and {.
. Said my method name printFibonacci was a bit misleading and could have been 2 methods since I also calculated it. 

As much as I appreciate the advice to clean up the code, as a year 2 student intern you are still only at the stage of writing functioning code and not completely clean code. I feel quite disheartened after leaving and was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this in an interview and if so, what was the follow up like? Did you get the job?

Thanks for listening!

Now completely lost...again,ongoingcrisis26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/eq3580/quit_my_job_due_to_anxiety_now_completely/,"I feel like I've been here so many times. I don't even know what to do anymore. I'm 26F, thought I wanted to be a doctor my whole life. Got accepted to medical school. Had massive anxiety about committing/moving away from family that caused me to defer and then ultimately withdraw my acceptance. Been a mess ever since. Next, got myself into a nursing program that I didn't even want to do before I started. Withdrew before losing any tuition money. Was lost again, saw that human resources would be a good fit for my personality type (INFJ). Got an HR intern job that I loved mostly because of my coworkers and the flexibility (25 hours/week), but I needed something full time. Got a full time benefits coordinator job. I hated it so much. I'd have 3 hours of monotonous work to fill an 8 hour day, and felt incredibly suffocated working 9 to 6 in a cubicle. I tried to push through it because I was getting tired of always quitting, ended up getting massive anxiety, crying before work, dreading Mondays on Saturday mornings. Ultimately quit because I was so unhappy, and would have eventually been fired because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm lost again. I'm fortunate that I'll never be homeless. But this doesn't feel good. I went from getting into medical school to applying for Medicaid. I'm terrified of being trapped in another 9-5 cubicle job, so there goes 90% of my job prospects. I still have a part time waitressing gig at my parents restaurant, but is that really it for me? I wanted so much out of life, but having generalized anxiety disorder takes me from being unhappy to absolutely miserable about a situation, until I can't stand it anymore.

I started Lexapro, and I'm on day 3, and all its done for me is give me morning panic attacks. I want, desperately, to start building a life I'm happy with, but I don't even know what that would look like anymore. I feel like SUCH a loser. And I'm aggravated with myself. Why can't I just stick it out in something like a normal person?? Where do I even go from here?"

I'm sort of torn here and I'm looking for some advice. I'm 30 yo and working on getting my BS in Computer Science. I work part-time at T-Mobile doing retail sales. Lately, I've felt conflicted on what I'd like to do with my life.

Part of me wants to follow a plan I laid out. Spend the next year or two finishing up on my bachelors, put up with the BS (pun intended) doing retail sales until I can find an internship and hopefully after graduation grab a job as a software developer. I figure with IT, it's a solid industry with plenty of growth and decent pay. My dad had a few friends who'd help me out get started.

On the other hand, I've had some offer for some sales jobs right now for LGI Homes. Base salary is alright, but commission makes the job fairly lucrative. I know it's not as simple as cashing the checks in and calling it a day. But I do pretty well at my current job, but I've sort of hit as far as I can go. Not to mention recent changes in the commission structure has reduced my commissions quite a bit and caps make what I use to make literally impossible.

**So what should I do?** I can't stand retail sales. I mean I can. But now that they've cut our pay and the market has become somewhat saturated. I feel like it's a dead end. I feel confident I could do new home sales and make some good money out of it. I am worried about the long term however.

At this point in my life, I'd like to make money. Lots of money and I don't really care how. I'd like to travel too. But I realize that's not all that it's cracked up to be. I'm scared if I take this sales job, I'll make good money, but maybe lose out on money down the road. I'm also worried what's next after this (room for growth, as cliche as that sounds). On the other hand, I'm scared I'll end up in software engineering and hate the office 9-5 life. I'm already 30, thankfully no family, but I don't feel like I can really afford one career change after another.

At this point, I just want to have enough money (well lots of money lol) and to be able to enjoy it, too.

If anybody has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. I seek advice in different subs to minimal or no replies. If you know something about either one of these jobs, or know where I'm coming from, I would really appreciate any and all advice you could offer.

Thanks!"

Tl;dr at the bottom.

I am a senior in Nuclear Engineer, and I have an offer for 25/hr (max they can do, already asked) for a summer internship at a company I want to work for. They will not hire directly to full time (already asked) but have made it sound like full time would likely be available as soon as my internship ends. They also made it sound like a full time employment working there is likely either a GS-12 or GS-13 (86k or 100k) salary. 

On the other hand it is only January and most offers in my field go out later in the year. Just today I spoke to a recruiter that said to call her back in March for an interview for a full time job. I expect most offers I would get to be about 70k salary as that is standard for the field. The recruiter also said that she would not like to see a internship after senior year and would rather see full time work (although she is probably bias).

**Tl;dr I am a senior graduating in May. Should I accept a 25/hr internship and deal with uncertainty for a higher paying full time offer after completing it. Or turn down the internship and hope for a full time offer later in the year. The full time offer after the internship will likely pay better than what I can get now.**"

If you haven't read my previous posts, they can be found [here for the first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/e07wla/rolling_out_hopefully_part_one_of_god_knows_how/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), [here for the second](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/e9ttjy/rolling_out_part_two_of_who_knows_maybe_a_thousand/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and [here for the third](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ej2wnm/rolling_out_part_three_of_hopefully_less_than_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), but long story short, I'm part of a team doing the swap from win7 to win10, and our management is awful.

So, not much changed after the last update, no one got thrown under a bus, and that's why I haven't posted anything in a while. But today, oh boy, I am fuming. 

Let's set up the scene: Me, Junior tech, is covering for my Senior, which is taking a deserved rest after weeks of stress and exhaustion. So, I'm responsible for updating the excel spreadsheet, format machines and answer our supervisor and contract manager, while also doing stuff for the users (And not earning a penny more for all of that, great.)

We have been having problems with our servers, one of them being that it is quite uncommon for any machine to start formatting before 11:00 AM, which makes no sense, and no one knows why (My bet is that the server is actually an intern pressing ""OK"" whenever there is a request to format a machine).

But, here I am, and after waiting forever, all of them started... At 11:00, like always. No biggie, I thought, nothing unusual there. Oh boy. My supervisor, a little after the machines went up, asks for a meeting with the entire team.

We all know that when such a request is made, it is not to give praises or to give a suggestion.

Such meeting just ended, and to summarize it all, he was basically implying that we were slacking off, just to try and prorrogate our contract.

... Seriously? The ones who walk about five to nine kilometers a day, carrying desktops under their arms, complaining about pain in the end of the day, but still doing their jobs? ***We are slacking off?***

I had to hold myself to not scream at his face that:  

A: His servers are shit.  

B: He gave us about 50 machines to start the project, which contemplates almost a thousand machines, and he expected 20+ swaps each day.  

C: We are not allowed to format old user machines before the user validates the change, but, as we all know, you can't expect an user to comply with any instructions.  

D: Some users have 100GB, 120GB of data, which takes forever to transfer to an external HD, then to their new machine, so, you can see why this would hurt our productivity.

I only argued with him about the time it takes to backup data, and how some machines have 10+ users, which have to be backed up individually, with either the user, or his password, since our ""Administrator"" account can't copy user data.

Right now I'm sitting in the office, writing this and calming myself down listening to some music, because that pissed me off.

Anyways, sorry about the rant, had to vent about all of this bullshit that is happening right now.

Ah, also, as said before, my contract ends in two weeks, thankfully. I can't see myself working here for any longer.

Thanks if you decided to read through my entire rant, may your AD servers not crash and burn after an upgrade. Noodles signing out, peace!"

I‚Äôm a CS Freshman and I failed a Remedial English for my First Semester in the Fall. I‚Äôm not the greatest at Math, so I had to put a ton of effort into Calculus I and Discrete Structures, and I did fairly well in both of them (B and a B+). I also had never coded in my life prior to entering College, so I had to put a ton of effort Into my Intro to Computer Programming class which was pretty difficult, but I ended up doing extremely well (A-) due to how hard I worked, but putting so much effort into my Major courses due to their difficulty and learning curve came at the cost of doing worse in my other courses, including the remedial English one that I failed. 

Because of this one class, my GPA drops from a 3.5 to a 2.9. My schools Computer Science website says that since this a remedial course it can‚Äôt be applied to the 120 credits required for graduation and can‚Äôt count as an Open Elective or elective credit, and on DegreeWorks it‚Äôs also under the ‚ÄúNot Counted Section‚Äù, so I thought I may be able to get it excluded. I contacted my University and they said they couldn‚Äôt do it, but I‚Äôm still going to see if I can get it excluded from my GPA when I talk to my Advisor from my CS and Engineering School, since it‚Äôs their policy that for their Degrees it can‚Äôt count. Only problem is, my University gives all Freshman a First Year Advisor and I only get an Advisor from my CSE school my Second Year in the Fall. So it‚Äôs probably going to be some time before I can get my first semester GPA recalculated.  And that sucks because I know there‚Äôs a big difference between a 2.9 and a 3.5+. 

I was planning on applying for some Internships in the near future, but now I think I‚Äôll hold off until at least when the next semester ends so I can bring my GPA up. Is it a good idea to just wait until then and not apply anywhere due to how low it is? I have a career fair coming up also this semester, and I‚Äôm feeling kinda hesitant about giving out my resume with such a low GPA. If there‚Äôs a chance that my GPA may be able to recalculated in September to something like a 3.7 overall, should I just hold off until then to apply to Internships? Thanks! 

 **Summary**

- Failed a Remedial English Course due to how much effort I had to put into my Major courses such as Intro to Computer Programming, Discrete Structures and Calculus I and their learning curve and difficulty 

- Because I failed this English course, my cumulative GPA drops from a 3.5 to a 2.9

- I may be able to get this course excluded since it‚Äôs a Remedial Course and my Computer Science programs website states that this course specifically can‚Äôt be applied to the 120 credits for graduation or count as an elective/for elective credit.

- The Earliest I‚Äôll likely be able to get this grade and it‚Äôs credits excluded is in the Fall since I don‚Äôt get an Advisor from my CSE school until my Second Year (all First Year Students have a First Year Advisor) 

- I Was Planning I‚Äôm applying to some Internships in the near future, but now thinking about holding off until at least the next semester ends and I can bring my GPA up. Is this a good idea? Would it also be smart to just wait until September to begin applying for Internships, since I could potentially get my GPA recalculated up to something like a 3.7? 

- Should I give out my Resume at my schools upcoming Career Fair with such a low GPA?

eq5ecj,1,2020-01-17,Made a huge mistake at work and need advice,QuietlyMenacing,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eq5ecj/made_a_huge_mistake_at_work_and_need_advice/,"**warning:** contains disturbing mentions of self-harm (cutting), depression, and suicide.

It is also very long, so I have bolded the most important part towards the bottom.

**TLDR:  Went to work black out drunk &amp; passed out in the locker room. Manager found me unconscious with self-inflicted cuts on my arms from before work and called an ambulance. Got stuck in psych ward for 2 weeks without access to my phone to call in, explain, or apologize. Got  discharged from hospital and have not been contacted by my workplace about what happened.**

I‚Äôm a  21 y/o college student working at a restaurant on campus. I live in an apartment with 4 other students. All of my roommates and pretty much  everyone else I know left for winter break, but I didn‚Äôt because my relationship with my family is terrible. The restaurant where I work was  closed for a lot of the break, so I was just alone in my apartment most of the time getting increasingly depressed and lonely (I hate being  alone, even for a short time). I was off work for about a week from Christmas through New Year‚Äôs, returning to work on January 2nd. This was  the longest period without at least a few hours out of the apartment and with other people. Loneliness and depression are pretty common  feelings for me anyway, and being alone in my apartment for so long especially during the holidays made it a lot worse.

I  started drinking more and more to deal with it, telling myself I was ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù the holidays. But for some reason on New Year‚Äôs eve I was less depressed and actually kind of happy. I started drinking that  night, but I really was just celebrating this time as I watched the ball  drop on TV like I do every year and was actually having a good time, right up until exactly midnight. Then out of nowhere I just started sobbing. I didn‚Äôt even fully know why at first, but seeing all those  people on TV, happy and smiling with people that love them and knowing I don‚Äôt have any of that just broke something inside of me.

I  don‚Äôt remember a lot after that, but I kept drinking for a while and  then went to bed. I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep so I got up and kept drinking and I just didn‚Äôt stop. I was drunk all of New Year‚Äôs day and kept  drinking all night again. If I slept that night it was only a couple hours. I have been self-harming and suicidal off and on since middle school, never getting help for it, and in the morning on January 2nd, I  cut my arms with a razor blade. I had been doing a lot of painting during the break, a more healthy way I sometimes deal with my emotions, and I started another painting that morning, but this time I painted with my own blood. And I was still drunk, for the third day, and I kept  drinking, and suddenly it was time to go to work.

I  blacked out and only remember parts of what happened next. I remember realizing it was time to go to work and getting ready. I brought more alcohol with me, but I don‚Äôt remember actually drinking once I was at  work. I don‚Äôt remember leaving my apartment or the trip to work, but I  do remember when I first got to work. I clocked in and started working  for a bit and then went to the bathroom. I may have passed out in the  bathroom for a while but I don‚Äôt remember for sure. The last thing I  remember is deciding to go get my pocket knife from my coat pocket in  the locker room and continue cutting in the bathroom. Then suddenly I  woke up on a stretcher; I don‚Äôt know if I was still at work or somewhere  in the hospital. Someone asked me, ‚ÄúDo you know where you are?‚Äù and I  shook my head no. They then asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the last thing you remember?‚Äù and I responded, ‚ÄúI was painting.‚Äù I asked who called them, confused about who could have found me when I was alone in my apartment.

**They explained that my manager found me unconscious in the locker room with cuts on my arm and that I had alcohol with me, and then I remembered that I had been at work. I said some nonsense about my brother, and then woke up somewhere else, in the hospital in restraints. I ended up getting sent to the psych ward for about two weeks, and wasn‚Äôt allowed  to use my cell phone or the internet while there. I was supposed to have another shift on the 3rd that I missed since I was in the hospital. I  got discharged from the psych ward yesterday and have had no calls, voicemails, or emails from any of my managers about this. What should I say to them? How do I apologize/explain and ask about the status of my job? I am not taking classes this semester, which started this week, because I have to do an internship instead as a graduation requirement, so I wouldn‚Äôt be working there this semester anyway, but I would like to  return after my internship is over. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I liked this job and the people there until now. I hate that I made such a stupid decision and possibly lost not only the job but the respect and trust of my managers and coworkers.**"

DIY port scanner, Bluetooth sniffer, and cryptopal challenges are about the big things on my resume. Now I scored an internship which I am happy about, but I am pretty concerned because it is a pure developer based job. The reason I am concerned is I really would not like to be a professional code monkey my whole life. Can you guys tell me I‚Äôm being irrational and that the internship is not a big deal. If I am on the wrong track what can I do to get back towards entering the netsec industry. I was not able to get any security related internship, so maybe I have too much software related info in my resume? Any ideas will be welcomed thanks so much!

How essential is getting a security related internship to getting a foot in the door of the industry. Would any tech internship fit?"

One thing my First Year advisor told me was that I can retake this course in the Spring and the grade that I got the second time around would be the only grade which counts towards my GPA for this course, and my first semester and overall GPA would be updated to reflect this change. I would do this, but there‚Äôs a Computer Architecture course that I‚Äôm supposed to take in the Spring and that I need in order to take further CS courses as a prerequisite, and if I don‚Äôt take it now it will extend my graduation date since it‚Äôs only offered in the Spring. And since I go to a fairly small university, there‚Äôs only one of this Computer architecture course offered, and it conflicts with the only Remedial English course being offered this semester. 

So I‚Äôm kinda torn as to what I should do. Should I take this Computer Architecture course now and just retake the English Course in the Fall?

Note: First post on Reddit (reposting because wasn't allowed before), please excuse my errors.  
I started learning web development 6 months ago because I found the web to be the most interesting field in the programming world. Also because one could easily see their results on a browser.  


But now it's been 6 months and I have barely made many complete projects even though I have learned quite a few technologies like Laravel and MERN stack.  
Which got me so frustrated because I can't find an internship. No surprise really, I haven't got much in my resume to show that I can develop. So first I thought I guess WebDev isn't for me if I can't even find it in me to make a few practice projects. So I moved on to learn a bit about Data Science.  


But then just today, I built a basic WebScraping API to use for DS, within a hour or so. So I wondered how?  


Then I realized, it's not the programming, it's the designing. My limiting factor is CSS and designing. I don't have any projects completed because I stop at the designing part. I have three projects with back-end made in my Github but I can't put them on my resume because they aren't complete. I can't make even get myself to make anything on React Native or Electron because I stop thinking about it the moment I think about the design.  


And it's not even that I hate visuals, I absolutely am stunned by some websites. I just suck at doing visuals. Which has gone deep rooted in me to hate it. Even a Polling App I made depended on Reactstrap and was shit in visuals.   
How can overcome this? Or is their a way to fill up show my resume with Backend projects w/o designing much?  


tl;dr How to find the motivation and get better at CSS and Frontend?"

I got my degree a year ago and recently was doing an internship in my field while working my part time job as a floor supervisor. then, my district manager (who is my store manager's superior) offered me a promotion to a full time position as assistant store manager at my old store. i was unsure at first but ultimately i decided to leave the internship and accept. i essentially just overworked myself and burnt out doing both jobs and did not like the boss at my internship and decided that I would not work full time there, so I took the assistant manager role. that position will start beginning of February.

basically, i found out from a sales associate that she has been complaining about my performance, saying that I've been doing badly and making mistakes, and that she wanted to DEMOTE ME because of my limited availability from have the internship. the assistant store manager at my store is friends with this sales associate, so that is where he got all of this information. i had literally no clue that she felt this way at all. i was honestly shocked to hear it and so upset that she did not come to me and tell me that there was a problem.

i also feel embarrassed because i'm sure she spoke to other managers about me and complained, meanwhile i'm being offered a promotion that, clearly, she does not think i deserve. neither her nor my assistant manager came to me and said a single word about me doing ANYTHING wrong. like, not a thing. i asked her multiple times if me having both jobs was an issue, and she always said no.

is this grounds for going to HR? Or at least talking to my district manager? the difficult part about going to her is that she will then be upset with the assistant manager for talking to an associate about these things. it just feels incredibly unfair for her to be threatening to demote me and not discuss it WITH ME!!! i also noticed that she is giving me less hours. i just feel like she is extremely passive aggressive and something needs to be done about it. she does this to other employees too.

this was pretty messy so i can clear anything up if need be. i'm just looking for some advice. is there anything i can do about this?"

It would be a dream to move to Seattle with my boyfriend and start my career on the west coast so I don't know if I should decline both offers and keep applying.

NASA (52k/year)

PROs:

* warm weather (Bay Area)
* mountains, beaches, and SF!
* friends in the area &amp; at work (current intern)
* work is slow at times but my boss allows me to study
* guaranteed raise every year
* have until March to make a decision
* potential to implement software currently not used by any logistics members (SQL, Tableau..)

CONS:

* expensive (will most likely get a part-time job for weekends)
* no relocation assistance or sign-on bonus
* office politics
* traffic sucks
* libraries are always full (this is weird but I love to go to libraries and they're especially crowded on the weekends. I can hardly ever find parking or a desk to study in peace.)

OR

IBM (65k/yr)

PROS

* can pay off student debt faster (30k)
* $3,000 sign-on bonus
* live comfortably
* most likely working with the cognitive intelligence team
* exposure to industry-wide supply chain software

CONS

* I don't know anyone out there
* small town in Minnesota
* it gets SUPER cold in the winter
* plane tickets are expensive b/c the largest airport is 2 hours away
* No OT

My future goals include returning to the Midwest to hopefully get into Northwestern's MBA program after a couple of years. It's a unique program for students with less than 3 full years of work experience. I've also been doing long distance for about 6 months and would love to close the gap if I could in Seattle.

I am a first year masters student, currently enrolled in a Telecommunications Engineering program (similar to electronics and computer engineering, I'm not sure if it's called something else in the states).

My university (in Europe) gives me the opportunity to complete my second year at an American university, giving me both a European credential and an American credential. because there is no direct comparison to what I am studying in my European uni, I am able to choose from a few different options in the American university.

Due to the cost of studying and the challenge of a graduate program, I am very seriously interest in the difficulty level of each masters degree.

I am very torn between the choices. I have previously specialized in electronics which i have really enjoyed but I'm interested in making a transition into more software aspects. (Specially because in my home country the job offer is more limited in HW aspects).

eq9qzi,48,2020-01-17,Stuck,swinglifeaway3,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eq9qzi/stuck/,"""Just our luck, eh?""

Elevator stuck. The fire department said they were en-route to get us out, but we both knew how long that was going to take. Stupid elevator music didn't make it much better, either.

It seemed like my companion didn't want to talk. He was tall and lanky and young, and his pinstripe suit made him look like a tryhard intern. He reminded me a little of Ryan, whom I was supposed to be picking up from soccer practice this afternoon. Seemed like that wasn't happening now, though.

I needed to text Linda to let her know I couldn't make it, but when I tried, I saw that the signal had cut out. Just my luck.

Right then, the stranger decided to speak.

""Would you like to play a game?"" His voice was uncannily childlike, but I wrote it off as that he was just a late bloomer or something.

""Sure, bud. What game?"" I was still messing with my phone, trying to get a single bar in that infernal metal box.

""The wish game."" He said it like he expected me to know how to play, but I guess the confused look I gave him sent the message that I didn't. He took a deep breath before continuing.

""You make a wish and I grant the wish and that's how we play the wish game.""

I chuckled. ""Okay, first wish. Turn the damn music off.""

He clapped his bony hands twice and the sound coming from the elevator's speakers stopped.

""Didn't know it was a clapper. Neat trick.""

The elevator lurched down a few inches, settling into position again. My heart raced for a second, but I took a breath and tried to calm down. We'd be fine soon enough.

""Next wish?""

""Oh, yeah. How about you get me some cell signal, yeah?""

I was still waving my phone in the air like a maniac, but this time it seemed to have finally caught. Not just on some service, but also on the wall of the elevator. My fist collided with the metal carelessly and the device slipped out of my hands, thudding to the floor.

Cracked to pieces. ""God damn it.""

The stranger smiled sympathetically. ""Anything else?""

""Fix my phone, maybe?""

He pulled a tube of superglue out of his pocket and tossed it my way. I exhaled. Didn't know what else I should've expected.

The lights went out this time, leaving us bathed in the glow of nothing but one red emergency bulb.

""How about a million dollars?""

I hadn't noticed until then that there was a briefcase behind his legs. He picked it up and offered it to me.

I cracked it open, finding the exact thing I'd asked for. Stacks and stacks of hundreds. I'd just taken the rubber band off of one when the elevator moved again, falling forward a few feet this time.

It rained money, but I was too rattled to catch any more of it. I just closed the briefcase and stood up against the wall, clutching the rail.

""Do you want me to get us out?""

On the verge of throwing up, I nodded my head.

This time the elevator went into free fall. The motion was nauseating and every second seemed to be far, far too long.

""We're going to my house."" I didn't want to go to his house. I didn't know where he lived that we had to die in an elevator accident to get to.

""I want to go to my house, okay? I want to go home!""

I snapped at him. He simply looked, puzzled. Calm.

""Who are you? Huh? Who?""

We were still falling at what felt like a hundred feet a second. He pulled out a business card.

""I don't care who you are! I wish I was out of this damn box!""

I was yelling now. My heart was pounding and blood was rushing in my ears and I was too angry to be afraid.

Right as the elevator hit the ground, I found myself at the bottom of the staircase. I felt my phone in my pocket, pressing against my leg. It rang.

""Hi, you're listed as an emergency contact for Linda Brooks, correct?""

""...yeah?"" I felt my heart sinking.

""Your name and relation, please?""

""Nathan, Nathan Brooks. She's my wife."" My voice was shaking.

""She's been taken to West Memorial Hospital with traumatic injuries from a car accident."" Click.

The rest of the hour was a blur. I drove to the hospital faster than I'd ever driven in my life.

Linda collided with a semi truck while bringing Ryan home from soccer practice. He died on impact. She died before I could get to the hospital to say goodbye.

I reached in my pocket for a tissue, because I knew I kept a pack there in case something ever happened.

The tissues weren't there.

What was? A bottle of superglue and a business card.

Samael D. Lucifer. No number, no address. Just a handwritten note.

1. Do these jobs exist, and if so where do I find these opportunities ?

2. what do I need to do to put myself in the best position to get hired? 

3.  Should I just finish my computer science degree early and use this to help me find a dev/enginnering position?

Now, I have no regrets doing all of this because they really helped me with securing a data and analytics graduate job that starts in September. I also did a software development internship last summer that helped a lot as well. The job I've secured only requires me to have a 2:1 hons degree - which I already have - however, I'm just so so burnt out from last semester that I'm now just finding it so hard to learn / study. I've never felt this burnt out before so now I'm starting to worry that I won't get out of this rut before September and I won't be cut out for a career in this industry. 

I'm trying to motivate myself by thinking of passion projects that I could work on alongside my masters as at the moment I feel like an imposer and not someone who deserves the graduate job I've been offered...

My primary field of interest is in computer interfaces and specifically Virtual Reality.

I have a number of ideas for VR software, which, as far as my research can tell, do not currently exist and would be extremely practical, as well as experiments and studies that have not really been done yet. They're hardly groundbreaking, but they are pretty new ideas and I do believe they could both do a lot of good and potentially make a lot of money. I am actively working towards developing the skills and technical knowledge necessary to actually develop those programs, but until then, they exist as mere blueprints.

I'm applying to a number of internships and undergraduate research programs, many of which would help provide the *exact* skills I need, and I'm finding that mentioning these ideas in the essays is very relevant and helpful to my applications. My concern, however, is that I am attempting to get an internship at, for example, a Virtual Reality research lab that develops Virtual Reality software, and in order to prove my worth, I am including my *own* potentially money-making ideas in the essays. I will most likely not be able to begin working on those ideas until early next year, and in the interim, I am concerned about the very labs I am sending them to taking them from me.

For the record, I am aware that this sounds a little silly, given my lack of experience. I know it sounds like I'm probably assuming my ideas are better or worth more than they actually are. I don't want to advertise the ideas themselves (for obvious reasons), but as evidence that my concerns are legitimate, I offer that my mother is the one who raised these concerns to begin with. She works as a grant writer and editor for the Psychology/Social Sciences department of a major national university. She works on literally hundreds of research proposals every year from Faculty hoping to get NSF funding, and she is concerned enough that my ideas could be of potential interest that earlier today she recommended contacting my college's legal department and asking to get in touch with whoever they have to handle intellectual property rights/theft for Faculty. Additionally, even if they are worthless ideas, isn't it worth taking precautions just in case?

If I send this essay in and later on find that the lab is developing my idea without my permission, can I take them to court with the application as evidence? Do I have a leg to stand on? If so, what steps can I take preemptively to ensure that I can use these ideas as evidence of my competency and ability without risking losing them?"

I am in my third year in a pure science degree. I \*don't\* dislike my choice of major, but I hate going to classes. Some subjects I like, some I don't. But aside from the stress of exam month, I actually enjoy not having to go and studying on my own.

I went to university because it was expected of me, and I didn't consider doing anything else. I got really good grades in high school, but almost never paid attention in class. I loathed going and had few friends. I spend hours memorizing stuff than I forgot a week later. I thought going to college would be better because I would be studying things I like. But I still don't like being in class.

Last semester I got really stressed during exams to the point I started having panic attacks, so nowadays I'm trying to prioritize health over grades.

I don't know what I should do. The options I have been thinking about are these:

\- I could push through the next year and a half and finish the degree as soon as possible. After university I was thinking of taking a gap year and thinking what I want to do with my life.

\- I could take less credits per year and do something else, such as an internship or hobbie related side gigs. Part-time work would be cool too. But then I would lose some of my financial aid (like 2200 euros). My credits would still be paid for.

\- I could drop out or pospone the studies? It doesn't seem like a sensible thing to do though."

so the title is  correct. i'm currently a junior  in at an over competitive  high school and i genuinely  fucking hate every. single. aspect of it, and  now i've come to hate myself as well.

everyone has it all together and im here, a useless lonely piece of shit, both a disappointment to my parents and to myself. at my school, there are no stereotypes (nerd, jock, cheerleader, etc.) everyone is literally fucking everything. the cheerleader is also an aspiring molecular biologist with 3 stanford internships under her belt. the football player is also a theater kid and straight-a student. then there's me, with literally no passion and no extracurriculars  (im supposed to, tho!) -- for example, i tell my parents i'm going to a FBLA meeting at the library when all i do is sit in a dark corner and go on ig, looking at everyone's perfect lives while doing nothing to ameliorate my own.  every FBLA member in my grade  has an officer position and multiple wins under their belt. what do i have? nothing. it's not that i don't want to go to the meetings or try hard to win at competitions or anything. i JUST CANt seem to bring myself to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

and in addition to being model students, they all have friends. people to text and FaceTime and hang out with. i guess in a sense, i do too. but i don't have friend group anymore  because one by one they all moved out of the hell hole that is Silicon Valley, and now its too late to join  any other  friend  groups because they're so well-establisbhed and rigid. i almost always have someone to fuck around with during class and during lunch, but never outside of school. i literally never hang out with anyone or do any fun things -- going to concerts, sleepovers, etc. because no matter how much i beg my 'friends' they're just too busy. they always seem to have something going on and now it's starting to feel like they are avoiding me (even though they seem fine with me in school?). they never want to get lunch or go to dances or games or aNYTHIng its just so frustrating. everyone else has such great friends and i don't have any. i feel empty inside and alone. all i've ever wanted was a normal high school experience, is that too much to ask for?.

&amp;#x200B;

i think the worst part about all this is my parents. they see me come home from tournaments with no wins that they paid hundreds of dollars for me to attend. on weekends, all i do is sit on the fucking couch and watch TV as my grades plummet, meanwhile everyone i know is having the time of their lives with their friends and acing every class they take or competition they go to. my parents' silent disappointment is so, so worse them screaming at me to get my shit together. they remain so loving and kind and despite fully knowing that i'm a sad failure of a person in comparison to all my peers. they bought a very very expensive house in a prime area so i could get the best  education, meet the best  people, and take advantage of the best  opportunities. and what did i do? nothing.

i did nothing.

tl;dr i  fail my classes, have no friends, no extracurriculars, and am a disappointment to my parents. i feel trapped, lost and hopeless.

now, when i'm driving to school, i find myself wishing i'd get into a freak accident with an 18-wheeler and just die. in class, i stare out of the windows hoping that the overdue CA earthquake finally hits and collapses the brick school walls on  my head. when im home alone, i feel like popping a bunch of pills and OD'ing on the floor to end my failed  life. and in all seriousness, i should...

i've let myself down so many times in my life. why not  let myself down  one last time?"

Also this is an alt account because I am just too paranoid. One last note, English is not my native language so I am sorry if my grammar doesnt make sense. 

I graduated from a non CS masters program on October. However, my bachelor is computer engineering. I have focused on mobile development, especially for Android and kotlin and made a bunch of portfolio apps with third party API's, basic stuff. 


Two months ago I have found an internship as a software engineer intern for a consultancy company with bunch of digital products, such as mobile apps, websites etc. I have a very kind supervisor but he is not a programmer, he is focusing more on maintaining servers, websites and mostly network oriented stuff. I was told to learn React Native because they wanted to keep a single code for apps that are existent for both platform. It was a new experience for me and I was very ready to learn new framework and also enhance my js skills which I did not focus previously. So I worked on the old apps for a month and tried to re-write them properly. 

One Day, my supervisor told me that there is a new client and we need some work to do. When I asked what is needed, I was told they need a new mobile app, a website with very specific payment functionalities, an API that handles request for app and website which is connected to a cloud database. 

I have less than two months to finish all these and I dont think I have enough experience for this work. I am very worried about disappointing my supervisor and dont know where to start. Dont get me wrong, I love coding, I love everything about this job but this looks like more than a challange to me. As I've told before, I am the only one who codes in the company and it's the first time I have felt this kind of pressure in my career  (which is almost non existent). If there were even one more person that can lead me in the process, I would be much more enjoying the challanging aspect.

Are there any suggestions or thoughts on this? Is this really to much for an internship or am I feeling this because my lack of work experience?

eqx61s,19,2020-01-19,What is the best career for me?,y6961706,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eqx61s/what_is_the_best_career_for_me/,"I'm currently studying Computer Science at a top university. It may seem obvious to just become something like a software developer, but there are so many different careers I can go for. Ever since school I've been struggling to find the one thing I'm amazing at and want to pursue my whole life. I've always been well rounded and achieved top grades no matter what subject I studied. The only reason I even chose to study Computer Science is because I wasn't sure what else to do and Computer Science can open a lot of doors. I could have easily chosen another degree like Economics, Engineering, Medicine, Law, etc... I really have no preference. 

So now, I've reached the point where I've started to look for internships in a field I want to get a job in, and realised how many jobs don't have requirements for a specific degree. For example, there's marketing, auditing, financial roles, and more which I could be eligible for. I would enjoy doing any of the above, they all seem cool and interesting in their own way. I could also do a masters in a broad subject, like management which could open lots of doors for me. On the other hand, I could do a masters in a more specific subject, e.g: Data Science and then pursue the career following it after.

The best career for me would be a high salary career, which would help me achieve a high quality of life. However, I'm not sure what the process is to move up within a company. For example, there might be a job which pays low at the start but by the time you're 50 you earn crazy amounts, or a job which pays high at the start and the same amount after tons of experience. To be honest, I don't know how the world outside school even works, so any guidance would be appreciated.

So to conclude, the reason I'm posting this is because I want a goal to work towards whilst I'm still studying at uni. I want to start applying to internships and build up my CV for the career which is for me, so I can be in the perfect position once I graduate. As of now, all the doors are open and I need some guidance because I don't know which one to take, and I don't know how to take it.

Find mentors‚Ä¶

* Best in the field you want to work in
* In the school where you may want to enroll
* 1 year out of that school getting started in the field
* 3-5 years out of school established in the field
* Businesses that have a similar model to the one you are creating

Not sure what you want to do?¬† Scroll to the bottom ‚Äú**Not Sure? Help With Vocation**‚Äù section in this article.

Know what you want to do or have an idea?¬† Have someone in mind who does what you want to do?¬† **Connect with them.**

Start by reading, listening, and watching their content.¬† After you do that, *ask* them a few questions through today‚Äôs social platforms or on an actual phone call or video call, then act on the result.¬†

Check out the section below, ‚Äú**The Magic Mentor Search Tool**‚Äú, and use the free search tool that uses Google search modifiers to search the LinkedIn and Twitter database.

## Fill Your Environment With Positive Influence.

Putting the best, most inspiring, most healthy, most spiritual, most true into your environment and surrounding yourself with the best- it‚Äôs work. Important work. It‚Äôs constant curation. Be careful with who and what you bring into your environment and check your priorities regularly. Build an ecosystem for growth.¬†

I call it ‚Äúcool curation‚Äù in my classes.¬† Find what calls you to grow. What lights you up?¬† What gives you an ‚ÄúAh-Ha!‚Äù moment? Find it, inspect it, digest it, use it as a guide, model it, copy it, play with it, then do it in your own style.

Positive influence changes and transforms the participant.¬†

## Take Action.

&gt;Being ambitious isn‚Äôt enough. Far more important than ambition is commitment.When you‚Äôre committed to something, you will be and do¬†**what is required**¬†for the attainment of that thing. You‚Äôll stop wondering and start building. You‚Äôll stop being distracted and start learning. You‚Äôll start connecting. You‚Äôll start failing.-Benjamin Hardy

It starts with exposure. Then observation. Then consumption. *Then participation and experience*.

ACTION ‚Äì that‚Äôs the important part. Courage to act. Sometimes *acting while uncomfortable*, in spite of feeling or thinking uncomfortable thoughts, is where the most growth happens.¬† It can be freeing to ‚Äúdo the thing that needed doing‚Äù. What is the next right action? Do it.¬†

&gt;‚ÄúI should be a professional cheerleader.¬† I love being able to cheer people on and say, ‚ÄòWhatever you can do right now, go do it.‚Äô ‚Äù‚Äì[Kaisa Keranen](https://kaisafit.com/as-seen-in/)

## Celebrate.

I drink a cup of apple juice and crank up the music to celebrate small wins.

Celebration and gratitude grooves good habits.¬† It‚Äôs important to groove positive growth mindset and good choices. Writing it down helps document progress.¬†¬†

## Gratitude and Goal Journal

Celebrate what you experienced yesterday and what you are grateful for in the present moment. I‚Äôve found that the habit of putting it in writing in a daily journal, along with written goal setting, compounds into rewarding days.¬† Visualize the best day ahead.¬† Put it in writing, then act. Regularly choose to take action.

## Build Your Environment By Connecting With Great People

&gt;‚ÄúBrick by brick my friends. Nothing happens over night and no moment is ever ‚Äòthe moment.‚Äô You just gotta keep on building, and moving, and doing ..‚Äù-Gary Vaynerchuk

\[paraphrased from [this Gary Vaynerchuk video](https://www.facebook.com/gary/videos/10157724708598350/)\]:

* Find RAD people-distribution hubs¬†
* On spec find 87
* Connect with them on social media¬†
* If you get 87 no‚Äôs consider it a win. It‚Äôs an answer, if so, reframe your message.
* If 1 says yes and shares, you get a brick in the wall.¬†¬†
* Surprise and delight them

I tested this, *on spec* (I love that phrase), and contacted my favorite *New York Times Bestseller* authors who are most influential on my thinking and career.¬†

Only 3.

One responded positively and may be scheduled for a recorded Skype in September!¬† It happens to be my favorite and most prolific psychologist, Dr. Benjamin Hardy!¬†

I reached out via his web site to his assistant, Ms. Whitney Bishop.¬† She was charming and kind, asking for clarification on my request and letting me know that Ben has crazy deadlines. She suggested connecting in August for a September recorded Skype call. I‚Äôm excited to speak with him.

The purpose of the chat is to get Ben‚Äôs insight on college and vocation, noting his experience and path to his successful career.

I want to share this interview to inspire everyone to reach out to their favorite mentors.

I also want to inspire the use of cellphones and Skype to produce your own portfolio of interviews with mentors, so I will record my interviews on my phone and share it as an example.

## From Dr. Benjamin Hardy: ‚ÄúHow To Learn In 2 Days What Normally Takes 6 Months‚Äù

[Please read the full article here.](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-learn-in-2-days-what-normally-takes-6-months-57953ee30da4#.nlmzzar6j)¬† I‚Äôm always inspired by his prolific and positive work. He sends daily emails with deep and inspiring content.

Here is an extended quote from his article:

&gt;Research has found that having clarity about your goals is essential to having motivation to achieve those goals.If you‚Äôre not clear on what you‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs hard to be motivated. Which is why seemingly easy tasks, like sending a fax, could end up taking months. There‚Äôs a lack of clarity on how to do it, so you don‚Äôt ‚Äî until either you have to or it‚Äôs too late.Can you relate?Unfortunately, having a lack of clarity is why so many people settle for less than their dreams. Said Robert Brault, author of Round Up the Usual Subjects, ‚ÄúWe are kept from our goal not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.‚ÄùYou want clarity so bad that you‚Äôre willing to settle for lesser goals, simply because the path to getting your true goal is less obvious.If you want to achieve big things, your path will be unclear and hazy. The emotional need for clarity and fear of the unknown leads people to abandon their dreams for more straightforward pursuits.Having goal clarity is essential to motivation. Consequently, in order to get motivated to achieve your big dreams, you need clarity. However, this does not mean you have ‚Äúit all‚Äù figured out. It means you‚Äôre clear on the next step or two.If you‚Äôre at mile marker 1 and your dream is at mile marker 50, you just need enough info and support to get to mile marker 3 or 4. Once you get there, you‚Äôll need further instructions. But you have no clue what those instructions will be, because you don‚Äôt currently know what you don‚Äôt know. When you get to the next step, you‚Äôll be able to ask better questions. You‚Äôll be able to better assess who can help you get to mile marker 5, 6, 7, or 8. What got you here, won‚Äôt get you there.Here‚Äôs what you need to move forward right now:A clear ‚Äúcheck-point‚Äù (so you actually know what to do)A hard and fast time-lineThe right tools and systemsA support structure-Benjamin Hardy

This mindset helps get to productive action. I see it in the school setting all the time. When a student writes down a goal prior to doing it and commits the time and energy to clarifying the goal by asking questions to remove obstacles in the way, immediate action, growth, learning, achievement and progress takes place.

The ‚Äútime to take action‚Äù variable here is huge and should be taken seriously.

## Sometimes It‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat To Do?‚Äù, Sometimes It‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat Not To Do?‚Äù

When a student does not commit the time to writing down a clearly defined goal, they stay uncertain and a massive amount of time can be spent avoiding growth.

The lesser goal is usually a distraction with a cellphone notification from Snapchat or other social communication. Students who frequent this habit and behavior fall behind and spend HOURS without a productive direction requiring frequent redirection. Uncomfortable, ‚Äúbored‚Äù, or uncertain feelings trigger this behavior.

A support structure, like a parent, teacher, or coach can help bring awareness to the uncertainty and time spent away from the productive task at hand.

When a student begins to pay attention to the trigger and develops a habit to communicate, clarify and research the question that is the obstacle, major progress happens.

## Train Your Brain. Uncomfortable = Signal For Immediate Action Toward Clarity and Growth.

Use the feeling of uncertainty or feeling uncomfortable as a sign or guidepost for progress. Celebrate it. Train your brain to pair the feeling with immediate action toward clarity and growth. Raise your hand, reach out for help, start searching for the answer or next step.

## Goal Checklist: Use Your Phone to Connect With 3-5 Mentors For Clarity. Start With One.

When you know what you want to learn, research who can help you get where you want to be. Define who does what you want to do best. They will help clarify any uncertainty and give guidance that shortens the time to take action.

Rather than trust the marketing message that the school, course or book is selling you, could you pioneer your career through the simple action of connecting with people currently doing it best?¬†¬†

Write these questions down and start to fill in the answers. Writing it down makes it statistically more likely that you will achieve what you intend.

## Who Does What I Want to Do?

* Who does what I want to do at the highest level?
* Who is currently going to school in this field?
* Who is one year out with a degree in this field?
* Who is five years out with a degree in this field?
* What are the different subsets of careers within this field I can also research?

## The Magic Mentor Search Tool

Use [https://recruitin.net/](https://recruitin.net/) to find people by their job title, degree, college, and location, then connect with them on social media.¬†

This site is a simple graphic interface that uses Google search terms to search the Linkedin and Twitter database.¬† You‚Äôll have to be diligent, adjusting search terms and looking sequentially through profiles.¬† This step can throw up some roadblocks and may take some time to dial in your search words.¬† Be prepared to try 50 or more different searches before you find the right people. Use keywords like jobs, college majors, colleges, awards, locations, years, companies, and skills you may be interested in. You can also try the same search terms but search Twitter by clicking the Twitter tab at the top of the search window.

This is the easiest way to find real people who may or may not have a trending social stream that hits your radar.¬†

\**Quick Tip: keyword to include: graduation year, example ‚Äú2014-2018‚Äù.*

Did you find on or more people in each of these categories?

* Who does what I want to do at the highest level?
* Who is currently going to school in this field?
* Who is one year out with a degree in this field?
* Who is five years out with a degree in this field?
* What are the different subsets of careers within this field I can also research?

Now you are ready to start connecting.

## Contact Mentors With A Simple Request.

* Contact them and others like them, ask what they recommend for training.¬† Ask what to do, what not to do.
* Contact the training (college or person).¬†¬†
* Contact people currently in training.¬†¬†
* Contact people 1,3,5 years out of training.

## Time and cost spent doing this:

A few days or hours?¬† \~1-3 months?¬†

Do you have a cellphone?¬† Who pays for it and what does it cost? It‚Äôs far less than the cost of formal or traditional instruction.

The cost of a school, college, book or course: 0-60k per year.¬† Before you commit to an investment of four years and potentially $240,000, does it make sense to do research with people who have experience, credibility, maybe even the best in class; then act on new insight?¬†

## Match and Mirror

What are the channels they use and which do they prefer to contact them?¬† Are they interacting on their channels?¬† What do they respond to? How do they interact with comments and replies?

Is it Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Website, Linked In?¬† What are their preferred platforms?

What will you use to connect? Email, Phonecall, Skype, Hangout, Facetime, podcast, coffee in person?¬† Decide then try one.¬† If that doesn‚Äôt work, you may need to add some value to their day before they recognize your request.

Consider their perspective and think about what they might have going on in their business/career/personal life and honor that.¬†¬†

Do they have a channel on Youtube that helps people for free then sells membership and courses?

Participate in their culture and they may be more likely to respond.

Ask yourself:

* Do I have a channel?
* Do I help people for free?
* Could I buy their membership?
* Can I use Match and Mirror to develop my email/request for time?¬†
* Does it have to be polished and formal through their personal assistant or is this more casual?¬†¬†

## Craft a message that gets a response, then schedule an interview.

&gt;‚ÄúHey I love your work. I‚Äôm working toward a career in your field, could we speak for 15 minutes?¬† Maybe on a Skype call?‚Äù

Is this something you can copy and paste in an email, tweet, or DM? Is it enough to get your foot in the door?¬†

Or do you need to participate in the ecosystem a bit more, share their tweets, leave insightful comments before you ask?¬† [Check out Gary Vaynerchuk, *Jab, Jab, Right Hook* for more.](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/the-one-thing-i-didnt-clarify-enough-in-jab-jab-jab-right-hook/)

Explain succinctly what the discussion might be:

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking for college and career experience and advice.‚Äù¬†¬†

## Questions To Ask Mentors:

* What do you recommend for training?
* Is there anything you would recommend me to do?
* Is there anything you would recommend me not to do?
* Do you have any advice for getting internships and meaningful work even at the high school/ college level?
* What‚Äôs your experience with scholarships/ financing college tuition?
* How did you try to get your foot in the door before you had your big break?
* What is the toughest part about what you do?
* What was your big break?
* Best networking tip for your industry.
* Best networking tip for college.
* Best college success.
* Best career success story.
* Worst college mistake.
* Worst career mistake.
* What would you say to someone who aspires to have a career like yours?

## Here are a few from Tribe of Mentors by Tim Ferriss:

* How has the failure, or apparent failure set you up for later success? Do you have a favorite failure of yours?
* What advice would you give a smart driven high school or college student about to enter the college world or real world? What advice should they ignore?
* What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?

## Follow Up With A Thank You

Send a follow up message thanking them and note your biggest take away. Occasionally send them very short updates or interesting articles or links relevant to their interests.

Try a networking request. It can‚Äôt hurt to ask.

* Who is someone else you would recommend I should be talking to?
* Who‚Äôs that guy or gal that‚Äôs doing it best in your mind?

## An Example Of A Mentor Interview

My high school students took this process and ran with it. Here is a great example of a Skype call we scheduled.¬† We used Skype and a video production system called Tricaster by NewTek, but don‚Äôt let that scare you. Skype has a single click button to record a call that you can then playback to remember the important points and share with an audience who would benefit from the discussion.¬† It‚Äôs easy to build a brand and start a podcast.¬† I‚Äôm certain of this with my experience through working with high school students.¬† Anyone can do it.

## Not Sure? Help With Vocation

If you need some inspiration for vocation and aren‚Äôt sure about the path forward try working through these questions in writing.

This section comes from a favorite book from David Brooks, *The Second Mountain, The Quest for a Moral Life*:

Mr. Brooks poses these questions:

* What do I enjoy talking about?
* When have I felt most needed?
* What pains am I willing to tolerate?
* What would I do if I weren‚Äôt afraid?
* What problems are around me?
* What has life given me for preparation?
* What is life asking of me?
* What is my responsibility here?
* How can the two go together?
* What actually gives me deepest satisfaction?
* Is there a deep gladness with something that may satisfy the world‚Äôs deep hunger?
* What activity do I love so much that I am going to keep getting better at it for decades?
* What activity do I love so much that it captures me at the depth of my being?

And here is one that I reflect on all the time: What is the highest and best use of my time on Earth?

## The Transformed You

David Brooks takes what Ben Hardy states above, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt currently know what you don‚Äôt know‚Äù, a step further stating:

&gt;‚Äú\[‚Ä¶\] you have no data about the desires of the transformed you.‚Äù¬†David Brooks

You can‚Äôt be sure what your transformed self will want, need and value.

You can take a step toward a future goal, and when you act on it you‚Äôll get new questions and answers. We all want to limit cost and regret, but the cost of time spend doing tasks of limited importance and value (the opportunity cost), versus the benefit of action, even if it‚Äôs uncertain, outweighs cost.

Here are examples of transformational experiences:

&gt;‚Äúmarriage\[‚Ä¶\], having kids\[‚Ä¶\], emigrating to a new country, converting to a different religion, going to med school, joining the Marines, changing careers, and deciding on where to live. Every time you make a commitment to something big you are making a transformational choice.‚Äù-David Brooks

The chapter goes on to compare different paths to vocation.

## David Brooks on Vocation Strategies: ‚ÄúYou Just Know‚Äù, The Calling, Obligation, The Rational Model

## ‚ÄúYou Just Know‚Äù

Emotional knowing or going with your gut may be fleeting, it may be more trustworthy in arenas you have experience in, but may be guessing that leads to long term consequences.¬†¬†

## The Calling

&gt;‚ÄúDoes it feel like it captures you to the depth of your being?‚Äù‚ÄúThe core theme of this book-to fall through the egocentric desires and plunge down into the substrate to where your desires are mysteriously formed.¬† You are trying to find that tension or problem that arouses great waves of moral, spiritual, and relational energy.‚Äù¬†‚Äì David Brooks

I know in the depth of my being that helping people find and optimize time spent doing moral, spiritual and relational work will change the world; it‚Äôs my personal calling.

Ask yourself deep questions. Break the quote above down. What arouses moral energy? What arouses spiritual energy? What arouses relational energy?

If I were to answer each of those questions simply, as a Christian, my belief it is to love others as Jesus did. Love and serve.

## Obligation

&gt;‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs a problem that burns at your conscience. If you work at a normal office doing some sort of organizational job, you‚Äôre probably not going to be thrust face to face with some gigantic social problems. But if you get a job as a teacher at a school on an Indian reservation, you will see injustice face to face.‚Äù‚Äì David Brooks

Sense of obligation and duty may come from appreciation. Brooks tells the epic story of Fred Swaniker who was born in Ghana, his father a magistrate and lawyer. He was awarded a scholarship in the US, moved on to a degree at Stanford Business, and felt obligation to provide opportunity for African children. He founded the African Leadership Academy which is building college campuses in Africa, providing free education and partnering with universities abroad as long as students commit to return to Africa to reside and lead.

## The Rational Model

&gt;‚ÄúDecision-making experts fill books with clear decision stages: preparation (identify the problem; determine your objectives), search (assemble a list of possible jobs or people that will help you meet your objectives), evaluation (make a chart and rate the options on a 10-point scale according to various features), confrontation (ask disconfirming questions; create constructive disagreement to challenge existing premises), selection (tally up the scores; build a consequences table that will help you envision the future outcome of each choice).If you follow this kind of formal methodology, you will certainly be able to apply some useful frameworks.¬† For example, when you are considering quitting your job, apply the 10-10-10 rule. How will this decision feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years?¬† That will help you put short-term emotional pain of any decision in the context of long-term consequences.¬†-David Brooks

The strategies listed above are great writing exercises. After thinking through a few of the suggestions I put together some questions I use when making decisions on how to invest.

## Cost Benefit Tools

Here are some cost benefit analysis questions and resources I‚Äôve gathered to help rationalize paying for a degree or coursework.

* What is the acceptable amount of investment?¬† How is it paid?¬†
* What is the cost of reading books, listening to podcasts, college/training/mentoring?
* What is the return on the investment? How much do you make annually?

[Payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report)

This site gives some actual costs and average income returns. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a total answer to the cost benefit equation, but it‚Äôs a helpful tool.¬† Here is how the site calculates ROI:

20 Year Net ROI:

Difference between 20 year median pay for a bachelor‚Äôs grad and 24 year median pay for a high school grad minus total 4 year cost of college.

*\*Note, this is based on the average salary for each, which makes it less accurate when the variance can be huge depending on success over a career, but it does fix a controlled variable across all colleges and careers.*

Example:

*\*note: these are listed in a heads up display on the site without having to do any math and can help to put numbers in perspective.*

* Montclair costs $121,292 for 4 years
* [BFA Graphic Designer](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts_(BFA)%2C_Graphic_Design/Salary) Avg Salary from 2019- $51,000¬†
* High School Degree Avg Salary from 2018- $35,000
* 20 year gross income after 4 year college degree-¬† 51,000 x 20=$1,020,000
* 24 year gross income no college- 34,000 x 24=$840,000
* 20 year difference in income- $1,020,000-$840,000=$180,000
* 20 year difference in income minus cost of college= $180,000-$121,292=$58,708
* Annual ROI: 20 Year Net ROI / 20 = Net per year / total investment cost (total cost of college)
* 58,708/20 = 2935.4/121,292 = .024 or 2.4% Annual Return On Investment

## Understand Best Case, Worse Case, Likely Case

Diligently working through the numbers and thinking rationally can give perspective.¬† Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway teaches rational thinking: have the best case, the worst case and the likely case researched, understand the second and third order effects, [control any biases in your thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7KN9fkmVbw) and you can make good choices.

Be diligent. Find the intersection of right and wrong.¬† Look at it from all angles.

## Summary: You Can Do It. Take Action.

Take on one step a a time for clarity. Simple steps, then try the next one.

* Select a vocation. What lights you up?
* Not sure? Copy the questions above, write your answers.
* Fill Your Environment With Positive Influence- reading, listening, and watching good content.
* Take notes, visualize and write goals and note wins-gratitude and goal journal
* Know what you want to do or have an idea? Find people who do it.
* Use social media or [recruitin.net](https://recruitin.net/)
* Draft a simple request asking for a 15 minute chat or copy the one above. Send it.
* Keep following up until you get a yes reply. Reply to schedule a time and date, give 2 alternatives. Ask if it is ok to record the chat to post on your social media.
* Call exactly on time. Use Skype. Click the record button.
* Ask the questions listed above. Take notes.
* Be gracious and friendly. Ask follow ups if you are unclear, but end after 15 minutes.
* Send a follow up message thanking them and note your biggest take away. Send them very short updates or interesting articles or links relevant to their interests.
* Contact the best and most inspiring people you can find.
* Contact the training (college or person).¬†¬†
* Contact people in training.¬†¬†
* Contact people 1,3,5 years out of training working in the field
* Try to set up work or internships doing what you love right away. Show anyone you contact your portfolio of interviews and the work you do.
* Run the cost and prepare financing, decide on training.
* Apply to training or colleges.
* In your college or job interviews show your portfolio of mentor interviews and the work you do.
* Keep connecting with people who do great work and cool curating.
* Do great work and share it.

Take an irreverent, deliberate approach to your goals. Be untraditional and self propelled with your research.¬† Be ambitious, discerning and goal-oriented. Be different than your peers.¬† Stand out. Create a positive growth environment.¬† Build a community around that.¬†

Once you find the path, take action, then you move on to ‚Äúhow can we improve every single detail?‚Äù The information you learn will guide you.

Write each step down.¬† Take notes when you find good information. Do it now on any piece of paper or device that can type.¬† When thoughts turn into things, *matter*, words on paper, they are statistically more likely to become reality,¬† you act on them.

er08j1,3,2020-01-19,"My job makes me feel useless, I do absolutely nothing and am starting to become depressed",ladybug20202,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/er08j1/my_job_makes_me_feel_useless_i_do_absolutely/,"Hi all,

A few months ago I got my first ""real"" job. To quickly give some backstory, I decided it was best to take a break from college and get my loans paid down a bit, save up some money and then go back to school and continue working full time once all of those have been fulfilled. I also wanted some ""real"" experience that wasn't retail like I had been doing since HS.

After months of interviews and no offers I landed a job at a prestigious office, which was offering really good benefits and so on. I accepted the job immediately. The position was really basic, and despite not having a degree I was hired anyway. Some of my tasks include scanning papers, opening mail and well, honestly I don't really do anything else worth mentioning. 

This job is nothing I expected. I do literally nothing. There's like never anything for me to do, and when there is, it takes up usually not even a half hour of my day. There are a few interns at my job and they are always overloaded with things to do. At this point I'm starting to envy them.

The whole ""not doing anything"" I'm sure to some people is great - you get to sit at a desk all day and do nothing and get paid. Personally it makes me feel absolutely useless and I'm starting to become depressed. I'm capable of so much more than doing NOTHING and it's really starting to affect me mentally. 

A typical day for me includes sitting at my desk pretending to ""be busy"" until lunch, and then repeating ""looking busy"" until I get to leave. It's awful. I ask if there's anything I can do, if I can do intern stuff too for some experience and am never given anything. 

The other day an intern promoted to be an employee because her department really needs someone. It made me feel terrible. I sit and pretend to do shit all day while this intern, who works 2 days a week, gets hired. I'm hesitant to look for a new job because I feel like I won't get any decent job without a degree and this one just happened to be pure luck. 

Also, the interns are so busy doing actual work that the things interns are required to do (run errands, pick up food, clean) is placed on me. 

I didn't mean to ramble but I just feel so down about myself. I am sick of pretending to work and meanwhile interns are doing so much more than me. Any advice? I feel so stuck"

er1q55,558,2020-01-19,Roommates 'solution' to missing sound on his computer,Mid-Game1,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/er1q55/roommates_solution_to_missing_sound_on_his/,"I did work in tech support for a summer internship and I also received a bit of experience in high school. However, I am still the Tech Support for some of my less savvy roommates and family.

RM - Roommate

The story begins with me taking my laptop apart to install a new SSD, when my roommate walked in. We talk for a bit, and he notices what I'm doing, and proceeds to tell me that his laptop is broken. I ask what happened and he tells me this.

**RM**\- My laptop is broken. It won't turn on anymore.

**Me**\- Did you install  something, or did you do anything to it?

**RM**\- I don't think so.

**Me**\- OK, can you try turning it on for me? (I wanted to see if it would post or how far it could get into starting Windows)

**RM** (starting his laptop)- Well, my sound wasn't working, so I decided to do a system restore. It was taking a while, so I ended up shutting it off. Now it won't turn on.

**Me**\- You shut down during a system restore?

**RM** (realizing he probably shouldn't have done that)- Well, I don't know, maybe?

Computer gets through posting and starts going into disk repair.

**RM**\- Can I skip this?

**Me**\- No this should fix it.

**RM**\- Ugh this is going to take forever. (ETA 10 hours)

**Me**\- Don't shut it off! If this doesn't fix it, I can probably just reinstall Windows on your computer and it should work fine.

**RM**\- Fine. But I already ordered another laptop, and it already shipped.

**Me**\- What... You can still return it right?

**RM**\- I guess, but that's difficult. Are you sure you can fix this?

**Me**\- Pretty sure. Just let it run.

About an hour later he calls me over to his desk. His computer has finished repairing the disk, and is now guiding him through the setup process of Windows.

**RM**\- So I've gotten here before, but now what do I do?

I end up walking him through the Windows setup. It looks like his restore ended up working, just the only point he had saved was the factory default settings of the manufacturer. After listening to cortana jabbering about the installation process for about 10 minutes, he finally came to the realization that his sound was now working.  
He was a bit bummed that he lost his files, but for the most part grateful that he didn't have to spend the money on a new computer.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  - Roommate's first instinct to fix a sound issue is to do a full system restore. He then shut down his laptop while restoring, and couldn't get his computer to start correctly after. He proceeded to buy a new laptop instead of letting disk repair fix the computer on its own. I fixed it by telling him to be patient."

I want to make sure that I'm taking into consideration the amount of opportunities available, like internships or job fairs. I know Austin seems to be a pretty good place for that, but i have no info about how A&amp;M is about that. I also don't really have much in terms of scholarships provided by either school.  
I'm a straight A student in all my classes, a lot of which are AP, but I have no clue how that'll translate into college. I'd like to think I'm good at learning on my own, and I don't mind big classes.

He got there a couple of minutes after I did. Anyway he introduces himself and we sit outside coffee bean. 

When we start he doesn‚Äôt give any of his background or interests. He goes straight into talking about my background. I talk about the general family and community. He asks what I like or dislike about my school. I start talking about an academy I am in at my school called CODE Academy. I say it‚Äôs a 3 year commitment that provides computer science courses, volunteer experiences, and competitions. He asks ‚Äúso what is code?‚Äù And I thought he meant what the program was so I go into detail. He restates the same question ‚Äúno but what is code? Like biology, chemistry or a science?‚Äù I was confused bc I just said it was computer science oriented and eventually he goes ‚Äúohhh so like computer code?‚Äù (He was pretty young so there wasn‚Äôt the possibility that he didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about) None of his questions felt like he genuinely wanted to know. They all felt like he was just testing me by playing dumb. It wasn‚Äôt anywhere near a genuine conversation. 

At one point he asks if I had any questions. I ask some decent ones but he gave the crappiest, vaguest answers. I asked ‚Äúhow did Harvard prepare you for the transition from a student to your professional life or even just life after Harvard?‚Äù Homie goes on to explain that Harvard didn‚Äôt prepare him like that bc it‚Äôs not a trade school that teaches you a profession. Like huh???? So no internships, research, or just life skills in general? Okay....

I also asked if there was any club or extracurricular he felt passionately about. I though maybe he got to talk about himself he‚Äôd be a little more excited. He talked about how he was president of the entrepreneurial club and it was the only time he seemed slightly interested in what we were talking about. Probably just excited he got to stroke his own ego. 

And I should mention this whole time he made eye contact with me about 5 times. He seemed so disinterested and looked like he just wanted to get the interview over with. 

He asked about my stats at the end and that seemed to catch his attention at least. Entire interview almost reached the half hour mark. He left as soon as the interview was over. 

I hope you guys have Interviews much better than mine &lt;3

Edit: I just remembered he asked me what STEM was"

But I ended up finishing the semester a lot better than I thought (3.56). Now, I'm wondering if I should drop one of my easy electives and take CMSC250 instead. Would this be a good idea? Or would it look bad for internships if they saw that I had a relatively 'easier' second semester with my electives? I'm two semesters ahead for math (I only have MATH240 left) so I wouldn't really fall behind if this upcoming semester was lighter. Also, if I don't take CMSC250 this Spring, I'd probably take it in the fall.

I graduated a month ago (6 months early) with a degree in engineering. Lately I‚Äôve just been feeling really down with my choices in life.

I took a high paying job out of college and was feeling on top of the world. I just started this week. Now I‚Äôm seeing all my friends enjoying college, and I‚Äôm starting to really regret my whole college experience. 

I stayed in-state, so I saved a lot of money since I didn‚Äôt have to dorm, but I really really regret this because I felt like I really missed out on the college experience by commuting to class.

I was so focused on looking good for engineering internships, that I chose to do engineering clubs, hated it, barely put in any work, and eventually stopped attending. I wish I had joined more clubs, as my friend group right now is very small and full of people that I don‚Äôt really vibe well with. I wish I did cool things like attend parties, instead I was up 24/7 studying engineering. I never studied abroad, which again I really really regret. 

Yeah I‚Äôm making good money and am successful, but I don‚Äôt feel fulfilled at all. I just feel very lost üòû I almost want to drop everything and study abroad and tell these cool stories, but it‚Äôs challenging because to employers it looks bad to take months off, not to mention the experience that I‚Äôm not gaining. My field that I‚Äôm in right now (software development) isn‚Äôt even related to my major and I put in SO much work to get my job and it‚Äôs a cool job, but I just don‚Äôt feel fulfilled. And I just started this week, so it‚Äôs just really hard to just quit. 

I don‚Äôt know, I am just feeling really FOMO and unhappy. I don‚Äôt know what to do and could use some advice. Thank you for reading this."
era9uj,0,2020-01-20,"Why You Should Graduate Early (I saved ~$420,000)",joiemoie,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/era9uj/why_you_should_graduate_early_i_saved_420000/," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM1mogvsGtc&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM1mogvsGtc&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I wanted to make this post to encourage people to take graduating more seriously through overloading in earlier years of school. This is for those who are capable of graduating earlier, but want to artificially extend their time in college for friends and experiences. If you are already trying your best, this post isn't for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: 

 I was able to finish my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at Boston University in 2 years by:

1) Taking 16 AP courses in high school 

2) Taking nearby college courses during my high school 

3) Overloading on courses during college.  That saved me \~$420,000. That breaks down to $120,000 for 2 years of tuition saved and $300,000 for 2 years of income.  

First I will go over the positives. These are:  

1) The amount of money you save. 

2) The more experience you can acquire. 

3) The more you can free your schedule in you choose to extend your degree.  

Next, I will answer the common criticisms and questions: 

1) Are you missing out on friends and experiences? 

2) Will you have to be overworking yourself and is that worth it?  

The savings will come from two areas. The first saving area will be the cost of attending school.  The next part of comparison is the salary that you are giving up by going to school instead of working at a full time job.   

Let‚Äôs break down the cost of attending school. Let‚Äôs just put the average cost of tuition at $20,000 per year. Your total tuition over 4 years would be $80,000.  We can exclude the cost of food and housing because you also need food and housing if you are working. Let‚Äôs assume you take on summer internships each year, $20 an hour for 12 weeks your first summer, $25 an hour for 12 weeks your next summer, and finally $30 dollars an hour for 12 weeks for your final summer. Your income over your entire college would be $36,000. Generally, students who take internships get a higher salary when they start working. If the average college graduate income is $50,000, then they might expect a pay increase of 10%, or a starting salary of $55,000. After tax, that will go down to $42,900. Given this, the cost of attending college for this student is $44,000 over 4 years, not including room and boarding. This hypothetical student finished college with a post-tax salary of $42,900.

Let‚Äôs take the next scenario of graduating early. This hypothetical student graduated in 2.5 years. The cost of tuition was therefore $20,000 times 2.5, or $50,000.  Let‚Äôs assume the same internships for the first 2 summers at $20 an hour for 12 weeks and then $25 dollars an hour for 12 weeks. Over those 2.5 years, the student will have made $21,600. Suppose that because the student had 2 internships rather than 3, his pay increase was only 5%. That would make his starting salary $52,500, which after tax would be $41,300. Finally, this student works for 1.5 years, and after those 1.5 years, 4 years have now passed. Over those 1.5 years, he would have made after tax, $82,600. Overall, is overall net worth would be $32,600. Compared to the student who went to school all 4 years, that student‚Äôs net worth would -$44,000, which means a difference of $76,600.  Finally, after those 1.5 years of working, if he is able to increase his salary by 15%, his income would go from $52,500 to $60,375, which after tax would be $46,400. His final salary after those 4 years is higher because full time work experience is more valuable than internship experience.  By choosing to go to school longer, the first student is paying an extra $76,600 dollars in both tuition and time opportunity cost. Friends and fun shouldn't cost you $76,600 dollars, and you can do that for much cheaper after you graduate and still attend clubs at your university. 

Some people believe that college is to make business connections. You can participate in clubs being an alumni, and in fact you will be more valuable. You can use the money you saved on tuition to fund a start up!  You can also graduate early to finish a Master's before people normally finish a bachelor's. I finished my Master's by the time people would finish their third year of school.  

The last benefit of graduating early is course flexibility. Courses are easier in the beginning and get harder towards the end. If you max on the courseload early on, you can still choose to graduate in 4 years with fewer courses in your junior and senior year, which might contain the hardest classes. It's easy to extend a degree if you need to.  Another thing is that people often underestimate the courses they need to graduate because they aren‚Äôt reading their planning sheet carefully enough, or they fail a course or two. Would you rather do the max courseload early on in your degree, and then have leeway later on if you underestimated the amount of credits you have, or be forced to max your courseload later on and have to max out on your courseload just to graduate on time? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: If you stay longer than you need to in uni, you are paying $50,000/year or more just for friends, which you can get for much cheaper as an alum. You can still attend clubs from uni and go to parties as an alum. Also, by aiming to graduate earlier, you give yourself flexibility in case later semesters become too hard."

I hope it‚Äôs alright to post about internship opportunities. As a computer engineer, I know how hard it is to come by cutting edge ASIC / Computer Architecture jobs / internships so let me shamelessly promote this research focussed internship. It‚Äôs properly paid, including plane tickets and an accommodation stipend on top. If you‚Äôre interested in what we‚Äôve been up to before, just google for MN-Core.

erbfdh,3,2020-01-20,[24f] I am 6 months pregnant and had to cut off my whole family.,whatthefu-ckjen,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/erbfdh/24f_i_am_6_months_pregnant_and_had_to_cut_off_my/,"This is my first time ever posting to Reddit, so I‚Äôll try to make it as concise and not-confusing as possible. 

-okay after typing the whole thing, it ended up be super long so I apologize and if you read this at all thank you in advance. 

I‚Äôve always had a weird relationship with my family. It was really hard growing up, my mom has addiction issues and spent 10ish years in prison. My dad passed away when I was 17, so my siblings and I didn‚Äôt really grow up around each other or form a relationship until we were older. I have a sister who is 30, a brother who is 31, an estranged brother who isn‚Äôt really relevant who is 26, and two younger brothers who are 13 &amp; 14 (they are the most important to me because I basically raised them until their last couple years, when my sister took custody). 

I‚Äôm 24 now, and in the last couple years have really tried to work on building a relationship with my siblings and my mom. I let my mom move in with me and I paid the bills and gave her a weekly allowance. I had phone calls every day with my sister. I helped watched my brothers kids on the weekends when I could. And I always kept in touch with my youngest brothers. Granted I‚Äôm not a perfect person, for a couple months last year I ran into money troubles and my oldest siblings helped me. It was about $800-$1000, and I paid them back quickly afterwards but they hold it against me. I wouldn‚Äôt have asked but they are constantly stressing to me how we are a ‚Äúteam‚Äù and they want me to come to them when I really need help. 

So when I found out I was pregnant, I was excited because I really thought it would bring my family together. 

The first person I cut off was my mom. About two months into my pregnancy, I moved in with my boyfriend and left the place we were living in for her. I continued to pay the bills and give her a weekly allowance even though I was no longer working. She stole things from my room that I wasn‚Äôt able to move out yet, pawned it, and started working in sketchy undercover poker rooms. There were a lot of times there I forgave her but the last straw for me was that she had apparently owed $20,000 in taxes for one of the poker rooms? I don‚Äôt understand it fully. And tried to guilt trip me into paying it so I cut her off, as in block her number and just lost contact. 

The second person I cut off was my brother but I feel like this one was a long time coming. To put it short my oldest brother sexually abused me when I was growing up, and when I tried to confide in my mom and sister about it they called me a liar. So I feel like I grew up with this unhealthy relationship towards him, where I constantly had to make him happy or not disobey his rules. The place that I was living in with my mom was a condo that was owned by my late father, and all the children inherited it so we all have part ownership. In 2013 when I went to college and came back for the summer, he turned my room into a nursery for his kids and put all my stuff in boxes and told me I had to move out. I was fine with moving out but I was upset because I felt like he could have told me in advanced, because now I was a broke college student with no plan. Luckily that summer I had a great IT internship that paid well so I got an apartment and took care of myself. It was just hurtful how much him and his girlfriend treated me like I was disposable, and when I tried to confide in people about it, it got back to them and they called me a liar to save their reputation. Pt 2, when I was about 2 months pregnant he basically sent me an eviction notice and said that I have to move in with my boyfriend. Even though I pay my part of the bills. I asked him why and he said it‚Äôs because he wants to sell the place, and I reminded him that we all own it. But I didn‚Äôt want to argue so I packed my things and left and told him to leave me out of whatever he‚Äôs doing because it‚Äôs none of my business and I don‚Äôt care anymore. And to no longer ask me for money. 

Lastly is my sister, and this is the most hurtful situation that I haven‚Äôt really been able to talk to anyone about. 

My sister and I have falling outs often. We get into fights and then we won‚Äôt talk for months. And usually it‚Äôs about something dumb like we borrowed each other‚Äôs clothes or something. 

Well our relationship was getting better, we were getting really close last year and she started getting into really bad fights with her long term boyfriend. They were super toxic and a lot of times she was being toxic towards him ie. Putting him down, going through his phones, monitoring who he hangs out with, monitoring his expenses, telling him what he can‚Äôt and can wear. This is super unusual for my sister because she‚Äôs normally very level headed and caring. She would call me every time and I would try to give her advise the best I can but it was hard because it was almost like she didn‚Äôt want to hear it. So I figured it was one of those relationships that you just had to let play out and I would just try to be supportive. 

So this past Christmas, I bought her a present and my two youngest brothers presents. My boyfriend and I go to their house and drop off the presents. They were all expensive gifts and we went through a lot to find them because they were often sold out. My sister opens her gift, and literally throws it and says ‚Äúwhy would you buy me this! Return it‚Äù I remember getting red in the face and I wanted to cry but I didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward so I just saved face. My boyfriend was furious and in the car told me I should have said something. But I just let it go. 

Two weeks later she texts me asking for receipts for the rest of the gifts. I ask her why and she said they had no use for them and wanted to return them. This was like a breaking point for me even though it‚Äôs so little. But I took a breather and calmly explained to her that I felt like it was rude that they were so open and tactless about how unhappy they were with their presents, and that I wish they would just give their gifts away or sell them instead of openly telling me they want to return them. She told me I was inconsiderate for not giving them gift receipts, and that it was my fault for not going by their wishlists. I did go by my two younger brothers wishlists, but reminded her that she never made one. I tried to tell her that it‚Äôs not about the money or the gifts but just the fact that they always feel comfortable just openly being so disrespectful towards me. I‚Äôm the black sleep of the family, so they‚Äôre always commenting on my tattoos, makeup, career choices, everything. And I feel like my sisters critical attitude rubs off on my younger brothers. I told her it‚Äôs clear that she‚Äôs not understanding where I‚Äôm coming from and that it‚Äôs whatever. 

She starts making a bunch of personal shots at me, saying that I‚Äôm a bad sister and now that she sees it‚Äôs a mistake getting close to me. She was supposed to move in with me and my boyfriend mid February, since her and her boyfriend are breaking up and I wanted her and my younger brothers to live with us. (We are about to close on a house). She threatened to never let me see my youngest brothers again and said that I can‚Äôt hold anyone accountable since I make the most mistakes in my family. 

I feel like that part was the most hurtful but it was like closure for me for the relationship, because I realized that I don‚Äôt need anyone in my life who doesn‚Äôt see the value of having me in their life. After all the fights we‚Äôve had, this one really sealed it for me. After the last few messages, she blocked me before I could even say anything back so I just left it at that. I know she‚Äôs probably expecting me to come after her but I‚Äôm not going to. 



I think the whole point of this is that I‚Äôm mostly afraid of what my daughter is going to think. I‚Äôm due in May, and I know my family isn‚Äôt going to be at my baby shower, the birthing, nothing. It‚Äôs hurtful because I‚Äôve learned that my boyfriend‚Äôs family is all that I really have, and even though they‚Äôve never given me a reason not to, I just have a really hard time getting close. I haven‚Äôt really talked to anyone in my life about any of this because I hate sounding like I‚Äôm playing the victim. Even typing all of that out I feel guilty for sounding so victim-y. I‚Äôm not a perfect person that‚Äôs for sure and that‚Äôs what I want everyone to understand first. I‚Äôm just so scared for when my daughter gets older, and wants to know about my side of the family. And I‚Äôm not sure what to tell her. All of the above is also just a small glimpse of the things I‚Äôve been through with my family members. So I know it can sound kind of extreme to cut each other off but it was all a long time coming. I just want my daughter to have a great and happy life, and with the way my family is, I‚Äôm scared that one day in the future if she were to get mad at me she would cut me off the same way. I have no interest in reconnecting with any of my family except my youngest brothers. I basically raised them and I feel like my sister is using them to get me to apologize to her, by withholding them from me. It just hurts because I feel like my whole family just totally disappointed me. I‚Äôm totally focused now on just my daughter but I know one day she is going to ask those questions and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

If you read all of this thank you in advance. I don‚Äôt even really know what exactly I‚Äôm searching for. I just don‚Äôt want to feel alone anymore. I guess I‚Äôm really just wanting advice on how to deal with this, how to stop feeling so alone, and how to handle it with my daughter in the future."

erdbbi,2,2020-01-20,Entry level skills for digital design,balloonboom,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/erdbbi/entry_level_skills_for_digital_design/,"Am interested in getting an internship or coop for embedded systems/digital design. Currently am on a year off so I'd like to make the most of my time. 

Right now I'm learning:

\- FSM designs in VHDL/Modelsim

\- I/O, comms protocols, timers, interrupts with a microcontroller (Tiva-C launchpad)

\- Networking/socket programming in python

I was wondering what other skills I could develop for those sorts of jobs. Or if I'm better off combining them in some sort of a project (was thinking of an RC car controlled w rpi and arduino)."
erdipf,50,2020-01-20,"My interview didn‚Äôt go well, but I may get the job, how do I refuse it?",juniperbeer,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/erdipf/my_interview_didnt_go_well_but_i_may_get_the_job/,"Hello!
I recently applied to an internship at a company I have really wanted to work for.
For background I have a full time job now, but I saw this internship as a way to get into this company.  I was willing to risk it.
I had two phone interviews, one with HR and one with the project manager (potential boss).
The project manager wanted to meet me in person.  We had an informal interview at a coffeeshop.  I do not feel it went well and I don‚Äôt think I will be able to work with this person no matter how much I love the company. She talked down to me like I was an idiot. Then she called me timid and shy. She said i seemed terrified of saying the wrong thing. She barely looked at my work sample. She told me to email it to her but left without giving me her email. 

I don‚Äôt think it is wise to let go of my full time job to work for this company as an intern, since I am not guaranteed full time employment after and I will be taking a cut in salary.  I also don‚Äôt think I like my potential boss.

How do I gracefully deal with this situation? I don‚Äôt want to burn any bridges.  I may find out tomorrow, since the office is closed today, so I have little time to decide.  My interview was Friday, at 5:30 (at the end of the day)."

I'm graduating with a bachelor's in computer science this spring and I submitted my application to OMSCS October 3, 2019.  When I applied my GPA was 3.07 but now it's 3.17, is it worth updating in my application since I haven't heard back yet?

And if not how long does it typically take to hear back? I was under the impression that it would only be a month or 2 at first.

For more context I've had 2 software engineering internships, have secured a job at FAANG following graduation, and 2/3 of my recommendation letter were submitted within the first week of my application.

Any insight would be very much appreciated, thank you!

Edit: 2 software engineering internships, not 3"

My story is atypical: since my early teens I had serious personal/health-related problems. I always heard that Computer Science grads were incredibly in-demand and getting my BS in CS would assuredly lead to a job. At the time I was just trying to get through the program because the unrelated issues were dominating my life. I didn't realize the importance of an internship, nor did my professors/counselors inform me just how much of a mistake it would be not doing one. I figured I'd just focus on getting the degree, get hired, and get all my *real* training at the job.

After graduation, the reality hit me that find a job wasn't going to be easy. I realized I fucked up and now I was going to pay for it. So I applied and applied got basically 0 calls back. My resum√© was(is) essentially blank except for my degree. No work, no extracurriculars, nothing else (again, as a result of my personal issues). The one response I did get, I was sent what was supposed to be a relatively easy HackerRank and I did poorly.

On a positive note, with lots of hard work and an equal amount of both fortune and help, my personal/health issues are now essentially resolved.

After a year and half of searching, I took an IT support job out of desperation, which basically has nothing to do with programming. I'm there now but it feels like a dead-end.

Anyway, I want to get back into *really* learning how to program for once. In school, we learned basically exclusively Java, so I feel like I know a good amount of the fundamentals. I wouldn't need to start entirely from scratch writing ""Hello World""s and stuff, but I don't really know where to pick up learning Java where my formal education left off. Should I even attempt going for a Master's now that I can focus on school 100% in hopes that I can get an internship/networking opportunities?

Any help is appreciated."

So I am looking for a critique of both of these documents if you could as well as wanting to ask a few questions.

1. I am wondering if I have begun to apply to jobs to early? My earliest start date would be march 16th d/t need to buy furniture and getting settled in the new place. I have already received one call back from a hospital who wants me to call them back when I am closer to my move date.

2. I was told to begin applying approximately 2 months before your move, but with the knowledge above in mind, when would be an appropriate time to begin to apply, and would it be largely a waste of time to apply before hand?

3. Anyone w/ NSG experience, I am trying very much to get into a Pediatrics position, with my experience in geriatrics, I feel that there is very little chance. I intend to study for and obtain my PALS Cert shortly after I arrive in March.  - W/o an internship or previous pediatrics experience, is there any chance of me obtaining a hospital Peds position?

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and respond, I greatly appreciate it.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I'm writing today because I wish to be considered a candidate for the open position of Clinic Nurse within Cook‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Health care which I saw posted on Linkedin.com. I've been looking for an opportunity to join a Pediatric department since graduating from my nursing program 2 years ago and I feel that I would be a strong asset to your clinical team. . I will be moving to Arlington Tx, March 1st 2020, and am currently studying for my PALS Certification.

I have a personal interest in Pediatrics because of very positive interactions with children and their parents during the time I was babysitting in High school and having taken in my younger brother to live with me from age 13 to 18. I also was privileged enough to rotate to General Pediatrics and a NICU for a month during my schooling for my associates degree. In fact, these experiences are what compelled me to become a registered nurse in the first place.

Since graduation, I have been working as a Registered Nurse in a sub-acute rehabilitation center as both a charge nurse and a nursing supervisor. These positions have exposed me to all kinds of different medical situations that have helped me to become a well-rounded caregiver. I'm thankful to have had this opportunity to hone my nursing skills, but with my move to Texas approaching, I am eager for further career growth.
Throughout my career both as a nursing student and a practicing nurse I have been a committed volunteer for local charities, remote area medical,  and various walks to end diseases. This experience has helped me develop a deeper sympathy, empathy, and caring bedside manner that my patients have expressed they deeply appreciate. 

I am a dedicated team player and don't hesitate to help my coworkers out, even if the task falls outside of my job description. I have confidence in my ability to multitask, think critically, and adapt to strenuous ever changing situations.  My ultimate goal is that every patient receives exceptional care and I'm willing to go above and beyond to provide it.

I would be honored to be part of your team at Cook‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Health care.  I'm confident that I have the attitude and skill set needed to perform the job. I‚Äôm also certain that there is plenty of room for me to learn new skills within your state of the art facility. I thank you for taking the time to review my application and hope to speak to you soon regarding an interview.

Sincerely,

erifwu,4,2020-01-20,How much SQL is needed?,DickDingle69,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/erifwu/how_much_sql_is_needed/,"Hi,

I‚Äôm applying for an internship in Quantitative Analysis and it says that I need to have knowledge of SQL in order to get it. So I‚Äôve been teaching myself sql for that past few days. I‚Äôve been able to teach myself basic stuff like using SELECT, WHERE and expressions so far. But I was wondering if typically in quantitative analysis, there was a set amount of things I should know?"

I‚Äôm not against staying with the company, but by the time I have my bachelor‚Äôs I would have been an intern for 3 years making $14/hr. This seems like an excessive amount of time to be an intern and I feel like I could make more just with the AAS. I‚Äôm definitely new to this so if anyone has advice I would appreciate it. Thanks."
erixy3,87,2020-01-20,Helpful Guide for MechEs,onlypostscode,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/erixy3/helpful_guide_for_meches/,"Here's some resources for any mechanical engineering students. I'm a graduated senior and I just wanted to walk through some of the classes and give you guys some tips. I wasn't a straight A student and I skipped most classes and self studied so these resources might be helpful to you. I graduated with a 3.3 and had 3 pretty good internships. Take this advice/resources however you'd like. 
 
 I'm going to base the class codes off the 2014-2016 catalog, so keep in mind classes might have changed, professors might have changed too since. So one class I say was hard might be not as hard anymore etc.

Also DEFINITELY get a chegg account lmao but make sure you still understand the concepts.

Also join ASME purely for access to their test banks and that one tailgate they throw with free top quality bbq. Always look at test banks when u study!
 
**M408C and other first year courses**
 
If you make sure you double triple check the grade distributions before u register u should be good here. Lots of youtube channels out there to help you with calc and chemisty and physics. Check the grade distributions first tho, thats really important, don't sign yourself up for a hard VAPA where youll struggle to get a C. Be really careful with checking your grade distributions, my 408D class was harder for me than mechatronics. 
 
Also, you don't have to stick with your FIG classes, feel free to switch and transfer out of them. Also you don't have to go to your FIG class

**History Courses**
 
Try your best o take the Gov courses online either over the summer at midlands or ACC or whatever. The online courses there are a breeze. The Gov courses at UT are going to require a lot of reading

 
**M427J**
 
http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx
 
**Engineering Physics II PHY303L**
 
I took this at ACC for my freshman year summer. I think that was a good  decision by me, especially since I didn't get an internship

**EM306 Statics**
 
Structure free has a dope videos on statics. This is the man. Also get your FBD right and be damn good at them or else you'll do poorly
 
https://www.youtube.com/user/structurefree/playlists
 
**Thermodynamics**
  
Lots of resources on youtube. I might've used the Ron Hugo video channel but I can't recall. This class can be a weed out class, be careful. Know your charts well and don't forget to bring them to exams
 
**ME318M Computational**
 
Pretty easy, depends if professor has changed, but for me homework was same as exams
 
**EM319 Mech of Solids**
 

Use structurefree mechanics of solids playlist, this class can also be difficult
 
**ME324 Dynamics**
 
I think I also used structurefree for this course.
 
**Fluid Mechanics**
 
I used simmy sigma video course. His video course used the same textbook as my class. His later videos have lots of errors though, specifically his pipe flow. Be careful
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JG_P6ixaaE&amp;list=PL7FF084F8C414D602
 
**Fluid Mechanics Lab**
 
Dude this lab sucks. They can take a week to do, don't leave them last minute
 
**Engineering Communications**
 
This class sucks but you gotta pony up and do it. Just get a good group/partner for your paper. Also if they make your write a giant linkedin bio, don't use it lol. nobody has a giant four paragraph linkedin bio its cringe
 
**Materials Engineering**
 
Depends on who teaches, but for me it was lots of memorization. 
 
**Heat Transfer**
I (think)  I used this video channel for this. I can't remember very well though. If you get Rylander argue points back after every exam no matter what. Its very likely you can get a LOT of points back  
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gihhKTViHW0&amp;list=PL_ZIJMd-rNhUApP0SuawDkIP4muI6QbPV
 
**Engineering Stats**
 
Did bad in this course lmao. But keep in mind if you go into Manufacturing Engineering or even R&amp;D and lots of other fields, engineering statistics are SUPER important. This can be one your most important courses you take all four years. Statistics are super powerful tool for an engineer. 
 
**Mechatronics**
 
Also struggled with this course, but if you have WeiLi do well on the quizzes. Lots of resources you can find online
 
**Mechatronics Lab**
 
Ok so this lab sucks. Depending on who teaches it, the exams will have you build a circuit then you write down the results for your circuit.  When I took the exam, if you couldn't get the circuit right you could raise your hand and get partial credit for what circuit you managed to get. Here's the thing, if you finish the circuit, and write down what you ""think"" is the right answer you can a 0 if your circuit is wrong and you don't even know it. The key here is to raise your hand during the exam and ask for partial credit for each question, even if you finish the circuit. This way the worse case scenario is you either get partial or you got the answer right. Instead of getting the answer wrong and getting like a 0.
 
**Machine Elements**
 
Farenthold is the easier of the two professors. Exams are take home matlab coding
 
**Engineering Finance**
 
Just learn how to do the conversion time value charts well
 
**DSC**
 
Class was hard
 
**DSC Lab**
 
Know how to build the LabView acquisition very well. There are some settings that you have to mess with that you won't get right if you just print out the VI and put in your notebook. Make sure you have a good notebook. Also vastly overestimate the amount of water for the two cup lab. Surface tension will allow you to be way over. 
 
**ME Design Methodology**
 
Get a good group. Remember engineering is about keeping it simple. I've seen a lot of wacky complicated builds with tons of 3D printed shit. If you can make your design out of stuff you buy from McMaster do that. Also keep in mind whatever the prompt is a solution has probably already been partially made on instructables. 
 
**Senior Design**
 
Dude this class is hard. Don't take a bunch of hard classes with this. MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD GROUP. Your a senior, hopefully  you have a close group of friends you trust. 
 
**CGEs**
 
Pick things that interest you but triple check those grade distributions 
 
**Internships**
 
Very competitive. Keep in mind if your freshman you don't have any skills. Volunteer at labs/engineering clubs to get experiences. Use that experience to get an internship. Use the internships to get a full time job. For volunteering stuff just send a bunch of emails to professors and check out SAE/rocketry club/ or whatever other established club there is.
 
**Applying for jobs** 
 
Online applications these days are filtered by keywords. For example if HR has a job application looking for people who know ""SolidWorks"" ""FEA"" ""Creo"" they will sparse all the resumes into plaintext and just filter for the resumes that have those three keywords. This is why sometimes they make you fill out your resume info even after your submit. Lots of people know fea and solidworks but if you have a niche skill that the job application has you have a better chance. If you just go down the line on Indeed and apply for everything the chances are nobody will ever see your resume and it'll just get filtered out. IF you apply online take a few seconds to throw whatever applications keywords there are into your resume you have a better chance. DEFINITELY do not just shotgun your shit on indeed. Indeed is really competitive and you will be filtered every time by the keyword algorithm

 
**Career Fair**
 
For non freshman this is a GREAT resource for internships. Like I said above most resumes get filtered out by a robot. If you have a good resume this is a great way to get some real human eyes on your resume. I don't do elevator speeches I feel like its weird, but its up to you. Ask recruiters for a card/linkedin to follow up on talking to them. I think career fair is better then just shotgunning your resume online imo
 
**ECAC**
 
Use the ECAC job system to apply for jobs. Especially if these job posting are only on ECAC, you have a much better chance of getting an internship/job. 
 
**ECAC Employer Events**
 
These are really good. Going to these info sessions are a great way to get real eyes on your resume. If your an upper division student looking for an internship or job and have a decent resume these are really great. 
 
**Final thoughts on applying for jobs**
 
What you want to do essentially is build up skills by volunteering/clubs. Once you get a decent resume and skills you are pretty much trying your best to get real human eyes on your resume. This is why employer event/info sessions/career fairs/networking is important. Face to face time is really important. You need both skills from volunteering/and your resume seen by a person and not a keyword algorithm.

 
**Tutoring**
 
With big classes might be hard to get one on one time for office hours. Use the Sanger center to get free tutoring. Its also great if your super behind on class and don't want the professor to know you've essentially skipped every class. You can study on your own then just mark topics that you don't get or are too hard and have the tutor explain them. Double check who your tutor is. Some of mine weren't that great but I got one guy had a phD in mathematics and he helped me pass diffeq.
 
There is also tutoring from one of the engineering societys, can't remember which. But sanger will only tutor the lower division stuff, and the society one will do a lot of specific MechE classes.

**Class Registration** 

Use the registration plus extension or whatever and ALWAYS check the grade distribution of whatever class your signing up for. When I signed up for classes I always prioritized picking the easier professor, then the class time. There are some 408D classes out there with worse grade distributions than weedout MechE courses. 
 
Anyone who is code savvy can download the database from UT Catalyst and sort for worse class average grade for each semester. ALMOST every time the lowest class average will be 408D or 408C. Don't start your college career with an F in 408D (there are 408D classes with that class average)
 
 **UT Therapy**
 
You paid for it dawg use it. You don't only need it if your having a breakdown. Go there and bitch about your professor/lab group or anything that is really stressing you out. Can help a lot and help you focus on ur schooling
 

 


 ***UT is a good mechanical engineering school. Best of luck to all the mechanical engineer bros out there.***"
erjmnm,25,2020-01-20,Ways to Make Money in College as a Full-Time Student (personal experience too),lamejarsenemy,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/erjmnm/ways_to_make_money_in_college_as_a_fulltime/,"Hey guys, what's up. This is my first post here, my name is Jeremy and I currently attend Cal Poly Pomona as a second-year Computer Science student. I just want to drop this post here since a lot of students are wondering what are the ways and side hustles they can do to make them a few extra bucks, whether it's for food, books, entertainment, your Netflix account, or whatever. I'm going to list ways, and most of these ways I have done, so I hope you guys benefit something from this!

**Online Ways to Make Money:**

1. **Do Freelance Work** \- Doing freelance work means selling services online like graphic design, logo design, video editing, and you can get paid a quick $10-$15 for a task that can probably take around 30 minutes. It's not bad money, but the only downside is the competition. I've done so with T-Shirt design and made a good amount of money in the past years that I've done this. If you don't know how to use the software, there are always free YouTube tutorials online that could teach you to do so. A freelance website that I used was Fiverr, but there are other ones like Upwork.

2. **Test people's websites and apps** \- I've done this as well with sites like UserTesting and TryMyUI. Basically, you take a quick survey per task of who you are, and they check if you qualify or not. If you do, you can do that certain task, which basically consists of you talking to a microphone and following along with their ""app"" or ""website,"" depending on the task. You can do this with mobile devices and desktop as well, and they generally pay around $10 per task.

3. **Dropshipping and Print on Demand** \- Now this one is a little more complicated, but it could seriously rake up profits if you're doing it right. I mean like, thousands of dollars a month. There are tutorials on how to do dropshipping and print on demand business, which I've done both with Shopify by watching YouTube tutorials and it generated me around $1000 a month at one point. Not too bad! Just watch out because the competition is rough nowadays, but if you set your heart into it, you can definitely make it somewhere!

4. **Create content or become an influencer** \- Creating content could start with YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, you name it. You can grow it and eventually get sponsors from other people or advertisements. If you use the right key terms, hashtags, your content could easily be discovered by people of similar interests. You need to be patient, however, it does take time to grow so you need to be patient. I've started my YouTube channel based on the college niche (vlogs, advice, questions, rants), so if you guys are interested, check it out as it will definitely help me a lot! :)

 [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClaaXhWDyCjfNKhcpKR-GBg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClaaXhWDyCjfNKhcpKR-GBg) 

and I've even made a video about this topic as well, discussing the same methods that I made in this post :)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3LKcRhdg3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3LKcRhdg3s)

5. **Start a blog** \- This also falls under the same creating content category, but I feel like it's on its own spectrum. Blogging is awesome if you love writing, and it's different in the sense that you're having your own website and platform rather than relying on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, or whatever. I haven't personally done this myself but I've seen a friend of mine who's making $1400 a month from ad revenue on her blog posts. She's a poet and she posts a lot of poems on her blog.

6. **Reselling Things** \- You can buy used things online and then resell them for a higher price. This could be physically doing it as well, not only online, where you can go to Craigslist, buy things in person and resell on eBay, Mercari, or those reselling apps. It's awesome, but at the same time, it's risky knowing the fact that there isn't always a buyer interested in your item. So be sure to buy/sell on popular items when you've copped a good deal.

Physical Ways to Make Money

7. **Drive for Food Delivery Services** \- Postmates, DoorDash, GrubHub are your friends. I own a Hybrid car which saves a lot of money on gas and I've used that advantage to make money driving for Postmates. I love the tips, and I love the process overall. I get to start as soon as I finish school and end whenever I feel like it. You can always deny offers if the drive is too far and it's a perfect side hustle in the free time.

8. **Part-Time Job** \- It's pretty self-explanatory but be sure to find a job that's flexible on your school schedule. I've worked 5 different jobs and gained experience through them, so a part-time job is definitely awesome as well if you have a neat schedule. It'll definitely add up experience in your resume, which could interest internship and job opportunities in the long run!

That's about it, hope you all enjoy my post! If you have any other ways to make money and as a side hustle, comment down below :)"

I'm in 2nd year of Computer Science in a University outside of Dublin.  I've completed a Data Analytics internship using mostly SQL, R and a bit of JS in one of Ireland's biggest banks last summer and have another Software Development internship in a much smaller company lined up where I'll be working with Ruby and JS.   I plan to do some extracurricular projects as well this year on top of some websites I've developed for businesses. 

Java would definitely be my strongest language but I've done a fair bit of C and Python.

 I've also done pretty well grades-wise in the leaving certificate &amp; college. We have a placement next year that we either organise ourselves or apply through the university for it.

Really want to get a car after the internship and I'm hoping I can be a little selective, I know there's many other factors at play beyond money but it would be a pretty important one.  Which of the companies in Ireland would pay the most for someone on this type program and provide the best benefits?

I've heard really good things about Facebook, Microsoft, Stripe, Amazon and LinkedIn but have no idea how to make myself attractive to them &amp; which of them would be best if any of them.

Thanks a million folks, highly appreciate any insight yous might have."

erml51,6,2020-01-20,Communicate over internal network,Finnthebroken,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/erml51/communicate_over_internal_network/," 

TL;DR: How one communicate two applications in different computers? Is it a terrible idea do this on a shared text file over internal network?

For context:

I'm in an internship at a small Asset Management company. My boss has developed an algorithm for his quantitative trading strategy that runs on his computer. I need to develop an application that receive his trades decisions end execute them on another computer that has the bloomberg terminal.

Here comes the problem:  
I'm having trouble to decide on how to communicate these two applications. My boss suggested that we use a shared file over the internal network that would be written to by his application and read by mine trading application.

But I keep thinking: Is this a reasonable way of implementing this? Wouldn't be terribly slow? It seems to me like a jerry-rig (i guess that's the english term that I'm looking for).

I first thought of two other solutions that I'm not familiar and would have to learn to use them: sockets (which seems simpler, but too much low level... it seems like it would be a lot of trouble). Build an API using flask on python (which I fear it may be an overkill, but it seems like could be done in an organized way and without too much effort once i learned the basics of it).

So, how would be the right approach to this problem?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
I'd like to make clear that I'm an undergraduate electrical engineer student and the experience that I have in programming is more or less just enough for the use of personal/""scripting for a class homework"" applications such as implementing a numerical method learned in class or something like that. I don't have real training in software development and almost null understanding of web development. Yeah, I took a course on OOP and another on algorithms and data structures. But when it comes to less obvious stuff It often goes to the scope of what I don't know.

erml69,10,2020-01-20,"(24m) I'm just utterly lost, I need to make at least 3k/month in 16 months. Right now living at home, unemployed while in grad school.",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/erml69/24m_im_just_utterly_lost_i_need_to_make_at_least/,"I recently quit my first full time job and I don't know what to do now. I hate living at home with my parents even though they are fine with it. Its stigmatizing plus its limiting in my own development.

The real problem is that my student loan payments will come knocking at $1800/m in about 16 months from now. I'm in grad school full-time for journalism which freezes that loan payment until then.

I tried working full-time as a recruiter, but with the additional workload of school it was all too much so I quit.

I don't know what to do now. My loans tell me that I need to get on track soon at a company to prepare for those payments, but I'm also overwhelmed working full-time while in school. Right now I'm hoping there's a full-time job out there that is more compatible with my current needs but I don't know what that would be, or if it exists.

My age and peer group make me feel that I need to get a serious job regardless in order to move out of my parent's and begin my adult life for the first time. I also want this. I am not scared to be independent. Those general adult independent living skills are not an obstacle.

So I see my options as either looking for the right full time job, which is hard with my arts degree, but possible. Or I could work part-time or intern in my field somewhere and hopefully get a full-time job that pays well when I receive my masters.

Or I could pursue my journalistic dream stress-free while living at home, which is to create an online platform for the issues that are important to me. I went to journalism school to learn the skills of doing this. But this idea has obviously the biggest risk, but its where my heart is. Since I seem resistant to being a typical company man I want to take this as a sign to commit to my dreams instead. Crazy talk I know. Being unable to commit to one path I believe has prevented me from really making any progress in any path. Being unemployed lets me at least commit to one thing even if its the greatest risk.

My back up, back up plan is Bernie or Warren get elected and somehow pass legislation to erase student debt which is basically a crapshoot. But being 24 and virtually lost is really hard for me to accept compared to how I've lived my life so far and the vision I had for myself.  I'm worried about falling too far behind, becoming bitter, and turning into that person who never launched and lives with his mom and dad at 26 or so and copes with my unmet developmental needs in dysfunctional ways. Sorry to fuel the shame of others who are in this situation. I'd love to relieve myself of this shame as well."

I am able to decide on when to go, but I have been getting conflicting opinions on when I should go.

* **The argument for me working first** is that it will look bad to employers if I graduate and do not have anything relating to my career or skillset for the following 1.5 to 2 years. This is assuming I finish and immediately seek a job with a US employer and not a Korean one (which makes sense because other than companies like Naver, Kakao, and Samsung there don't seem to be many companies that can seriously compare to American ones). If I were to look for a job in Korea then I assume they'd understand the situation because every guy goes.
* **The argument for me serving first** is that I just want to go and finish the military service ASAP and get it over with.

It is also worth mentioning that I worked as a software engineering intern and a contractor for a medium-sized tech company in San Francisco for about seven months in total, but I do not plan on going back there. I've heard arguments that ""an internship is an internship"" and that having a real full-time job is more important for proving to future employers that I am an employable person.

Employment eligibility concerns are nil because I am a dual citizen of the US and Korea, so there's no extra factor to worry about relating to visas here."

21F here. Im going to be finishing my junior year this semester and I‚Äôm thinking about dropping out. Even though it‚Äôs my junior year, I will still have 2 years left since I switched majors. I‚Äôm feeling like I really messed up and possibly made the dumbest decision of my life here. Last spring I was a nursing major, and had to take an art class to finish up my gen eds. I hadn‚Äôt done anything artistic in a long time and fell in love with it again while I was in the class. The teacher really hyped my work up and made me feel important and even asked me if I‚Äôd thought about switching to become an art major. At this point in time, I was depressed and just generally unhappy with my nursing degree, and I feel like I was just looking for a way out. I ended up getting accepted into nursing school, only to decline the offer and switch to a Fine Arts major. This past fall was my first year as an art major, and now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs even for me. To even do something with your art degree, you have to network and meet tons of people and that‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm terrible at. On top of that, I‚Äôve been unable to get an art internship anywhere so far, so my resume is empty. I feel like I would‚Äôve been better off as a nursing major, since that would‚Äôve guaranteed me a job. 

The thing is, I‚Äôm already over $20K in debt just from these three years. I have 2 years and a semester left as an art major and I‚Äôm wondering if its even worth it to finish up my bachelors at this point. My parents keep telling me to finish it and that just having the bachelors will help me get jobs, but I just don‚Äôt know if I have it in me. If I quit now I would be a little over 20K in debt, if I finished my bachelors I would be around $35K in debt. I would switch majors again but I don‚Äôt even know what I want to do. If I were to do nursing again I would have to apply in the fall and wait till next fall to begin, so another year. If I were to drop out, I have absolutely no plan. I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do then either besides start working at any place that‚Äôll hire me. 

Any advice here? I‚Äôm really struggling"

Firstly, this a throwaway account, I just don't want my co worker to find me on reddit.

So  currently I am doing my internship at company A. I was assigned to  company B because company B outsourced their whole IT department to  company A to handle. Right now I am the only person on site (on company  B) and the staff here are relatively small, around 60-70 staff.

Unless  there is a major breakdown/down time, my supervisor from company A  asked me to try my best to solve any problems on my own. I don't know why  but every time the COO of company B have an issue with the  server/network I'm just clueless how to explain the situation to her.  She is the type of person who want an immediate solid answer on the  current situation.

So  last week she brought up to me on why is it taking so ""long"" for her to  access and save file into the file server. I tried to replicate and  anticipate the issue but to no luck. I was accessing the server without  any issue. So here are some of my concerns and questions :

1. Does  the type of connection (LAN/WiFi) make a huge difference on the file transfer rate? if it does I am exclusively using WiFi to access the  network and I have no issue the whole time I'm at company B.
2. My coworker from company A asked me to check the server health and also the network bandwidth (SMB). Their DC and file server is a HP server, I  know for Dell I can use iDRAC to check the server health, but what can I  use for a HP server? And also how do I check the network bandwidth as  instructed by my coworker?
3. Right  now the file server storage space usage is \~900GB free of 9TB. So I am  wondering if the free space left affects on the read/write performance and file access to the server?
4. The COO asked to check on it because she don't want any excuse in case the server crashed as she have raised this concerns to us (company A). But as I said from the above I have absolutely no problem with the network files so far.
5. The  COO is currently using a relatively new laptop, so I hardly think it has anything to do with her laptop. i could understand that some of the staff that is using old laptops that is still using HDD to face this kind of issue. But is it possible that it is her device that is the  problem? I request to check her laptop in case it was just her, but she said no, check the server because she had no issue before last week with the server.
6. I  tried doing a ping test to the DC and file server for around 2 hours, and the average was around 3ms, minimum of 0ms, maximum of 320ms and the  packet lost was 4 out of 7110. I'm not sure if this information is relevant for this case, thought might as well let you guys know.

I seek advice on my current situation as I have no idea what to do and I am actually starting to lose my mind.

Thank you!"

Why life has to be so complicated ? I don't get it. I don't get anything. I don't get people, I don't get the world. I'm so lost and broken. Maybe living is just not for me ?

erxa0o,6,2020-01-21,Moving from Game Development to non game SWE?,Striking-Pear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/erxa0o/moving_from_game_development_to_non_game_swe/,"tldr: How difficult is it to swap from game programming to non game programming / SWE? New grad looking for work with a background in AAA game development trying to leave games. Should I take a no name SWE job or AAA developer job for 1-2 years and then transition to non game SWE?

I spent 5 years working as a Technical Game Designer in AAA but I quit two years ago to pursue a BS in Computer Science. I was finding my interest in building software kept growing while my interest in design kept dwindling so I figured why not! I'm graduating this Spring as I did an accelerated program due to already having a previous bachelors.

I've been grinding leetcode and applying to non gaming Software Engineering positions as I don't really wanna go back to games. I grew tired of the long hours and I'm looking to Software Engineering as I really enjoy building software and it generally has better pay, more flexibility as to where I live, etc. My problem is the same as most new grads, applied to around 100 new grad positions / internships but haven't gotten much in the way of interviews. I got a couple but I fucked up the coding tests; like I said, I'm grinding leetcode so already working on getting better. 

So my question is, how difficult would it be to transition from a game programmer position to a more traditional software engineering position? I have a lot of friends in the AAA game space and I know I could get a fair number of recommendations / interviews as a result but I don't really wanna work in games long term. Would it be better for me to keep applying to new grad software engineering positions and take whatever I could get? Or should I try to get hired as a game programmer, work for a year or two and then hop over to a non-game programming position?

I'm thinking a AAA studio as a game programmer would be better than a random SWE job at a no name company? But I have no idea how difficult it would be to swap over after 1-2 years."

I'm currently in university right now for a degree in Construction Management, I will be graduating in the Fall of 2020. I have interned with a construction company and found that it's not really a good fit for me for a number of reasons. I have always been interested in computers and have always had IT in the back of my mind.

With that being said, I plan on finishing up and graduating with this degree as I have been at university for 5 years and I can't afford another few which would be needed to change majors.

I have been doing research about the industry and looking up the basic certifications that I need. I have already started on the A+ certification, I was wondering what other certs I should get in order to secure a entry level job within the industry. I was also wondering if doing an internship would be worth it for this upcoming summer? I would like to hear everybodys opinions on the industry (what you like/don't like), what job is the best to get your foot in the door? (I've heard helpdesk) and what is the best route to take as far as certifications and landing a first job. I have VERY little experience with programming, just some with Matlab and Python.

I would also like to get some knowledge and explanation on the different routes you can take within the industry such as network, security. Finally, will it be hard to get into the IT industry with a degree from an unrelated field? I have been thinking about this and the only connection between construction management and IT would be that I have experience with project management and some computer application experience, I'm not sure if this helps or not. 

I'm still very new to this and I'm doing research on it but any help would be very much appreciated."

I don't have any paid tuition benefits at work and the work is pretty much run-of-the-mill SaaS web dev for a small startup. My current job is full-stack web developer and I've worked for several years as one. 

However I am interested in moving into another area, Computer Vision. This is gonna be a far cry from doing CRUD web apps so I need your help here in paving my journey.

How would an experienced programmer pick up the gaps in advanced CS topics in a way other than attending classes at school, but can still make you a serious contender like the applicants that did have a heavy CS course load at school?

Places like Uber, NASA, and Amazon look for software engineers that specialize in CV. For interns, they favor students that take classes in related math, CV and Machine Learning.

So I am not a student, but a self-taught web developer. And I don't know what the already employed, non-student counterpart to ""study a lot in school and take the right CS classes"" is like, to getting my first Computer Vision job. Essentially I need a place that has a position for it with hybrid status of ""Self taught, experienced in SWE but not in this very specific CS heavy niche"" where I want to be at."

1.  A project that involved using MATLAB to provide simulations of data.  

2.  A project that involved C/C++ code to make an Arduino do stuff.

I started as an intern, worked part-time through college, and was hired full time after I graduated.

I'm really not sure what I should do. I have a great relationship with my current co-workers and manager, but we've gone through a decent amount of churn recently and I worry that asking them to be a reference for me would sour things, especially because this position seems pretty competitive and I worry it may all be for nothing.

This person would be most up-to-date with my performance and skills in areas that are extremely relevant to the position I'm applying for.

In order to do so, I would need to take a full load (5 classes or 15 credits) consisting of all upper division level courses at a commuter school which takes over an hour to get to. While I could probably handle the course load, I think my GPA would suffer as a result. However, my GPA is already quite good (3.5+), so it may not be that bad of a decrease.

I am also interning year round for a relatively well known company part time during the school semester and full time during the summers. This internship ends when I graduate from college, and if there is a position available, I would most likely be a good candidate. 

The thing is, I am also interested in seeing what other internships are out there and I would like to land another internship elsewhere in the summer as a way to see what I like while also gaining more experience. This would mean I can spread out my course load, relax a little more, and graduate in December of 2020, still a semester early from my expected graduation date. Furthermore, I feel like I've focused so much on school that I haven't taken the time to network and partake in extracurriculars (though there aren't many that interest me).

So my question is should I graduate a year early in the Spring of 2020 and look for a full time job, or wait another semester to graduate and hope to land another internship during the summer? If I graduated in the Spring, the company I am working for now most likely won't have an entry level position open, but I will have to verify. 

Any insight is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I have a few internships under my belt, and I am fairly sure I'll get a job offer with the company I'm interning with (fingers crossed).

I've always had an interest in medicine. I found the work that doctors do very interesting. You get a stable job that pays super well. You are highly respected as a doctor. You make a living out of helping others.

My biggest problem right now is money. I'm set to graduate with about 80k in debt. This includes my loans as well as the loans my parents took out for me. It's not a pretty amount, but if I live with my parents and work for a few years, I think it wouldn't be too bad. I'm praying I can find a job in the 70k-80k range if I do choose this route.

My 2nd problem is my current resume. I lack a lot of the shadowing, volunteering, etc. that medical schools look at. My grades are fine. I'm sure I can work on these things and build up a good resume if I put my mind to it. It would just take time and money.

If I wanted to go to medical school, I'd have to put off my huge debt AND add more. I'd need to work in a medical field for a while to build my resume for 1-2 years. I'd have to go to school and residency which would be another 7 years. I'd be in a ton of debt if I could make it through medical school. Is this even worth it?

Am I happy I chose my current major? Definitely. I feel that there's a lot I can do with my degree in terms of jobs. I feel safe knowing I can find a job and pay off my massive debt. I don't HATE my major. There's tons of work in engineering, even jobs not related to my major that I can get. I'm sure one of them out there will make me decently happy. I just feel that medicine is something that has always been grabbing my interest. I'm happy with engineering, but sometimes in my mind I feel like I ""settled"" for something else. I feel like my fear of debt and finances is pushing my career choice. If my family was well off, there's no doubt in my mind I would graduate, work towards getting into medical school, and become a doctor. 

As you guys can see, I'm about to graduate yet I don't know what I want in life. I hope I found the right subreddit for this. I would greatly appreciate any insight or advice you all have!"

I wasn't great at paying attention to concepts in college and made the mistake of not working on any personal projects. I just finished with my IT internship (couldn't land a CS one) and started looking for jobs recently.

Every junior position is asking for things outside of what I know (knowledge of numerous frameworks, testing tools, server knowledge). I feel like I barely even know the languages I thought I knew. I'm scared that I will not be able to find anything, and I'm not picky about salary or prestige, literally anything above $45k will make me happy. I freeze up before submitting resumes, not wanting to waste my time (or the company's). I'm terrified of my future and the possibility that I won't be able to find a dev job.

For reference, most jobs around here are asking for Java experience before anything else. I haven't seen a single junior position for a python dev (unfortunately).

I've been feeling horrible lately and even though I'm working on a personal project (Java currency converter using selenium), I feel like I'll never be able to come close to meeting the expectations of these companies. Every moment I'm working on the project, I feel inadequate. Every moment I spend relaxing, I feel like I'm wasting time.

I have a therapy appointment next week but I'm worried that nothing will help at this point.

Edit: I should add that when I was in college I did do well in any programming class and graduated with a 3.7 GPA. I enjoy programming, but all of the anxiety of job-hunting and inadequacy is starting to take that away."

I am a computer science freshman and I have been having difficulty finding an internship/summer job in my field of study.  I was looking at different opportunities provided on sites like Handshake Student and Indeed since the previous semester, and it seems that a lot of companies tend to hire for their internships with students starting in sophomore year.  And for companies that do look at freshmen, it seems that they try to find students who have a lot more experience in programming and skills.  I have only had 2 semesters of C++ and slight experiences in Python and Java which make me doubt I could even get in for such an opportunity.

In other words, my question is what kinds or opportunities are available for freshmen looking to hone their skills in summer work even if they are not highly skilled?"

I know UT has an amazing campus/college vibe, but based purely on computer science strength, what sets it apart from other schools? I have to make the choice between UT and UTD CS and need a couple of reasons for why the program of UT outweighs the financial benefits of UTD. And at first glance it seems like a no brainier, UT is substantialy higher ranked for comp sci than UTD. But I don't really know what's the basis for those rankings are wether it be access to internships, classes, professors, research etc... I am pretty confident many UTCS students had to make the choice between UTD v UT and was wondering was the quality of the UTCS program worth it?

Since past two years i have not gained any much interest in material science and went for placement process of bank to explore it.

Honestly i havent had any big interests in either side : banking or material science.

What is your opinion i should do? ( Long term as well as short term perspective )
I would like to share that these are the only options for now , and its only 5 months in both.

I think i should go for banking to explore the corporate in an itern role and if i dont like , i d have to start at a lower level in my field ( material science)to pursue it further .
I am really confused and anxious about this decision .
Sometimes it seems its just an internship , and what could go wrong . Othertimes it seems so heavy to think about what to choose.

Any opinion or suggestion is helpful.
Even a perspective or an advice .

Basically, I just want to graduate, but my school requires an internship for graduation. Other than this requirement I'm for the most part caught up. Ideally, I should have gotten one junior year but I was too damn lazy. I did some applications but failed pretty much at the phone interview stage for most companies. Because of this, I now have to take a summer quarter consisting of just one credit internship review class during senior year. This class must be taken concurrently with an internship. So senior year comes along, first-quarter already whizzed by. I took 12 credits this quarter on purpose telling myself it would give me more time to work on applications, but I'm already in my third week of the quarter and I haven't done jack. I just fall into a habit of cleaning and playing videogames. But I need to change. I want to change myself. I know what I need to do. But I just keep avoiding it.  I'm not overly interested in CS and I feel like employers see that. I did it because I thought it would be a smart degree for someone who didn't really know what to do, to make decent money in the future. Now it's biting me. I want to grow up. I want to stop wasting time playing League of Legends or watching dumb garbage on youtube. But so far, nothing seems to be working."

Today, I'd like to ask for your help.

My current situation: I'm a student from Germany and finished my bachelor's degree with a GPA of \~3.6 (1.4 in German grading system). I studied Business Informatics / Information Systems, which has like 1/3 computer science, 1/3 economics and 1/3 of information systems (think of business process modeling, knowledge management, development of application systems (waterfall model, scrum etc.)). Right now, I'm doing a gap year where I'm doing two internships (these are usually not done for job offers but for work experience) before I want to start my master's degree. Since I did two courses in data analytics, I started liking this topic a lot and also wrote my thesis about a data science topic where I analyzed a dataset in R.

Initially, I planned to do a data science master abroad but reading a lot about the career opportunities of data scientists on Reddit I'm not so sure anymore. I'm reading more and more that these programs are cash grabs and are created because of student demands, while there are actually not that many jobs for inexperienced data scientists.

While I had fun with statistics and aced these courses in university, I don't have a hardcore math/stats background and also not a CS background. I like the application and comprehension of models on a higher level but not really the maths stuff. But on Reddit, you basically read that this is absolutely essential as a data scientist and everybody recommends a statistics degree. So I'm also not sure if I should pursue this path. I also tried to pick up elements of statistical learning, which seems to be a must-read for aspiring data scientists, but I couldn't really get into it. It was too difficult for me.

Right now, I'm also thinking of just continuing my degree in Information Systems (I don't think there really is an equivalent in the US, at least I don't know of one) since I also really like most of the IT topics. For a project in my current internship, I'm designing the system architecture and the API specification and also develop a web application (frontend in Angular, backend in node.js). At another internship, I was part of a data warehouse project where we were the link between software development and the business, basically translating the business requirements to the developers and assure that it's implemented correctly. This meant creating test data and validating correct ETL processes.

Most Information Systems master degrees also offer some data analytics courses. The ones I took at my university were also from the master's program. My second internship will also be at a data science consultancy where I will code in R most of the day.

What would you do in my situation? I really like to work with data but this career path seems kind of ""insecure"" compared to being more generalistic in IT."

I just finished my CCNA last week and school is done at the end of April (hurray!) I have an internship of 8 weeks to do afterwards. I have like 7-8 companies in mind where I would want to do my internship/work but they all need like 5 years of experience and specific knowledge about certain technologies. Is it possible to start as a Network Administrator with CCNA without having experience ?

I still applied on their websites, including my resume and a cover letter saying that I wanted an internship with them just so they can communicate with me..

I think the best way would be to go directly see them and ask them if they can take an intern first and talk to them about possibilities. I have 7 years of experience in sales for a telecom company. I know it doesn't count as a network admin or sysadmin but still I think if I can just talk to them I might get a foot in the door. I live in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

So what do you think ? How would you approach them if you were in my situation ?

Schools: Northeastern, Tufts, Rutgers, UPenn (mega reach LMAO I'm not expecting to get in here), American, Georgetown, Penn State

I worry that my ECs simply aren't impressive. I see y'all out here with big internships at the NYSE and like doing science research and like I feel like I've wasted 3 years of HS and now I'm scraping for anyone who'll take me. I'm applying for an internship at the New York Historical Society so hopefully I get in. I also don't have many great ECs nor a spike so I worry I lack any personality.

I've been looking at schools in Boston, so the northeast is really where I'd like to stay but I've also been looking pretty intently at UF, so really east coast. Not looking for a huge party scene but a school with lots of clubs and student interaction is a big plus. Campuses near a city are great, but as long as there are things to do I don't mind either. Boston is my top choice, it's just perfect for me. History, culture, opportunities, good schools, college city, 10/10

I found that odd, since most of the engineers at my school have easy access to internships. I realized that it's because my school located within commuting distance of a huge military base, which means ample contractors with ample internship opportunities (not to mention on-base civilian work). 

Most people I know are aware that a post-graduation job requires an internship or two. They don't even realize that mid-semester, local internships exist in abundance near certain colleges in addition to summer ones both local and abroad. If you want that opportunity, make sure to take into account the *location* of the school as well as the other stuff you're interested in. It doesn't have to be in a military town; big tech cities and coastal port cities are similar such locations. If you do work during the semester, many companies have flexible hours that work around classes, and it helps that you also get that dank paid internship cash mid semester.

Experience is everything in our job world. Make it easy to have access to that."

City college has a good computer science program i believe but its pretty far and idk if its worth it just for a slightly better CS progam?

esgslj,7,2020-01-22,TIFU by signing up for an escort service,Gelicca,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/esgslj/tifu_by_signing_up_for_an_escort_service/,"After calming down and laughing about this moment with friends, I think it‚Äôs time to share this story. This occurred in early December.

A month ago I ran into financial hardship as I am currently a university student , and I signed up for a site that allows men with money to pay for women to go on dates, an escort site. When I first signed up for this, I was very hesitant as there are so many weirdos out there and safety is always number one priority. I eventually began messaging an older man, around his 60s. We had a causal conversation on the site and I asked why he would be on a site like this. He informed me that his wife passed away a year ago and he really only wanted someone to talk to and go out with. Whenever you hear something like this, you are always suspicious.. When you feel sympathy for someone, you open up more and feel comfortable towards them. I then asked if he had social media, as that always gives a personal look into someone‚Äôs life to see if they are honest about who they are. He then linked me his Facebook.

When I clicked his page, I guess he was telling the truth about his wife, and I noticed we even had some mutual friends. This was not surprising as he works in the same field as I am majoring in, and it‚Äôs a very niche space. I clicked on his wife‚Äôs page, and it was an obituary page filled with pictures of loved ones, heart felt messages, etc. After confirming that he was being honest, I decided that I was willing to go out with him. We arranged a date shortly after, and he agreed to pay upfront for the service which was surprising. 

This was my first time ever doing something like this, and we decided to do dinner in a downtown area and to a walk around a local park. I live in the southern United States, so the temperature is fairy nice in early December and a lot of people are out and about during night. I felt safe knowing this and that we decided to meet at the restaurant. 

When the day finally came, I wore conservative clothing as I did not want to give any implications of having anything sexual and to let him know this date was simply platonic. We met at the restaurant at around 7ish, and it was awkward at first due to the age difference being about 40 years, but due to having a lot in common career wise, it was easy to talk about his work and my schooling. We were at dinner for about an hour til we decided to do a lap around the park which was down the street. The park is very lovely in early December as it is lit up with Christmas lights and decorations. There‚Äôs a section of the park with a Christmas tree that is a very popular spot for a picture op. While walking by the tree, he waved at someone to take a picture. I was very hesitant about this, but reluctantly didn‚Äôt oppose. He wrapped his arm around my waste, and I was a little creeped out, but I smiled and they took the picture. We ended our walk shortly after and headed our separate ways. Although the date did not go poorly, I just felt uneasy about the whole situation. He messaged me a few times after about setting another date, but I didn‚Äôt respond and erased my account on the site.

Now this is where the story takes a turn... 

During the week of Christmas, I received a Facebook message from one of my mentors who I had an internship with the prior summer. It was a jpeg file with the caption ‚Äúis this you with *date‚Äôs name*‚Äù. My heart sank... When I opened the file, it was a Christmas card saying ‚ÄúHappy Holidays‚Äù with the picture we took in the park. I was mortified.... despite anyway I could try to spin it, it would look bad regardless. I just closed out of messenger and erased Facebook off of my phone.. I tend to run away from my problems instead of addressing them... I still feel uneasy about the amount of people who have this picture on their fridge or who received it... 

tldr: Signed up for an escort site and arranged a date with an older man in his 60s that works in the same field I am majoring in. Went on one date with him, and near the end he wanted to take a photo near a Christmas tree display. He ended up using this photo for his Christmas card, which was then sent to a mentor of mine during an internship I had previously."
esgv3h,45,2020-01-22,Internships that I can take that might look good for software engineering.,clinkyscales,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/esgv3h/internships_that_i_can_take_that_might_look_good/,"By this summer the only classes that I will have done that actually give me some experience will be computer science 1 and 2 which is basically just a bunch of java. 

First off I guess this post is based on my assumption that I won't qualify for actual software engineering internships if my only experience is based on these limited courses. So if this the wrong assumption let me know.

If my assumption is correct, what I'm looking for is internship ideas that I might qualify for that are maybe less technical than software engineering, but that will still look good when I know enough to go for actual software engineering internships."

esh9a7,5,2020-01-22,Summer Internship at An Embassy? Good Idea or No? Seeking Advice.,zhang_2928,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/esh9a7/summer_internship_at_an_embassy_good_idea_or_no/,"I am a sophomore Computer Science student. I moved here from China six years ago.

I have been fortunate enough to have received a surprisingly lucrative internship opportunity for the Summer of 2020 at a foreign embassy in Washington D.C. It's very much exactly what I was looking for in terms of skillset required, hours, demand, and the pay is much more than I anticipated.

The only thing that's holding me back is the country that this Embassy belongs to does not currently have good political relations with the United States. My mother is strongly against this, scaring me about me being put on a ""registry"" of some sort (I'm skeptical that even exists), and now I'm concerned that my internship at this embassy may hamper my job prospects in the future. My mother is paranoid of a lot of things though and I don't know how true what she said is. Is it really that big of a deal to just intern somewhere? It's not like I'm employed by them.

I am not interested in pursing a job in the American public sector / government after graduation. In fact I would be ineligible to do so because I currently hold Chinese citizenship, and do not have American citizenship (I'm here on an AIIB visa).

**So, being barred from working in the U.S government or any government-contractor does not concern me as I already am ineligible to work there, for I am not a U.S citizen. Nor do I have any plans to obtain a U.S citizenship.** 

But--I am concerned about the consequences that this could have on my prospects of getting a job in the private sector. Could an American private company not hire me just because I interned at an embassy?

Because ideally, I would love to work at a Western firm, but in the Asian market (Singapore, Shenzhen...etc.)

Sorry for the lengthy post. Any additional information that could help me make a decision would be helpful. Thank you!"

I tried to look up pasts about engineering students and their internship search experience, but I couldn't find any. I would appreciate if you guys could share some experiences or tips on when you landed your first internship, how many companies you applied, where you found the companies to apply to (other than career4engineers)  etc,."

esj08g,2,2020-01-22,Is it wrong to continue applying while having an offer?,eurojdm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/esj08g/is_it_wrong_to_continue_applying_while_having_an/,"Had an interview today, they know I graduate in May but they knew that before the interview started. It seemed to go really well. I proposed the idea that I‚Äôm available as an intern 3 times a week until May and from how the manager states everything, I would have an offer ready and be an intern meanwhile. (It would be an unpaid, for credit internship)

I also just signed up for 2 networking events with my university, will be attending the career fair as well. Don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up or anything but I feel like by May I‚Äôll end up with at least 2-3 offers to choose from. The one that I think I‚Äôll receive from today‚Äôs interview pays pretty low. $60k (NYC, city job). The way it‚Äôs setup is pretty much you max out at about 76k over about 5-6 years, and then hopefully receive a promotion. I don‚Äôt really like that concept.

Would it be wrong of me to accept an offer and then reject it if I find something better?"

I am pursuing a master's degree in computational biology and getting prepared for the last semester. I took 10 CS courses during the master's program and I realized I would like to work in the tech industry rather than biotechnology. I did my research about coding bootcamps and there are some that actually offer internship opportunities as well, so I quickly thought about giving up the degree for bootcamp. I can put the degree on hold and graduate anytime I want. Or, I can switch major and re-apply to CS master's. With this being said, if I give up computational biology degree for bootcamp, would this be a wise choice? I would appreciate anyone's advise."

esjsfo,1,2020-01-22,Should I Keep Listing My First Degree?,nerinmar,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/esjsfo/should_i_keep_listing_my_first_degree/,"Hey All;

I'm a second degree student getting a B.S. in Computer Science; my first degree was a dual B.A. in Philosophy and History. I'm wondering if I should keep my first degree in my resume.

I'm of course applying to internships and jobs in the C.S. field; I've had a tech support job and a year long internship at a company doing C.S. work; I have a few projects under my belt, and I've been a grader for three difference C.S. courses, as well as president of the C.S. club at my university. Obviously, not the worst as far as that goes, and pretty much enough to try to show I have some credentials.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: do you all feel it helps or hurts to have the Philosophy/History degree on there? I'm very fond of my first degree, and those subjects really are my passion. However, I'm concerned leaving it on might distract from my more notable and relevant credentials in the C.S. field. I don't want to HIDE the fact I've got another degree, but I'm concerned if it's relevant.

TLDR; I've got a liberal arts degree and I'm getting a CS degree and applying for CS jobs: should I keep listing my liberal arts degree?"
esk9z4,0,2020-01-22,Working as a developer without formal study,guilhermetod,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/esk9z4/working_as_a_developer_without_formal_study/,"[TL;DR] I am a last year law student who works as an intern in a lawsuit office. I already passed the bar exam and the place I work at want to keep me as a lawyer next year. However, I found out that I absolutely love to code and I want to work doing it. In a year of study, I would probably have the same amount of dev knowledge I got from the law school to be an attorney, given how I could spend the whole day coding and studying it. Question: Is there much rejection from companies with people that have no tech related degree? How long would it take studying by my own to get to a level where I'm able to get w decent job?

[Long version]

So, I am a last year law student in Brazil. During the middle of my course, I started working as an intern in what is the equivalent of the State Attorney General Office. There, we had tons of repetitive lawsuit themes. Same discussion, same arguments used, just different plaintiff. Naturally, we had a lot of repetitive work which required a great organization.

So, after about 7 months working there, when I started having more responsibilities, I created a google sheet to organize my deadlines. In a couple of months, I pretty much mastered Google sheets for my needs and tried to expand it through Google Apps Script. I never even tried programming before, but I was never afraid of doing anything tech related and always had great success with self learning. I programmed there for about a year and then my contract expired (interns can only have a 2 year contract in Brazil, they didn't wanted me to leave, but I reached that period). I know GAS isn't the most sophisticated platform and some people might think it was just a very basic programming, and that's partially true.

But the thing is, I absolutely loved doing what I did. I created a calendar for the attorneys, which they automatically had the lawsuit documentation ready for download before the deadline count started, a mechanism to detect duplicated lawsuits, which believe it or not, caught duplicated lawsuits that weren't caught by neither the State Attorney's or the Court's internal system, another mechanism for Attorney's to ask different types of documentation and so on.

I loved programming so much that I would go to classes during the morning and work, then go to my actual work, go back to classes (yes, I took classes during the morning and night) and stay awake till very late. As I said, GAS is initially a very limited platform, but after hearing about Clean Code, I got the book and took it seriously: I refactored all my projects, created my personal library, developped locally using clasp and TypeScript and always cared for my code, I loved that work more and more. I think that you can feel my excitement with this thing at this extent of text.

As I said, they didn't wanted me to leave, but since they are a government department, they can't just hire me. I either have to take a civil service exam, which is not always available, or they would need a public trust vacant, but they don't have it right now.

I already got another intern job in a lawsuit office. Since I'm in the last year, they even want me to work as a lawyer next year and I even passed the brazilian equivalent to the bar exam already.

But, as you can tell, that's not what I want. I don't have any problem with just switching my career right now, and to be honest, in one year more I would definitely get more knowledge than I ever got at the law school simply because I could do it all day (I know there's probably a boring part, but have you guys ever read a lawsuit case?).

The only thing holding me from just shifting my career is how accaptable are companies and the market with someone without a degree in this area? Someone that is self taught, not much experience but a lot of will to learn about it and do things? I mean, how long would it take me to get a professional job or something like that? 

I don't have a problem with throwing away what I learned in the law school if I manage to get in the same position in a similar amount of time, but at the position I'm in right now, I can't just start another degree (at least 4, more possibly 5 years here in Brazil) to then be able to finally work. Is there much rejection with not having a degree? Do tech companies have this vision of investing in someone's will to learn, even if they don't have much to offer at that moment? How long do you guys think that would take, studying by my own, to get to a level to be able to have a proper job? I would probably get a good job as a lawyer next year, can I manage to get a decent one as a dev? Does anybody here started from another area or with no experience at all as a dev? How it was?"
eskeay,0,2020-01-22,Summer Internship Question,Long-Explorer,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/eskeay/summer_internship_question/,Hello everyone I just got a summer internship in the silicon valley. The pay is $54/hour and $88/hour for overtime. The work is mostly comp sec. Regarding the amount they are paying me is it okay? I don't want them to pay me less just because I am a newbie
eskpaq,1,2020-01-22,"I'm a junior dev a month into their first job. Need some advice on how to philosophically approach and understand a big, muddy code base.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/eskpaq/im_a_junior_dev_a_month_into_their_first_job_need/,"Question is pretty much in the title. I've done two internships and I've never seen a code base this large. It also doesn't help that a lot of it is complete and utter trash, which are my manager's words and not mine (we're about to begin rewriting a large portion of this code base in Java / Spring). 

Like a lot of you, I'm super interested in this stuff, keep side projects as a hobby, and often find myself coding, thinking about code, or reading about code even in my free time. As a result of this and two decent internships where I felt like I learned a lot about design patterns and ""best practices"", I felt pretty confident coming out of school that I would be able to ramp up pretty quickly wherever I ended up working. 

What they don't tell you about ""best practices"", however, is that there are a great number of professionals who either don't care about them, don't understand them, or simply have to continue patching and plugging a sinking ship because the code base is a decade old and no one has the fucking time or resources to rewrite it, so the cycle continues. I wish there was a class I could've taken in college that involved learning how to read bad code. I definitely would've taken that class.

TLDR: My question to all of you is how I need to approach a code base that's large, unwieldy, contains 10k line classes, and is generally terrible? Especially if said code base might not even be used anymore within the next year and a half?"
eskudq,5,2020-01-22,Should I (Junior Student IT Tech at my Uni) jump ship to work PT for an MSP,Renfah87,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/eskudq/should_i_junior_student_it_tech_at_my_uni_jump/,"Hey everyone.

I'm a college Junior right now working on campus as a student IT tech making $12/hr 20hrs/week. Last week I interviewed for a 'Server Engineer' position at a small MSP here in my college town. The listing said they were looking for a FT person but I figured that I would just apply and see what happens since I'm currently looking for an internship and FT employment upon graduation (Dec 2020). 

I just got a call with requesting a 2nd interview and was given an offer to work PT (~32hrs a week) for $14/hr with the opportunity to switch to FT and salary upon graduation. I asked what the FT salary would be, but the guy kinda beat around the bush and didn't tell me but I will bring it up again in my 2nd interview.

My question is, would it be advantageous for me to leave my fairly cushy, low stress student job on campus for $2/hr more than what I currently make? I asked the guy if I could have until tomorrow to talk to my wife about it and sleep on it. I think it would be a good opportunity for me, but I'm unsure because of all the MSP horror stories I read about on here and r/sysadmin.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/rJDJ8bp) is a snip of the job listing that is now closed. TIA!

Edit: Something I forgot is I already have some IT experience. Mostly help desk/desktop support but have been working with Active Directory for about 3 years. I'm also 32 and married so I'm familiar with 'the real world'."
eslklj,3,2020-01-22,Graduate a year early with 1 internship or look for another one?,Easy-Entertainer,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eslklj/graduate_a_year_early_with_1_internship_or_look/,"I  am currently eligible to graduate in the Spring of 2020, 1 year earlier  than my expected graduation date (Spring 2021). In order to do so, I  would need to take a full load (5 classes or 15 credits) consisting of  all upper division level courses at a commuter school which takes over  an hour to get to. While I could probably handle the course load, I  think my GPA would suffer as a result. However, my GPA is already quite  good (3.5+), so it may not be that bad of a decrease.

I  am also interning year round for a relatively well known company part  time during the school semester and full time during the summers. This  internship ends when I graduate from college, and if there is a position  available, I would most likely be a good candidate.

The  thing is, I am also interested in seeing what other internships are out  there and I would like to land another internship elsewhere in the  summer as a way to see what I like while also gaining more experience.  This would mean I can spread out my course load, relax a little more,  and graduate in December of 2020, still a semester early from my  expected graduation date. Furthermore, I feel like I've focused so much  on school that I haven't taken the time to network and partake in  extracurriculars (though there aren't many that interest me).

So  my question is should I graduate a year early in the Spring of 2020 and  look for a full time job, or wait another semester to graduate and hope  to land another internship during the summer? If I graduated in the  Spring, the company I am working for now most likely won't have an entry  level position open, but I will have to verify.

Any insight is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

Right now I am on the east coast but want to try living in Southern California for a few months or a year after graduating. If I am unsure of whether I want to stay in California, am I better off finding a post-grad internship where I have an end date and more freedom (in case I decide to go back to the east coast) or should I try looking for more full-time opportunities in California even though I am unsure how long I would want to be there.

esnaqz,174,2020-01-22,"Hmm, nah, I will not allow your remote control session.",IsThisKaii,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/esnaqz/hmm_nah_i_will_not_allow_your_remote_control/,"As a lowly TS intern who barely knows anything about TS since I studied security instead, my colleague kinda has to work doubly hard to teach me anything before he could just leave me alone to my own devices, doing whatever he delegated to me. We recently got a second intern, so I had to teach him whatever my colleague taught me.

So, here are the cast of characters:  
$me: me, of course, the lowly TS intern with no background in TS.  
$usr: user in question who needs some help  
$col: my dear colleague who's been here since the start of my intern  
$int: a fellow intern that joined recently

&gt;$col: sends message to the group chat that consists of $me and $int Hey, please help $usr with his VPN issue, same cert validation failure  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: cool, hey $int, why don't you try to remote into $usr's laptop and solve the issue for them? You can use my laptop (their laptop did not have the remote application)  
&gt;  
&gt;$int: sure, why don't you ask $usr for permission first before we proceed, since you have to send him a link anyway

So I messaged $usr, as follows:

&gt;$me: Hi! This is $me from IS, may I know when you're free so I can remote into your laptop to help you with your VPN issue?  
&gt;  
&gt;$usr: now is fine  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: *sends link* alright, just click on the link and click run!

So he does that, and I pass my laptop to $int, told him to press the button that says ""launch remote control session"" and wait for $usr to elevate us so we can finally gain access.

&gt;App: *user has denied desktop remote control*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: weird, let's try again. *clicks on launch remote control session again*  
&gt;  
&gt;App: *user has denied desktop remote control*

At this point, me and $int are both confused. I checked my message to $usr and verified that I had indeed messaged him with the words ""remote into your laptop"", so I messaged $usr again

&gt;$me: did you deny the remote control access?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: please accept it *internally* god how can someone be so dumb

$usr doesn't reply, but to his credit, he allowed us to remote into his laptop on the third try (finally!) and so $int got to work, solving his issue

Once $int was done, he used the app to message $usr:

&gt;$int: can you try to use your VPN?

No reply, so I decided to IM $usr

&gt;$me: hey! We're done with the fix, please try your VPN and make sure it works!  
&gt;  
&gt;$usr: *disconnects session without saying anything*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: *internally* uhhhhhhh???  
&gt;  
&gt;$int: *looks at me* well I guess this is a TFTS moment

Well, thought I'll go by three months of intern without my own TFTS and I guess I was wrong.  


Edit: Fixed formatting on my home laptop! Feels great to be away from people who take IT for granted."

espfkx,1,2020-01-23,Internship Advice for HS,AdiBaby04,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/espfkx/internship_advice_for_hs/,"Hello. So I am currently a sophomore in a bay area high school, and last summer, I landed an Internship at a mid-sized tech company in San Francisco. I worked with Android infrastructure/QA, and was paid more than I can do anything with, around $12k. My manager said he wanted to work with me again multiple times, and I think I did pretty well at the internship. So a few days ago, I wrote him an email regarding a next summer internship, and he said it couldn't happen because it was a frugality thing. As next summer comes up, I want to intern somewhere, but I am not sure where, or who would take me. That Internship was more of a lucky strike, I knew no one there, but my manager really liked my GitHub. What do I do? 

tl;dr: Will tech companies consider offering me an internship if I had experience?"

I also have phone interviews for the Google STEP internship next week, two days before my Microsoft offer deadline.

I‚Äôve asked Microsoft for an offer deadline extension, and I‚Äôve asked Google to expedite the interview process. For now, however, it seems like I probably won‚Äôt hear back from Google before my offer deadline.

Should I just accept Microsoft if my offer deadline arrives before I hear back from Google? 

I‚Äôm not sure waiting for Google is worth the risk of having no internship. (And I‚Äôm also not sure if STEP is necessarily better than Explore.) Ideally, I‚Äôd really like to see my Google application through and be able to compare my offers if I‚Äôm fortunate enough to get both. I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice!"

esq46d,4,2020-01-23,"Completely confused and lost in terms of career goals at the moment, can you please provide some guidance ?",tra2019,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/esq46d/completely_confused_and_lost_in_terms_of_career/,"Hello all,

I am working in software industry for the past 2.5 years. I would define myself as a go-getter. I am self driven, ambitious, sociable and practical. In terms of my perspective I would say I am not looking for a job but a career. So showing up everyday and getting paid is not enough for me.

I have been in my current role for 1.5 years. Last year we have been through a major reorganization, this affected our daily work tremendously. My job definition kept changing every 6 months or so, and at the moment it is neither what I signed up for nor the same job people do in industry with same title.   I am now having a hard time getting interviews even with references and this is driving me into panic.

My coworkers are happy that they are getting paid for just showing up, and bully anyone who is trying to achieve something (including me and 2 other colleagues). Other two colleagues decided to tune off their efforts and now sailing alongside pretty much doing nothing and not gaining any kind of expertise. I find this extremely troubling, that there is no expectation from us. It feels like a government job.

The structure here as follows, unless someone with enough title and expertise wants to become a manager, my manager doesn't get promoted.

My father and father in law have been managers, so I consulted with them about this situation. My father in law thinks I should just stay and wait for an opening since the company is a well known one and there is job guarantee. My own father however believes that manager is doing this on purpose, not providing guidance and letting people bully each other into incompetence so he can stay as the manager and I should start looking for another job.

Also many competent and highly skilled people left the company after a year or so, and this seems to be trend now. Every other month someone is quitting to go for FAANG companies abroad offices. One reason for this is that my current company pays double of the current market rate here, so you cannot really change jobs locally since it means a financial downgrade.

All of the people who left complained about lack of challenging work and growth opportunity. Promotions seems to be not happening for any of us regardless of how hard we work or how much improvement we come up with. For this year's performance I honestly expect a low grade because I kept pushing instead of sailing.

Aside from this I realized I am now confused about my career as a developer. It seems like I am too driven for this kind of work. I am good at finding information, read books easily, develop ideas and designs easily, question a lot of the things and come up with improvements regarding resource utilization and constantly optimize.

I also have a natural understanding of how things work in general, usually develop an eye's bird view on matters, understand business side as well and also like to help people. Due to this, I am receiving way too much attention from pre-sales positions. They seems to be looking for someone like me. Even internally our pre-sales team had me meet their manager and encouraged me to think about switching after an hour chat. I am only interested in working in pre-sales if it is a cloud provider company though ( currently I am not working at one). I had an internship at a cloud provider and it was quite fun. I left the company I interned at to become a software engineer even though I was offered 3 different positions (both in pre-sales, consultancy and as contractor ) because at the time I wanted to ""learn the trade"" from inside. I can now say I was being naive.

It didn't turn out the way I expected. I am not even sure whether this is due to me failing to understand something, me being a woman or things simply being the way they are.

I don't even know which path to choose now, stay as a developer and study certain tech stack and become an expert on my own and sell that to next job ? Or start considering other positions such as pre-sales or management. However about these work I am concerned about work life balance, which I value tremendously. These kind of jobs require constant socialization and include other kinds or peer pressure. So it is not greener on the other side, I know.

At the end of the day I just want to work from home and stay with my dog and utilize the hours I loose to commute for hobbies. This seems to be the best path to me. However I lack the years and expertise for such a job, and even you find one it is another kind of gamble.

I don't even know where to start or what to spend my limited time on.

I would appreciate guidance and some questioning very much.

Thank you"

I'll  be completing my Bachelors  in Environmental Engineering in a few months. I've  decided to pursue a career in CS. I  want to join a Masters in CS program soon. I know a Masters is not required, but I am interested in delving in to advanced topics and in conducting research.

I've looked at Masters programs at universities I want to get into, and contacted the graduate program advisor for one of them. They all ask for prospective students to have sufficient knowledge of programming, data structures and algorithms, computer architecture and theory of computation. In addition they want people proficient in C, C++ or Java. Other than this they all require students to have taken calculus and linear algebra courses, which I've taken.

I have limited programming experience. I know python and basic SQL through a Coursera specialization. I had to take an introductory C programming course as part of my program. And know basic java through an online course, that covered the basics of object oriented programming, algorithms and data structures. I also know some MATLAB through university courses.

From what I've read on forums and from the graduate program advisor's reply the best way to complete the prerequisites is by taking the courses at a local/community college, this I can't do because there aren't any universities in my country Pakistan that would allow me to courses as a non-degree student.

The other option left for me is to cover the knowledge gap take online courses or through textbooks while staying at home and eventually work as an intern or trainee at a software firm. Then apply hoping that the experience would serve as proof.

I'm looking for suggestions on how I can cover the knowledge gap and if getting into a Masters program at a reputable (preferably in the global top 50) university in USA/Canada/Germany/Australia is possible. If there is someone how's been in a similar situation I would love to talk to them."

I noticed Germany had a demand for IT, and has nice work benefits, but I am open to any country. I just want to start preparing sooner rather than later. If it helps, I also am fluent in Spanish to the point where I can also live comfortably in a Spanish speaking country. As I mentioned, I am open to most countries if the work benefits are good.

essdiu,14,2020-01-23,"(Software Engineering) Extremely conflicted as to which uni to go to, UNSW or Usyd?",ExcelAvinash,unsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsw/comments/essdiu/software_engineering_extremely_conflicted_as_to/,"Hi guys, I'm a 2020 first year student (the confused year 12 kid :D) and am currently set to do software engineering at either Usyd or UNSW. I have already received offers from both and have seen the myriad of discussions on engineering at Usyd vs UNSW. Those have of course resulted in the overwhelming majority of people suggesting UNSW since they are the kings of engineering, but I feel like it may be different for me.

Firstly, I have heard many complaining about the trimester system, but have also equally heard many say it isn't as bad as a first year student. My only issue is how it will affect internships (since they are required for engineering). Would I have to take a trimester off?

Another problem is the distance for me, as UNSW is at least 30 mins added on to my travel each way, which isn't helped by the fact that the light rail has been plagued with issues and the bus lines being the most chaotic thing I've seen.

Usyd was also ranked higher than UNSW for the first time in a while in Computer Science on the QS uni rankings, and software engineering is probably closer to CS than anything else. Also, the new engineering building is scheduled to be open later this year, which should help modernise the faculty a bit. There is also the fact that Usyd recently got a new engineering dean, and UNSW's dean just left for Newcastle.

Engineering at Usyd also has the Professional Engagement Program (PEP) which I've seen mixed reviews about, but does not seem to have an equivalent in UNSW, is that really a problem?

There are also the issues that I've heard about Usyd, such as the bad course management in Usyd, the lack of proper programming teaching, and that coding tests are done on paper.

I would love to get your guys' opinion on this, as many say that the engineering experience is considerably better at UNSW, from the teaching down to the assessments. There are also many that say that the societies and student atmosphere for engineering is better. On the other hand, Usyd is so much closer, has a nicer semester schedule, and is the more reputable uni overall and internationally.

With these different pros and cons, is UNSW still the obvious choice for software engineering, or should I go to Usyd? (Please let me know if I've stated anything incorrectly, as all I know has been gained through word of mouth or discussions online)

Thanks guys!"

esxv6u,0,2020-01-23,Question about lieing in employment contract and invention disclosure,XXXautoMLnoscopeXXX,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/esxv6u/question_about_lieing_in_employment_contract_and/,"I just got an official offer contract from a company I'd like to intern with, however their contract has a section which worries me. I am not sure about the legality of sharing the actual contract but I found another contract with the same language [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1506293/000119312519092894/d674330dex104.htm) (important section pasted at bottom)

Before I ask my questions I want to emphasize **I don't care about ownership of these ideas**. There is a section about ownership that is extremely non-ambiguous based around the labor laws of CA. My question is specifically in regards to ability to perform the stated actions and what happens if I sign something that says 'I've done something that I believe to be impossible and know I haven't done.'

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a few questions:

1. Lets say I do research in some academic area, assuming that my internship is related to that, (given that at no point do the contracts mention anything about only listing things that are useful) do I have to list literally every idea about that research area I've ever independently had?
2. I assume computer programs are going to fall somewhere in the below word pile of 'inventions' I have written countless computer programs in the course of my life, its not clear to me how to distinguish those relating to projects/research of the company. I wrote a program 10 years ago to convert binary numbers to decimal and vice versa. Something like this is probably important for displaying numbers on whatever computers the company uses. Is this 'related'?
3. If I sign this, knowing that its impossible to list everything, is that perjury? If I list useful inventions and authored works does that change anything? Does good faith enter into things?
4. Is this a normal contract? I have other offers I could accept but it'd be stupid to decline the better one and have to assign a similar agreement for the other. (None of my tech friends have seen anything this extreme, but then I found the same language elsewhere online)

&amp;#x200B;

(a)¬†¬†¬†¬†**Inventions Retained and Licensed**. I have attached hereto, as Exhibit A, a complete list describing with particularity all Inventions (as defined below) that, as of the Effective Date, belong solely to me or belong to me jointly with others, and that relate in any way to any of the Company‚Äôs proposed businesses, products or research and development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that there are no such Inventions at the time of signing this Agreement.

(c)¬†¬†¬†¬†**Inventions**. I understand that ‚ÄúInventions‚Äù means discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, know how, improvements, inventions, trade secrets and/or original works of authorship, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable. I understand this includes, but is not limited to, any new product, machine, article of manufacture, biological material, method, procedure, process, technique, use, equipment, device, apparatus, system, compound, formulation, composition of matter, design or configuration of any kind, or any improvement thereon.

I'm aiming for an internship, but looking at my resume and reading about just how many people show up to the engineering fair makes me feel hopeless. I'm bar-none the last student *anyone* would want to hire. However, there are a few things I think I can use to help me:

1) Research heavily 2 or 3 smaller companies and show strong interest in them, putting on my best game face tomorrow.

2) The reason my resume is so bad is due to addiction/depression my first couple of years here. My last year, however, I've turned my academics around and haven't dropped below a B. I've scored A's in some courses important to my major as well! I can point to my most recent grades when people see my GPA, I hope.

I can seem like a great addition to the company, be well-read, be motivated, but with *that many* STEM's showing up with those qualities *and* an awesome resume...

I've applied to many internships and co-ops at my college I've either gotten a rejection or no response.

Let me tell you all about me. I work for Amazon working as an FC Ambassador, and Warehouse Associate helping ensure that packages get delivered to customers. At where I work, I know many people their who graduated from state University's, and even the flagship University in my state and couldn't get a job in their field. They literally work in the same job position that I do making the same wage and some of them have a huge load of load debt. Some of them have moved up to a higher position in Amazon, and some have quit. The promotions at Amazon from within are only $1 dollar more, which is not much. So, I don't hope that I stay working at Amazon in a promoted role after graduation because of the low pay and also considering that I hate my job. Also know that I did apply for another promotion at Amazon, and had an interview but I got declined.

I'm scared, that I'll end up in a low-paying job after graduation and even if I finish my college degree I'll end up not ever using it. I live with my parents still, and I want to University immediately after high school. My dad says wanted me to join the military after high school, but my mom didn't want me to because she scared for me. A part of me says that I should've joined the military because I could be in a far better situation than I am right now from what I could've learned there. Also know that I'm considered a failure to my parents because both my sister and brother lived by themselves after high school capable of providing for themselves while in college. Both of them graduated, had internships, and have a high paying job. My parents say that I won't get a job after graduating because of my GPA. And that even if I get an internship, it doesn't mean that I'll get a job after graduation.

I don't have any loan debt because I pay off my college tuition mostly from working, and a small part from scholarships that I've gotten from work. All my housing, food and other necessities are still paid off by my parents. I know many people who say that I still act and dress like a child even though I'm over 20 years old.

My college professors don't seem to like me that much because of the average grades that I got in their classes. When I was in middle school I had a 4.0 gpa. In high school I got an honors diploma for taking so many AP classes and ending with a GPA higher than 3.5. I actually find my engineering classes quite difficult, and most of my good grades are from the liberal arts classes that I have to take.

Lastly, I know that a shy person. I don't like talking with people that much. And I've always been that type of person ever since I was a little child. I do have quite a lot of friends at work, including my managers at Amazon who used to be warehouse associates and FC Ambassadors. But I think that's because I work with them. At school, I have little to no friends.

What would you do in my situation? Should I drop out of college? Will I even get a job after I finish college? Should I join the military? Should I join the navy? Should I join a trade school instead of college, and get an apprenticeship? What's my best option?

What should I do, I don't want to end up in a low-paying job that I hate. Most of my coworkers at Amazon think that way. They just think that work is something you have to do to get money. And they are all hoping for the day that they finally retire, and they all hate working at every single job they've ever had. I don't want to end up like them, especially even if I have a bachelors degree. Because their life sounds completely miserable. Know that many of them don't even have children, and I'm guessing its because they barely have money to even support themselves. And practically all of them don't even have any money to do anything fun, they just work 2 or jobs working 60 hours or more then and stay at home (I know because I've talked to some of them about their lives). The only one's that do have the money to have fun are the one's that work there and still live with their parents."

et2bib,3,2020-01-23,"I‚Äôm a new intern at my very first office job, and I‚Äôm struggling to navigate the social politics of it.",the_new_intern,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/et2bib/im_a_new_intern_at_my_very_first_office_job_and/,"TLDR at the bottom.

About 3 weeks ago, I started an internship. I have no background in the field of business that I‚Äôm interning at. I had the opportunity to try it out and learn as much as I could about the industry while I‚Äôm there. I don‚Äôt have much else going on for me job-wise at the moment, so I was excited and happy to have this experience.

For context, I‚Äôm 29F, not studying, and I‚Äôm married (using a throwaway, as my main has photos of me on it and I‚Äôve overheard people in the office talk about Reddit). I tend to be on the introverted side, but can have a kick ass conversation 1-on-1. I‚Äôve also never worked in this kind of environment before. Most of what I‚Äôve done for work was model/act. I‚Äôm actually still modeling on the side a little and trying to get my big break in acting. But like I mentioned, I didn‚Äôt have much happening when the opportunity to take the internship arose, so I figured I‚Äôd test it out and learn some new life skills in the mean time. My employers are incredibly cool and understanding of my situation, and even told me when I started that everyone needs a Plan B job, so it‚Äôs kind of a great situation that I feel incredibly fortunate to have. 

Now on to the social side of it. The office has an open floor plan, so everyone can hear everyone‚Äôs conversations. I had been doing my best to stay in my lane and not interject myself into common conversation too early, and just listen. I would speak to my teammates and some of my coworkers who sat near me on other teams and it seemed like I was well received by them at least. After two weeks of working there I felt a bit more comfortable to chime in when everyone else was chatting around me. Last week there was a happy hour event at the office. Unfortunately, everyone I had already connected with wasn‚Äôt in attendance, so I pushed myself to attend to try to get to know some of my other coworkers better. It was alright. I chatted with a few people from other teams, but I wasn‚Äôt able to integrate myself with the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù people of the office. By popular, what I really mean is loud. This one woman dominates most of the conversations and in general makes a scene to have attention on herself a lot, which I observed in my first few days there. She also seems to be the one to organize office happy hours and whatnot. 

So that brings us to today. We had a few people from one of our other offices in town training with us for the past two weeks, and tonight was their last night here. I heard Loud Woman invite almost everyone to drinks after work to send our coworker off, except whenever she was inviting people around me, she was, for once, using super hushed tones. Loud Woman invited someone on my team, but never directly invited me, and the person on my team never extended the invitation to me either. So 5:30 rolled around and I pathetically tried to stall to see if an invite would come, but it never did so just left. I didn‚Äôt know where they were going for drinks, or else I would have just invited myself. But I was still kind of crushed. I felt like I was in high school again. I also feel shitty cause I didn‚Äôt say goodbye to the coworker who was leaving, but it felt like it‚Äôd be super fucking awkward for me to say goodbye to them in front of everyone else who was invited to go out... 

I know it‚Äôs only been 3 weeks, and I certainly didn‚Äôt feel like I was owed an invitation, but the coworker they‚Äôre sending off tonight started the same time I did. They‚Äôre a guy though, not sure if that is relevant. So my question is, do I just need to be more patient? What more can I do in a work environment to show that I want to be included? And how do you get people to want to get to know you if they exclude you? Also, please be nice. I already feel pathetic for being my age and still feeling this way about this, but this is a whole new ballgame for me. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm a brand new intern at my first office job and I‚Äôm having trouble integrating myself with my coworkers. I also feel like I‚Äôm being blatantly excluded despite feeling as though I made a good first impression with some of my coworkers. How do I navigate that dynamic?"

To start I was diagnosed with herpes 3 months ago after my first sexual encounter at the age of 19. It completely crushed me and I havent been the same happy bubbly person I used to be. I opened up to my parents about it they were extremely supportive but I hate seeing them upset because I am upset. My diagnosis brought on anxiety and depression which caused a huge drop in my attendance at university. Im now falling behind quite a lot. Infact I have 2 assignments due in 6 days and have no idea how to do them because I wasnt present when the content was being taught. Along with this 2 weeks after my diagnosis one of my friends I have known since I was a child passed away due to cancer. This added extra weight on to the depression I was already experiencing. Everything around me has just been crumbling down for the past 3 months. I also found out yesterday that all of the internships I applied for next year have been rejected leaving me clueless as to what I am going to do next year.

I just feel like a complete failure ive never really achieved much in my life. I made it to university but only just and its not even a good university. I was in tears on the phone to my parents earlier today telling them I want to drop out. I really feel hopeless at this point. My love life is ruined, my future career is ruined and so is my mental health. Im finding it really hard to carry on. When I go to sleep I just wish I wouldnt wake up.

How do I get out of this awful place I miss the person I used to be."

In order to do  so, I  would need to take a full load (5 classes or 15 credits)  consisting of  all upper division level courses at a commuter school  which takes over an hour to get to. While I could probably handle the  course load, I  think my GPA would suffer as a result. However, my GPA  is already quite good (3.9), so it may not be that bad of a decrease.

I   am also interning year round for a relatively well known company part  time during the school semester and full time during the summers. This  internship ends when I graduate from college, and if there is a  position available, I would most likely be a good candidate.

The  thing is, I am also interested in seeing what other internships are  out  there and I would like to land another internship elsewhere in the  summer as a way to see what I like while also gaining more experience.  This would mean I can spread out my course load, relax a little more,  and graduate in December of 2020, still a semester early from my  expected graduation date. Furthermore, I feel like I've focused so much on school that I haven't taken the time to network and partake in extracurriculars (though there aren't many that interest me).

So  my question is should I graduate a year early in the Spring of 2020 and look for a full time job, or wait another semester to graduate and  hope  to land another internship during the summer? I have verified that there is not an entry level position open at my company, so I do not have a job lined up if I graduated as soon as I could.

Any insight is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I am really interested in improving my skills in Embedded Software, but I don't really understand how to progress with extracurricular projects. Ultimately, I would like to build something practical, but my ideas seem way too easy or way too hard and I am unsure where to start, especially when thinking about building a drone or a rover with image processing capability.

1. Has anyone got like a challenge sheet for embedded system development or can someone share your story when working in this field?
2. Are there any websites that have a list of products people can build?
3. What project example would be considered expansive (covering a lot of material), but not too difficult?
4. I have read before that STM32 MCUs are quite good for improving in Embedded System Development after playing around with Arduino, but in what way?

A lot of embedded concepts are still new to me (e.g. RTOS programming, which I will be studying in next academic year classes), but I am keen on studying about them in advance.

P.S. I have experience with Assembly programming ARM Cortex-M3 processor, Zynq FPGA with VHDL and Arduino development with C and OOP C++. At the moment, I have Raspberry Pi 3B+, ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC and and Arduino Uno to work with."

Book Club

Track team (spring sport, my first time ever trying out a sport... after the year ends, I'll reflect on how I've felt about it.  Being on track is actually kind of making me want to try out other sports)

Girls Inc, but this is a summer program that will last until the end of senior year

Hopefully UC Berkeley's engineering program for female teenage girls from February-April, but they haven't released decisions yet so who knows?

Future EC's/things I'm interested in and hoping to get started with/opportunities I'm set to have:

Through Girls Inc, I will have an internship opportunity the summer before my junior year of high school.

I want to join a STEM program that runs through the school year - I've been looking for one that is in Alameda, Oakland, or San Francisco.

I want to join our school's Coding Club next year, but as someone who has no previous experience, not too sure about that.

My GPA is currently a 4.0 (and it was first semester as well,) but my classes really aren't that hard yet (PE, a course equivalent to History, Geometry, Chemistry, Spanish 1, and Advanced English.)  Next year's schedule doesn't sound too challenging either - PE, Algebra 2, Biology, Spanish 2, AP World History (the only AP my school offers for sophomores,) and Honors English.  I could have another class if I take zero-period PE, which would start an hour earlier, and if I do this I can take Art (which I honestly don't want to take, but must take as a graduation requirement,) or Computer Science (which I actually do want to take, just to see if I like it.)

I don't know enough about engineering/haven't had enough experience to know whether or not I'd like to go into it, but I'm working on getting some more engineering EC's under my belt to see whether or not I like it.  I'm also interested in medicine (I love reading about diseases, for a long time I said I wanted to be a nurse or doctor and I'm still interested but I've realized that I don't know much about those fields either!)  It may be easier to go into engineering if I'd like to receive a scholarship though, as I suspect that they have many scholarships for black first-gen females who want to be engineers.

How am I doing as of far?"

I know the consensus here is that RRSP are for when you have a high income. However, My income for the year is 41k and I have a large contribution room due to an odd income year (I had once a large foreign income for a year, most in form of residence cost abroad for an internship). 

&amp;#x200B;

I calculated the ROI on RRSP contributions. Basically I looked for the federal refund (including CWB) GST credit, and CCB, and Ontario's OCB and OTB. These add up to a yearly amount with most of their phasing out in the range of net income 17k to 35k.

The crucial part here is that I have 2 kids younger than 12. Hence the crucial importance of CCB and OCB. These phase out quickly between 31k and 65k, and then decrease slowly. Therefore, RRSP is more effective within that range than at higher incomes.

Calculation showed that the return I get for RRSP contribution is as follows: 

|RRSP contribution|Net Income|Benefits\_TOTAL|

:--|:--|:--|

|$ -|$ 40,201|$11,517|

|$ 5,000|$ 35,202|$13,861|

|$10,000|$ 30,202|$16,018|

|$15,000|$ 25,202|$17,360|

|$20,000|$ 20,202|$18,396|

|$21,000|$ 19,202|$18,419|

|$23,200|$ 17,002|$18,419|

|$25,000|$ 15,202|$18,419|

&amp;#x200B;

The sweet spot is 20k for me. getting refund (including CWB) + benifits of 25k for the year. If I contributed nothing, I get 15k. 10k is not bad for locking up 20k! 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; RRSP may be very feasible at incomes of 30-60k depending on your personal circumstances, and if you have accumulated enough room."

I still enjoy it, and it is something that I would still love to have as a career. I've always been above the average student in my program, landing in an internship program that a company runs in collaboration with my school, and have received contract work from a company that a professor of mine had co-founded. I've made the dean's list every single semester, and also work a part-time job while doing all of this.

So what? Everything should be fine, right? That's what I keep telling myself, but I'm in my last two semesters now, and nothing I ever do feels like it is enough. I am applying for internships for my last summer left and right, and despite the interview going perfectly on one of them and receiving the promise of a second interview, I didn't land it. A few others at my school did, and a friend of mine told me that I had gotten unlucky. The field I am aiming for is highly competitive, so I feel like I need to do even more work to have a chance of being successful, and it's unhealthy.

I've always had a problem with comparing myself to other people, and I feel as if it has gotten even worse lately, with everything going on in my life. I won't get into those other issues, since I believe that they also tie into this one. But my main issue seems to be that I am so caught up in whether or not I am going to land a job at all, even though thinking that way seems irrational. I have backup plans and other occupations to fall back on if my main goal falls through, but *no matter how many precautions I can think of, I still worry.* 

Will anyone want to hire me? How am I possibly going to make enough to pay off my loans? Why are other people getting praised for their work, and not me? How can I ever be as good as the few people that are far more skilled than me? Why can't I get an opportunity to prove myself?

These are some of many things that go through my mind every day. I feel horrible about it, and hate to see everyone in my program as enemies - even my friends sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter me, final year CS undergrad who always did well in school academically. Mainly I studied consistently throughout the semester. However, recently I faced too many a job rejection, at mostly big companies, especially at the final round. **Couldn't handle the pressure of studying for interviews while maintaining my studies &amp; grad research project all at the same time and broke down mentally.**

**Always wanted to be a data scientist/researcher, only to realize the math and domain knowledge were too much for me**. Previously I followed ML projects off Medium and had fun, but of course these projects don't work well in the real world.

**Now I am considering going back to be a software engineer.** I previously dabbled with frontend, backend, android and databases (basic CRUD queries). However, these are mostly CRUD projects and **I'm afraid that I'll just end up doing CRUD my whole life**. Someone commented that I was only good with theory and exams, and bad at practical applications, but I have had been working hard throughout my college days, doing DIY projects, joining hackathons, clubs, teaching etc. Have had internship experience but sadly that was mostly in bug-fixing as that was what the whole team was doing, though I did learn a lot on best practices.

**I also feel that I have a poor memory,** usually forgetting the things I learnt over the holiday break. Thus, I realized **I was weak on all my CS fundamentals** \- algorithms, data structures, SQL, system design. Rusty on other languages as I have mainly been using Python the whole of past year for Machine Learning. Working on Leetcode but however, I feel dumber, slow at learning and less creative than I was in freshman year. Also find that I am slower in picking up new frameworks etc than before.

Not sure how to improve myself to be work-ready before I graduate (May), and also what software engineer roles to apply for either.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: College student going to graduate, failed many interviews at big companies and other setbacks cause me to break down. Now my mind can only visualize basic CRUD projects and hate/feel that I am weak at programming sometimes. How do I break out of this rut?**

P.S. People who seem to have it all - free time to work on DIY projects, contribute to open source, have time for family, work out, socialize, freelance, run side businesses etc. How do you do it? I feel like my studies and some extra learning on the side already takes up all my effort, resulting in burnout. Have I reached my limits already? I would also like to contribute back to open-source if I could

P.P.S So many new technologies. ElasticSearch GraphQL etc. etc. How do you guys keep up? I find that I am slow at learning new technologies, though I am a hardworking and consistent worker."

Now hired as a back-end developer for 4 months. I was planning to continue in that way, but I just got an offer for a data engineer position in a company I previously worked for as an intern. I know work conditions are excellent there (the company is Nintendo), and I am very tempted to come back. Also, not exactly a fanboy of the brand but I definitely like the company image and products, so it has an influence on my choice.

However, since I have very few experience in my current field, I'm afraid to make the wrong choice. I have to make my choice very quickly, and I've been torturing my brain all day long for the past week.

I am concerned by the following questions :

\- Is data engineer as ""fun"" as web developer ? Since it involves some kind of development too (Python, APIs, and so on)

\- Will I be able to go back to web development if it turns out being the wrong choice ? I have a very limited experience of 4 months in the field of web development (which is nothing), but I was thinking that some skills could be common to both jobs

\- In terms of pay, which is better ? My colleagues who work as freelancer developers earn a lot, but I don't know about data engineer salaries. From what I have seen it depends a lot on the location.

The question had been posted once, but I have a much more junior profile...

- did not get asked anything technical
- I don't have any IT experience outside of software engineering
- I feel this would be a good place to get some general IT experience (setting up routers/workstations/switches)


Some things to consider:

- both places are about the same distance commute wise

- currently a software engineering intern at another company for about a year. This is the only IT experience I have.

-major in college is general IT (1 year left of school)

- ultimately, I want to go to the place I get the most out of. My main concerns are professional growth, pay, job stability.

Tldr: my manager got me out of a company I really wanted to have a career in just because I discovered problems in his work. He decided to let me go as I was on mandatory probation and I just can't let it go, even after securing a new job. 


I always wanted to get into a great MNC (you might be able to guess which one along the way) when I was in school and managed to secure an internship in 2018. Did really well, 2nd out of 12 interns and got converted. Started full time in 2019.

On my second week of work, I did an audit and uncovered that the freight forwarder (people helping us prepare export and custom clearing documents in a foreign country) have been sending out a very sensitive and compromising piece of information to our customers without the knowledge of my boss (who was overseeing them before me) for 2 years. Upon future investigation, I confirmed it was down to his negligence but he instructed me to cover up for him in my minutes to the higher ups and other functional heads that were also interested in this incident. I just reported the incident as it is and he was very unhappy.

During my internship, I was under another manager and while I was trying to understand my current manager's planning documents for my own project, I discovered that he has got serious errors his formulas. I didn't tell anyone but him when we were alone (during the internship).

This motherfucker is a very insecure person, he would tell me ""remember that time when you did not listen to me (on the covering up incident), you should have done it"" from time to time. I always do my best in my work and also try my best to get along with people. I am not a confrontational person by nature, just want to do the right thing. 

At the end of 6 months, even though I had completed 99% of my on boarding, he pushed to release me and I was let go.

Maybe I should have been more tactful - I have always been a very frank and transparent person. Its my first job, I haven't figured workplace politics out yet. It has been 3 months since and I can't get this out of my head.

I want to hurt him so bad and it makes me upset how much taken by anger I have became. I was a super carefree and happy person but in the past 3 months I have been searching for a job, I can't believe how much he has screwed me over.

Can anyone talk me through how to get this over with? I am not sure how to talk through these things with people around me because deep down, I know I wouldn't piss on him if he's on fire.

Thank you for reading all these."

Anyway I just got confirmation that the place I have interned at for the past two years will have me back again and it seems like they really like me there, I also like it there too. But I don't know how much I like it. I have only ever interned there for an engineering job and I don't know if I want to stay there forever.  I just feel like I am digging myself into a deeper and deeper hole of that I am showing them I want to work for them once I graduate May 2021.

And yeah the answer seems simple, ""Go apply somewhere else, duh."" But the problem is I don't know where I want to apply! The thought of applying somewhere and then getting accepted and not liking it or not being good enough for it is scary. I don't want to be there and get an assignment just to have to go back to the person and say I have no idea how to go about this.  I am comfortable enough where I am now and I know i can do the work there no problem. 

Another thing is the money. I hate to say it but money is a big factor for me, not to say I am only doing this for the money. I love engineering otherwise I would go find something else to do that makes decent money. The place I am at right now I think the starting salary is somewhere between $50k-$60k. But I hear people all the time talking about ""Oh I got offered $80k right out of school."" Like I want that and that's not possible where I am at it seems like. 

So I don't know I just feel like I am settling and burning bridges that I haven't even built yet. I just can envision myself being trapped there forever and I never want to feel stuck. I want to feel like I can move on after 5 or 10 years to a new job that is more exciting and offers more of a challenge. 

Sorry for ranting so long just needed to get that out there.

One is for a Security Analyst Intern role at Facebook where I will be working on risk and compliance for the new cryptocurrency Libra. The other offer is a Product Manager (Security) role for Salesforce where I will be working on building encryption and data security features. 

Which one should I go with, considering future career growth opportunities? Does risk and compliance have better opportunities or does Product Management?

Some more points to consider:

1. Salesforce pays higher - but at this stage I want it to be more about experience and learning than money.
2. Location-wise, Facebook is better since I will be in Menlo Park (the HQ) and at Salesforce I'll be in Bellevue WA.
3. I already have good experience in risk and compliance so Salesforce will be a chance to learn something new while Facebook will help me build on my existing profile.

Please help. Any advice is welcome and appreciated!"

I'm just lost. I was laid off from my job working as a tattoo artist, a job I busted my ass for. Before working as a tattoo artist I was working in the cannabis industry. I also have a bachelors degree in journalism, which basically good for nothing. I graduated college at 24 due to a bunch of complications because my dad died at 19, followed by 3 other family members and our family dog. College was rough for me but i made it through. Tried to pursue journalism after graduation but it's extremely competitive and I never landed a gig. Even the internships I applied for wanted more internship experience (even after I already interned for a wedding photography company and was a staff writer for the school newspaper).

So i traveled.  Moved to the west coast and began working in the cannabis industry. Felt like that was a dead end and in an attempt to avoid going back to school , I put my life long artist experience to use. I became a tattoo artist and realized that this industry is extremely difficult. Sexism, ageism, working commission, dealing with people of low caliber. 

At this point, after being laid off from my last job I'm just so defeated. I have tried so many things now I am becoming hopeless. Im also a certified yoga instructor, which i mainly just do for fun now. I don't teach anymore. I also specified in photojournalism in college. So as you can see, I love art and have a ton of interests, but none of them make me any money or take me anywhere.

I want stability so maybe i can own a home and have a child with my boyfriend. Im trying to keep this short but I'm just lost and sad. I'm contemplating even staying with tattooing because its commission based and very unstable. 

I want to keep drawing and being creative I just don't know how to make it profitable without hustling so hard. I don't have any real office experience but would love to do graphic design or illustration, or maybe teach art. I don't know what to do, reddit. I never even post like this. I'm just late in the game at this point to be starting in an office, have been applying to all diff types of jobs and am just feeling pretty down. Please, people of reddit any suggestions, advice, pick-me-ups, reality checks... anything will help me. Thanks for your time."

etnh3q,70,2020-01-25,I screwed myself for my degree and need advice,alogiHotTake,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/etnh3q/i_screwed_myself_for_my_degree_and_need_advice/,"Hi all, so I'm about to graduate with a bsc in electrical engineering in the next few months. Currently going through my last semester now where I am basically doing my last 3 ECE courses (which aren't really ECE courses). 

I am going to be graduating with most likely a 2.9 gpa overall..3.0 in the best case scenario. In retrospect..I think I screwed myself for my degree. Now, I did enjoy most of my classes and found them very interesting, but I am not very smart as my grades tend to range anywhere from C- to A+ (usually just B- lol). I did try making adjustments to how I study and approached material, but my school performance has remained inconsistent throughout. I think I just am not good with learning multiple different things at the same time.

Anyways enough of that. The courses I really really liked throughout my degree were C/C++ and my FPGA courses. I thought somewhere along the way I would have the time to work on side projects using these technologies to build up my portfolio. Unfortunately I never made the effort, as working and doing school left me with no time or energy to pursue these options. Also the extent of my exposure to these topics were just limited to 2 courses, so its not like I'm even close to proficient in them.

I did manage to land an internship, but it was pretty much a support job as all I really did was update a database using sql and troubleshoot vendor software issues. This job was part of a very niche industry, and I really hated it. I honestly became depressed because it was so boring and yet also stressful as I was expected to solve problems that I didn't have the tools to solve. It also made me realize I really enjoy design oriented work and the difficulty of the degree.

At this point I don't know what to really do. A lot of people have told me, I would succeed in a masters environment, but I don't even know how the hell I'd get accepted into a masters program with my grades. My current plan involves graduating and then spending the next 2 years as a NEET while I try to become a C++ wizard via watching youtube tutorials and reading CS books. But then, I see this going very wrong as employers ask me why I have a 2 year gap on my resume, or pick anyone with a formal CS background over myself.  Not to mention, the whole market seems to be headed towards webdev.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice to share. I honestly don't know what to do. Do you think the plan above could succeed? Everyone is telling me to just go back to school but I feel like thats going to be such a gamble given my past experience.  I look at the LinkedIn profile of many of my peers and they all have skills listed that I see posted on most job listings, while I barely have anything. 

Also I hope this post can serve as a warning to anyone currently in school. If you're interested in a particular ECE topic, don't hesitate to keep pursuing it once the course is finished.


**TL;DR** I really liked my degree but did bad in it. I also didn't make an effort to pursue the topics I was really interested in, and did an internship that was barely ECE.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your sharing your personal experiences and advice. It means a lot to me. I feel a lot more confident after reading your comments and I am taking steps to be more proactive in my developing my desired skill-set. Its never too late. All the best."

I just got out of high school at that time and joined  java class. Then started loving it. I joined IT Computing. I learned most of the things on my own after the class i took. I had also great interest on 3D, so started learning  it with coding. So, i love 3D+coding. After doing free works, i landed a good client, through  which doing everyday 5 hour work, i earn $400 in a country where average salary is $2000 per year(19 and half now, 2nd year in uni). So, basically  i am self employed. I have many big dreams, and i am giving it the time as much as i can. Money is no problem for me right now, as i stay with my parents and take care of my expenses myself.
So, my question is should i also join a company as a intern, so that i can build up my professional career incase things  doesn't  work out at the end or i can just showcase works i will be doing in the coming days. I will be doing games, softwares, animations, films projects.  Still i have lots of things remaining  to learn, i am giving my best everyday.

1) What should be the ideal career trajectory for someone with my background?(i.e someone interested in tech as well as Finance)

2) Will it be easier for me to switch my job profile from tech to managerial/Finance if I decided to, few years down the line? or will I have to take some financial modelling courses and/or get an MBA.

I'm an international student studying (Bachelor) Informatik  at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in the third semester and I have some questions about finding an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

* Because my ""vacations"" (vorlesungsfreie Zeit without exams) are generally quite short, I'm guessing that I'll have to do a Beurlaubung, which is fine. Are most internships six months or a year long? Do you recommend taking a Beurlaubung and doing an internship or trying to finish my studies as fast as possible?
* If I choose take an internship, how will that affect my residency status?
* What are the best websites to find CS internships? I'm not limiting myself to Karlsruhe.
* In which semester do students generally do an internship and how early do I have to start looking for one?
* On what basis are candidates usually judged? Marks? Portfolio? I've looked around on the internet  and my university's job forum for some internships, but the required qualifications seem quite high. I have decent grades (2,3 currently), but I'm not sure if my programming skills are up to the task. I've done Java and C in university. I've also been working on a semester long project using C++ (which I really like), but besides that and some tiny side projects, I don't have much to offer.
* I've thought of looking for an internship abroad. Is such experience valued by German employers or is it better to find something local?
* Lastly, I'd love to hear some of your internship stories (how you found the internship, how the experience was, etc.). I'd also like to hear some stories from foreigners. How is it like working in a German workplace? Did you find it difficult to communicate with coworkers in German? Though I speak C1 German and study in German, I'm still not 100% confident in my language skills. Understanding professors and reading academic literature is usually not a problem, but expressing my thoughts and opinions is a challenge sometimes.

Thank you for answering and I hope that my wall of text isn't too long.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: One other question I have is about Xing and recruiters. I've been contacted by a couple of recruiters, and while some of them are complete trash (aka job offers even though I'm still a student), some actually acknowledge that I'm a student and want to take about my ""wishes and expectations"" and possible opportunities. Is it worth taking the time to talk to these recruiters?"

I'm currently in my 4th semester here at Cal and am an undeclared intended CS major in L&amp;S. As a bit of background, I have already taken 61a and 61b in the first two semesters of my first year, and unfortunately didn't do great in them - I have to get an A- in CS70 if I want to be able to declare. Originally, I was taking CS70 last semester, but I only scored ~0.5 std deviations above the mean on the first midterm and just around the mean on the second one, so I ended up late dropping the class and deciding to retake it in the future as I would have had to do pretty well on the final to get an A-.

After dropping the class, my plan was as follows:

**Spring 2020**

* Take CS61C along with some EE/Data Science classes in order to get lower division requirements out of the way and gain more programming experience.
* Apply to more summer software development internship positions.

**Summer 2020**

* If I get an internship, do the internship.
* If not, take CS70, since you get a separate drop for summer courses so I have another fallback in case I fuck up with 70 again.

**Fall 2020**

* If I had an internship in the Summer, take CS70 and declare at the end of my first semester of my 3rd year.

I have contacted my academic adviser about this as well, but pending a response, my question is this: is this schedule allowed and/or viable? I picked my current semester schedule with this plan in mind, but I am now questioning it as I was recently informed about the fact that there is also a registration hold placed on people who have accrued too many units but still haven't declared, which could be an issue if I end up taking 70 in the fall. Moreover, I am also concerned since declaring in the fall of my Junior year would only leave me 3 semesters to explore upper division CS classes here at Cal. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!"
etv9eb,113,2020-01-25,Advice From a College Junior,Choice_Volume,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/etv9eb/advice_from_a_college_junior/,"Hey Everyone,

College junior at a T20 here. As college decisions are coming out later this year, I just wanted give back to the community and share what I think is the most important thing you all could be working on RIGHT NOW. This was the hardest obstacle that I had to overcome, but once I did I not only became a better student, but a better person overall.

**Respect yourself, and be happy with where you are.**

I know this sounds cliche. You've heard it a thousand times, but I can almost guarantee that most of you haven't made an effort to practice this because it's **extremely difficult**. I would probably say it is the most difficult assignment that I've had to work on during my time here in college (and I'm a Math + CS major!). 

**The Problem**

I know some of you (not all) are chasing the reputation. You're high achievers. You've been judged by your academic profile for so long it's not uncommon to believe that the brand name, the prestige, the network of a great school will instantly make you a happier and more content person. I know this because I was the exact same way. The best EC's. The best grades. The best test scores. All of those things seem to put us on a pedestal above others in some twisted way. 

It doesn't stop in college either. You'll find yourself having the urge to be in the ""best"" fraternities/sororities, the best clubs, get the best internships, etc. 

It's easy to lie and say that's not true. In fact, it's what I did all throughout freshman year. Kept chasing more prestigious clubs. More prestigious internships. The solution to my low self-esteem was to make my pedestal higher.

But as college admissions are about to come out, I encourage all of you to evaluate your level of happiness and examine if there's a correlation between your acceptance to a specific college or program. I can guarantee you that this type of ""carrot on a stick"" behavior leads down to a dark path, and even darker one if you get into your ""dream school"" because whatever imposter syndrome or complex you've slowly been inheriting will begin to manifest itself in ways that will seriously harm your mental health. I've seen it myself. I've seen countless people at my school with 36 ACT's and 4.0 valedictorians take semesters or even years off because of stress and anxiety and because they suddenly find themselves for the first time struggling. 

**Not all successful students are happy, but all happy people are successful.**

The ones that are having the best college experiences I've seen are always the one's that have a positive awareness for self-respect and gratefulness. I'm not talking about the best internships, or the best grades, or the best school. You could be working for your dream company and still be miserable, in fact I've seen that happen many times as well. The happiest individuals in college are the ones that don't compare themselves to others, but instead try to really live in a way that makes them content with what they have. Hang out with friends. Play the guitar. Watch a movie. Go hiking. Find something that you enjoy and allow yourself to live in the moment. 

I can't really explain what clicked for me, or why I decided to write this. But I know that for me being happy is the most liberating feeling in the world. I hope that you all can take this piece of advice to heart and look for ways to improve yourself not just for college, but for the rest of your career.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or anything at all!"

I chose to go to a community college with the plan to transfer over to the large university in my city after 2 years. Long story short, due to my dad becoming sick with cancer I had to begin working overtime to take care of my family. This affected my future plans. It took me 4 years to finish 2 years worth of community college schoolwork. 

During that time I failed a couple of classes due to missing a lot of school because of having to work. In 2015 I had enough credits to transfer so I did. 

Same story though. I was struggling. I failed Static‚Äôs once, I failed materials twice, dynamics twice, structures twice. I was heartbroken. One semester I failed every single class. I cried the day I got my grades.

I considered quitting many, many, many times. I should say that my dad went into remission and by this point he was able to go back to work. My dad encouraged me to continue. Honestly, he‚Äôs the only reason I did.

I kept at it and didn‚Äôt give up. I went from being on probation to a (still mediocre) 2.5 GPA. This last year I decided to quit my job and take the plunge into finishing this damn degree. I passed steel and concrete on the first attempt! When I got those grades back I almost cried again but for different reasons.

During this time I met a girl who ended up becoming my fianc√© (we get married in August!!). I graduated in December of 2019. I got an internship at a very prestigious firm and they plan on keeping me on and giving me a position as soon as one opens up.

I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt quit. I wanted to so many times. This was the hardest thing I ever had to do. With that said, I learned so much, I was humbled many times and I believe I am a better person because of it. 

Don‚Äôt give up. You will get there. I promise. That‚Äôs all. Thank you for reading."

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have three general options to pursue at this point. 

\- Internship - Could provide some valuable experience that will assist my future career. I also feel like this might be a weak option because I already have a lot of work/leadership experience and I have the impression that internships are for ""kids"". 

\- Full-time job - A full time CS job would be ideal. The issue comes down to balancing a family, and a full time school schedule. Would a company be willing to hire someone for summer and allow the flexibility to finish their last year of traditional courses. 

\- Independent Study - Take time to enhance my abilities and really work on all the weak points while maybe taking a couple summer school classes.

etyga4,81,2020-01-25,The Truth of What We Are,WeirdBryceGuy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/etyga4/the_truth_of_what_we_are/,"When I was nine years old, my father said to me, ‚ÄúNever forget what you are.‚Äù I remember the moment so clearly, because it was the first time I‚Äôd ever seen my father so somber. Normally, he was a man of infinite humor, always attempting to lessen the severity of serious situations through jokes or sarcasm, for our sakes‚Äîmy mother and I‚Äîand for his own. Something happened during his childhood, something so terrible and distressing as to be unspeakable; he died having never discussed it with us or anyone else. Because of this unmentionable thing, joy was something supremely important to him, and I loved him so much for it. 

When he offered‚Äîcommanded‚Äîthat advice of remembrance, with a solemnity so uncharacteristic of him, the *scene* of the moment was just as much cemented into my mind as the words themselves. I was in my room, sitting on the floor before my CRT television, playing the remake of the first Resident Evil‚Äîcolloquially dubbed REmake‚Äîand engaged in a battle against the undead. 

My father walked in, quickly acknowledged and dismissed the images onscreen‚Äîhe had a *thing* about death, moreso than the average person, presumably born of his past trauma‚Äîand sat in front of me. By instinct, and out of respect, I paused the game, and without preamble or comedic intonation he said those words to me. He then hugged me and left, and after puzzling over the incident in my head‚Äîin the small capacity a nine-year-old can‚ÄîI continued playing the game.¬† 

I thought, a bit later, he had meant it geographically; we lived in a fairly small town, of an appropriately small population. My father loved the place, as did my mother, although they knew, even at my age, that I would leave it someday‚Äîpermanently, most likely. And I have. 

When I grew up and moved out ‚Äúinto the world‚Äù, my assumption changed, and I thought him to have meant it racially; our town was primarily white, and so I assumed my father intended for me to keep the same circumstances about wherever I settled. I would even admit to feeling a certain ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù around people who bear a skin-tone similar to my own, born entirely of that childhood familiarity. Beyond that, race was not something I had ever dwelled on, and was not certain that it would have been very important to my father either. We were born what we are, where we were.¬† 

But again, as the years went by, I realized that attributing his words to race was incorrect as well. The third‚Äîand final‚Äîrevelation, the truth behind that ominous reminder, was made apparent not long after I met *her*. The horror that came¬†after her¬†introduction into my life is abominable; only worth¬†recollecting, because to talk about her without mentioning it¬†would be a disrespect to her memory. It‚Äôs necessary to emphasize the impact she had on my life in such a short time.¬† 

I was twenty-three when I met her, a bit over a year ago now. I had a job‚Äîthough I don‚Äôt say this dismissively or regretfully‚Äîas a teaching assistant¬†and afterschool tutor. It was a position for which I was paid; although it did start out as a sort of unpaid internship (prolonged volunteering, to expand), but my performance was appreciated enough to become proper employment.¬† 

My particular area of study was for a literature course, specifically targeting 19th¬†century writers and the genre foundations they‚Äôve laid for subsequent creators in the craft. I had a personal preference for traditional science fiction, horror, and fantasy, but also for the *altered* and *reconstructed* variations of those genres, under the umbrella of Weird Fiction. According to the teacher, a Miss Stacey, my enthusiasm and deep interest in genre fiction helped intrigue the class, and offer a counterbalance to her relatively straightforward curriculum. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll teach the classics, you teach the unclassified. I really liked her.¬† 

But she is not the woman I am here to tell you about. That woman would be met six months into the position. It was after-school on a day I can‚Äôt recall as being anything other than just ‚Äúa day‚Äù. I was in the library with a student, introducing him to a few writers of the aforementioned literary period and nature. I gave him‚ÄîAndrew‚Äîa copy of Emperor of Dreams; a collection of Clark Ashton Smith‚Äôs more fantasy-focused short stories. Previously, I had given him The Weird, a compendium of Weird Fiction and Weird Fiction-adjacent stories compiled by Jeff Vandemeer.¬† 

Of the stories, ‚ÄúGenius Loci‚Äù, a Clark Ashton Smith tale, was Andrew‚Äôs favorite, with T.E.D. Klein‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Events at Poroth Farm‚Äù a close second. Delighted, I mentioned that I owned several books of Smith‚Äôs stories, and offered him one. I met *her* during our first discussion of the first few stories he had read.¬† 

*She* was his mother. Her name was‚Äîcan no longer say is‚ÄîMarissa. I had never met her before; my tutelage usually lasted only about twenty minutes per student, as most of them had other educational needs that I could not provide. I was almost always the first the students met with, and I suspected this ordering was intentional, to get my particular studies ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù, so that the Maths and Sciences could be given greater time. 

I understood it, wasn‚Äôt insulted or made indignant by it.¬† 

Marissa arrived to retrieve her son earlier than usual because he had a doctor‚Äôs appointment‚Äîwhich he had innocently failed to mention, and for which I apologized on his behalf‚Äîand was in a word, ‚Äústressed.‚Äù Not over the appointment, which was just an annual check-up, but because she had waited for her son to exit the school for ten minutes before deciding to come inside and find him. I would soon learn that she hated being late to things, even if her lateness was tolerated without criticism or emotional injury. 

Marissa was undoubtedly the most beautiful woman I had ever met‚Äîand would ever meet‚Äîand I, for the briefest and silliest moment, felt insulted that Andrew hadn‚Äôt told me about her. Like being jovially upset at a friend for not pointing out‚Äîor not pointing out soon enough‚Äîan attractive woman in public; giving you only a short glimpse of flowing hair¬†as she walked out of view.¬† 

Curly red‚Äîa soft, natural red, not some harshly-dyed crimson‚Äîhair fell upon relaxed yet firm shoulders. Freckles, small, light, and scattered, dotted a cutely-round face, in which two brilliantly green eyes were set. She had plump‚Äîthough not comically so‚Äîlips, and a smile that was effortlessly pleasant. It was like looking at a best friend, if that makes sense. Someone with whom you‚Äôre so deeply comfortable; someone so immediately identifiable in a sea of people, who in their own ways are also uniquely different. I felt a¬†*warmth* spill into me from her at that moment.¬† 

As she whisked him away, I felt myself drawn to her in some inexplicable gravity of attraction, and‚Äîin her own way‚Äîshe must‚Äôve felt it as well, because she stopped then, and turned towards me. She apologized for her haste, and in a gesture of oddly-hasty trust, invited me to accompany them, so that I could continue my work with Andrew.¬† 

Professionalism would have me immediately and politely decline, as would my own general sense of ethics, but something‚Äîher beauty, let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîcompelled me to accept the invitation.¬†   
I accompanied them, informed her of Andrew‚Äôs work in class‚Äîphenomenal‚Äîand gave a brief history of the writers in which he showed interest. She appreciated the briefing, and expressed her gratitude for helping her son find his ‚Äúpassion‚Äù. Hers, she told me, was sports; she had wrestled in high school and followed basketball fervently as an adult. 

I had played on a few school-sponsored footballs teams as a child and early teen, both flag and tackle, and once had¬†interest in watching the professional sport, but overall the desire to engage any further was lost as I entered my late teens and became enamored by literature, video games, and other things which would then be referred to as, ‚ÄúNerdy‚Äù.¬† 

Andrew‚Äôs physical health was just as impeccable as his educational performance, so the three of us returned to their home. I spent an hour‚Äîthe longest period ever‚Äîwith Andrew, discussing the stories he‚Äôd read and recommending others based on which he liked the most. His favorite so far was ‚ÄúThe Dark Eidolon‚Äù, so I recommended ‚ÄúThe Colossus of Ylourgne‚Äù for him to read after the rest in the collection, since it was not present therein.¬† 

After the session, I planned on departing; not wanting to further impose on their privacy, and also wanting to get out of there before I did something stupid and unprofessional like ask his mother out on a date.¬† 

Of course, she asked if I wanted to stay for dinner.¬† 

And, of course, I did.¬† 

The rest can be guessed from that alone, and I don‚Äôt want to dwell too much on those early, teasingly romantic interactions. They were pleasant, of course, but also awkward; mostly due to my own behavior and hang-ups. I was only twenty-three, and despite the undeniably powerful feelings I had for her, I didn‚Äôt initially want the *permanence* the circumstances would demand of my attention and life. Andrew, though a cool and likeable kid, was still a child, and not my own. But of course, it was an all-or-nothing situation, and I could not have a relationship with Marissa without Andrew *eventually* being‚Äîand me seeing him as‚Äîmy son.¬† 

His true father was out of the picture. That‚Äôs all that was ever offered, and I accepted it without further information. I had learned with my own father that some things are best left undiscussed, unmentioned, and while not forgotten, forsaken. 

We lived a wonderful life. As wonderful as a year‚Äôs worth of life together can be. Andrew and I got along splendidly‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt expected any real change‚Äîand Marissa and I interacted in a way that made it seem as if we‚Äôd known each other for years. That immediate warmth and familiarity I mentioned earlier. She was funny, incredibly honest regardless of the consequence, and *natural.* She didn‚Äôt pretend to be anything she could not naturally, effortlessly become. She accepted who she was, and I never once detected that she behaved a certain way to garner unmerited attention.  

I felt so¬†comfortable, around her, that at times I found myself laughing at my initial hesitation to join our lives.¬† 

A year after we met, the horror arrived. It tore her from my life. Of Andrew‚Äôs fate, I have no idea. But when *it* happened, I remembered my father‚Äôs words. To this day they still come to me.  

*Remember what you are*.¬† 

I am a human being. No matter what delusions I may suffer, or praises I may receive which would suggest the achievement of some higher existence, I am still a lowly, pathetic, cosmically insubstantial human.¬† 

I was reminded of this the night Marissa was murdered. The night Andrew escaped, or was¬†*taken*; I really don‚Äôt know.¬† 

We were watching Infinity War, in *our* living room (I had moved in with them) on a 70inch TV (a Cyber Monday purchase so affordable as to have been necessary). The size and definition worked together to immerse you so totally into the presentation that, in darkness, the other objects of the room became essentially unseen; visually disregarded and forgotten.¬† 

I‚Äôm not a big fan of the more recent movies, and wouldn‚Äôt have thought Andrew would be either, but he loved them, and Marissa enjoyed them to a lesser degree. The movie was nearing its sequel-requiring conclusion, when the screen went blank; bringing about an instant and absolute darkness. I immediately uttered an ‚ÄúOop‚Äù, thinking that I must‚Äôve accidentally turned off the TV. I had the remote, and thought that during my inattentive shifting I had caused it to fall off my lap. 

But a slight movement of my hand showed this was not the case, as I brushed against the remote resting on my thigh.¬† 

My next thought was that the power went out, but this theory was immediately¬†disproved by the now audible hum of the fan oscillating on Marissa‚Äôs side of the couch‚ÄîAndrew sat between us. The fan was plugged into the same power strip as the TV and console.¬† 

Maybe, the game console had somehow come unplugged or automatically powered-off? Third time‚Äôs the charm, right?¬† 

Wrong, again. The explanation for what *actually* happened, arrived just as Andrew asked, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù¬†

Marissa's sudden scream explained it to me. 

I, sensing that something must of course be wrong for her to let out such a shrill and terrified noise‚Äîshe had never once done so in the time I knew her‚Äîquickly figured out the reality of things as well. That a very unreal thing had occurred.  

Usually, there‚Äôs a white light on the front of the game console to denote that it‚Äôs fully on. And on the controller, a blue light signifying the same. Neither was present, which, alone, would have proved true my third suspicion; that the console had automatically turned off.¬† 

But as my attention was forcibly brought to the darkness, I remembered that while the areas outside the TV were basically unseeable¬†during the TV‚Äôs use, you were still aware‚Äîalbeit dimly‚Äîof distance, proportion, and your spatial placement relative to everything. This perception was completely absent in that newfound darkness, and only one conclusion could arise from that situation: we had somehow been rendered blind.¬† 

So, Marissa‚Äôs scream was warranted, and in a way, I allowed myself to express my own terror through her screaming. Andrew caught on, a few seconds later, and panicked as well; repeating the same question he had already asked, with¬†variance of wording and tone.¬† 

It was hard to remain calm, both due to their reactions‚Äîagain, warranted‚Äîand the circumstances. Going immediately, inexplicably blind was not something anyone would handle well, I‚Äôm sure.¬† 

But we weren‚Äôt given time to contemplate how we all simultaneously became so disabled, because the horror I‚Äôve been so ponderous about getting to attacked us. It began as a sound, a massive¬†*thud* on the roof of the house. After that, different sounds which seemed to spread from the point of impact; like several lines of rope being drawn across a surface. Next, shattering glass‚Äîthe ‚Äúrope-sounding‚Äù things entering the house. After that, the sound of my own voice shouting, almost autonomously, for Marissa and Andrew to ‚ÄúGet down!‚Äù. Through some instinctual‚Äîcertainly not visual‚Äîperception, I decided upon this course of action as being immediately necessary. 

This instinct was right in impelling me to do that.¬† 

As we pressed ourselves flatly against the floor, holding hands and probably looking like those cutout paper-people doing the same, we heard extremely strange things going on just overhead. The rope-like things did some unknowable work throughout the room. We heard things being knocked over or violently entered. The sounds of things be constrained or ripped apart. The tightening of those frantic appendages around objects and each other at various sections, securing whatever controlled them to our house.  

In that moment I was honestly a bit thankful of the blindness. Because I heard‚Äîand this will sound stupid, or silly‚Äîin the action of the rope-things a certain sinister element. Or, if this is more understandable, a *disregard*, not just for our home‚Äôs privacy, but of mankind and the things we expect of the world, and even of the laws of life and physics.¬† 

When the noise settled, and all that could be heard was the *straining* of those unseen appendages‚Äîthe fan had presumably been destroyed‚ÄîI felt around the faces of my family for their mouths; beckoning them to remain silent by placing my ‚Äúpointer‚Äù finger longitudinally over their lips.¬† 

Andrew, a smart kid, nodded; which I felt. Marissa grasped my finger, and from her hand I felt the fear-induced trembling of her body.¬† 

I had no plan, then. I only knew that our silence was, for pretty understandable reasons, paramount.¬† 

*It*, however, had no such cares, and we soon heard it *breathing* up on the roof. I grew up in a small town, and had on many occasions heard the calls, shrieks, yelps, and of course, breathing, of various farm and woodland animals. And that thing up there sounded nothing, absolutely in no way like anything I‚Äôd ever heard. I only recognized it as breathing based on the rhythm of the noise. But even that, the intake and expulsion of breath, was so odd and unlike anything of this world. The inhalations were *tiered,* while the exhalations were singular, great, and wall-shaking. Staggered breaths collected air, the oxygen was purposed, and the unnecessary elements were exhaled in a single reverberant burst.¬† 

It was fucking terrifying.¬† 

Something else was made apparent. Felt, rather than heard, and only by me. Had the others felt it, they would be here now. That feeling elicited the remembrance of my father‚Äôs words, and I finally understood the true meaning behind them. And, I think, the narrative‚Äîor at least nature‚Äîof his own past.¬†The past he had refused to share with his own family. 

*Remember what you are.* 

The feeling was one of an existential *insignificance.* I felt in that moment like an insect, stunned by the sudden and oppressive shadow of an overhanging boot; petrified, in my own youthful insect way, by the heretofore unimagined, un-experienced phenomenon of *outr√©*¬†existences. Just as humans are aware of bears, cougars, and wolves, ants are aware of spiders, beetles, and worms. Both groups are aware of and may even interact with their respective taxonomical neighbors and foreigners.  

But put an ant in the early days of its life on a sunlit ground, then introduce to it the Titans that are humans, and its dim cognition will freeze; seize up upon beholding something so unimaginable, something so *alien* to what it is.¬† 

An ant, and really most insects in general, would dumbly attempt to investigate the human; thinking it not as a potential danger, but as something from which they could derive nutrients without harm. Others may attempt to avoid a foot or finger placed in front of them and continue on their intended way; again, not recognizing the potential doom, and stupidly thinking it to be some moving part of the greater landscape. 

They, in either case, had not remembered what they were‚Äîif they were ever truly aware. 

I realized, instantly, that the presence atop our house was not something I should investigate. It was not something that I, with my¬†human *intelligence*, could ever hope to understand or communicate with. I understood that there was no challenging the thing‚Äôs decision to rest on our house. I knew, the moment I heard its breathing, and felt the enormity of its being, that my best and only course of action was to regard myself as an insect beneath the shadow of its boot. And hope to God‚Äîcertainly not the one that created *it*‚Äîthat the entity had no traces of human cruelty; that it would not let that boot fall upon my body, effortlessly and utterly stamping out my existence.¬† 

I could‚Äôve been declared cataleptic, if a physician was there to diagnose me.¬† 

Marissa and Andrew had not remembered‚Äîif they ever truly knew‚Äîwhat they were.¬† 

Both remained *relatively* quiet, but neither as quiet as I. Marissa whimpered, almost inaudibly, but that was enough. I heard the untethering of ropes, and the swiftly-displaced air as they shot towards her.¬† 

I heard them fasten and tighten around her. At which point she ceased to obey my command, and let out an anguished roar‚Äîfar worse than her frightened scream.¬† 

I then heard the following sounds, which, as I type this, make my fingers tremble and miss the keys.¬† 

The sounds of her being ripped apart. In half. Arms first. I don‚Äôt know. She was audible for a few seconds. Death wasn‚Äôt instant, nor free of pain. 

I felt her blood rain down on me in that darkness. Shower me with *pieces.*¬† 

I heard Andrew shout out a, ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù, which was of course followed by the sounds of other ropes undoing themselves from the house and rushing towards him.¬† 

Fate, if it exists as an ordered, regulated mechanism, worked fortuitously, then. I mentioned earlier that my initial feelings about joining their family were uncertain; my acclimation to the circumstances doubtful. I thought it would be difficult to see Andrew as he deserved‚Äîneeded‚Äîto be seen. As my son. But at that moment, in the darkness beneath that incognizable entity, with its murderous tendrils plunging towards Andrew, I felt in my animal core that he was my son.¬† 

It drove me, regardless of own peril, to shout out, ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù A single word bearing all the authority, motivation, and *love* I could ever offer him. The fortune of the moment, the grisly, morbid chance that worked in my favor, was that Marissa‚Äôs final declaration of agony rose over my command, so that I was not heard by the creature.¬† 

But Andrew heard me, and he felt the gravity behind my words. He may not have known that his mother‚Äôs fate was sealed, but he knew that what I had ordered was something not to be ignored or disobeyed. I heard his soft footsteps flee towards the only window of the room. A window I had heard broken earlier. I did not hear Andrew exit. Which, I thought was good. I believed that he had, in that blind, frightened flight, had enough sense to dive through it, rather than clumsily climb out.  

That‚Äôs what I hoped. The window wasn‚Äôt far away, and I never heard any sounds from the *tentacles*¬†that would indicate they pursued him. And, it didn‚Äôt take a huge amount of spatial awareness to orient oneself in relation to it. A light breeze could be felt coming from that direction.¬† 

All of this I tell myself, day after day, because I have not seen, found, or heard from Andrew since that night.¬† 

The creature seemed to play with the remains it held of Marissa; something about the swishing of air and arced droplets of blood led me to believe that it was swinging the pieces around. Like a child would a doll.¬† 

Eventually, maybe after a few minutes of this, it got bored, or something else caught its attention, because it suddenly let the pieces fall; they landed with a wetness that I won‚Äôt described beyond that.¬† 

Another a few minutes passed, during which *it* continued its horrible breathing, while I assume its extensions did things of an assuredly unconveyable‚Äîand, therefore obscene‚Äînature.¬† 

After this period of post-kill elation, or probing, or whatever, I heard it grunt; or express some alien equivalent of it. Then, to my nigh ecstatic relief‚Äîand to the relief of the house, no doubt‚Äîit lifted off the building. I felt unencumbered by a weight I had not acknowledged when it first burdened me, and I heard the retraction of those infernal ropes back to the main body.¬† 

My vision returned shortly after; just as quickly and completely as it had left.¬† 

I‚Äôll make my account of the house‚Äôs state brief. It was a mess. Things, as I suspected, were knocked over, broken, and bored through. The ceiling, collectively through each visible area, was caved in. Andrew was nowhere to be seen.¬† 

Marissa was *everywhere.* Let your imagine conjure up what it will. But I can assure you that it will never approach the awfulness of the reality.¬† 

I looked for Andrew, of course. Went through all the official channels, and conducted searches of my own. I was of course questioned relentlessly, both for his disappearance and Marissa‚Äôs death, which, in the mind of a detective, were undoubtedly connected. Understandable, considering I was the ‚Äúnew boyfriend‚Äù, which amounted to no greater innocence for them than a stranger. At no point did the police bring up Andrew‚Äôs biological father, which has led me to my own conclusions about his whereabouts. Form your own, if you‚Äôd like.¬† 

There was nothing that could actually implicate me in her death, nor in Andrew‚Äôs disappearance, and the state of the house‚Äîmost importantly the roof‚Äîargued in favor of my explanation; that *something* had fallen on the roof, and a piece or the pressure of this something had so abhorrently killed Marissa. To my ‚Äúluck‚Äù, there was a large hole in the roof; probably from where a mass of tentacles or some other, thicker appendage had come through.¬† 

I didn‚Äôt suggest at any point to the authorities that this *something* was not of this world. Even the absence of this something had not served to incriminate me. 

The months went by, and I still searched for Andrew, even though part of me began to think that he had simply been snatched up once he made it outside. Or had not even been that lucky, and was seized inside the house, silently. Consumed, or taken with the thing for purposes I won‚Äôt dare imagine.¬† 

Now, I only bother to recount the experience so openly because I feel that what happened, what actually happened, should be known. I will still search for Andrew, but that doubt has seeded itself, and will only grow, and if I can‚Äôt find him, I at least owe it to him to tell the truth of what happened. 

To Marissa, as well.¬† 

The creature‚Äôs appearance is still unknown to me, and I still consider that a kindness‚Äîeven setting aside the horrendous acts it performed. I don‚Äôt know how or why it came to our planet, or our dimension, but if it is so mind-numbingly alien as to induce blindness by proximity alone, through solid matter, I would not under any delusions of protection want to behold it.¬† 

I can‚Äôt even say that I hate it, despite what it did. No more than I can hate the sun for being hot. Looking at either is obviously unadvised, and neither can be humanely reasoned with or confronted. And I‚Äôm sure that both, if they should be inclined or naturally driven to do so, could eradicate our species. With lashing tentacles or solar flares. 

I lost the love of my life, and **our** son. That loss will haunt me for as long as I live. Sometimes, in fits of self-hate and survivor‚Äôs guilt, I curse my father for telling me those words of salvation. For allowing to save myself and live on without my family. 

For, implicitly, making me aware of forces and things which are *usually*¬†kept from our ken by some grace of God‚Äîor cosmic chance. 

I love you, Marissa. I love you, Andrew. And I‚Äôm sorry that we couldn‚Äôt spend much time together.¬†"
etygwt,1,2020-01-25,Can I reach succes doing this? Should I do something different?,siilverp,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/etygwt/can_i_reach_succes_doing_this_should_i_do/,"Hello everyone!

It's been a while since I've had a question that is bothering me a lot. It is likely that this post is going to lengthen a little, I really appreciate those who take the time to read it and help me. (Also my native language is not english, sorry about spelling mistakes.) I will clarify my definition of success below.

This is the matter:

I¬¥m 19 years old. I live in Argentina. I finished high school in 2018. In 2019 I started studying a career (informatics engineering) but I left it in the middle of that year, because I didn¬¥t like that career that much. I knew that I wanted to study something related to computers and technology, but it wasn¬¥t that. (let's clarify that college in Argentina is free).

I spent the other half of the year looking for something to spend my time on, since until this 2020 I couldn't start another career, but I didn¬¥t find anything. A few days ago, I found a course on Udemy about full stack development, and I started it. I really liked it, and I realized that programming would be something that I could dedicate myself to. That made me very happy.

But here¬¥s the problem. First, In Argentina there are no careers on programming, only some distance courses that do not teach more than one particular language and last only a few months, or the systems analyst career, but that doesn't interest me too much. Also, I don't like college, I prefer a lot more learning on my own.  
But I don¬¥t know if an Udemy course can give me the succes I want. And what¬¥s success for me?

Well, first I want to leave Argentina. I like this place less and less. Insecurity goes up, the economy goes down. All the time like that. I would like to live in a country of Europe like Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, or in the USA.  
Then, it is not a mandatory requirement, but something I would like very much is working from home (or somewhere like a coffee shop), and that this allows me to travel a few times a year.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don¬¥t know if an Udemy course can give me the succes I want

Returning to this, you think that with this udemy course, could I be taken in some internships, and thus be able to be hired, to be able to move to another place? (sorry, I can't think another way to write this)

What would be your recommendation or life advice?

Thank you very much to those who take the time to read and respond, seriously."

I've been doing this all for quite a while and I've recently read a very inspirational post from someone about from high school to a very amazing job that inspired me to make this post and ask this question. 

Okay so here it is, I truly am incredibly passionate about all of this field, as ive sunk so much time into it, but after so long I'm slowly starting to lose confidence in the things I do with it. I'll be graduating next year and before I leave my high school, I'd absolutely love to learn as much as I can so I can shoot for an internship or even job when I get out. That all being said, I need some help, or advice, how can I start learning more? I'd love to do some projects or make programs but I have no clue what to make, and I'd like to get in hacking contests and things but I'm not confident in my abilities yet, I simply need some advice as to how to go about doing this, because this field is an absolute dream to work in.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to reading/replying to any feedback :)"

I felt like my common app essay was amazing. I talked about my abusive stepfather and this metaphor how writing saved me. (Btw if anyone wants to read it please dm me)

I really really love my ones for UChi, both the Uncommon and the Why essay. 
For the UnCommon one I used a prompt from the 2015-2016 app. cycle and it was about finding order in disorder. I wrote it on music and playing my saxophone. (Also if anyone wants to read that one I‚Äôd really love it)
For my why essay I used a wayfinding metaphor and talked abt UChi kind of like it was a star and how I‚Äôve been searching for so long to find the right way and this star is pointing me in the right direction kind of thing.
Note: I also got them edited by someone who is an English Major at the university near me and he was even impressed with them so I took that as a good sign. 
Other essays:
Bowdoin
I felt like my supp for bowdoin was v good. I talked about putting up thousands of sticky notes for world Suicide prevention day. And also they allow you to upload a picture of yourself so I used a picture of me standing in front of a huge heart made from sticky notes that I mentioned in my writing piece.
Amherst
I chose to respond to the quote, ‚Äúdifficulty need not foreshadow despair or defeat. Rather, achievement can be all the more satisfying because of obstacles surmounted.‚Äù 
I wrote about preparing my music for Area All state this past year, And how it felt too difficult but I put in a lot of practice and broke rhythms down until I got them perfect and how eventually because I put in the work the end result was great.

**Extracurriculars:**

* Bruin Hedge Fund: I joined as one of four freshmen accepted out of 150 applicants. So far I've worked on a stock pitch with my team within the club, gone through a 10 week training session learning about basic technical skills involved with investment banking (DCF, Precedent Transactions, Public Comps, LBOs, financial statement analysis, etc.). We're also planning to host a couple restructuring case competitions, and compete in some other ones hosted on campus. (This is my big extracurricular)
* Part time job at a food court (Lu Valle Commons): I work \~15 hours each week as a ""customer service representative"", and I should be getting promoted to a supervisor soon; basic food service job but I do have some authority and a leadership role at this point
* Undergraduate Business Society: I'm a general member (all you have to do to join is join the list-serve), but I've been involved with some of the programs they've offered, such as a business showcase and a career development showcase, both of which were actually somewhat selective application processes
* Intramural Volleyball: My stress reliever lol, just a fun way to stay involved with volleyball
* Floor Government Council: Basically just attend weekly meetings and vote on issues involving my residence floor/hall, but still a leadership role on my floor
* Volunteer Income Tax Assistance: I just joined this one, but it was also a competitive application process (I don't have the numbers yet), basically you learn how to file federal/state income taxes and help local low-income/elderly file their income taxes
* Dropshipping: Co-created two ecommerce stores with my friend, both weren't very successful but I could still talk about this as a great learning experience, as I handled all of the finances and legal issues (did this over the summer)
* Volleyball (high school): Team captain senior year, varsity for three years, led team to a league championship for the first time in five years, also played club for three years and won some tournaments for that
* Volunteering (high school): Went to a local elementary school and assisted teachers with classroom activities, helped organize a parish fundraiser, assistant coach for girls volleyball team, overall over 500 hours of service
* Investing: I currently invest in stocks, not really that much but I do hold some positions in the market and in crypto and watch daily updates, worth mentioning on the application I suppose

Another potential extracurricular would be a private equity internship, I have a referral from someone in Bruin Hedge Fund and hopefully will get it; this would be in February.

**LORs:** One from the president of Bruin Hedge Fund, one from my history professor who graduated from yale (not sure if this will mean anything but I figured I'd mention it), one from my accounting professor (the class is taught at the Anderson School of Management \[MBA program\], again not sure if this will mean anything but I figured I'd mention it)

I‚Äôve done two internships (one in Helpdesk, another in Infrastructure/Security/Software QA); I‚Äôll be completing a third in either security or business analysis. I‚Äôm sort of lost in terms of what career path I want to go down.

Personally, I like combining both the aspects of business and IT. I‚Äôve thought about becoming a consultant, where I can assist in different companies and their IT projects. I‚Äôm also interested in Information Security, as I‚Äôve been helping out with investigating/auditing my current employer and vendors; I love the criticality factor to it. I also enjoy programming, such as in Java, C++, Swift. My main issue is that I‚Äôve applied for software engineer type roles but feel like I don‚Äôt have the skills yet to complete programming challenges yet. Lastly, I‚Äôve used R to do data analysis for classes, which I found to be quite a lot of fun.

One thing about me is that I‚Äôm a slow learner (more visual guy, most information is conveyed by words to me and it doesn‚Äôt sink in quickly), but once I get into it, I really dedicate my time to learn all I need to.

When I was choosing my major, I originally wanted to be an economics major due to my interest in game theory, decision science, etc. However, I (evidently) chose computer science. I'm doing ok: I have an internship for the summer focussing on web apps and will be graduating June 2021. Although I've recently come to realize I don't want to work purely writing software 40 hours a week. 


What can I do to transition to a role that combines analytics/programming and pays as well as software engineering? I know data science probably sounds exactly like what I'm describing, but I've read a lot about how the field is saturated and master's degrees are cash cows for the issuing universities. Any way I can graduate and get into a master's program that combines math/programming/analytics/economics, or find employment with my BS in a well paying stable role that isn't creating software?

Very few companies come to our campus to offer data science related jobs. So i am afraid that i may not be able to get a chance in them. I have some questions about-

what to prepare during my internship period so that i will increase my chances in on campus or off campus companies. 

how to develop my profile like doing other projects alongside my internship would help? (Like an open source project ).

How to devlop my contacts in order yo get a referral. 

And which forums to follow for my knowledge devlopment in this field. 
Thanks a lot."

I want to work in ML/Data science, and I could be interested in doing research... if I didn't have to do a PhD for that. I have an internship in DS this summer and they could hire me if they like me (ofc they could also not hire me, but I think my chances of getting a job in ML/DS is kinda good because of that internship).

But I'm worrired that not having a master degree will make it harder for me to get good and interesting jobs (I don't want to clean data all days). I'm in Canada, and a lot, if not all, of job offering ask for a Msc. I figure that anyone hiring me might not want to promote me because I don't have a master, while others do?

So, do any of you working in ML/Data science regret not going for a graduate degree?"
eu9wgb,2,2020-01-26,Need advice on which city to choose to do my Diplom thesis,QuitoMeister,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/eu9wgb/need_advice_on_which_city_to_choose_to_do_my/,"Hello everyone! It would be really helpful if you could give me some advice about my situation. 

I'm a 23 y/o mechatronics engineering student (Diplom) from Argentina and recently I've got a scholarship to stay for 1 year in Germany to do my Diplom thesis (1st semester) and an internship (2nd semester). 

I was given a list of some universities I need to choose to go and I've cut the options to four Unis: TU Braunschweig, TU Dresden, TU Munich and Leibniz University Hannover. Between these four, I have to choose one university and 2 substitutes but it's really hard for me right now to decide which city and college to go (they all seem good options). 

Here is what I'm looking for/ interested in: 

* Besides college, I like doing a lot of activities, like sports, going hiking, cycling a lot, learning languages or even volunteering. So I would love to live in a city with a lot of things to do. 
* I'm not a ""night person"" (i.e someone who goes to discos or big parties and gets drunk every weekend) but I do enjoy meeting my friends and going to some bars, listen to bands, eventually some small party or event,  the ""calm nightlife"" I would say.
* My monthly budget is 750 Euros (my health insurance is already paid so out of this budget). I mention this because I know Munich is expensive (although a friend of mine told me she is living there with this budget, staying in a university residence)
* Ideally, my thesis topic would be about Intelligent Systems (Robotics, AI, control systems) but anything mechatronics related would be a good fit.
* I would love to travel to other cities/countries during long weekends or holidays. 
* I would like to live in a WG to meet new people and practice and improve my German skills (around B2 at the moment).

So, do you have any insights or recommendations for me about these cities? 

Thanks for reading, I hope you have a nice day!"
euannl,0,2020-01-26,Chance a boi,thepowderhound123,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/euannl/chance_a_boi/,"**\*Schools\*: UCLA, UCSB, Berkeley, USC, Caltech, Stanford, Harvard, Yale, etc. Top schools in general.**

**\*\*Planned Major\*\*: neuroscience**

**I don't have a T-10 or bust mentality but I want to see if there's a decent chance of at least getting into one of these high end schools if I applied to all of them with my stats. Also, my essays are fantastic and well crafted and specialized for each school - kind of ""packaged"" and altered to show truly why I want to go to each college, not just because of their reputation for being a highly ranked school.**

**\*\*Grades/test scores\*\*:**

**GPA: 3.9/4.0 unweighted - One B in Calculus BC sophomore year. I made up for it with a solid A second semester and a 5 on the AP test. My first semester in 10th grade was a bit rocky with several A minuses and the one B in AP Calc BC but going from there, I had very solid grades with A's and A pluses**

**SAT: 1580**  
**ACT: 35**  
**SAT II Math 2 - 790**  
**SAT II Biology - 800**

**\*\*AP Classes\*\*: I have consistently taken the most rigorous courses available to me (our school is pretty weak when it comes to AP course selection). My AP classes and scores are: AP Biology (5), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Chemistry (5), AP Physics 1 (4), AP US History (5), AP English Lang (5), AP Government (TBD), AP English 4 (TBD), AP Statistics (5), AP Physics 2 (TBD)**

**\*\*Extracurriculars\*\*: I have good ones that mesh well with my career goal of med school and neuroscience. I also have some others that will stand out from other premed kids.**

**- Leading member and captain of our school's high powered rocketry team - we compete in Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC), and placed 16th in the nation at Washington DC last year. We have also been invited to Huntsville Alabama by NASA to participate in the Student Launch Initiative to launch a huge rocket with an experimental payload. It's normally for college students but we are a pretty accomplished team netting about 20k in scholarships from Boeing, Aerovironment, Aerojet Rocketdyne, etc.**

**- Over the summer - I did the Research Mentorship Program (RMP) at UCSB. I did neuroscience research one on one with a postdoc and got a lot from the experience.**

**- The next summer I did RISE at Boston University. It's another month-plus long program in computational neurobiology. Did research and presented it. I also may be accepted to SIMR at stanford which is a cost free research internship for medicine over the summer and you actually get a stipend for working there.**

**- Academic Decathlon Captain winning several medals over the years.**

**- I've worked at Kumon all my years in high school. In addition to Kumon tutoring I tutor on the side at school.**

**- I finished Calculus BC in 10th grade and went on to take classes at community college like multivariable and diffeq's**

**- UCLA Math Circle, a pretty selective program where you attend math seminars and learn about higher math topics with graduate student mentors.**

**- I have been teaching high level math classes at my local Math Circle for a couple years now.**

**- I've shown a lot of personality in my essays, and I love skiing with my family in my free time. I play Tabla, an eastern percussion instrument and as an Afghan American it is a way for me to express my culture and heritage.**

**- I have worked at a free clinic in my area providing free medical care to disadvantaged people and have learned a lot about the struggles people face to obtain quality medical care through my 3 years at the program. I have spent 4 hours every week throughout my 3 years working here and it has made a huge impact on me personally.**

**- Finally, I think I will be able to seal the deal with neuroscience research with a professor from Caltech that I know personally. However it may not work out so just like the SIMR please judge me without this additional experience and with it too.**

**\*\*Recommendations\*\*: I have recommendations from my AP Biology teacher, AP English lang teacher, and superintendent. My Superintendent who is the organizer of our Rocketry team. He and I are very close and his letter is very meaningful as are the other previous teachers who I am also favorites of.**

**I just want a good idea of my admission chances for these top schools. Appreciate it.**"

As an aspiring human resource professional, I am confident that I am prepared to assume the responsibility of serving the clients and colleagues at the [named] Company.

In addition, I have over five years‚Äô worth experience in a fast-paced customer service environment at [company] while one years‚Äô worth of volunteering at [Public school] as an ESOL (English Speaker of Other Languages) assistant translating and teaching both English and Spanish.
If needed I can provide additional information on both my work experience and education descriptions of the courses and projects that I have completed can also be provided, as well as the task I have completed at past employments.

eubpib,1,2020-01-26,Are joining engineering clubs important when you don't have the time?,_xhannn,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/eubpib/are_joining_engineering_clubs_important_when_you/,"I am a third-year full-time student in computer engineering, and I also am fully self-supporting. Because of this, I have a difficult time finding the equal school/work balance so that I can afford to survive, but also my grades don't suffer. However, I would say I have made it pretty well so far. 

I have heard the importance of joining engineering clubs for the sake of networking, gaining more hands-on experience in your major, and overall being a great resume booster. So my junior year, I managed to squeeze in enough free time to take on two clubs to try and make myself a more rounded student. Second semester has now come around and I'm not sure if I'll be able to maintain a regular active status in those two clubs.  


So my question is: I get good grades (above a 3.5 GPA), my job is related to my future career, and I've already landed an awesome internship for Summer 2020. Is continued involvement in clubs critical to being successful in my future career?"
eubrkf,3,2020-01-26,Thinking of getting a Masters in Applied Math and looking for advice...,pink_simplicity,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/eubrkf/thinking_of_getting_a_masters_in_applied_math_and/,"I apologize for any unnecessary details, as I'm trying to process my situation right now.

I graduated in Spring 2018 with a double major in Chemical Engineering and General Chemistry and a minor in Math. I've been working for a year and a half (plus a summer internship) as a Materials RnD Engineer for a semiconductor company.

Last week, a month after I found out we were expecting, I got the news that my position was eliminated for cost saving purposes. They offered me another position as a Yield Engineer, which was a very rare case among all the ones that were laid off. I accepted this, even though it hit me pretty hard.

Right before we found out about our pregnancy, my husband learned he'd be held back a year due to some error in the degree audit, and he can't start working as a teacher until the 2021-2022 school year. This is relevant because given the uncertainty in his career, I need to find ways to better secure mine for the sake of our family's financial being.

I already planned to take my FE this year. Now I'm thinking of applying for an online Master's program in Applied Math. It closely aligns with my new position, so I could get some reimbursement from my company. Plus, a Master's would help me find another job more easily if we were to relocate or if I got laid off again.

I don't know which specific branch of ChemE I want to devote the majority of my career to, but I know I like using math to solve problems. I'm looking for advice on if this is the right path for job security, if Applied Math is the way to go or something else is better, if online program is just as respectable by employers as physically going to school, if there's a school anyone would recommend. Personal stories of anyone who has gone through similar situations are welcomed as well.

Thank you so much!"

I have extremely bad anxiety. I'm medicated for it and it's still pretty bad. I can have a ""good fit"" interview conversation and have that go great, I can do at-home code challenges and impress people, but sooner or later, either over the phone or in person, the interviewer wants me to write an algorithm in front of them while explaining my thinking, and for some reason I cannot do that. It'll be some easy challenge like filter out all the odd numbers in an array of ints and sort what remains in reverse order, and I just forget everything I know. I've written production level software from scratch, which have dozens and dozens of algorithms like that which I wrote. I've read cracking the coding interview and can speak comfortably about time and space complexity etc. But if you were to watch me do a white board challenge for a job you'd think it was your grandpa who doesn't know how to set an alarm on his phone being asked to write an algorithm.

I'm a college dropout, but I have a pretty impressive portfolio, including a paid internship with a pretty well known open source developer and a nonprofit I started myself and coded from scratch. When I send out my resume companies seem very interested, but the moment I whiteboard their response immediately changes. They're like ""ok we'll be in touch"" in a way that obviously says ""how did you get this far in the interview"". If I tell companies about this is there any chance they'd make accommodations? Is there a method of getting a coding job that reliably doesn't require whiteboard style challenges?

Today I found an ad for a technician position requiring a car, phone to send pictures, and a laptop. They don't require any experience, only a willingness to learn as they have a network of help desks to assist you on your jobs. They are a small business that contracts people out through work orders to resolve the tech problems other small businesses have. My concern is that this place sounds too good by not requiring any background in IT and they do contract work (with a 2 year promise not to compete). Is this typical in the field for a starter position, just driving from place to place resolving small issues? Will it be respectable to have it on my resume prior to or during school?

euetb8,1,2020-01-26,Chance me plz I'll chance back if u want,thepowderhound123,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/euetb8/chance_me_plz_ill_chance_back_if_u_want/,"**\*Schools\*: UCLA, UCSB, Berkeley, USC, Caltech, Stanford, Harvard, Yale, etc. Top schools in general.**

**\*\*Planned Major\*\*: neuroscience**

**I don't have a T-10 or bust mentality but I want to see if there's a decent chance of at least getting into one of these high end schools if I applied to all of them with my stats. Also, my essays are fantastic and well crafted and specialized for each school - kind of ""packaged"" and altered to show truly why I want to go to each college, not just because of their reputation for being a highly ranked school.**

**\*\*Grades/test scores\*\*:**

**GPA: 3.9/4.0 unweighted - One B in Calculus BC sophomore year. I made up for it with a solid A second semester and a 5 on the AP test. My first semester in 10th grade was a bit rocky with several A minuses and the one B in AP Calc BC but going from there, I had very solid grades with A's and A pluses**

**SAT: 1580**  
**ACT: 35**  
**SAT II Math 2 - 790**  
**SAT II Biology - 800**

**\*\*AP Classes\*\*: I have consistently taken the most rigorous courses available to me (our school is pretty weak when it comes to AP course selection). My AP classes and scores are: AP Biology (5), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Chemistry (5), AP Physics 1 (4), AP US History (5), AP English Lang (5), AP Government (TBD), AP English 4 (TBD), AP Statistics (5), AP Physics 2 (TBD)**

**\*\*Extracurriculars\*\*: I have good ones that mesh well with my career goal of med school and neuroscience. I also have some others that will stand out from other premed kids.**

**- Leading member and captain of our school's high powered rocketry team - we compete in Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC), and placed 16th in the nation at Washington DC last year. We have also been invited to Huntsville Alabama by NASA to participate in the Student Launch Initiative to launch a huge rocket with an experimental payload. It's normally for college students but we are a pretty accomplished team netting about 20k in scholarships from Boeing, Aerovironment, Aerojet Rocketdyne, etc.**

**- Over the summer - I did the Research Mentorship Program (RMP) at UCSB. I did neuroscience research one on one with a postdoc and got a lot from the experience.**

**- The next summer I did RISE at Boston University. It's another month-plus long program in computational neurobiology. Did research and presented it. I also may be accepted to SIMR at stanford which is a cost free research internship for medicine over the summer and you actually get a stipend for working there.**

**- Academic Decathlon Captain winning several medals over the years.**

**- I've worked at Kumon all my years in high school. In addition to Kumon tutoring I tutor on the side at school.**

**- I finished Calculus BC in 10th grade and went on to take classes at community college like multivariable and diffeq's**

**- UCLA Math Circle, a pretty selective program where you attend math seminars and learn about higher math topics with graduate student mentors.**

**- I have been teaching high level math classes at my local Math Circle for a couple years now.**

**- I've shown a lot of personality in my essays, and I love skiing with my family in my free time. I play Tabla, an eastern percussion instrument and as an Afghan American it is a way for me to express my culture and heritage.**

**- I have worked at a free clinic in my area providing free medical care to disadvantaged people and have learned a lot about the struggles people face to obtain quality medical care through my 3 years at the program. I have spent 4 hours every week throughout my 3 years working here and it has made a huge impact on me personally.**

**- Finally, I think I will be able to seal the deal with neuroscience research with a professor from Caltech that I know personally. However it may not work out so just like the SIMR please judge me without this additional experience and with it too.**

**\*\*Recommendations\*\*: I have recommendations from my AP Biology teacher, AP English lang teacher, and superintendent. My Superintendent who is the organizer of our Rocketry team. He and I are very close and his letter is very meaningful as are the other previous teachers who I am also favorites of.**

**I just want a good idea of my admission chances for these top schools. Appreciate it.**"

To explain my introduction briefly, I was a transfer student from 150\~200 ranking in US after Fall 2018. Before transferring the previous school, my final cumulative gpa was 3.91/4.0. At the time, my major was Computer Science(B.S.). Why I transferred the previous school is I want to get more opportunities such as various undergraduate research, internship programs and so on. I want to study for a field : Artificial Intelligence(AI) for Autonomous Vehicle such as robotics. During one year, I endeavored to find a research lab or internship related what I want to research. In addition, I visited a career center, met some academic advisors in Math department or emailed some professors conducting the research.

euhc34,1,2020-01-26,How do tell you boss you are starting a new business?,andy_clark,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/euhc34/how_do_tell_you_boss_you_are_starting_a_new/,"Hi everyone. I am new to this community and hoping it is the right one to ask for advise.

I have been employed by the same company for the last eight years.  It doesn't always look good on a resume to be at the same company for so long, but through my time, I have been promoted several time (started as an intern and now I am VP Operations).

Over the last 24 months, I have been putting some after-hours time towards starting my own business.  I have developed a solid business plan, found investors and key business partners to take this thing off the ground.  I should note, my business would not in any way compete with my current employer.

In the past month, a lot has developed, leading my business plan to become a reality. Some key obstacles that were preventing me from taking it off the ground just got removed.  Those that were able to remove those obstacles are asking me to have all my ducks in a row in less than a month and would like to see operations commence as soon as possible.  The time has come to advise my employer that I will soon need to depart.

The dilemma I am faced with is, I hold a high enough seat where many decisions pass through me.  I am managing multiple facets of the corporation, including a restructuring that I am actively handling due to the CEO making some very bad decisions (against my advice) that led to massive losses that put us at the brink of bankruptcy.  I feel if I were to stay until the financial health improved and could say "" I completed my task"" , I would be missing out on the opportunity to start my business.  At the same time, the restructuring is so dependent on me, that leaving would leave them clueless as to have to have this set up.  They could hire a restructuring consultant, but they do not have the cash flow to afford that.

This is the first time I have been in this type of dilemma.  What would you advise is the best way approach to this?  Any advice would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

Thank you, all, for your advice.  I considered all of your comments and decided the right choice was to tell the CEO about starting a business and that I will need to leave sometime in the near future.  

He asked if I can stay on a part-time basis (or any amount of hours I can dedicate) . I agreed as long as it is related to high-level tasks, not the smaller day-to-day stuff unless it becomes relevant.  I've given the company a 1-month notice with the option (at my discretion) to extend depending on how my own business progresses.  It sounds like I am damn valuable around here, to which he agreed to keep me on as long as possible."

Also learning C++ through my coursework.

I'm working on polishing up my resume and my LinkedIn, but I'm not sure if I should attend this Career Fair. I still have 2 years until I graduate, so I don't really have time to be working (or afford working at an unpaid internship). 

Should I still go? If I do, what should I even do since I'm not currently looking for work?"

I have been focusing on my DSAlgo skills this semester  and been applying to major Tech/IB companies for Summer 2020 SWE/Tech  Analyst internships ( but haven't really heard back from them yet). I  have a few queries that I'd like to ask and I'd highly appreciate it if  someone pointed me out it the right direction.

1. What should be the ideal career trajectory for someone with my background?(i.e someone interested in tech as well as Finance)
2. Will  it be easier for me to switch my job profile from tech to  managerial/Finance if I decided to, few years down the line? or will I  have to take some financial modelling courses and/or get an MBA.

euoxqk,4,2020-01-27,Fast(er) Variant Calling. Such a thing? Am I doing something wrong?,ChrisTOEfert,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/euoxqk/faster_variant_calling_such_a_thing_am_i_doing/,"Hi all.  I am turning to you helpful folk again as I you were all so gracious with your answers before.  I will recap a bit, new to the world of bioinformatics, working on a PhD in anthropology, but looking at genomic data of primates.  Specifically baboons.  I am doing an internship at a local hospital where I am learning the ropes on variant calling and processing data into SQLite databases for future data extraction and everything is going fine and I have a script built that does what I need it to.

However, **it is extremely slow.**  I am using Niagara on SciNet (uses Slurm) and I am concerned about how slow this is actually going.  Which is something I never thought was possible as all of the meetings I went to before I signed up for this all tout how much faster it is and what can be done.  I can align to reference using bwa approximately 30 samples in a 24-hour period, in which case Niagara will time out and force-quit.  From there using GATK4 protocol for sorting, marking duplicates, and adding read-groups can be done for all 30 samples in roughly 24 hour chunks per step before it times out again.  My actually variant calling took 24 hours and outputted 1 full VCF and started a second, but I am not confident in that one as it only started that one at like hour 22 and quit at hour 24.  I read a paper comparing variant callers and it looks like for whole genome data at \~120 samples, it would take roughly 81-82 hours of compute time to complete this entire process, which is manageable, as I am currently at 192 hours to get one sample as I have to ""take a break"" due to the workload manager on Niagara making it so I can't hog nodes and CPU.  The ""breaks"" I understand, the sloth-like computing speed I don't.  I feel like the desktop in my lab made a VCF file from a .fasta in 24 hours start to end, so I'm not sure why an HPC cluster takes significantly longer.

What can I do to speed this up?  I have read that GATK4 can be run in parallel, but they strongly advise not to do this as the accuracy plummets.  I have seen they champion HaplotypeCallerSpark for running in parallel, but in the same breath also strongly advise not to use it as the data is unreliable.  It is also possible I am just stupid and am not specifying enough nodes to do this in my script (which I have pasted below).  I reached out to my intern advisor and his advice was to either look at an IBM Power9 to run in parallel...super helpful, a $35,000 unit on a PhD budget, that is basically double what I make in a year, or to look at a different VariantCaller (fine, but then I have to learn Python from scratch).  However, there might not be any guarantees that this will run any faster.

So my questions are two fold:

1) Is it feasible to only run alignments and variant calling on a chromosome or two if I am looking at a specific subset of genes and I know where they are on the baboons?  Or is that poor taste and I really should be running GWAS this day and age?

2) Is there something I can add to my script (below) that can will introduce ACCURATE multi-threading without having to completely relearn a language from scratch?  Many of samples are low-quality I believe due to the small size of the files.  Further, I have to re-run a second variant step as there is no --knownsites .txt I can input since baboons don't currently have this (sigh), so the only method is to variant call multiple times until I get some consistency and convergence.  I unfortunately cannot specify any more runtime than 24 hours as that is the maximum allowable time frame.  

Thank you all for your help, and apologize for the length of this or if I have a very newbie mistake somewhere hindering the performance of this script.

Since I was preparing I didn't appear for college placements. I cleared prelims but could not make it to the interview. The plan was to an year gap but now I have some issues at home.

Academics wise I was the class topper but my grades tanked due to civils prep(8/10 GPA at graduation). Because of this I couldn't do any tech internships or sit for placements. I have some good projects but currently my CV is mostly empty. This BTech college with outdated curriculum also didn't help much(turbo c, struts and other BS)

Bottom line, how much pay can I expect now? I plan to get an AWS certification and build some projects before appearing for interviews (mid Feb). I'm from a tier 3 college where highest pay was 10L from Microsoft. Scared that I'll get peanuts now xD"

I already have a Econ &amp; Psych double major with a bunch of Social/Cognitive Psych courses. The problems I have with this is that not only is it a ton of work when I could be learning more programming and that it will definitely lower my GPA, but employers won't see these courses when recruiting season starts this fall(most seniors at my school get FT offer during senior fall rather than after graduation.) I was able to get a Consumer Analytics internship at a Fortune 50 company without listing the CogSci minor on my resume, but I'm so close to the minor that I just kind of want to say fuck it and do it."

I have received 2 internship offers - one from a FAANG and other from a Unicorn (game-dev) with almost similar compensations. I am an international Masters student from a top 25 CS school and on a 3 year OPT permit. Now I am more of a stable guy, and want to work for the same company for a little while (say 5 years if everything goes to plan) before switching.

The FAANG company is obviously best in class and will offer higher compensation (although not by a lot). However, the role will be pretty limited to standard SDE in a huge team. (If they give me a return offer)

On the other hand the Unicorn offered me a role in the research dept and have very very interesting work - also, something I enjoy a lot in doing (ML).

However, some people have advised me to be wary of Unicorns as they don't sponsor H1Bs very easily and hence I might be in cold water after my OPT ends in 3 years 

(I am from India, hence I am at double risk of H1B rejection). 

What do you guys say, where to go?"

I had everything configured in my IDE, knew what every part of the systems (mostly Java and SQL tables) did and would work pretty fast and solve most if not all problems and feature additions by myself, but I had a horrible pay.

Fastforward to now, I'm in a huge company and there's a few hundred programmers on my floor, everybody working in long desks side-by-side. But I have no (urgent or not) demands, I'm sitting here right now doing jack shit and feeling useless.

 This is my 5th day at the job and I'm absolutely dreading it. I depend on other people a lot for not knowing the codebase and the weird behaviours of some of the legacy systems and can't have silence at all at any time when coding. People talk a lot and go get free coffee and feels like there's just a dozen people who actually do their job; the rest seems just... resting and/or chatting.

No one seems actually to be expecting something from me and that is the most frustrating thing. I used to feel proud of being productive and somehow I lost that in-between jobs. 

I'd like to know how do you deal with this or catch up faster in a new programming job?"

I'm a person from the United States.

So basically, the situation is that I had a Base Model Macbook Pro 13.3 Inch from 2017 that I bought in February of 2019.

The computer was an absolute dream to use and was perfect for my type of usage. However, on December 2nd 2019, the computer's motherboard blew a fuse and quit working.

I sent it to a repair shop where I personally talked with a gentleman that specialized in repairing newer Macbooks and he even took the time to show me a Macbook Pro that was similar to mine that he had repaired.

He stated that it was necessary to do a motherboard replacement as the original motherboard had been fried.

He estimated costs to replace the motherboard to be at $400 which was perfect since that was all I could afford.

I gave it to him expecting him to have it repaired within two or three weeks.

However, a few weeks later, in late December, he told me that the battery had also shorted out and that I had to pay him an extra $60 for the battery.

Keep in mind that I had requested a refund because I realized that it was taking too much time to get the computer repaired.

I gave him the $60 for the battery and we've been in contact since.

It turned out the man ordered the battery from China, which angered me.

I personally went to see him on Friday where he verbally confirmed that the computer would be ready be 1/28/2020.

However, I just texted him and he said that even that date is not guaranteed.

Whenever I try to ask for a refund, he says that a refund is not possible. 

I really need some advice because I need this computer desperately for my college, internship, and personal use.

tldr; laptop motherboard blows up, i send it to guy to get it repaired, instead of taking two or three weeks like it normally should, it's taken two months."
eusmzh,32,2020-01-27,Career Expo is Tomorrow!!!,UCFCareerServices,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/eusmzh/career_expo_is_tomorrow/,"Career Expo is tomorrow from 10am-3pm in the arena! Everyone in my office has been working tirelessly to make this a great expo for everyone. So please come and check it out! Here are some quick notes:

* Professional attire is **highly encouraged**! If you don't own any professional attire, I've been told Knights Pantry may have some donated clothing (I know I donated some at the beginning of the semester!)

We also have a massage chair to help ease the anxiety, some computers to research employers and the companies as well as a mirror to check yourself out. We also will have some photographers ready to do your LinkedIn profile photo if you'd want to get that taken care of there too! 
* Not looking for a job? You can still see if they're offering internships. 
* This event is open to both current students and alumni. We're also opening it up to students from Seminole and Valencia who are a part of DirectConnect.
* We have approximately 236 employers with companies such as AdventHealth, AeroSimulation, Aflac, Aldi, ADP, Carnival, Charles Schwab &amp; Co, Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, Fairwinds Credit Union, Geico, KPMG, L3Harris, Lake County Schools, Siemens, NBC Universal and a whole bunch of others!

If you have any questions, comment here or DM us!

Look forward to seeing you!"

I've recently graduated from community college and I'm in the process of seeing about going to college in the fall to major in graphic design (we're a few months to the end of Winter where I live).

And before I say anything else, I want you to know that I honestly want a job even if I'm not doing something glamorous in the process, I'm just conflicted due to the circumstances.

I'm currently searching for internship positions between now and school so I can get some experience in the fields that I'm interested in, about 10 hours a week for each internship. I'm also thinking about getting a part-time job locally or remotely (working from home on the computer), another 10 hours a week or 20 hours. I also want to set out to do a freelance marketing job in one of the fields that I'm interested in as well and that would probably be 10 to 20 hours depending on the workload that I have in the job.

On top of that, if need be I want to apply for scholarships and visit colleges (some of the colleges are close by and some are far away).

That sounds exhausting but alright, but here comes the dilemma:

I want to visit my grandparents and family for a few days because I haven't seen them in a long time. I need money to visit them but at the same time, if I work a local part-time job, I feel like the boss wouldn't take it well if I put in a two week's notice and ask to take a week off when I've only been working there for a month or two and I could risk being fired or a relationship with the boss (correct me if I'm wrong). That's a reason why I'd like to work a remote job, aside from the fact that there are positions with better pay.

I'm also really interested in doing side businesses (hence the interest in freelancing). Of course, the dilemma is that I'd be just starting out with little to no experience (hopefully the internship would help to get me that experience in the meantime). I could also work wherever I am and be able to work and possibly make even more money in shorter periods of time while I'm visiting family, similar to a remote part-time job but with better possible financial returns. I was told it might take 1 to 2 weeks before I get clients for marketing (but I do have a lead or two. I'm currently uncertain about whether or not they'll have me). I'm also interested in resume writing, dog walking and other independent gigs to make money. I'm hopeful that they would replace working a local traditional part-time job in restaurants or retail. I could possibly pursue these things instead. The conflict in my mind here is that the independent jobs that I'm interested in doing are said to be unstable and at the end of the day it is uncertain about whether or not I would get any clients and bring some money within the time that I'm hoping to. That's the fear that I have.

And if I do go ahead do the independent jobs along with a local job and I happen to be doing well in the next month or two or three and decide to put in a two-week notice to leave said local job, wouldn't that be bad? I know it's a part-time job but I've heard that you should stay at a job for at least 6 months if you're fine with it. But I've also heard that it's common to be at a part-time job for a short while because it's temporary and that the manager wouldn't mind? But I'm also considering the fact that the managers put in so much time and resources work to train their employees, at least that is what I've read. It's why I'm hesitant to do a local part-time job again, I'm not sure about the etiquette, etc. I don't want to ruin my relationship with the boss and I don't think it would look good on my resume if I just worked there for a month or two, etc. And if I wanted to work there again at some point I don't know how the employers would respond or react.

So, this is basically what I've been thinking about. It's been troubling me a lot over the past few days and I thought it may be best to get insight from someone about it.

She also said she would hold on to the money in case nothing is damaged and would return it to me at the end of my stay. She asked me to Venmo it to her. I said I would like some more time and preferred if I paid her the deposit closer to the move in date to which she agreed and said late February or early March is fine.

So, I was wondering whether there is anyway I can guarantee I won't lose the money - could I write up a form that I ask her to sign or something along those line ? Any help would be appreciated."

The details:

* Got an unrelated BS in 2013, and have worked various jobs in the biotech services industry since then. They were mostly non-tech-related, but I have been a ""data analyst"" for the past two years (including some Python/Jupyter and SQL)

* I'm currently enrolled in OSU's online BS program in CS, but I won't graduate for 2+ years

All job postings that I see are geared toward *current* students are, of course, internships, and I can't afford to give up my job for a short-stint gig that I know will be over in a few months. Otherwise they seem to expect that you've already graduated (and maybe already did an internship). I have a feeling my biggest hurdle is going to be just getting through HR. 

So, are there any resources for someone in my situation, or has anyone here been in a similar spot? I've already tried looking for jobs related to my past work experience for the benefit that my domain knowledge might grant me, but there doesn't seem to be that much overlap between what I know and what I'm looking to move into, at least as far as the people hiring are concerned. 

Should I just put a project on github and start applying to new grad positions, hoping that they overlook my graduation date?

euwtua,187,2020-01-27,Who the Hell Would Bury a Mannequin in the Woods?,ThisIsNotEz,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/euwtua/who_the_hell_would_bury_a_mannequin_in_the_woods/,"You know that moment when you're hiking up through your woods because you're mad as hell and you left the house without your jacket and it's the middle of winter in New England and yesterday was like 70 but today it's like 30 and you severely misinterpreted the asshole behavior of the weather and you wanna go back but you don't because then you'll see the gloating in your family's eyes, like--yeah, we knew you couldn't do it, you always come back--and so you're just fuming and fuming and fuming until WHAM! You know that moment when you trip over the buried corpse of a mannequin in the middle of the gray, shadow-eating trees?

Yeah. That was me yesterday.

A mannequin. I guess. I mean, it was, but it was the whole thing, not just some stumpy half-body with a chest and a torso but no legs. It was dirty and covered in pine needle carpeting and leaf decay, but it was head, shoulders, knees, and toes. Like what mannequin has toes? My own toes curled in my shoes just looking at it there. And it looked back. You know what's freakier than a mannequin? A mannequin with a face.

The display window body was unclothed and as I hesitantly peered closer, I could tell that it wasn't just dirty, it was scrawled on. Weird, backwards-looking letters in thick sharpie. Like some crazy witch's intern had been practicing human sacrifice and then dumped the practice body like you might crumple up a piece of paper with bad math and chuck it in the bucket. This mannequin had been chucked in the bucket of my woods. Honestly, I'm surprised the swarms of dirt bikers and quads didn't cartwheel over it already.

It lay there helplessly, graffiti-ed and cold, one arm flung up like it had been turned to stone and knocked backwards. Like it had been real. Those eyes were too real. I blinked and looked away. Really, I should've kept walking, but I was still mad and I wanted to poke something.

I grabbed a stick from the layers of forest mold and detritus, levered it up under the mannequin's back and flipped it over. There was another arm coming out of its back.

A whole other freaking arm.

Like another mannequin deep in the ground had reached up through earth and roots and plunged its fist through the first body to wrench out its non-existent heart. Then got stuck.

""The hell,"" I said. Because I felt that was appropriate. The stick slid from my hands and I hissed as a jutting splinter sliced the inside of my thumb. Someone either had a weird-ass installation art hobby that happened to have a gallery in my backyard, or all the stress in my life was finally pushing its way through my eyeballs in hallucinations. Because dear god was this creepy.

I hastily sucked my thumb and then flipped the first mannequin back over so I didn't have to look at the other one attached to its back. The plastic was cold and clammy. Almost like skin. But mannequins didn't have skin. I mean that would be some illegal human atrocity shit, right? Why would a mannequin have skin?

But why would there be a chain of mannequin bodies buried in my woods anyway?

I seriously thought about going back. I could just make out the shape of my house through the dry-rustle of dead leaves. Stupid leaves, still hanging on, still thought they were alive even though winter had killed them months ago. Clearly, I was still pissed, so after scuffing a clump of leaves and grass over the mannequins, I walked on.

You know that moment when you're hiking through your woods and it's starting to get dark, the shadows are growing and the branches seem to be growing too, and the sky is bleeding down the drain and the light that comes through is sticky and stained and gives you just a little bit of a primordial hiccup in your heartbeat?

Yeah. That moment. I kept walking, walking off the feels, off the mad, and was finally beginning to really feel like all that spiky emotional junk was leaving me. Leaving me pretty cold too. The temperature had gone down even further, and I was shivering in my own bones. After another minute, I flicked a glance back, startled to find how far up the hill I'd come. Trees spilled away behind me, the curve of the incline seeming steeper in the dusk. Seeming darker. Hunched trunks and tangled branches creating a hungry sort of looming arch.

That wasn't the only thing I saw.

Something was there, not too far behind me. A silhouette glimpsed between blinks, an odd sort of creaking reaching my ears. Just the wind in the woods, I thought, just the trees complaining about the cold. But there was no wind. Nothing moved.

If you're ever not sure about anything in your life, if you ever feel uncertainty creeping like a cold-bellied snake up your back, then you know the dark doesn't usually make it better.

I wanted to go back now.¬† Hell yes I did. But there was something out there behind me, and to go home, I had to go past it.

An animal, I told myself. Surely an animal. There are coyotes in these woods, after all. But that silhouette had not been an animal. Not animal-shaped anyway. It had a human shape, maybe a little crooked, maybe a little stilted and leaning, but human. Human-ish.

God did I regret my choices. I was going home. Just walk with purpose. Just don't look.

I swiveled on my heel, listening to leaves crunch in the too-quiet air. My jeaned knees scuffed against each other, my breath plumed white, my hands were tight with shivers in their pockets. Nothing but trees and rocks and fallen logs. An owl hooted and I had to clap my frozen hands to my chest to keep my heart from exploding out.

After that though, it was better. I felt a little ridiculous, which made me both a little more warm and a little more confident. I walked faster down the hill, heels sliding on damp moss and buried stones, slick as unearthed skulls.

Just about halfway down I stumbled, hit the dirt, elbows and knees catching me with bruises, breath warm and startled on the leaves beneath my face. Damn shoelace. I knew it had to be. The one on my right shoe always came undone, slithering out whenever I needed it to behave the most.

Only, my shoe was still tied.

There was just a hand around my ankle.

*Shit*, I tried to scream, but it came out as heavily garbled surprise instead. That wasn't a hand, it was just a root. Gnarled and weird. I felt back along my leg and tried to pry it off. Wood that felt like freezing skin. Knots and whorls that felt like knuckles.

It was *definitely*¬†a hand.

Hissing fear sharply through my teeth, my head and my heart both drumming *ohgodohgodohgod*, I yanked my leg up toward my chest, not caring if I bled, not caring what I tore. I had to get the hell out of here.

But the hand held on.

When I pulled my own hand away, it was smeared with black, runny and with that heady, pungent sharpie smell. God, I hate that smell. And that hand, I knew, I knew with every trembling cell, was the hand of the mannequin buried in the ground. And just as I thought that thought, the hand began to drag.

I slid back along the leaves, uphill, feet scrabbling for purchase, for something to dig into, but everything was moist and soft and caving away.

""Stop, just stop, oh god, stop!"" I think I was shouting, I'm not sure, my ears were ringing too loud and my own voice sounded muffled, packaged and boxed. Like I was already underground. Part of that not-human chain, reaching up who knew how far through layers of years and leaves.

I reached out wildly, hands sliding through leaves and dirt until I grabbed something. It might've been the same stick I'd found earlier, I don't know, I just lifted it and started whaling away at the thing that gripped me tight.

Something cracked. A gunshot in the terrible quiet.

My involuntary movement ceased. For a few seconds, I just sat there and breathed, and then carefully, I detached the hand from my leg. When I lifted it to my eyes, just enough to see with the last of the bloodied, dying sun, the hand was just a root, snaggly and twisted, but just a root. Just wood. It had split seams from weather and water, and lines of some inky black substance leaked out, just a little, carrying with it that faint, but unmistakable acrid sharpie smell.

I lobbed the hand-root away from me and staggered to my feet. it was hard to see in the swift fall of dark, but just a few feet up the hill there were shoulder-y lumps, the form of a body reaching, attached to another body and another and another, making a chain down the hill. I mean maybe. But maybe it was just dark.¬†

And who the hell would bury a mannequin in the woods?

I went home, and I threw out all the sharpies in my house."

I am a recent B.S Mechanical Engineering graduate (December 2019) and i'm currently working at a hospital as a Mechanical Research Intern. I was hired back in mid November while i was still in school (where i was also working as a Research Assistant for a professor). Now that I've graduated I obviously want to be working full time. My current position is only part-time for 15/hr (9:00am-2:00pm every M-W-TR-F where i usually come in early and leave later) and it seems as though my manager does not have any plans for a full time position anytime soon, but plans to keep me on strictly as part-time. When we first interviewed he mentioned how i probably wanted a full time position (correct) and that I should find another part-time position at another company while also working for them as he is uncertain if they'll be able to have me on as a full-time.

While i did express my eagerness for a full-time position, i didn't push it too much as at that point I had little work experience (worked at a cancer hospital hospital a couple months and my research assistant position) and knew that this would be beneficial for my resume and just sucked it up. Now that i'm approaching 3 months, I've been actively looking for full-time positions. I even sent a couple applications out while I've been working (not at work obviously.)

The reason why i'm approaching the Reddit community is to help give me advice on whether or not i'm doing the right thing looking for full-time work while working as an intern. I was going to send in another application to another company today, but decided to hold off and get some advice. I'm also living with my parents, so I think you can understand my eagerness for full time work.

If you guys could help guide me on the right path I would be very grateful."

The job listing didn't list pay or anything, but I was hoping it would be a decent rate and something that graduated into a better, full time role.

I was selected for a phone interview and found out it is a 15/hr part time (20-30hrs/week) job. I asked about advancement and the interviewer responded it is absolutely possible and people have done it before, but it is not guaranteed, there is no timeframe, and it would ultimately depend on the needs of the (very small) company.

Meanwhile they are conducting an extensive interview process, telling me they will select finalists to come in for the next round of interviews, etc.

Is this normal? I would understand if this was some sort of internship with clear advancement opportunity, but it isn't.

Also, would anyone have any advice on pursuing the job if it is offered to me? It is a company I would absolutely love to work for, especially if it were to turn into a full time position. However I would have to make huge sacrifices to live on 15/hour (including other part time work on top of it), and while I could justify that for a specific timeframe, the open ended no guarantee for promotion kills me.

I really do want to ask who their ideal applicant is, whether it be students, recent grads who still live with parents, or what. But I don't know if that would be appropriate. She did ask me during the phone interview if I would be able to keep some shifts at my current job (restaurant server), so they do know my situation and are still considering me.

I am posting this on the behalf of my SO.

I have looked at some previous posts, and I have seen quite a few people mention wanting to work in the bay area that are unable to find jobs. I have also seen some claims that this is because some people are mostly looking at top companies, but finding a position at smaller companies should be easier. I wanted to see if anyone knew what I should expect in my situation or if anyone has any advice.

Background: I am considering going to grad school at UCSC, and my SO would come with me and try to find a job. Here is his general profile, graduating in June:

* Double major Math/CS from an unknown state school, 3.0 GPA (from low math grades)
* 3 years IT intern in desktop support and scripting, 1 summer internship at the same company as software test engineer, TA for algorithms class 
* Most confident in Python, Java, C++, SQL
* Some small school projects, a bigger personal project working on unreal game engine, a fairly big senior project that is almost done
* Misc: Honorable mentions in math competitions, Math Club president, STEM outreach volunteer, a generally likable person/good at answering behavioral interview questions

He would like to get a job as an entry-level software engineer within a 1-hour commuting distance of Santa Cruz. Salary isn't a huge factor, as long as he makes a little more than me we should be fine. Some worries he has about his resume is that he doesn't have an actual software engineering internship and he does not come from a well-known University (however, employers in the bay area will be familiar with the University). 

My question is, how difficult will it be for him to get interviews/jobs? Should he try to do an internship this summer, and get a full-time job after? Any advice? Thank you in advance!"
euy9ot,3,2020-01-27,I am an adult who needs an adult. I only make bad choices. Long-winded but necessary post.,popsiclefondue,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/euy9ot/i_am_an_adult_who_needs_an_adult_i_only_make_bad/,"I understand how I got here, I really do, but that  doesn't fix a problem.  I still have to turn it around because I don't see much hope. I feel like I can't assimilate as a human because I spent all my life in such weird circumstances that people keep me at a distance and I'm falling apart.

I grew up 'white-native' on an Indian reservation in a fly-over state. Rez life is really bad and my white skin didn't protect me from it. I joined a fundamentalist christian sect when I was in middle school to escape rez life and all my friends abandoned me. The sect was full of white farmers who were depression-era old, even if I wanted their advice, they're all dead or have dementia. A combination of reservation culture and old fundamentalist farmers as my imprinting leaves me just a little 'different' from the rest. I left that fundamentalist christian sect a decade ago now, but ever since, I've been falling to pieces mentally. I couldn't build myself a new community out here in the real world and I basically have only one friend left. He left the same sect with me at the same time. He's doing much better now and he roots for me so that's one good thing.

I did 'the things'. I read a lot. I deleted social media, I went to the gym, I joined bands, I made new .... 'friends', I paint. I have tried therapy. I broke down in front of ONE of my therapists and got sent to a psych ward twice in one year. (4 years ago). I have been bounced between about 7 different therapists/psychiatrists trying to get talk therapy to work for me. Its hard to keep a therapist in the poverty class. Interns drop like flies from those jobs. Dozens of meds tried, that didn't seem to work.

Eventually I fell completely apart, cut myself off from the new community I built for myself. These were friends I built from a music community that led me down the road of drugs and alcohol (in an extreme way, not in moderation). There were good musicians who weren't druggy, but they could see my pain and kept me at a distance, so I basically had who was having me as friends. Mostly, also broken and un-supportive trauma kids (like me), who could barely take care of themselves. It was a really embarrassing crash. I left my 'cult' at 33 and all my friends were early to mid 20's. I assume everyone my age was paired off and raising kids. But I just grinned and bore it, I love all ages, but I wish I had generational peers.

I blew my life up 3 years ago and moved one year ago. I had a small business that fed me and two part timers. I turned it over to my brother and got the fuck out of my red-state and moved somewhere progressive. Now I've been  here a year, can't get a job, don't want to start my own business back up and can't get out of bed to take care of myself.

I tried to get a job to convert to full-time after the holiday season but the employers went with others because I wasn't so great socially, not mean, just quiet. My previous job kept me pretty isolated. I'm learning coding on freecodecamp and really good at this kind of thing but getting a job at 43 seems like it's going to be tough given my lack of social skills, and I'd rather work with people before I become one of those guys who ends it all from lack of community.

Financially, after a year of messing up my life even more in the Pacific NW (I could write pages, I really spared you a long read), my debt is huge enough that I can't see past bankruptcy being the only option. I have $10 to my name and a place to sleep. My vehicle is registered to my former corporation that doesn't exist anymore. The IRS wants money. My sister and brother-in-law could stand to have some help with the bills.  r/legaladvice wouldn't touch this.

I literally don't know who to ask about what I should even do next. I'm completely frozen in indecision. I can't start my business back up because I can't afford to insure myself and re-license my business. I clean windows professionally and my kind of clients are really picky about who they let in their houses.

I've been thinking of selling my whole life to keep me ahead of my bills including my work truck and all my tools so I can throw myself headfirst into coding. I know myself and, intellectually, I can do it. I just don't know if i'm making the right decisions anymore.

I'm totally lost. Therapists for poor people suck. The drugs don't work anymore.

Where should I go from here?"

Heck, when they asked expected salary, I said 40k (about the average for entry level helpdesk) even though the Indeed page said average for technical specialist was 52-65k.

Lo and behold, within an hour of said video screening they said they wanted me in for an interview and all that stuff. The way they do it, you take that personality/cognitive test stuff, interview with the hiring/talent manager, HR guy, support team lead, and the technical operations guy, aka support team lead's boss. Had that video screening on Monday and was in for the interviews (~3 hours total) that Friday. Mind you, this is going on as I'm taking my final online class. Post-interview they said they were going to email me a thing to authorize a background and credit check. Wasn't getting my hopes up or anything but if it was a hard no post-interview then surely they wouldn't bother. Sent brief thank-you emails over the weekend to everyone as a thanks for taking the time to interview me kind of thing, not so much to suck up to them.

Come Monday, I get an email back from the hiring/talent manager saying she would be calling me later. Guessed it was a good sign, sure enough her and the HR guy are on a call with an offer. It's December 23, a Monday. Just the Monday before I had that video screening. I was offered 55k; they said they definitely wouldn't offer that 40k I foolishly said. But hey, I'm young and dumb. I had no other offers, and 55k in itself is more than any entry level helpdesk, so of course I accepted.

I began the same week I finished my online course; a few days before. In a way, I am still helpdesk, since I'm part of the support team that helps ~200 businesses using their ERP software as tickets come in. Between my major being IT+business, having prior retail experience, and also unofficial support experience, I guess they felt confident in me. They seemed to really focus on that unofficial support experience in the interview -- I had a popular blog about the Club Penguin game, a now-defunct virtual world for kids. I would get comments all the time from players asking questions and posted guides and tutorials so I was more or less like unofficial support for the game. Since they focused on that in the interviews quite a bit I made sure to focus on that more than my other experience (school computer lab assistant, school bookstore employee, school IT department intern).

So, a few weeks in, I'm enjoying it. I'm learning the software and enjoy helping the customers with their software issues whether it be questions on how to do something, or trying to replicate a bug. I've still got plenty to learn about the software, but as they ask questions and I investigate, I'm learning as well. I always thought I'd be more IT since I enjoyed the hardware, but it was a no brainer to take this higher paying position, plus my career path can always change in the future.

The real kicker is that a few nights before my interview, my fortune cookie said my next interview will result in a job."

My counselor said that I have a good chance of getting into top schools for CS based on my stats and ECs, but so far, I've been rejected by UT Austin and UIUC. I've also been deferred by Princeton and GA Tech, despite the fact that I have legacy on my father's side. I've worked very hard both inside and outside of school to get to where I am today, but I'm worried that I might not get into any of the schools I applied to. A close friend with lower stats and less ECs got into UIUC for CS and I wasn't accepted to any schools during the EA round. I would appreciate any feedback or insight into what I can improve on, or what possibly went wrong. Thanks in advance!

Topics I wrote about included my hobby of designing and flying RC model planes along with my passion for engineering, as well as challenges I faced getting investments for my startup.

LOR 1: 10/10, written for me by the professor I worked under at Princeton. She let me read it before she submitted it; it was very positive and clearly showcased my passion for computer science along with other uplifting attributes.

LOR 2: 8/10, written for me by my AP Physics C teacher. I didn't get the chance to read it, but I think that he writes good recommendation letters (at least that's what I've heard from peers). As his TA during my junior year of high school, I helped him design new tests and even took over a couple of lectures. I think he really likes me, and he always addresses me fondly.

Other LOR: 9/10, written for me by my childhood friend. We've been very close since our elementary school days, and we're both on our high school's varsity soccer team. I've worked with him on various occasions for nonprofits and tutoring, and his letter was absolutely glowing. He's one of the few people who I think really understands me, and the letter definitely shows it.

ev0ml0,3,2020-01-27,Some thoughts on what it takes to find the next opportuniy,cocoon_of_color,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ev0ml0/some_thoughts_on_what_it_takes_to_find_the_next/,"I wanted to just make a quick post on here in case it adds to the playing field of what I see on this sub. I've been on the interview circuit for about 4 months now, and it is finally winding down to a close. I see a lot of posts on here from people only trying to get into FAANG, and I just thought sharing my experience would be helpful, since I did not target FAANG. I was targeting established startups (less than 500 people but with a track record of success and continued growth, and in a major city). While I did interview at 1 FAANG, it was mostly for the experience to be honest.

First off, I just want to say that when I started preparing for interviews, I SUCKED at Leetcode. A lot. I would often read the posts on here about others who struggled just to know I wasn't alone. But I rehearsed problems almost every day, until the patterns to solve them started to stick. While I still struggle with some Mediums, I can come up with good approaches to them now, and can even complete most of them on my own. And I'll admit, I never really got good at it until the very end of my interview circuit. It does start to click, but boy was it stressful all the way until then. It was grueling work and I hated it, but I did it and I think it paid off a lot in terms of my confidence in doing these problems at interviews.

I found these sources incredibly helpful while learning how to Leetcode:

Competitive Programmer's Handbook (you can find a free pdf online)

14 Patterns to Ace Any Coding Interview Question: [https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed)

Blind Curated 75: [https://leetcode.com/list/xoqag3yj/](https://leetcode.com/list/xoqag3yj/)

In case the metrics are interesting: I have about 1.5 years of industry experience (excluding college internships). I applied to around 60 companies. I got rejected from about 25 (most right off the bat :/ ), and ended up interviewing with about 8 companies (as in coding interviews over the phone). I had 2 onsites, and 1 turned into an offer that I'm very happy with. All the other companies I applied to just didn't respond, so I guess that counts as a rejection? lol.

In terms of interviews themselves, it's true that it can come down to luck. Some I really just wasn't ready for in the beginning (needed more Leetcode practice), but others I was just on my game and got the problems I knew I could solve. Some interviewers were rude, and some recruiters made interviewing impossible (not replying, standing me up at interview appointments, constantly rescheduling at the last minute, etc). But many others were great, I guess they have all the power, so don't let it get you down. It's obvious to say perhaps, but my advice is to cast a wide net in your job search - apply to the ones you really want, but also apply to others that you could maybe be interested in. There 100% is more out there than FAANG, and while it may help to have a FAANG on your resume, they are not the holy grail in terms of gaining meaningful experience (maybe just in terms of salary, haha).

Lastly, I just want to say that I'm a young single person, and even I was becoming overwhelmed with the amount time and coordination it took to work 9-5, just to come home and Leetcode at night, take recruiter calls during the day, travel between any interviews out of the area, keep up a social life, and still get all my current job's work done. Especially when you have multiple interviews crammed into a couple of weeks, it is hard. It really is like a second job. So shoutout to anyone who does this and has a family to take care of or some other big obligation.

Now this post is too long. But I just wanted to share my experience. Hope it helped someone out there! If not, well, thanks for reading."

I'm a 29 going on 30 year old trans woman.  I've worked in food service for almost the entirety of my work life, with only a brief stint at a call center for a year and a QA internship in high school over a summer.  I am a community college dropout, and haven't been able to hold down a job for more than around a year and a half (with the exception of my first food service job which was almost 3 years).  I also recently moved out of my father's house to Indiana, currently hoping the good will of my friend who I'm living with won't run out.

My most recent job I don't even have on my resume because I worked there less than a month before quitting on the spot and attempting suicide twice (once while i was still working there, called off because i botched it, the other right after I quit).  I really want to try office work again in a more stable environment but I don't know how to get myself out of this situation I've made for myself.  I can't afford to get therapy, or meds for my transition (so my dysphoria is through the roof pretty much constantly).  It's been over 6 months since my last job listed on my resume, and I know that's a big red flag to people, and using the move as an excuse only covers for so much of it.

Also because I'm trans, I have worked under my deadname (which has been legally changed).  Most applications I put in don't have a section for that, so I imagine that a lot of times when/if they go to verify employment, people will just say that I didn't work there even though I did.  The few times I do have interviews, I feel I do fairly alright.  I don't really have a professional feminine wardrobe (I have to borrow clothes from my roommate), so I'm worried even if I do get hired, I wouldn't be able to adhere to dress code.

I really just need advice on what to do.  I don't feel I'm good at anything at all or have anything to offer anyone at this point, I can't even get a basic retail job."

BNY Mellon:

\- Finance industry

\- 1hr 30 commute, or rent something in London for around 900-1000 per month

\- overall left probably 1000 per month

\-Not sure what tech stack i will be using yet

Cisco:

\- 2000 a month, not in London

\- 20 min commute

\- tech stack is going to be C++/Python

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a crossroads with my career at the moment, and would appreciate some advice. Background, I'm fresh out of college but have quite a lot of Data Science internship experience and that is where I would like my career to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two offers on the table from a company I interned for in the past, both are labeled as Data Science positions

&amp;#x200B;

1. \~95K Base Salary, California. Fledgling team in a newly invested area and would be mostly automation through Excel/VBA/ PowerBI Dashoarding etc. with some Data Science on the top but not prioritized. Ironically this location is where most Data Scientist in the company reside, just not on this particular team.
2. \~65K Base Salary, Pennsylvania. Established Data Science team. Work would be mostly analytics and predictive modeling. There are strong technical leads on this team

&amp;#x200B;

The first:

Pros:

* Visible role == any impact is magnified
* \~30K more(After tax around 18k difference)
* More Data Science happening in this location
* 4x number of employees on this site compared to other

Cons

* Automation isn't where I want to grow, and I fear my resume, skillsets and future opportunities in DS might be hindered because of it.
* Possibly pigeonholing
* Most DS skills and efforts would have to be self-taught and accomplished outside of work.

&amp;#x200B;

Second:

Pros:

* Much more technical team == mentoring opportunities
* Work would directly align with where I want to grow
* Lower cost of living

Cons

* \~30K less(After tax around 18k difference)
* Smaller location == less networking opportunities
* Lower visibility role
* Cold as hell

&amp;#x200B;

I want to grow as a Data Scientist and I believe it would be easier if it was nurtured from a knowledgeable team, but that 30K might be excellent incentive to learn independently.¬†

What do you guys think, and how would you weigh this decision?"
ev6cd4,4,2020-01-28,CS major with thoughts that ruin everything,scaredCSstudent,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ev6cd4/cs_major_with_thoughts_that_ruin_everything/,"EDIT:1 For some reason reddit cut off a lot of the last paragraph and TLDR but heres the gist of it

TLDR: Trying to push through the courses and I cant even begin simple stuff like homework or focus in class because thoughts of failures attack me from all directions, prompting me to be swallowed up from these emotions. 

Hey friends, I'm struggling a bit right now with school and i'm not sure if its because I chose the wrong major (computer science), or whether it would apply to any and all majors I would take at school. If anyone has any opinion on this while they were going through CS, the industry, or even just college, I would love to hear it even if you don't have any advice. Don't hold back. This might be a long post so I apologize, but I have a feeling to finally let my inner thoughts out there and totally understand if nobody got time for that lol. TLDR at the bottom

 

Let me preface this by saying i've had low self confidence/social anxiety since I was a child. Things like being scared to go up to a cashier because i'd be afraid to say the wrong thing, which I would think to outgrow during middle school, don't affect me as much now but still linger in the back of my head. Even now when meeting up with FRIENDS, thoughts like ""I hope I say the right thing/I hope they continue being my friend/ etc"" would just end up with me mumbling to find the right simple words in the moment. This doesn't happen every time I talk to them, but enough to know that it's noticeable. Even with stuff I believe to be ok with (photography), when asked to take pics of friends, I would turn them down because I'd be so afraid to let them down. Now I rarely talk to friends because i'm embarrassed that i'm still in school at this age (26). Sometimes I really hate that i'm this way.

 

Now to the schooling and the reason I made this post. I began school as a possible nursing major and while the classes were hard, I would be able to sit down and study. This would apply to high school and lower too. When things got frustrating, I'd take a break and continue working. But after schooling as a nursing assistant to get my feelings on nursing in general, I ended up not liking it and switching majors at the age of 24. At this point I was so discouraged because all my friends had graduated 2 years prior and here I am still unsure about my path in life. My confidence in myself and my schooling abilities shot way down and wondered if I was even cut out for school, let alone CS. I viewed myself as such a failure.

 

The main reason why I chose CS was because I was always interested in tech. I enjoyed installing programs/setting up computers and new technology was always fascinating. My coding knowledge was zero, but thought to at least give CS a try with the knowledge that the degree would open many doors to careers even without coding. But starting to learn to code was difficult. There was a frustration that I didn't really experience with my other (bio) classes and was so unsure of my abilities. To me it felt like I was pulling things out from midair to make programs work. Think of like freestyle rapping or improv LOL. This is what it felt like to me. I was definitely not good at it but decided to push through because I enjoyed doing it in once class! (think making a weather app/tap to shoot game). But it always felt like I didn't have the logic and problem solving skills to do coding. I was hoping more classes would help me with this problem. I just never viewed coding as a ""love"" when it seems like everyone else in my classes did. This made me question myself as an imposter. It was a scary feeling.

 

Then last semester I took a necessary Data Structure/Algo class and while I did pass, it completely rid of any fondness of coding for me. I know this is the foundation of CS, and with pretty much only CS classes for the next 2 years, it felt like a punch to the face and a rude awakening. This made me question if I was cut out at all for this field, and these thoughts would grow uncontrollably. Over winter break, I decided to practice coding through stuff like leetcode and similar websites and I could barely do the easy examples! I'm in my second year! I couldn't believe it. Algorithms I learned and was tested on a month ago would completely escape me. Then I would look at my old code from the first few classes I took and even then I couldn't be able to recreate it if asked to. Simple things like syntax would escape me, and i'd have to look things up. Thoughts like "" I should know this by now/how can you land internships like this/you're 26 now why are you still in school/you'll be old when and IF you even finish your degree"" would flash constantly in my head."

I feel like I should help out a professor with their current projects. Should I do that or should I apply for internships for the summer? Or should I work more on personal projects because I feel like I would enjoy doing that the most. Any advice will be appreciated, thanks in advance :)"

-I had an IT help desk job many years ago (2011-2012) during windows 7 days. It wasn‚Äôt very in-depth and was actually an internship, but I learned quite a bit.
-Always been an IT guy, but nothing actually relevant to A+ objectives. For example, I knew about how Mac could use parallels to run Windows, but didn‚Äôt know that it was called Virtualization.
-In June I walked into a temp agency looking to get a help desk job and the dude recommended I get A+, a certification I‚Äôd heard about.
-I got Mike Myers‚Äôs book and have been reading it since then. I was to take the exam by thanksgiving but I have been working long hours and reading has slowed down.
-That brings me to another point, in October, a small-medium company took a chance on me and hired me as a help desk guy. The practical knowledge has helped a lot, plus the guy above me is very knowledgeable.
-The company has PluralSight which I have used to take practice tests endless times.
I got David Prowse‚Äôs book Exam Cram Practice Questions and have taken those exams several times. Initially I would get 50s and 60s, now at the 80s range. Now that book was for 901/902. This weekend I ordered the newer 1001-1002 version and am going to hit that too.
-Oh, I stopped preparing for 1002 around December, deciding to narrow down and knock out the first Core then study for the second part.

I have a bachelor's in chemistry with about 4 years of law enforcement experience with a local department. I currently work in insurance investigating claims while attending school online. I have a family that is also dependent upon my income, so, unfortunately, I can't really take an internship.

I was hoping to start getting some IT experience while in school so, once my degree is finished, I can have a better chance of transitioning into a DF/incident response/cybersecurity role. I have been teaching myself python in the meantime with Automate the Boring Stuff and have started getting fairly comfortable with X-Ways Winhex and Wireshark. 

What jobs should I be looking into that are entry level and would possibly give me a shot (I live in the Denver area). If there aren't any jobs that would likely accept me as I am currently, how should I go about improving my chances? Also, should I be looking into getting certifications now or wait until I actually have a position.

Thanks!"

* Canadian

* Undergrad degree in math / business from more than 10 years ago - overall GPA is a 2.75, but my math course GPA is 2.45 (I'm using percentage / 20 - 1 to convert).

* I only took like 3 real comp sci courses (1st year level java programming, management information systems (SQL)) and 4 more business-oriented comp sci courses (e.g., databases for business applications). The GPA for these courses is around 2.75. I did not take any data structures and algorithms courses.

* Master's degree in economics from 8 years ago - GPA 3.05. Not sure if it counts for anything, but the MA was thesis-based and I did a statistical modelling project in Stata for the thesis.

* Experience: ~10 years of experience (including 2 years of internships). ~7 years I can describe as data analysis / analytics with very limited programming work (scripting) in R and SAS. TBH most of my analytical work is just done in Excel and Tableau. The remaining 3 years I can describe as non-technical business admin roles.


**Main question:** what are my options? Here's what I can think of:


* Apply this year, get feedback, and do a bunch of CS courses locally this year on a non-degree basis.

* Do a bunch of local CS courses on a non-degree basis first and then apply to the program next year.

* Would completion of online MOOCs help the application?

* Will building a Github profile or leetcode profile help my application?

evbnjw,1,2020-01-28,"Regretful, doubting my decision, unable to progress mentally. 22 years old, embarking on a software developer career.",treesofthemind,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/evbnjw/regretful_doubting_my_decision_unable_to_progress/,"Hi, so I've made a decision and can't really back out, but I often have panic attacks and massive surges of doubt, and I'm really struggling with this.

TL;DR - regretful, doubting my decision, unable to progress mentally. 22 years old, embarking on a software developer career. My question is - how do i stop regretting the past and questioning my decisions, and move on properly?

So, I joined a very good/prestigious financial company as an apprentice, last year, in the media team. (Not a graduate, joined at 21 years old with a few marketing internships under my belt.) This is a relatively small team in an extremely large/multinational company, and at first I was determined to have a successful career in marketing. Whilst being there, my interest was drawn towards engineering instead. Two reasons for this:

a) there is a massive engineering department here, they have a lot of events which I attended/subtly sneaked into, and I learned a lot about how engineers work, agile practices, coding tips/software design tips, etc., despite not being in the engineering department.

b) the media team I was placed in didn't really give me a lot to do, short of completely ignoring me at times. This was incredibly frustrating as I have marketing experience, I'm relatively intelligent and definitely offered them value in certain areas. May have been due to the fact that I was initially quite shy, and could have been louder/more assertive. Regardless of this, I know that I'd rather pursue engineering/product management as a career, instead of marketing. After hanging out more with engineering, I saw how much more open/accepting/diverse they are, how much more exciting their sector is, and began to gravitate towards them instead.

c) I also attended other engineering events within my city, and have networked with other companies/individuals in the engineering space. This is definitely essential as an industry newbie, and I've also learned from them, and was prompted to pursue engineering as a career, instead of marketing.

d) So... summer 2019 I applied for other apprenticeships - notably degree apprenticeships - in software engineering, and actually got offers - much to my surprise, as a newbie in this area. However, to cut a long story short, I ended up having to reject some of them, due to taking too long to decide/being deterred by the change of location and training providers. For context - my city is one of the biggest tech hubs of the UK, to leave this area as a newbie in tech seems slightly insane. At least, it did to me at the time.

So - I lost all offers and resolved to carry on with my marketing apprenticeship, even though I was not fulfilled, or working properly in my allocated team. You know the drill - you're an apprentice/intern, constantly chasing for work to add to your mandatory portfolio, and no one's giving you any - it's either repetitive, not enough or very inconsistent. To add the pressure on, the apprenticeship company (quite a dreadful one) was pressuring me constantly, whilst changing my skills coach/being flippant with me  - you're definitely treated as one of very many. Maybe this wouldn't have mattered if I felt supported/fulfilled by the marketing team - sadly, this didn't happen. However, the wider company still offered me value in terms of engineering events, networking with engineers etc - however, always with a tangible barrier. 

As an apprentice, I'm not a full time employee - I'm on minimum wage (which is hellish in London, with rent prices/transport so high), I have no real prospect of being kept on as a full time employee in marketing. Unlike other departments, there's no real room for apprentices to ""convert"" as they normally would in something like customer/technical support. 

**Here's the crux:** there was an internal engineering transfer programme available. However, I became aware of it at quite a late stage - bearing in mind that it can take up to 8-10 months or a year to do enough work to be considered eligible for the scheme, plus you have to be an employee for more than 10 months. You have to do an online comp sci course, independently, and then a bunch of tests - of course, with enough time I probably could have achieved it, which is what eats at me. However, in September/October 2019 I was struggling with health problems, anxiety, regret at missing the other opportunities, and general depression. My sister and I were squatting in a rather manky hotel, being unable to find a good place to rent. I fell ill, and went home for a period of time.

In the midst of this I went to an interview for another software engineering apprenticeship, based in my city, with another company - not as prestigious, but relatively well-known. I went to the interview and a few weeks later received an offer. I was happy and inclined to accept at once - the salary was pretty decent for an apprenticeship role, and the training company is known to be quite good. However, I was still struggling with ill health at the time, and explained this to the recruiters. They very kindly agreed to let me in on the February intake. I agreed, and signed a new contract to start in February.

Since then: I've been trying to wrap up here, I've had multiple talks with my manager, and I don't think he resents me. HR, on the other hand, have not been great. Too cut a long story short, this was a bit of a struggle at the end of last year - they were pressuring me to make a decision - are you staying or going, are you going to give notice, if you don't leave at the end of December you won't get your holiday pay, etc. Bearing in mind, I'm an apprentice, not a full time employee - holiday pay isn't a carrot to me, learning and getting value from the people around me is the real value. Though they profess to be all-accepting, championing diversity etc, I resented the way they treated me, and the attitude to the apprenticeship programme as whole - it's very much a mechanical/batch approach. Here's the first batch...along comes the second. I think I am worth more than that.

I'm still finding it hard to leave mentally, although I've officially given my notice, withdrawn from the crappy apprenticeship qualification, and my last day is this Friday. however, I will miss all the communities/groups I'm part of, talks I've had, and I do feel miserable and depressed. but there's no going back."
evbptq,0,2020-01-28,Possible HIPAA violation?,CrippledCryptid26,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/evbptq/possible_hipaa_violation/,"Hey y'all. 


Long post here, I think.  

I had a long saga that ended in my shoulder being fused in July of 2018.  My shoulder was permanently dislocated due to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, and after two failed procedures, we fused my left shoulder.  I live in Oregon and there was only one place that could fuse it. 

I was on Facebook late last night and there was a post in a secondhand finds group that I ended up posting a photo of this left shoulder fusion on, because we were showing crazy xrays and MRIs and the like.  Someone replied and said they had seen my Xray before, was able to name the hospital, doctor, and explained who she had seen.  She has so much knowledge and information theres no way she's making this up.  Especially when she mentioned how this PA (more below) treated her.  She treats all her EDS patients the same. 

We saw a mutual PA who worked on my case.  Apparently this PA showed this other patient my Xray without blocking out my information at first, then went and said ""oh, whoops"", blocked my info, then showed it to her again.  My shoulder Xray is pretty memorable because of how much metal there is and the fact that I also have metal clips in the ball of the humerus, which is not normal in fusions (since I had 2 prior failed procedures).  The other patient saw my identifying information, and was even able to *remember my Xray*.  I work in a hospital and used to be a CNA, so I'm very concerned over this.  In a weird way I feel like I've been just... I dont know.  The fact someone I dont know saw my flipping Xray without my knowledge has me feeling pretty sick to my stomach.  I spent an hour last night trying not to freak the hell out.  

Not to mention, she was berating the other patient, saying ""you dont want to end up like this, if we treat you you'll be ruined for the rest of your life, I dont know why you EDS patients come see us, you're broken and we cant fix genetics, you're wasting your time, etc."" I'm really disgusted by these comments because I think I'm doing pretty damn fucking good post op. I have fair ROM, strength, etc.  My nerve problems arent as bad as they were.  We were forced to fuse, I had no choice.  I wanted to live my life, I wanted to go to college.  I needed this surgery.  Not to mention I had severe crepitus from the joint. When they went in, there was severe Arthritic changes in less than 3 months from the previous surgery.  

I dont know my rights with this being that the hospital is a teaching hospital, but I dont think teaching extends fo patients.  I thought that was just providers and people who are still in school or internship, residency, etc.  I contacted the hospital we both attended, but the other patient reported the PAs behavior (not the HIPAA) but the hospital did absolutely nothing.  This is not my first issue with this teaching hospital/university. They stated they were doing a full investigation and that proper actions will be taken after this. 

Do I have grounds to get legal representation? I'm really concerned and now wondering if this has happened before.  At the very least she accessed my chart without permission, and without proper reasoning to do so (havent been a patient with their ortho department since at least August or sept of 2018), which if I remember is a break of HIPAA, but I may be confused.  I only got a few hours of sleep because this kept me up last night.  

Hope this isnt too rambly.  I'm just trying to find out whats happening/if I'm right to be upset about this/if I should get legal representation or if I'm blowing this out of proportion.  

I can also provide proof of these conversations between this other person and I - I'm not a huge reddit kid, I mostly just lurk and rarely post.  

Thanks all!"
evbvkz,8,2020-01-28,"[Profile Review] First-generation, Low-income, White Male looking at Harvard 2+2",1214ThrowAway2018,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/evbvkz/profile_review_firstgeneration_lowincome_white/,"Hi all! I am a senior graduating this May from HYP, and a friend of mine at HBS strongly recommend I look into Harvard's 2+2 program. From what I've researched, it seems I am one of the individuals whom the program targets (first-generation, low-income, non-traditional background.) I also talked to my adviser at my university's career office and she agreed. However, I'd like an ""unvarnished"" look at my profile and an unbiased assessment. I really don't want to waste my time if I have no shot. 

**Background**

* Work experience: After graduation, I will begin work as a federal consultant for Deloitte in Washington DC. I originally didn't want to go into consulting. But, I really liked the mission of Deloitte Government and Public Services as someone whose primary background is non-profits and government work. Most of my work experience is in internships for the House, the Senate, and a non-profit focused on helping low-income communities through civic engagement and economic development. I've done a couple of unique things at these internships. I founded a civic engagement program at the non-profit I worked at that will impact around 3,500 people. My work experience derives from my life experience. As someone who grew up in foster care, I really want to help federal agencies and non-profits deliver better public outcomes for disadvantaged communities. 

* Extra-curriculars: I was President of one of the largest undergrad organizations (&gt;150 members) on my college campus. I was actually the first sophomore President in several decades to be elected. I led a number of initiatives that strengthened accountability, revitalized member engagement, and successfully spearheaded a significant project that our organization hadn't done in two decades. I had a lot of opposition toward some of the things I did, and I talk about the ways in which I defused that opposition and got people on my side in my essay. I was also co-President of my debating society and passed a number of reforms that strengthened our finances and recruitment outreach. I'm also very active in my university's Christian community, being a religious education teacher for my parish. 

* Undergrad school: HYP, Political Science. 

* Race/nationality: White

* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GRE: (I haven't taken it yet, but I'm consistently getting the following scores on my practice exams) QR - 160 V - 165.

* Undergrad GPA: 3.2. I started my freshman year with a 2.72. I came from a very low-ranked high school in a very low-ranked state as a first-generation, low-income student. I was actually the first in my high school to ever be accepted to an Ivy League institution. I began college taking the toughest interdisciplinary program possible, which led to my low GPA. However, I had a VERY strong upward trajectory, earning nearly all A's and A-'s in the latter half of my college career. I talk about the upward trajectory in my essay. Nonetheless, I'm still pretty worried about it.

**MBA Info**

* MBA Goal: I really want an MBA because I want to work at the intersection of the public and private sectors. I grew up very poor and had a rough childhood. I experienced first-hand the benefits and drawbacks of government agencies, being in and out of state-sponsored group homes and living with families depending on programs like SNAP and TANF. Experiencing that level of poverty indwelt within me a desire to make use of the blessings I've been given and help others. I want to go to Harvard, acquire the MBA and the amazing network that comes with it, and help non-profits and NGOs deliver better public outcomes. I hear that HBS is excellent for people wanting to specialize in non-profit management. And I think the MBA will connect me with people who are different from me and therefore give me a diversity of valuable perspectives. Looking at things from both a private and public perspective will give me the tools needed to operate and adapt in all kinds of conditions. I really want this as someone who wants to make as positive an impact as possible. I'm aware many people go to Harvard to go into consulting and finance (I myself will be a federal consultant), so I'm somewhat of an outlier in that regard.

* Target Schools: Harvard 2+2. I've been recommended this program by a good friend going to HBS, my mentor, and a career adviser. Though I trust them, I'd like an unvarnished view of my chances. I welcome any and all advice with regards to my chances. I would also like to know about other programs I ought to look into as well like Stanford GSB, Booth, and Wharton; though I don't think those schools have programs which cater to college seniors like HBS 2+2, so I may be applying from a point of disadvantage (if I get into those schools I plan to defer for a few years.) Nonetheless, should I also look at those schools as well? 

Thank you so much!"

If it takes you more than a couple of hours to figure out how to do some basic things inside of a database or to build some basic UI interactivity on the front-end, this probably isn't for you.

However, if you can bang-out a database diagram but don't know anything about the UI, that's fine. Or, if you can build a killer UI and work on the front-end but aren't as comfortable with back-end technologies, that's OK too.

Currently our largest project is building a CRM mobile application in React Native/Laravel for a gas distribution company. We also do various dashboards, reports, SQL queries and triggers for them as well. Additional clients include Eccommerce companies for which we do marketing.

One of our primary focuses is on building internal software, and so there is opportunity to work on project that are more fun, like SASS applications or internal tooling.

The right individual could come in not knowing much about programming outside of an academic settings, and can still be successful with a hunger to learn and grow.

Completely remote via Google Hangouts/Slack is OK, but I'm also getting an office space for anybody who may be in Portland.

This is a paid position, but you have to be comfortable working as a 1099 contractor, which basically just means you have to save for your own taxes. Pay is $15-20/hr based on experience and background.  


I'm the founder &amp; lead engineer. However, I've found myself with so much work and trying to do so much that my code quality is suffering, and so I need quality engineering help to tie up some little things so I can improve the overall architecture of projects/systems.

I'm full-stack Javascript/PHP/React/Vue/AWS/DevOps/Design.  I tend to think of myself as a jack of all trades which appeals to clients, but there is a high likelihood that within a lot of subject matter you'll be more proficient than me and I've been working to build an organization where every individual's voice is heard. There is not really a distinction between senior/mid/entry or anything like that. I want passionate people who are looking to build.

**Desired Traits:**  
Javascript (React/Vue is a plus, but we can help you learn.)  
PHP (Laravel)  
\*NIX administration  
Basic Computer Networking Knowledge  


**Extras:**  
\- Design/UI Experience  
\- Sales/Lead Generation Experience  


**Example Project:**  
\- Working Back-End Database Schema's for Laravel App and Generating REST endpoints  
\- Working Front-End To Create Good-Looking UIs in React  
\- Creating/Modifying Wordpress Websites, In Some Cases By Hand And In Others Using Page Builders  
\- Working In Shopify/MailChimp To Improve Eccommerce Store UI/Marketing/Conversions  
\- Playing Around With Kubernetes and Containers For In-House Project of Building A Layer 2 Cloud Provider  


I am \*not\* looking for other agencies to outsource projects to. Looking for someone who wants to come in-house and help us build something great.

Feel free to reach out and let's chat more! If you think this could be you but feel like you don't have all the skills or are too nervous to apply, it never hurts to ask."

Two years ago, I made the decision to move 700 miles from home to go to school in Nashville. I finished up my Music Business degree (which dually serves as a Bachelor of Business Administration) and will be graduating in May. 

I should preface this by saying that family is incredibly important to me and I want to be there for my parents as they get older because I realize that time is incredibly precious. I want to be there to watch my younger sister grow up and spend the little time I have left with my grandparents as they enter their 90‚Äôs. And while I absolutely love Nashville, I still enjoy where I lived back home (about an hour from Philly, DC, and NYC).

But I also have some fantastic career opportunities here in Nashville. I enjoy my internship here that could potentially turn into a job. I‚Äôve made lots of close friends, I‚Äôm thriving academically. I also have two close friends that want to be roommates with me next year. 

I should also say that while I am going to school for Music Business, the side of the industry that I‚Äôve fallen in love with is Marketing, which can be done anywhere. Marketing is obviously not strictly limited to Nashville. 

So the decision I face is: should I stay in Nashville, pursue those career opportunities, continue to build my life here but possibly be unhappy because I miss my family. OR should I move back home (Philly area) and be with my family, semi-start over career wise there, possibly disappoint my friends who want to be roommates with me, but be happier?

Thanks for any advice, and sorry for the rant!"

I recently quit my first out-of-college job and moved up to the bay area (specifically Mountain View), and I am looking for a new position.

I have had on-sites that went very well with several companies including Amazon, Google, and two other mid-size companies (with around 500 engineers each) (not sharing names of smaller companies to maintain anonymity). More than one has gotten back to me saying they would like to move forwards with an offer.

So far I have avoided talking specific numbers (despite each company pushing for me to do so), and none of the companies have volunteered them. Based on how the onsite interviews went and on research I have done online, I think that the offers from the big companies will be larger, but the work at the smaller companies will be more interesting.

I am making this post because I want to:

1. Understand what expectations I should have salary-wise from both the larger and the mid size companies
2. Get some ideas of if / how I should go about leveraging a high offer from Amazon or Google into a comparable offer at one of the companies with more interesting positions.
3. Welcome any advise from people who have been in similar situations.

Thanks in advance for any advice you may have!

I‚Äôm trying to gather some information so that my husband can set off in a new direction. He has graduate degrees in both but doesn‚Äôt code at all currently. We are pretty financially devastated right now due to severe disability in 2 kids... He is teaching high level academic courses, researching optics but hating the politics in academia. He is miserable and we desperately need to double his income in order to get off SSI (and thereby foot the bill for our kids‚Äô medical costs entirely).

What are some tech possibilities for a guy who LOVES to solve problems and is very mathematically inclined? Are there certain career paths that would more naturally fit this skill set? Certain languages to learn? Internships to watch for?  

He has tuition wavers where he works, so more education would be an easy route. Masters? Bachelors? PhD? Does it matter? 

He has zero aesthetic talent, he isn‚Äôt a marketer or a manager, so if certain positions require a lot of schmoozing on the day to day, I‚Äôd love to know what to steer him away from. I'd prize any personal experience you have but general information is welcome, too."

evg9mh,1,2020-01-28,My controlling mother....,CraftySurvivor,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/evg9mh/my_controlling_mother/,"So to start off, I'm very new here but needed a way to vent my thoughts and feelings, as well as get any advice you guys have to offer. Also, very long post as there is sooooo much going on. Sorry ^^'. To start, my mother is a nutritionist, and fitness instructor. 

To start of, I'm still in school, and live with my mom while my two bio parents have shared custody of me. It sucks, but hey, two birthday's. Kinda. Basically my mother has been very controlling (and we'll say evil cause I can't think of another word), since my dad left her because of how she treated him. Which has then lead to how she treats me, and only me. I just didn't notice it till I was 13-14. Things she did were small, barely noticeable, but would leave me without food for a bit if I didn't listen. Mind you even then it only happened to me. So I put up with it because what could I do, I was so young.

Then we moved to the townhouse with my new step-dad at the time, and the attention went to my new baby brother. Fine, I don't mind. She would feed us frozen food and awful meals, and I put up with it. Then when I got my first phone, I found the internet and did some pretty stupid stuff, I'll admit, and she took away every little thing that would make me happy, right down to my coloring pencils and sketch pad. With nothing to do but be in my room, it started my depression... I fell into a deep spiral right away, and within a year I was cutting. I didn't have anyone to turn to at the time, and was scared. So she takes me to a psychiatrist and therapist. Therapist let's me talk, and I felt better at first. Then the psychiatrist gave me all sorts of different meds at high doses because they believed my depression was just a bipolar disorder. Crushed that I was on such severe meds so fast, i put up with it and gained 20 pounds within a month....

Then the body shaming started, because I gained the weight in bad spots. It was horrible. Then I was just continually given different meds, until they found something that made me feel no emotion whatsoever, even when my grandmother died I didn't feel anything but a hole in my chest. Plus as the oldest I had to show I was strong to the others. All this went on for about a year, till I turned 16. Then I would get yelled at over and over again, and be used as a slave for the whole house, not allowed to really do anything. My only reprieve was school. This went on till before my 17th birthday, and I decided I was done. Talked to my bio dad about everything.

But he couldn't do anything because at the time he was going back to school with no job. Then I start my senior year, and that's when this whole problem snowballs. Year starts off fine, I'm at school most of my day and starting my teaching internship. However I needed nice new clothes to look professional. And she yelled at me everyday, saying it's my fault for being fat that I needed new clothes. I fought back that it's worth my grad, so I got two, yes two, shirts and one legging. I put up with it hoping others wouldn't notice if I wore a hoodie, even though it was summer still. When October started, I was doing great, minus at home. She started restricting my diet, saying I'm too fat and need to eat less, but doesn't take me to the gym at all. This goes on till December. At this point I feel tired all the time, and I'm eating so little. She then cuts me off almost completely, minus one cheese stick, a bag of chips, and a fruit snack for my lunch, and that would be all I could get. Now it's January, and I'm so sick physically and mentally that I feel like I'm going to just break down in class soon..... I'm sick and I'm getting dizzy way to often now, and my mental wall has just broken down. I feel so broken all the time, yet I have to hide it all the time. And now that I have a job, that pays me very little, and I have few hours, I'm expected to pay for absolutely everything I need and want. Especially clothes.

And before you ask, no I can't move toy dads house.....  he's in a different district, so if I moved I would lose all my hard work at my internship, and I wouldn't graduate with friends, and I'd go to a highly unsafe school. Plus if I did my mom would hold onto all my items if I left. Even my own stuff I bought with my money would be hers. 

There's so much more, but as is the post is so long. Any advice you guys have I'd love. Thank you"

Worked as an Internal Auditor for 2.5 years and decided i didn't want to do that. Quit my job then 3 months later got a job as a Financial Analyst. Didn't like it there at all, quit after 5 months and was out of work for 5 months. Then I got a job as a Data Analyst (mostly working in Excel) and i've been there about 7 months now, but i am making less money than the Internal Audit job paid my first job out of school. 

I keep jumping around unable to move up because i don't like the work I'm doing. I decided i wanted to get into tech and become a software developer. I am currently taking classes at the local community college for Computer Science. I am trying to get into an online MS program in CS but i just feel like no employer will hire me due to my job history of jumping around. I also feel like I am wasting time going back to school when i could probably find a better job in Finance somewhere. But i doubt i could even land a pure accounting job at this point since i haven't done a journal entry since college. I haven't liked any of my jobs so far and i'm afraid that trend will continue. I feel like i am not cut out for the corporate world. I get very stressed at work so I'm not sure if i need a more straight forward career. I was thinking about becoming a teacher because it seems simple in that i only need to know what i'm teaching. I don't really need to learn new information. What options do i have to get my career back on track? I was thinking about leaving my current job 1 year in to try to make better money, but if i go forward with CS then i think i should probably keep my job until i land an internship, right?

Sorry if this is post is all over the place but this is basically how i've been feeling since i left school 4 years ago. Friends are moving up the ladder and i'm stuck at entry level and unsatisfied."

I am also posting anonymously for obvious reasons.

For the uninitiated, Mphasis is a multinational IT services company.

Anyway, I got my degree in Computer Science back in May, and even though I didn't have an internship (which is super valuable - if you are still in school, do everything you can to get one), and I didn't have a particularly good GPA, I was working diligently to find a job. I wasn't having much luck until...

In late July, I had received my first call from an HR representative at Mphasis - let's call her Jade. Jade told me about this job opportunity and it seemed like the job I would want to take. I would train in Florida, and during training, I would get the chance to choose from a list of clients to work for after training (these clients were scattered across the US). This sounded great to me, as I have been wanting to relocate for quite some time. In addition, the pay was pretty good (especially for someone with no internship). I really wanted this job, and after taking an assessment (and having a video interview)... I actually received an offer to work for Mphasis. After reading the offer letter, I accepted the offer, and I counted down the days until I would begin training (October 7th).

During this time, I had begun working at a supermarket so that I had a source of income. I really enjoyed the job, but I was super excited to go to Florida for training. My last day at that market was September 26th. On the morning of the 27th (10 days before training was scheduled to begin), I got a call from Jade. I was then told that training would be postponed to the 14th of January. I was absolutely devastated, because I knew needed the money for loans. I called the market later that day, asking if I could return in a few weeks. I was swiftly told that I could not.

About a week or two later, Jade called me telling me that she was going to try to get an official confirmation that training would indeed happen on January 14th. My plan was to try to find another tech job by that time, but if I couldn't do so, I would go to Florida. At the end of October, I managed to find a job at another market as a cashier (I am still working there today).

Around Thanksgiving, I realized that I had not heard from Jade in quite some time, so I decided to send her an email asking for an update. I received no response. A week later, I called her number, and I had the same result. A few weeks later, I called the office (where training was supposed to happen) number and I received no response. I left a voicemail. Obviously, at this point, I knew that training wouldn't happen.

On January 7th, I finally received a call from another representative at Mphasis (albeit from a different office). I spoke to another lady, let's call her Alice. Alice informed me that training had been canceled. Alice also told me that Jade is no longer with the company. I asked Alice why I was never notified of this until that day, and she told me that she could not provide a clear answer. Alice also told me that she found out about training being canceled the night before she called me.

I'm sure that other people on this subreddit and beyond have had positive experiences with Mphasis, but I would advise anyone looking for a tech job to avoid this company. I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy. I am willing to answer any question that any of you may have so long as it doesn't require me to give out any personal information."

At this point I'm avoiding certain classes that might accidentally earn me an associate degree and force me to apply as a transfer (57 college hours total).

UNG: taking one semester, classes undecided

UGA: taking entire senior year, classes undecided (this is supposed to be prestigious I guess, you need a 1490 sat to even be considered for uga DE)

Need 28 creds to graduate in my school, will have nearly 45 by the end of senior year.

Letters of recommendation: average, my counselor one will be really good and maybe my NHS teacher/academic team teacher.

Intended major: business/CS (Dual major if possible) will apply undecided tho.

I know I'm guaranteed for GA Tech since I'm currently salutatorian, but am I ivy league material and is it worth going?

Oh I'm also the only indian kid at my school so that's some good essay material maybe

The institution is called Per Scholas and I've heard there a other programs like this where they'll invest in people who prove they are qualified to be accepted and trained and that the the program is free for those with low income. This training program also helps the accepted individuals professionally (resume, elevator pitches) and to network with IT professionals and to also help you land decent entry level positions like a cyber security analyst etc. It feels like this could help me transition into a full time position. There's  also a chance for the students who complete the program could get a paid internship with Barclays after the program since they're one of the sponsors for the program.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been accepted into a cyber security Grad program at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (18 month program in Utica) but the real issue lies here. Because I come from a low income background I was able to get financial aid to help with the undergrad, but I know grad school doesn't. And the costs go even further if you have to move out closer to this distant school. But it's been recommended to me and I've personally read about this grad program and it seems quite reputable. But there's a diversity scholarship that will cover the costs of tuition and offer a stipend to live near and further grants awarded if you dedicate yourself to additional responsibilities if you get it (of course it's extremely competitive) and prior to getting into grad school there are 2 courses they've required me to take at a local college before they fully allow me to enroll but at this time no further financial aid will be given unless its loans so there are further costs to consider. So this path while seems to have a lot to gain has a lot of financial risks. I don't think there are any CUNY grad programs that offer a cyber security program unless I missed them (correct me if I've missed any). The plan was that if I get the scholarship I would decide to pursue this MS program. Otherwise I would try to make the best of the certification program

One last part to the grad program is that the school offers the entire program online. But I don't know how effective it is to take a grad course online or if that it's worth considering.

Last questions:

So how necessary is grad school for a career in Cyber security? Although my major leans in the field of network administration, there are many concepts I've learned that are also needed in this career. So the practical knowledge is what I value. And both the certification course and grad program emphasize on physical/practical knowledge and testing that will help make me qualified for a solid career. Is it fine to build a career in NY, what are some other states you would recommend looking into building a career whats a good salary to aim for? I'm more interested in a technical career, I don't have an interest in manegerial positions.

Last thoughts, I'm 22 so I'm trying to weigh my options so I can properly plan my future so any thoughts, concerns, and recommendations are appreciated. Thanks for reading."

Nothing against AIRBNB it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs smaller than google and not as diverse in products (google has 3 operating systems and an entire cloud platform) nor old it was just an example.

Getting into google is hard and everyone knows that. I want to know how does this compare with other Silicon Valley firms. Is every company equally hard to get in? Every career  site (even internships) say ‚Äúwe are looking for the best talent‚Äù. But if everyone only gets ‚Äúthe best‚Äù, that means the only people who get employed are ‚Äúthe best‚Äù and everyone employed is ‚Äúthe best‚Äù, so what does that mean exactly. Again, Google is famous for rejecting LOOTS of people and their engineers are known for being geniuses. But is everyone in tech supposed to be a google-level genius? What does ‚Äútalent‚Äù realistically means? Is it really REQUIRED to qualify to the ACM ICPC grand finale? Some people say it‚Äôs not really about having a 95% GPA (although it certainly helps).

Some of these companies don‚Äôt even ask for a degree, only HS."

As the title indicates, I'm wondering if there's anyone who has experience with or know how much more ""difficult"" it is for a European citizen to pass the CV screening for internships positions in the US/Canada? 

I'm wondering because I (somehow) have managed to get past the initial screenings for a couple of major US companies with an office in Europe, eg: Palantir, Databricks, Bloomberg, Amazon - and a couple of rather ""filtering"" trading firms (e.g Jane Street).  

But so far, I have not managed to get past even a single screening for an internship position in the US/Canada, despite having sent out  \~100 application (with the same CV that got past the initial screening at the  previous mentioned companies). So perhaps I'm mistaken, but I wouldn't suspect it's a problem with the CV. 

If it's relevant information, then I'm a MSc CS student at a top university in Europe (ETH Z√ºrich), have had previous working experience (part-time SWE, teaching assistant and research intern at the university). 

I guess that many of them don't want to deal with the hassle of the visa struggle, but I'm doubting whether this is the only factor? Or might there be some other factors I haven't considered?"

evme0g,3,2020-01-29,Help with Consultant Job Offer,ExistingMaintenance6,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/evme0g/help_with_consultant_job_offer/,"Hi,

Throwaway account here, but I'm could use a few different opinions on a job offer i was recently made.

**Location:** London, UK

**Background:**

Masters in Bioinformatics grad from a Top 20 Russel Group University in the UK. Had a 12 month internship as a junior IT Business Analyst for a major FMCG company (FTSE100).

After graduation, joined IBM as a Graduate Consultant in their Cloud &amp; Cognitive Business Area, working in the integration space mostly in a Backend engineer type role with a slice of DevOps for a couple of clients on some mid-sized projects. Starting salary was ¬£30k.

Been with IBM now for 18 months and current wage is ¬£36k. Slated to exit the grad scheme in the next 5 months or so, after which I will receive a promotion and a 20% bump in wage.

I quite like my job, and my team. Travel has been fairly light, as majority of clients are in London, so I maybe have to get out of London 1.5 weeks a month, which is perfect for me. Very flexible schedules, with plenty of opportunities to do remote work, and work from home as much as you want (as long as client is ok with it).

To summarise:

Wage: ¬£36k

Bonus: None officially, but I did get two minor bonuses in the past year from project performance.

Pension: I pay in 5%, IBM pays in 10%.

**Offer:**

Recruiter organised an interview with Deloitte recently, with their Consulting Service line. Cloud Engineering and DevOps enablement business unit. Interview went well and they made me an offer for a Consultant role.

Wage: ¬£43k

Bonus: Discretionary, based on Company performance

Pension: Deloitte will match my contributions up to 8%. E.g. I pay in 8%, they pay in 8%.

**Conclusion:**

I feel like they are lowballing me here. I was expecting something in the ¬£50k range, but 43k is only a 20% increase on my current wage, and slightly lower if you take Total Comp into consideration. I will be getting this raise in the next few months anyway.

Talking to friends of mine that have already left, it doesn't seem unreasonable that after 2 years experience I could fairly easily jump into a role paying ¬£60k especially in London if I wanted to.

Is this a decent offer for somebody with my experience? If not, what do you think would be one and what could I reasonably negotiate in this instance?

Any advice will be massively appreciated. Thank you."

I am in my third year of college and have everything I need to graduate this year with a CS major and Mathematics minor. I don‚Äôt really think I need much more than that to be successful in industry, but because I wanted to graduate in the usual four years (and because I‚Äôm only having my first internship this summer) I was aiming to get into a one-year accelerated masters program in computer science at my university so that I could graduate in four with that. I‚Äôve told internships that I would graduate in 2021.

Just learned that I didn‚Äôt get into that program, which is fine and well, but this leaves me with a more complex decision tree and I‚Äôm not sure how to proceed. I‚Äôm wondering if anybody else has had a similar experience. 

Even if I get a return offer from my summer internship, I doubt it would be immediately following the summer. If it is, then I can just do that and be done with it. Otherwise, I have some ideas of how to proceed:

1. Go to school for one more semester and complete a math major. Then either start work in winter semester or look for a winter semester internship.

2. Try to get two internships fall/winter for next year. I don‚Äôt know how unusual or difficult this would be.

3. See if I can get an immediate return offer.

4. ???

What would y‚Äôall recommend? I don‚Äôt necessarily think that a math major versus a minor is worth the tuition money for this industry."

So this will not be my first working experience , nor my first DevOps related Job.

But I will work in a relatively young Company and I will be the only DevOps.

As said before the company is very young (created about 6 month ago I think) , and my job will be to setup the baseline of the future architecture , everything need to be done , they currently have a test environment on a handful of EC2 , but nothing more and everything need to be set ( the Architecture , CI/CD,Monitoring, ect...)

(F19 if it matters)

But

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression, an eating disorder  and anxiety somewhere last year, had it for I think more than six years but never tried to reach out for help. Failed four suicide attempts most recently last October.

I do have a therapist but haven‚Äôt spoken with in more than five months physically (had phone calls every now and then) and am not on medication because I don‚Äôt want it (has been recommended to me) but am contemplating. Had EMDR before therapy for traumatic events.
Don‚Äôt really want to go into details about things I‚Äôve experienced because I know they aren‚Äôt that bad and I know people have it far worse than me.

But i‚Äôve been in a familiar loop lately. As of now my life is going pretty fine almost finishing my degree and work at an internship that wants to keep me after my diploma and like to work there too for the most parts. Am in a loving relationship and have the best friend group yet. Started dressing more in the way I like and started being myself a lot more. 

But the thing is
I hate the way I am as a person. As I said mg life is going great but yet I am not satisfied, i‚Äôm still suicidal and even though I love my boyfriend more than anything I keep seeking ways to break up with him so I can also push away my friends. And I just don‚Äôt know why. I hate myself so much for it. After having failed four times to end it I have stopped trying but because of that my eating disorder is getting worse and worse and without knowing it my bf and friends are enabling it because I lie to them about eating healthier. I say things like ‚ÄúI only drank water today and ate lots of food‚Äù which they of course encourage. But I explicitly leave out the fact that‚Äôs all I ate. And the reason i‚Äôm only drinking water isn‚Äôt to become healthy but because it doesn‚Äôt add weight. I‚Äôve become so conceited and manipulative that I can‚Äôt stand myself.

I am completely ruining my chances at a nice future because I don‚Äôt think I deserve it. I don‚Äôt deserve my parents and I don‚Äôt deserve my friends. And I definitely don‚Äôt deserve my boyfriend with all the baggage I put on him. I wish he would just break up with me.  I just can never be satisfied with anything in my life. Nothing is ever good enough for me.

These are the things I should be telling my therapist but I have this mindset where I don‚Äôt want to disappoint anyone (ironic considering it‚Äôs all I do) and last time I spoke with him I told him how great everything was going and had literally nothing to complain about. (Haven‚Äôt told him about my latest dramatic attempt at suicide) and now I don‚Äôt want tk tell him it‚Äôs actually going really fucking bad with me mentally. Because I know it‚Äôs silly and I should just get over myself and all this self-loathing isn‚Äôt gonna help anyone.

Bht I atill wanted it off my chest somewhere. God and it‚Äôs so incoherent lmao. 
Anyway if anyone is reading this I want to say I don‚Äôt glorify or romanticise depression/suicide/eatibg disorders/or any mental illness for that part. Because I know how this all sounds (and yea i‚Äôm dragging on again) but I don‚Äôt want to be bad influence on anyone.

TL;DR I am a brat with depression who wanted to vent somewhere."

I am looking for some advice. 

I am going to be finishing up engineering school very soon and have accumulated about $30k debt in OSAP loans during my undergrad. I did an internship and managed to save enough money to pay it off once I graduate in April.  If I pay it off, I wouldn't be completely broke, but I'll definitely take a hit.

On the upside, I happened to land a job that pays approximately $70k/year as soon as I graduate. 

 I want to get involved with investing in ETFs/stocks. I'm 24 years old. 

I opened a TFSA and Cash account but am having doubts putting money into it since it requires a minimum deposit of $15k per quarter OR a minimum of 3 trades per quarter. If not met, I get charged $25 per quarter.  Trades also involve a $10 commissioning fee. 

What is the best option for me?  

I want to get involved with investing (I might even go through the wealthsimple route, which has no minimum deposit to make investments). I will also continue to live with my parents upon graduation, so I don't have many bills aside from cellphone/car stuff.

Struggling to find gainful employment post achieving a Master's of Public Health from UNC Chapel Hill.  Upon graduation I was contracted by the university to build an online learning platform for early childhood educators for a year.  The program was so successful it resulted in a new position being funded and then given to someone with much more early childhood experience than myself.  Prior to that I have 5 years of health experience in the form of quality improvement, health education, and outreach coordination for Medicaid Patients and Primary Physicians.  I was promoted nearly yearly and it drove me to decide to get my Master's after having only worked there since the moment I graduated undergrad with a degree in Community Health.  I spent those 5 years accruing supervisor experience developing and implementing internship programs and was the primary liaison for the college in my area.  At this point, all my previous supervisors have moved on and I have attempted unsuccessfully three times for positions with the company again.  

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I am looking for at least a part time position, hopefully even remote as my past positions have been.  Nothing seems to be coming up for viable positions in the salary range that at least matches what I made prior to my Master's.  I have seen two career coaches over the past few years and have had my resume revamped.  Not sure what else to do, struggling to get call backs or even finding positions that semi fit my skills."

Gusje padded down the palace hallway, her leather sandals scraping over the worn wooden flooring.  Even at midday it was dreary inside the hulking edifice - there were few windows to let in the light, and those only showed the diffuse grey that fought its way through the omnipresent clouds roofing the valley.  The remainder and majority of the light in the palace came from a small fortune in glowering qim, kiln-charged for lack of sun and swinging in chains.  


She had never thought for a moment that she would long to feel the sun‚Äôs merciless rays on her skin, but the damp and dark had left her feeling sapped of something vital.  Fortunately, the sun was not the only remedy available to her.  She came to one of the mammoth exterior doors and pushed hard on the thick timber until it swung wide.  The melancholy grey light spilled in, and Gusje practically ran out to meet it.


Moss-slick pavers gave way to dewy grass spotted with white and blue flowers.  She kicked off her sandals as she walked, making her way to a carved whitestone bench half-overgrown with grasping ivy.  All around her vines crept sinuously over trellises or the odd arched pergola, hanging with flowers and fruit that twisted sweet aromatic tendrils into the cool morning air.  In the middle of the swaddling green riot, Gusje sat and was calm.


\---


‚ÄúLook at her,‚Äù Arjun said wonderingly, craning his head out the window.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen her sit so still for so long.‚Äù


Mark snorted, not looking up from the map he was studying.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs from the desert, she hasn‚Äôt ever seen anything like the palace grounds.  Plants where she‚Äôs from are either ‚Äòpoisonous‚Äô, ‚Äòdead‚Äô, or ‚Äòactually a lizard.‚Äô  Even under the cerein it was never really lush like this.‚Äù


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true, this is nearly as strange for her as it is for us,‚Äù Arjun chuckled, shaking his head.  ‚ÄúAlbeit for different reasons.  I think it‚Äôs good that she‚Äôs able to appreciate the beauty of it.  She‚Äôs so young, to be in the middle of such conflict.‚Äù


‚ÄúKids grow up fast in a warzone,‚Äù Mark said grimly.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen younger running around with a rifle.‚Äù  


‚Äú...you say, yourself a wise old man of - what, twenty?‚Äù, Arjun said, only half-smiling.  ‚ÄúYou and Gusje are practically the same age, from my perspective.‚Äù


‚ÄúTwenty-two,‚Äù Mark retorted, waving away Arjun‚Äôs smirk at the correction.  ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt know how old anyone is, doc.  You ever notice how they don‚Äôt have years?  Months?  They just count in days, and anything farther back than a few dozen of those they start talking about ‚Äòwhen so-and-so had his first child‚Äô or ‚Äòwhen the cerein was young.‚Äô‚Äù  He tossed his hands in the air frustratedly.  ‚ÄúTesvaji could be my age and we‚Äôd have no idea.‚Äù


‚ÄúA fair point,‚Äù Arjun conceded.  ‚ÄúSomething to ask Tasja about, perhaps.  Whatever her age in our terms, Gusje strikes me as someone in the process of growing up quickly.  The only home she‚Äôs ever known is threatened, both she and her family were attacked, and now she‚Äôs playing interpreter for the likes of us.‚Äù  He craned his neck to look back down at her.  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help but feel some regret, for our part.‚Äù


Mark sighed, setting aside the map.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù he advised.  ‚ÄúShit was coming down the pipe for them whether we were here or not.  Without us she‚Äôd be with Mosidhu‚Äôs son.‚Äù  He stood up and joined Arjun at the garden window, resting his shoulder against the cold stone of the wall.  ‚ÄúStuff like this, it‚Äôs too big.  You can never stop all the bad from happening, but you can sometimes pick where or how.  Even then, you‚Äôre not gonna be perfect.‚Äù 


‚ÄúVery few people have ever accused me of that,‚Äù Arjun said wryly.  ‚ÄúStill, that strikes me as a healthy attitude to take in unhealthy times, and advice I should consider following.‚Äù


‚ÄúEven if it does come from a wise old man of twenty-two?‚Äù, Mark said, raising an eyebrow.


Arjun raised his hands, conceding the point.  ‚ÄúI surrendered the moral high ground when I brought your age into it, I admit,‚Äù he laughed.  ‚ÄúYou and Mr. Gibson have valuable specialist knowledge.  You‚Äôre more used to the rules of this particular scenario.  If it had been only we two bumbling scientists Vimodi would probably have us wrapped around his finger by now.‚Äù


‚ÄúYeah, well,‚Äù Mark sighed.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not out of the woods yet.  I figure we only have another day before a report from Tizhodhu ends up on Vimodi‚Äôs desk.  I can‚Äôt say what‚Äôs in it, but I‚Äôm almost certain we‚Äôll be under increased scrutiny after it arrives.‚Äù


‚ÄúDo you want to leave tonight, then?‚Äù, Arjun asked.  ‚ÄúSlip out in the dark?‚Äù


Mark shook his head.  ‚ÄúTasja gave us our next destination but we still need to take care of aid for the Cereinem here.  I think after last night we‚Äôve got... well, call it ninety percent of our Plan B worked out, as well as an idea of how he‚Äôll probably try to come after us.  The trick is getting Vimodi to commit to supporting the Cereinem without any formal agreement from us to hand the truck over, then getting proof of the agreement to someone like Tizhodhu or this city council.  Preferably both.  Seems like they‚Äôre very big on ‚Äòletter of the law‚Äô over here, and his rivals in the council would love to find him breaking an agreement he‚Äôs signed.‚Äù


‚ÄúI assume the remaining ten percent involves the role you have in mind for Tasja?‚Äù, Arjun said.  ‚ÄúWe do need someone with inside knowledge of Sjan Saal, and he‚Äôs the best choice so far.‚Äù


Mark nodded.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to rely on him too much, he‚Äôs still an unknown quantity.  He‚Äôll have limits to what he‚Äôll do for us and we can‚Äôt guarantee what he knows won‚Äôt leak to Vimodi.  Implied threats only get us so far.‚Äù


‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been helpful enough getting us maps,‚Äù Arjun pointed out.  ‚ÄúShowing us the *vacata* devices-‚Äù


‚ÄúPlate-pairs, I think,‚Äù Mark said.  ‚ÄúSomething along those lines.  Yeah, those were good to know about.  Explains how Tizhodhu could call ahead but still had to send a courier.  I think the navy used to use a codebook system as well, in the early days of radio.‚Äù  He leaned back against the wall, ruffling his hair through his fingers.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not denying the kid‚Äôs been helpful, but he‚Äôs just a kid.  Hell, he‚Äôs basically doing an internship from what I can tell.  From the way he jumped at showing Jesse and Jackie the library I think most of the reason he‚Äôs helping us is that his day-to-day duties have him bored out of his skull.‚Äù


‚ÄúHe‚Äôs certainly had his mind on things other than the broader situation,‚Äù Arjun said with a grin, glancing out the window.  ‚ÄúThe poor boy seems to bring the conversation back around to Gusje every five minutes without even noticing.  He-‚Äù


Arjun stopped short, the smile dropping from his face.  ‚ÄúMark,‚Äù he said abruptly.  ‚ÄúDid you see Gusje leave?‚Äù


Mark spun to look out the window, seeing only a stone bench amid the greenery.  ‚ÄúFuck, I wasn‚Äôt looking,‚Äù he spat.  He stalked back to the table quickly to grab his backpack, then collected his rifle from against the wall.  ‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he told Arjun.  ‚ÄúBrace the door with a chair after I leave, don‚Äôt open up again unless someone asks in English.‚Äù


Arjun nodded mutely, and Mark stormed out of the room.


\---


The soft rustle of Tasja‚Äôs robes trailed after him like a chorus of whispers as he hurried down the darkened hallway.  Inwardly, he cursed the moment he had ever considered his post uninteresting; tedium was preferable to having Vimodi popping out from behind corners every moment of his day with another urgent errand, task or message.  Even the sanctuary of the archives, the traditional redoubt of clerks and scribes, could no longer offer protection from the governor‚Äôs whims now that the visitors from Gadhun Draat had kicked everyone into a frenzy.  


He had been forced to leave Jesse and Jackie in the scriptorium to attend to Vimodi in person only to be summarily dismissed with a command to summon Gusje to the governor‚Äôs office.  His last interaction with the stone-faced Cereinem girl had not filled him with confidence.  Still, she had sought him out specifically that night.  He recalled the old groundskeeper at the foundhome lamenting the strange and unknowable ways of women, and at the time he had put it down to the old man being an ugly drunkard.  


Now, confronted with the strange and unknowable, he found himself wondering if he had judged the old man unfairly.  


The din of raised voices from ahead jolted him out of his introspection.  Sound carried well in the old stone corridors of the palace despite the wood paneling, so he was able to clearly discern Gusje‚Äôs irritated tones well before he was in sight of her.


‚Äú-tell you whenever I want to take a walk,‚Äù she fumed.  


‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget where you are,‚Äù Mark‚Äôs voice echoed back, causing Tasja‚Äôs step to hitch a bit.  ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt safe to wander off on your own.  If you‚Äôd just let us know-‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a *child*,‚Äù Gusje hissed furiously.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here as the representative of my family, my people.  My father trusted me enough for that, but you don‚Äôt trust me to walk into the garden on my own?‚Äù


Mark let out an irritated grunt.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about trust, Gusje, it‚Äôs about safety.  Things are coming to a head, Vimodi will try to-‚Äù  Tasja rounded the corner and Mark fell silent, immediately turning to fix him with a cold stare as his hand dropped to rest atop a black object strapped to his hip.  


Tasja would not have thought himself capable of overlooking Gusje‚Äôs supremely irritated mien, but Mark‚Äôs pale-eyed stare had him transfixed with sudden, overwhelming fear.  The large man had none of the amiability and casual cheer that he had displayed the previous night.  Tasja felt his own death breathing frostily over the exposed skin of his throat, hovering only heartbeats away-


And then it was over, Mark straightening up wearily while Tasja‚Äôs heart thudded against his ribs with unpleasant vigor.  ‚ÄúTasja,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt hear you coming up.  You need something?‚Äù


‚ÄúAh,‚Äù he managed.  ‚ÄúVimodi Ma wants to meet.  With Gusje Mas.‚Äù  His voice trembled and cracked, but he was still too terrified to be embarrassed.  Mark‚Äôs glare had left him with an uncomfortable awareness of his own fragile mortality.


‚ÄúFigured he would eventually,‚Äù Mark sighed, missing another venomous look from Gusje.  ‚ÄúWell, lead on.‚Äù


‚ÄúAh,‚Äù Tasja stammered again.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mark Rys, but Vimodi Ma gave no instructions about bringing you as well.  I was under the impression he wanted a private‚Ä¶‚Äù  He trailed off, words dying in his throat as Mark‚Äôs eyes narrowed.  The pressure returned, and he became uncomfortably aware of his blood pulsing under his thin, vulnerable skin.


Gusje snorted and pushed past Mark to stand next to Tasja.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she said coolly.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one that wanted to bring me along to speak for you, so *let me*.‚Äù


Mark‚Äôs eyes flicked to Gusje.  ‚ÄúTasja,‚Äù he said lightly.  ‚ÄúCould you give us a moment?‚Äù


Tasja hurriedly excused himself and stood some distance away while Mark and Gusje exchanged furious whispers.  Their conversation grew increasingly animated until Mark flung his hands into the air with wordless exasperation.  He took a dark, boxy object from his belt and pressed it into Gusje‚Äôs hands, muttering insistently.  She rolled her eyes, but eventually stowed the object in a pouch at her waist before turning sharply from Mark to walk towards Tasja once more.  


‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù she said, her tone not inviting a response.  Tasja mutely led the way from the room, feeling Mark‚Äôs eyes on the back of his neck even after they turned the corner.  They walked in silence the whole distance to Vimodi‚Äôs office, Gusje a stalking whirlwind of indignation behind his hurried steps.  When they reached the heavy doors to Vimodi‚Äôs receiving room he flung them open with a palpable sense of relief.  


Vimodi was sitting at his desk, his lips splitting into a fleshy, unctuous smile when he saw Gusje arrive.  ‚ÄúAh, Gusje Mas,‚Äù he rumbled.  ‚ÄúDo come in and sit.‚Äù  His eyes flitted over to Tasja and narrowed.  ‚ÄúTasja, get us water and find some paper.  I‚Äôll need you here for this.‚Äù


Tasja‚Äôs fleeting hope of escape vanished like fog in the high desert as he shuffled to carry out Vimodi‚Äôs commands.  The governor turned to where Gusje was sitting lazily in one of his ornate wooden chairs, her hand idly stroking the visage of a snarling esemadhe carved into the armrest.  


‚ÄúGusje Mas,‚Äù he began.  ‚ÄúIt grieves me to hear of the threat to your people.  Although you are the first to visit in my tenure here, we have enjoyed good relations with the venerable Cereinem and Ademen Tacen from the time of my fathers and theirs before them.‚Äù  He folded his hands in front of him, leaning forward.  ‚ÄúI hope we can continue this tradition of mutual benefit even in the face of our current crisis.‚Äù


‚ÄúVimodi Ma,‚Äù she replied, her voice steady.  Tasja noted, however, that one of her hands was fidgeting nervously in her waist pouch, her foot tapping a nervous tattoo on the floor.  He realized he was staring at her leg and shifted his eyes hurriedly back to his paper.  ‚ÄúI was sent by my father to secure aid in protecting the cerein of my people, and others that may yet be saved.  Will you send men to help us?‚Äù


The governor sighed, his face looking very tired for a moment.  ‚ÄúI will be blunt,‚Äù he said wearily.  ‚ÄúThe king‚Äôs own forces are powerless to stem the advance of the Emperor in the Vidim Vai.  I have read the reports, and they all agree on one thing - resisting the blight on an open field is suicide.  Outside the walls of Idran Saal, the only city they have not yielded is the fortified port of Sjatel - and that, I fear, is only because the enemy has yet to seriously contest it.‚Äù


‚ÄúMy men must stay at the wall,‚Äù he continued solemnly.  ‚ÄúI am sorry, Gusje Mas, but if the *draam je qaraivat* fall then the desert is lost to us.‚Äù


Tasja saw her composure crack for a moment, an anguished flash passing over her face before it returned to grim focus.  ‚ÄúIf there is no aid to be had, then I agree,‚Äù she said, each word sounding like it cost her blood rather than breath.  ‚ÄúMy people must travel to Sun‚Äôs Rest.‚Äù


‚ÄúAnd they will find refuge in our valley,‚Äù Vimodi promised solemnly.  Tasja caught the particular tone of voice he used when he was offering terms and began to scratch down Vimodi‚Äôs words on the page in front of him.  ‚ÄúThe gates will open to them and we will shelter them behind our walls.‚Äù


‚ÄúI thank you, Vimodi Ma,‚Äù Gusje said.  ‚ÄúMy people will be glad to know they have refuge here.  However‚Ä¶‚Äù  She hesitated, although even Tasja could spot it as theatrics.  ‚ÄúI worry for their safety on the journey to your borders, as well as their livelihood.  The cerein and its lands are our lifeblood, and those who flee will arrive with nothing.‚Äù


A flash of annoyance crossed Vimodi‚Äôs face, but only for a moment.  It was, Tasja realized, a concession he had anticipated.  ‚ÄúFor any Cereinem who shelter here we will provide food, animals and land to work,‚Äù he said evenly.  ‚ÄúI will also send men and carts to help hasten their journey.‚Äù  


Gusje looked at Vimodi for a long moment before nodding.  ‚ÄúYou are generous, Vimodi Ma,‚Äù she said, although her tone was carefully neutral.  ‚ÄúI wonder if we will ever be able to repay such a gift.‚Äù


Vimodi fluttered a hand at her magnanimously, shaking his head.  ‚ÄúNonsense, it is the least we can do in the face of such evil,‚Äù he murmured.  ‚ÄúThe council will begrudge me the loss of that land, covetous as they are, but their complaining means little.  However, if you were inclined to think of the greater welfare of the valley, in the interest of reciprocity‚Ä¶‚Äù  He trailed off, and as his eyes came to rest on Gusje there was a hard glint to them.  


‚ÄúI fear for our safety when the blight reaches our walls, Gusje Mas,‚Äù he lamented.  ‚ÄúAnd I do believe it is only a matter of time, not of chance.  Though we have rich lands we are not wealthy, and we have much territory to protect.  During a time of war I could not say that our carts and messengers would be adequate to coordinate movements and logistics along the span of the wall, much less throughout the valley.‚Äù  He leaned forward, steepling his fingers and looking at Gusje intently.  ‚ÄúWe need a means of fast, reliable travel.‚Äù


Gusje did not react to his words visibly but Tasja saw her arm twist as she clenched the fist she held hidden in her pouch.  ‚ÄúAnd in the interest of the valley, you would like to have the chariot,‚Äù she said dully.  ‚ÄúI understand, Vimodi Ma, but it is not mine to give.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh, my child, do not mistake me,‚Äù Vimodi said soothingly.  ‚ÄúI know it belongs to your companions from far Gadhun Draat, and I would never want to suggest otherwise.  However, time is our enemy and we must make every day count if,‚Äù he said softly, his voice dropping to a murmur, ‚Äúwe are to ensure the safety of *all* those in the valley.  I know your companions would gladly agree to help if they could see the severity of our need.  I only fear that given their‚Ä¶ difficulties in speaking, such understanding will cost us precious time - time we cannot afford.‚Äù


Gusje looked at the governor with a pained expression, her hand clenching tightly enough that the tendons were standing out on her wrist.  ‚ÄúWhat would you have me do?‚Äù, she asked quietly.


‚ÄúChariots usually have an activation sigil,‚Äù Vimodi explained, unable to keep the excitement from his expression.  ‚ÄúUsed to set them in motion.  They also have sigils locking the doors.  If you could obtain these for me we could make use of the chariot immediately.  Your companions will be treated as honored guests, and I hope that in time they will come to understand the correctness of our actions.  Surely they, too, would like to see your people safe.‚Äù


Gusje hesitated for a long moment, and Tasja could read furious thoughts in the small movements of her face.  Vimodi simply smiled, watching, and after an extended silence Gusje sighed and bowed her head.  ‚ÄúTheir chariot does not use an activation sigil,‚Äù she said, her voice small and quiet.  ‚ÄúYou simply push a plate to activate it.‚Äù


Vimodi‚Äôs smile grew.  ‚ÄúAnd the locks?‚Äù, he prompted her eagerly.  


Gusje sagged further.  ‚ÄúA small metal key, attached to a larger object so it does not become lost.  They keep it in the drawer of the wooden table in the corner of our room.‚Äù  She looked up at the governor‚Äôs beaming face, a hint of defiance creeping into her eyes.  ‚ÄúWill you also ask that I take it from them?‚Äù


‚ÄúThere is no need for you to go that far,‚Äù Vimodi assured her.  ‚ÄúI will arrange for the‚Ä¶  request to be made.  Tasja, you have the terms?‚Äù  


‚ÄúFood, animals and land for the Cereinem upon their arrival,‚Äù Tasja said shakily, reading his paper.  ‚ÄúAssistance for their evacuation to be delivered immediately.‚Äù  He glanced up at Gusje before reading the next section and found her eyes cold and hard.  ‚ÄúFair treatment and guest right for the Gadhun Draatim travelers, all in return for information about the operation of the Gadhun Draatim chariot and the location of its sigil.‚Äù  He took the paper from his slate and held it out to Vimodi. 


Vimodi snatched the proffered paper and scanned over it, then tore it cleanly in two.  Gusje and Tasja gaped, but Vimodi held up the paper to show that it now only contained the declaration of support for the Cereinem.  ‚ÄúNo need to make your end of the agreement too public, since you‚Äôve already upheld it,‚Äù the governor said, winking. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep that a private matter.‚Äù


He grabbed an ornate seal from its resting place on his desk.  ‚ÄúOh, one more thing, my dear,‚Äù he said casually.  ‚ÄúI will not add it to the terms as written, since we have trust between us - but I will need you to stay in new quarters this evening.  They are more fitting for one of your station, regardless.‚Äù


She gave him a lingering, evaluating look before nodding slowly.  ‚ÄúWonderful,‚Äù Vimodi said brightly, flourishing the seal.  He pressed it to an inkpad, then to the paper.  ‚ÄúThere, my dear,‚Äù he said, sliding the paper over to her with the crest of Sjan Saal still glistening wetly upon it.  ‚ÄúIf you have no seal you can use your thumbprint as a mark,‚Äù he added.  


Gusje shot him a look, a flash of annoyance bleeding through her defeated slouch.  ‚ÄúI am a daughter of the Madi,‚Äù she said stiffly.  ‚ÄúOf course I have a seal.‚Äù  She withdrew her hand from the bag and slipped her bracelet off her wrist to reveal a small saon drai tucked into the braided cordage.  She pressed it firmly into the inkpad, then once more onto the paper.  


‚ÄúWhat an interesting trinket,‚Äù Vimodi murmured, his eyes locking on to it.  


Tasja couldn‚Äôt resist stealing a look at the inked impression of the coin, his eyes tracing over two seven-pointed stars and a reversed curve of flowing script arcing from a stylized *jehan* flower.  In the middle was written *ruud* in ornate aejha glyphs.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù, he choked, his eyes widening.  ‚ÄúMaja‚Äôs grace, an *asolan*?‚Äù


Vimodi‚Äôs eyes were alight, staring in naked greed as Gusje tucked the coin back against her ink-smudged wrist.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of surprises, Gusje Mas,‚Äù he said smoothly.  ‚ÄúBefore this I had heard only rumors about the treasures of the Cereinem.‚Äù


Gusje looked up at him with dull, sunken eyes.  ‚ÄúThere is no treasure that compares to the cerein,‚Äù she said quietly.  ‚ÄúIf there is nothing else, I would grieve for it now.‚Äù


‚ÄúOf course, Gusje Mas,‚Äù he said unctuously, inclining his head to her and tapping two fingers to an inconspicuous saon drai affixed to his collar.  A low tone sounded from outside and two guards entered, looking at Gusje expressionlessly.  Vimodi handed Tasja the signed paper and inclined his head towards the door.  ‚ÄúTasja, please show her to the royal apartments.‚Äù  


Tasja goggled at the governor, who gave him an irritated jerk of his head that sent him scurrying to Gusje‚Äôs side.  ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he whispered, hovering anxiously at her side.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you upstairs.‚Äù


She followed him out of the office, hunched and shuffling as they walked down the long corridor towards the stairs.  It was evening, and the interiors were pitch-black save for the fiery light of qim from above.  Two guards tailed them discreetly in the shadows, content to give them the veneer of privacy as long as they did not deviate from their proper course.  ‚ÄúVimodi Ma will keep to his agreement,‚Äù Tasja said, trying to sound reassuring.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶  well, he is who he is, but once he uses the seal it‚Äôs law.‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôm counting on it,‚Äù Gusje said grimly.  Tasja looked back and was shocked to find her standing tall and walking with easy strides beside him.  In her hand, now freed from the pouch, she held a black, boxy object.  


‚ÄúYou,‚Äù Tasja stammered.  ‚ÄúYou did something.‚Äù


‚ÄúI made an agreement with Vimodi,‚Äù she said lightly.  ‚ÄúYou were there.  I *told* Mark I‚Äôd be fine on my own.‚Äù


‚ÄúWait, but you-‚Äù, Tasja said, his mind spinning.  He peered at her suspiciously, pointing at the object in her hand.  ‚ÄúWhat does that thing do?‚Äù, he hissed.  


‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe me if I told you,‚Äù she said quietly, smirking and replacing it in the pouch.


‚ÄúI might surprise you,‚Äù he retorted.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt travel much, but I know a lot.  I recognized your asolan right away, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù


‚ÄúYou did,‚Äù Gusje admitted grudgingly.  ‚ÄúAlthough you lost any favor that gained you by telling Vimodi about it.‚Äù  Tasja winced, and Gusje elbowed him roughly in the side.  


‚ÄúShowoff,‚Äù she teased him.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not making fun of you, Tasja, I‚Äôve never met anyone half as well-read as you.‚Äù  


‚ÄúBut?‚Äù, Tasja retorted, sulking but inwardly ablaze from the compliment.


She smirked at him again.  ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no book that would tell you what a *radio* is.‚Äù  


\---


*‚Äú...in the drawer of the wooden table in the corner of our room,‚Äù* the radio hissed.


Mark blinked, patting the keychain in his pocket and glancing at the end-table in question.  Sure enough, there was a small drawer in its side.  ‚ÄúDo we have anything in that drawer?‚Äù, he whispered.  Jackie got up to check while Tasja hesitantly read the terms of the agreement.  


‚ÄúNope,‚Äù she replied.  ‚ÄúEmpty.‚Äù


*‚Äú...more fitting for one of your station, regardless,‚Äù* Vimodi oozed, the delight in his voice apparent even over the radio.  


‚ÄúCocksucker,‚Äù Mark observed sourly.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs keeping her under guard until he‚Äôs got the key in hand.  So much for Plan B.‚Äù


‚ÄúShe did lie to him,‚Äù Jesse pointed out.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reasonable precaution.‚Äù


Jackie smacked him on the shoulder.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trying to steal our ride,‚Äù she said crossly.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fair game.‚Äù


‚ÄúI should have gone with her,‚Äù Mark muttered, shaking his head.


Arjun shrugged.  ‚ÄúIf you had, he wouldn‚Äôt have offered terms.  There was never any hope of Gusje extracting a promise from him with us on her side, he would have just demanded that we hand over the keys right then and there.  As it stands, he‚Äôs just given us a concession for something he was going to do anyway.  At least now we have advance warning.‚Äù


‚ÄúUgh,‚Äù Mark grunted, burying his face in his hands.  ‚ÄúMy fucking head.  You know, if there had been anywhere else to go I‚Äôd say coming here was a mistake.‚Äù


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so bad,‚Äù Jackie said optimistically.  ‚ÄúI mean, Gusje got what she needed and we know where we need to go next.  We got a lot of good info from Tasja and Jesse has a mysterious stalker girlfriend.  All we need to do now is quietly get the hell out of Dodge.‚Äù  She smiled and spread her hands wide, ignoring Jesse‚Äôs pained look.  


‚ÄúFirst things first, Jack,‚Äù Mark said, sitting back upright.  ‚ÄúI figure Vimodi is a fan of instant gratification, so we‚Äôre going to have company sooner rather than later.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe should move, then,‚Äù Jackie said, grabbing her pack.  ‚ÄúGet Gusje out and leave, we need to be gone before they get here.‚Äù


Jesse shook his head.  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said quietly.  ‚ÄúVimodi needs to find us here, otherwise he‚Äôll know Gusje set him up.  He‚Äôll back out of the agreement before it‚Äôs public knowledge.  He needs to think he‚Äôs won at least long enough that his rivals in the council get a copy of the document.‚Äù


‚ÄúSo, what, we‚Äôre just supposed to let him steal our truck?‚Äù, Jackie asked, exasperated.  


‚ÄúHe needs to think he has a chance, at any rate,‚Äù Arjun mused.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose anyone has any ideas?‚Äù


‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôd give Gusje the OK to sell us out without a Plan C?‚Äù, Mark chuckled.  ‚ÄúI figure this will be easy enough, he‚Äôs operating under the assumption that we‚Äôre pushover nobles and he holds all the cards.  He won‚Äôt want to use violence, but he‚Äôll try to threaten us with it.  We‚Äôll just stand firm, flex a bit and call his bluff.  There‚Äôs a pretty good chance he won‚Äôt try and force the issue on the first try and we can stall him until the agreement with Gusje can‚Äôt be reversed.‚Äù


‚ÄúI think we underestimate his greed at our peril,‚Äù Arjun said.  ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it you that said the only thing standing between him and everything he‚Äôs dreamed of is us?‚Äù


Jackie nodded emphatically.  ‚ÄúArjun‚Äôs right,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre counting on him acting smart or at least cautious, but people do stupid shit when they get greedy.‚Äù


‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre not wrong,‚Äù Mark admitted.  ‚ÄúNot saying we shouldn‚Äôt have a contingency for him trying to flat-out rob us, just that we should try not to escalate if we can help it.  If someone gets seriously hurt our chances of helping the Cereinem go way down.‚Äù  


‚ÄúSo, what?‚Äù, Jackie asked.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Vimodi would mind hurting *us* if he could get away with it.‚Äù


Mark thought for a moment, then chuckled and looked over at Jesse.  ‚ÄúI just had a terrible idea,‚Äù he said merrily.  ‚ÄúRemember when Correia nearly got himself busted down to E-1 last year?‚Äù


Jesse blinked.  ‚ÄúWhen he rigged the - oh.  Mark, no.  You just said we shouldn‚Äôt escalate.‚Äù


Mark flashed his teeth in a predatory grin.  ‚ÄúAnd we won‚Äôt.  We‚Äôll just give ourselves some options for‚Ä¶  proportional response.‚Äù


‚ÄúYou paused before you said that,‚Äù Jackie noted.  ‚ÄúThat makes me think it will be a bit disproportionate.‚Äù


There was a pause.


‚ÄúMaybe a bit,‚Äù Mark admitted.

evppz4,1,2020-01-29,Everything is moving slow so far? What should I do?,Mdfinest,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/evppz4/everything_is_moving_slow_so_far_what_should_i_do/,"Hi all,

I feel like I'm moving forward in my life but at the same time I feel like my progress is moving at a ""snails pace"". 

Recently, I went to a networking event in London to try to enter my specific industry I'm interested including a particular one in London as it's a city I've always wanted to move to for a period of time. I managed to gain a few contacts and one of the contacts even said he might set me up for an internship for Summer or Fall of 2020. This was back in November. Fast forward, it's now January. Things are moving slow and the person who was supposed to start setting me up with the internship isn't responding to my 2nd follow up email. He responded to my first asking me about the details for the internship and I responded by telling him X Y and Z. Still no response on his end. 

I also managed to connect with another person in my future industry via LinkedIn in my local area. I asked him if he would like to talk about how he progressed in his career and he gave me his phone number out the bat. I then asked him what a good time would be to call him and he didn't respond. I waited for a few days before I called him and left him a voicemail. It's now been 2 days and I still have yet to receive a response. 

The things I am doing are reading up constantly everyday on industry news mostly in my local area and at times, nationally and Internationally.  I even post on my LinkedIn group constantly, at least twice a day.

I'm trying to get back into school through paying off my debt and currently working a menial job that is not a means to an end for me at the moment.

Is there something I'm doing wrong or am I just wasting my time with this? Because I am starting to get that feeling with things moving so slowly so far, I might start to get back into that downward spiral (ie, depression and doubt) again. I don't want to get back into that downward spiral of not moving forward with anything like in the past. 

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks!"

I'm aware that every company is different, but I wanted some insight into internship programs for CS. It seems like for bigger companies, they bring on interns in the hopes of hiring them full time after grad. Some smaller companies (like early stage startups) seem to hire interns for additional help and/or gruntwork at a lower cost.  
  
  
In your experience, why do companies hire interns?  
-Grunt work  
-Need additional help but short on cash  
-Giving back to the community  
-With the intention to find great students to hire post grad  
-To train current company's engineers how to be managers  
  
  
In my experience, I've noticed that the companies I've been applying (and have heard back from) don't intend to hire at all post-internship but are looking for extra hands. What have you seen?"
evr7pb,3,2020-01-29,"22 years old, dealing with extreme anxiety/panic attacks/regret. My question is - how do I stop regretting the past and questioning my decisions, and move on properly?",treesofthemind,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/evr7pb/22_years_old_dealing_with_extreme_anxietypanic/," Hi, so I've made a decision and can't really back out, but I often have panic attacks and massive surges of doubt, and I'm really struggling with this.

**TL;DR - regretful, doubting my decision, unable to progress mentally. 22 years old, embarking on a software developer career. My question is - how do i stop regretting the past and questioning my decisions, and move on properly?**

So, I joined a very good/prestigious financial company as an apprentice, last year, in the media team. (Not a graduate, joined at 21 years old with a few marketing internships under my belt.) This is a relatively small team in an extremely large/multinational company, and at first I was determined to have a successful career in marketing. Whilst being there, my interest was drawn towards engineering instead. Two reasons for this:

a) there is a massive engineering department here, they have a lot of events which I attended/subtly sneaked into, and I learned a lot about how engineers work, agile practices, coding tips/software design tips, etc., despite not being in the engineering department.

b) the media team I was placed in didn't really give me a lot to do, short of completely ignoring me at times. This was incredibly frustrating as I have marketing experience, I'm relatively intelligent and definitely offered them value in certain areas. May have been due to the fact that I was initially quite shy, and could have been louder/more assertive. Regardless of this, I know that I'd rather pursue engineering/product management as a career, instead of marketing. After hanging out more with engineering, I saw how much more open/accepting/diverse they are, how much more exciting their sector is, and began to gravitate towards them instead.

c) I also attended other engineering events within my city, and have networked with other companies/individuals in the engineering space. This is definitely essential as an industry newbie, and I've also learned from them, and was prompted to pursue engineering as a career, instead of marketing.

d) So... summer 2019 I applied for other apprenticeships - notably degree apprenticeships - in software engineering, and actually got offers - much to my surprise, as a newbie in this area. However, to cut a long story short, I ended up having to reject some of them, due to taking too long to decide/being deterred by the change of location and training providers. For context - my city is one of the biggest tech hubs of the UK, to leave this area as a newbie in tech seems slightly insane. At least, it did to me at the time.

So - I lost all offers and resolved to carry on with my marketing apprenticeship, even though I was not fulfilled, or working properly in my allocated team. You know the drill - you're an apprentice/intern, constantly chasing for work to add to your mandatory portfolio, and no one's giving you any - it's either repetitive, not enough or very inconsistent. To add the pressure on, the apprenticeship company (quite a dreadful one) was pressuring me constantly, whilst changing my skills coach/being flippant with me - you're definitely treated as one of very many. Maybe this wouldn't have mattered if I felt supported/fulfilled by the marketing team - sadly, this didn't happen. However, the wider company still offered me value in terms of engineering events, networking with engineers etc - however, always with a tangible barrier. 

As an apprentice, I'm not a full time employee - I'm on minimum wage (which is hellish in London, with rent prices/transport so high), I have no real prospect of being kept on as a full time employee in marketing. Unlike other departments, there's no real room for apprentices to ""convert"" as they normally would in something like customer/technical support. 

**Here's the crux:** there was an internal engineering transfer programme available. However, I became aware of it at quite a late stage - bearing in mind that it can take up to 8-10 months or a year to do enough work to be considered eligible for the scheme, plus you have to be an employee for more than 10 months. You have to do an online comp sci course, independently, and then a bunch of tests - of course, with enough time I probably could have achieved it, which is what eats at me. However, in September/October 2019 I was struggling with health problems, anxiety, regret at missing the other opportunities, and general depression. My sister and I were squatting in a rather manky hotel, being unable to find a good place to rent. I fell ill, and went home for a period of time.

In the midst of this I went to an interview for another software engineering apprenticeship, based in my city, with another company - not as prestigious, but relatively well-known. I went to the interview and a few weeks later received an offer. I was happy and inclined to accept at once - the salary was pretty decent for an apprenticeship role, and the training company is known to be quite good. However, I was still struggling with ill health at the time, and explained this to the recruiters. They very kindly agreed to let me in on the February intake. I agreed, and signed a new contract to start in February.

Since then: I've been trying to wrap up here, I've had multiple talks with my manager, and I don't think he resents me. HR, on the other hand, have not been great. Too cut a long story short, this was a bit of a struggle at the end of last year - they were pressuring me to make a decision - are you staying or going, are you going to give notice, if you don't leave at the end of December you won't get your holiday pay, etc. Bearing in mind, I'm an apprentice, not a full time employee - holiday pay isn't a carrot to me, learning and getting value from the people around me is the real value. Though they profess to be all-accepting, championing diversity etc, I resented the way they treated me, and the attitude to the apprenticeship programme as whole - it's very much a mechanical/batch approach. Here's the first batch...along comes the second. I think I am worth more than that.

I'm still finding it hard to leave mentally, although i've officially given my notice, withdrawn from the crappy apprenticeship qualification, and my last day is this Friday. however, I will miss all the communities/groups I'm part of, talks I've had, and I do feel miserable and depressed. but there's no going back."

Despite my body taking the initiative to heal itself from all the injuries I‚Äôve sustained over the recent course of time, I made sure not to strain myself when I wasn‚Äôt bashing brains in.

My shattered palm somehow was able to reconfigure itself to a point where I was able to form a fist without vicious pain shooting all over.

I knew that the human body isn‚Äôt capable of any of the feats I was able to perform, but questioning what my body was capable of is its own can of worms.

The elevator I took to the 25th floor was busted and refused to move upwards, so I took the long route-the stairs.

With each flight of stairs, I began to notice that none of the floors had any windows whatsoever, which was greatly concerning.

I still didn‚Äôt know how long I was in that chamber for, and I was unsure of how much shock my heart could take if my first glimpse of the outside was to see a *Blade Runner*\-esque cityscape.

I got up to the 12th floor and heard the soft murmurs of a conversation behind the closed door.

Stealthily, I peeked through the door and saw two cold-bodied humanoid demons talking to each other, looking greatly frustrated.

The tall magenta one with the horns of a buffalo and the feet of a crow dressed in an ill-fitting lab coat argued with a shorter, wider, opaquely red demon with arms as thick as tree stumps, wearing the typical jumpsuit all the warm-bodied spindly demons wore.

I may have been far from the both of them, but I could feel the frosty coldness emanating from the tall one, which chilled me to the bone.

The wide one had a stern expression on his mustached face, regularly turning around to scold someone off in the distance I couldn‚Äôt see from where I was standing.

The tall one shuffled a series of files stuffed in an envelope under his arm, tucking it carefully.

I was curious to know what was inside, but that was far from my priority. What I absolutely needed to do was take these two out, which was definitely going to be a tall order.

Belial was nearly able to snuff me out by himself, so what could I do against two demons?

To boot, Belial didn‚Äôt have such an overpowering cold aura around him as the tall demon did.

I looked around the room to find a route I could use to sneak around the two of them and try to surprise them, but I didn‚Äôt know what those two were capable of.

If either of them had Belial‚Äôs telekinesis, they could just pick me up and snap my neck with a flick of their wrist.

Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt have to decide whether or not to move because the burly pale demon had left the conversation in a huff, walking off to the side with his massive fists tightly clenched.

The tall demon‚Äôs talons skittered across the floor to make his way to a nearby desk full of strewn-about paperwork and broken computer monitors to peer down at something, or someone hiding behind it.

He pointed his finger at it like an enraged parent chewing out an unruly child, raising his voice to the point where I was able to hear it.

He was insulting someone to ‚Äúquit hiding like a damn coward and help us with this fucking ritual‚Äù, and was getting progressively angrier and losing what little patience he claimed he had.

I wasn‚Äôt able to tell why, but his rant was making me increasingly paranoid and enraged. The possibility that another human had escaped their chamber without losing their humanity was being coerced into helping them under the threat of death. My blood boiled at the thought of some helpless person at the mercy of these sick bastards, unable to defend themselves.

I poked my head out the door slightly more and got an eyeful of the ritual he had mentioned.

It looked like a generic pentagram carved into the ground with red ink, taking up nearly half the floor with its breadth.

The pale demon got on his knees directly into the middle of the circle, raising his hands in the air like he was testing the rain clouds to begin raining on an overcast day. A lizard-like tail poking out from behind his jumpsuit coiled tightly around his arm, like a serpent ensnaring its prey.

The tall demon shook his head disapprovingly and paced away from the desk and the unseen figure hiding by it, walking towards the middle of the circle to join the kneeling one.

Both of them looked deep in meditation like they were trying to achieve nirvana right there on the floor.

The large one‚Äôs tail began to gently slash across his palm, drawing dark blood that streamed down his arm and stained the sleeve of his suit.

The tall demon dipped his sharp fingernails in the fresh blood and dabbed the negative space inside the middle of the circle, to which it began to glow a dull indigo.

As soon as the circle lit up, I felt the veins on my arm suddenly harden intensely, like my muscles were going through extreme strain.

The birdfeet demon stood up quickly and peered around the room frantically.

The wide one opened a single eye and glanced at him curiously.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù He said, his voice so low it practically rumbled my bones.

‚Äú*He‚Äôs here*.‚Äù The other growled.

At that moment I threw any idea of stealth out the window and charged directly into the room, skidding across the floor to leap and tackle the birdfeet demon.

He reacted before I could jump and blasted a stream of cold, blue fire towards me, which I just barely was able to dodge. The fire hit the floor where I was and singed it black upon contact.

He followed up with several more streams aimed towards me and in front of me, but I was just quick enough to avoid being burnt, or frozen for that matter. I didn‚Äôt know what that blue fire was capable of doing to my body, but I wasn‚Äôt itching to find out.

The burly demon stood up from his position and stomped on the ground hard enough to make the whole room shake with a violent tremble, causing me to stumble and fall.

The tall one followed up with launching a fiery lance directly towards me, which I dodged with a well-timed roll that got me back up on my feet and running again.

Another tremor-causing stomp came, but this time I was able to jump and avoid the impact.

I wasn‚Äôt able to find any opening to attack either of them; the blue fire kept me at a distance while the tremors proved to make the ground unstable.

I made the choice to start running along the wall when the stomps came out, and switch to the ground when the fire blasts targeted me.

I had to maintain my pattern without failing even once because I was sure getting caught in either one would mean my death.

I felt my heart hammering in my throat as I ran closer towards the stomping demon, which judging by his expression, was getting more than a little livid of my persistence.

I was close enough to him where his serpentine tail began to try and jab me, moving like it had a mind of its own.

I heard another fire lance whizz past my ears, which gave me a dangerous idea.

I ran directly in front of the stomping demon and slid on the ground to avoid his massive hands trying to grab me.

I knew my plan was successful when I heard him roar out in pain as a bolt of blue fire intended to hit me lodged into his chest, causing the wound to seep an oil-like substance into his body.

I didn‚Äôt think that the one wound he sustained was enough to kill him, so I kept running and tore a fire extinguisher off the wall, using it shield myself against another blast of fire that was coming my way.

Each bolt that came towards me I was able to block with a cloud of the extinguisher fluid, giving me a method to properly fight back.

Before the big demon could get up and try to attack me, I used the narrow window of time I had before the tall demon blasted me again to whip the extinguisher directly at his nose, breaking it to the point where his eyes began to swell up.

The tall demon ceased his rapid-fire flames and began to blast a persistent jet of flames out of each hand, forcing me to hold down on the nozzle to not get attacked.

The distance between us quickly closed as we held our ground, the extinguisher and flame evenly matched.

At a moment's notice, he switched to firing out of one hand and aimed his free hand at the floor, blasting another stream of hissing flame at my feet.

I was on the run again, this time having to always keep aim with my extinguisher at the blast coming towards my head and run from the wave of fire at my feet.

Just when I thought I had bitten off more than I can chew, the big demon got up and stomped the floor enough effort to knock both me and his partner demon into the air.

Wasting no time, I got another wave of fire towards me, which I retaliated by throwing my extinguisher like a frisbee, causing it to erupt into mist and foam, which coated nearly the entire room.

I wiped the foam out of my eyes and dashed towards the birdfoot demon, who was struggling to wipe away all the foam.

He hastily blasted two beams of fire at me, but I slid underneath his legs before he could react and grabbed ahold of both of his arms, aiming the pillars of fire towards the other demon.

For just a second, the concentrated fire blasts were aimed directly at his legs, which proved hot enough to melt his thick flesh like wet paper all the way to the knee and covering his body in the same blue liquid.

The beams of fire stopped as the demon I was controlling had just realized what he had done, but I didn‚Äôt let him react.

I stomped the back of his legs hard enough so he would fall to his knees, and I aimed a kick directly into his jugular, causing him to grasp his throat tightly as his breath was cut off.

A nearby piece of extinguisher shrapnel proved to make an apt weapon, easily cutting through his flesh and piercing itself into his heart, killing him and leaving him unable to even take a last breath as he died.

I yanked the shrapnel out and faced towards the now legless demon, who had stopped screaming and was laying on the floor, looking like he accepted whatever form of defeat coming his way. How he was able to stay so calm after being burned so severely was lost to me, but I don‚Äôt doubt that demons have higher pain tolerance.

‚Äú**Where is the goddess?**‚Äù I demanded, my voice hardly even sounding like my own.

He glanced at me weakly and scoffed.

‚ÄúEat shit, bottom-feeder,‚Äù He rasped.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather die than tell you anything.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt going to argue with him on that.

I took my time properly mashing his skull with my sneaker, stopping until I could see my own reflection in his black, starry eyes.

I dropped the shrapnel to the ground and looked around the room, noticing the destruction.

Covered in foam, blood and scorch marks, I had made quite a mess in here.

Weakly, I began to walk out of the room until I heard an extremely faint sniffle and sobbing sound coming from nearby.

I remembered that there was someone else in the room with the two demons and I, and I ran on my strained legs, going to see if they were okay.

Instead of seeing another human hostage, I instead saw the small, slender frame of a demon with reddish-grey skin and with the striped tail of a lemur curled up tightly in a corner, quietly sobbing to itself with girlish inflections.

I was stunned. Why is it not attacking me? Why is it crying?

For a moment they raised their head and looked me in the eyes, which had filled their mismatched black and white eyes with a primal fear.

‚ÄúP-please, I won‚Äôt hurt you!‚Äù It whimpered, voice trembling like a leaf in a windstorm.

I was even less prepared to think about the fact that every single demon I‚Äôve fought prior was a male, and that this was the only female one I‚Äôve encountered.

‚ÄúPlease just leave me be! I won‚Äôt tell anyone you were here!‚ÄùI was at a loss of what to do. She was still undoubtedly a demon like the rest, but this was the first one that wanted me actively gone from the premises, nor was she trying to convince me to join their ranks for whatever insidious plot they were concocting.

I decided not to attack for now and try and get some information out of her.

‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù I said as softly as I could.

She glanced up at me, still unsure if she should be trusting me.

‚ÄúI was called Kendra before all of this...but call me Khrona.‚Äù She answered.

The mentioning of ‚Äò*before all of this*‚Äô painted an uncomfortable picture in my head.

These were all people prior to their transformation and had willingly abandoned their humanity for power.

But Khrona..felt different. There was something recognizably *human* about her, despite the fact she had agreed to become a demon. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was her reaction to me or some other factor I wasn‚Äôt able to see.

I further persuaded her by reaching my hand out, offering her to take it.

Trembling, she took it and I lifted her off the floor.

She still had the icy touch that all the cold-bodied demons did, but for some reason, I didn‚Äôt mind holder her hand.

When we were both standing up straight I could notice the drastic height difference between us, and I think she noticed.

She went bow-legged and looked like she wanted to run from me, but I showed her both of my palms to tell her I wasn‚Äôt carrying any weapons on me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to hurt you. I promise.‚Äù I told her, aiming to keep my promise if everything went well.

She nodded weakly and craned her neck to look me in the eyes.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She said shakily.

I reciprocated my giving my own affirmative nod and began to question her.

‚ÄúCan you tell me what happened here? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

She gulped and rubbed her shoulder nervously.

‚ÄúUm, How do I put this?‚Äù She said, sounding unsure of her own words.

‚Äú...Everyone agreed to become demons.‚Äù She said, sounding like she couldn‚Äôt believe what she was saying.

‚ÄúOkay, how?‚Äù I questioned.

She let out a sigh and prepared to tell me.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there when it happened, but I do know that nearly all the staff members who worked here signed some kind of contract to transform into what we are now. The ones who didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt need to hear in her words what had happened to the reluctant staff.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a choice!‚Äù She shouted.

‚ÄúIt was either become this or die! I did what I needed to do to survive, and now I‚Äôm a monster.‚Äù

She followed up sounding like she was going to cry again.

‚ÄúWhat about everyone in stasis chambers?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were turned against their will. They put up symbols to ensure that every single one of them turned into obedient slaves for whatever their purpose is.‚Äù She continued.

‚ÄúWell, didn‚Äôt work on me,‚Äù I told her, which earned me a skeptical look from Khrona.

‚ÄúAre you sure? I mean, I‚Äôve never seen red eyes on a person before. And the way you fought..‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have red skin or horns, so I think I‚Äôm in the clear,‚Äù I said firmly, to which she promptly dropped the subject.

‚ÄúSo, do you know *why* everyone agreed to become demons? Aside from you, obviously.‚Äù

She shrugged her elbows.

‚ÄúAgain, I wasn‚Äôt here when the initial plan came in so I‚Äôm not entirely caught up, so any business with this ‚Äògoddess‚Äô I don‚Äôt have much to say.‚Äù She said apologetically.

Just like that, our conversation ended and was replaced by an awkward silence.

‚ÄúWhat do you plan to do now?‚Äù I asked her.

I didn‚Äôt know a whole lot about her, but I struggled to sense any hostility from her, which made picturing her marching in the army of the goddess seems ridiculous.

‚ÄúUm, could I travel with you?‚Äù She asked shyly.

‚ÄúYou seem to know what you‚Äôre doing, and I could lead you around the place. I‚Äôve been working here as an intern for a couple months.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt totally comfortable with having a demon travel alongside me, but the directions were invaluable to me.

‚ÄúFine by me,‚Äù I told her, which lit her face up with appreciative glee.

‚ÄúNow, tell me where the goddess is.‚Äù

I know it's because of my lack of finance experience and low GPA (3.0 at an Ivy, Econ major). My networking efforts and personality also need work.

At this point, I'm not sure IB or PE is realistic for me. I've been told to reach out to boutiques elsewhere in the country, but even then it's tough since it's already this late in the recruiting cycle. I've been applying to other positions in hopes for a summer internship. So far, I have my first ever interview with an expert network firm soon but I would also like to branch out to other areas of finance.

What do you guys suggest that are hopefully easier to break into, and would they still recruit this late? I can't afford to be picky so I don't care if it's a middle or back office role. I've heard of Asset Management, Commercial Banking, Corporate Banking, Corporate Finance, Equity Research, and Risk Management but I don't know much about these since I immersed myself in IB. Of course, I'm willing to learn. Are these also very competitive or have a grueling recruitment process?"
evt286,1,2020-01-29,"22 years old, dealing with extreme anxiety/panic attacks/regret. My question is - how do I stop regretting the past and questioning my career decisions, and move on properly?",treesofthemind,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/evt286/22_years_old_dealing_with_extreme_anxietypanic/," Hi, so I've made a decision and can't really back out, but I often have panic attacks and massive surges of doubt, and I'm really struggling with this.

**TL;DR - regretful, doubting my career decisions, unable to progress mentally. 22 years old, embarking on a software developer career. My question is - how do i stop regretting the past and questioning my decisions, and move on properly?**

So, I joined a very good/prestigious financial company as an apprentice, last year, in the media team. (Not a graduate, joined at 21 years old with a few marketing internships under my belt.) This is a relatively small team in an extremely large/multinational company, and at first I was determined to have a successful career in marketing. Whilst being there, my interest was drawn towards engineering instead. Two reasons for this:

a) there is a massive engineering department here, they have a lot of events which I attended/subtly sneaked into, and I learned a lot about how engineers work, agile practices, coding tips/software design tips, etc., despite not being in the engineering department.

b) the media team I was placed in didn't really give me a lot to do, short of completely ignoring me at times. This was incredibly frustrating as I have marketing experience, I'm relatively intelligent and definitely offered them value in certain areas. May have been due to the fact that I was initially quite shy, and could have been louder/more assertive. Regardless of this, I know that I'd rather pursue engineering/product management as a career, instead of marketing. After hanging out more with engineering, I saw how much more open/accepting/diverse they are, how much more exciting their sector is, and began to gravitate towards them instead.

c) I also attended other engineering events within my city, and have networked with other companies/individuals in the engineering space. This is definitely essential as an industry newbie, and I've also learned from them, and was prompted to pursue engineering as a career, instead of marketing.

d) So... summer 2019 I applied for other apprenticeships - notably degree apprenticeships - in software engineering, and actually got offers - much to my surprise, as a newbie in this area. However, to cut a long story short, I ended up having to reject some of them, due to taking too long to decide/being deterred by the change of location and training providers. For context - my city is one of the biggest tech hubs of the UK, to leave this area as a newbie in tech seems slightly insane. At least, it did to me at the time.

So - I lost all offers and resolved to carry on with my marketing apprenticeship, even though I was not fulfilled, or working properly in my allocated team. You know the drill - you're an apprentice/intern, constantly chasing for work to add to your mandatory portfolio, and no one's giving you any - it's either repetitive, not enough or very inconsistent. To add the pressure on, the apprenticeship company (quite a dreadful one) was pressuring me constantly, whilst changing my skills coach/being flippant with me - you're definitely treated as one of very many. Maybe this wouldn't have mattered if I felt supported/fulfilled by the marketing team - sadly, this didn't happen. However, the wider company still offered me value in terms of engineering events, networking with engineers etc - however, always with a tangible barrier. 

As an apprentice, I'm not a full time employee - I'm on minimum wage (which is hellish in London, with rent prices/transport so high), I have no real prospect of being kept on as a full time employee in marketing. Unlike other departments, there's no real room for apprentices to ""convert"" as they normally would in something like customer/technical support. 

**Here's the crux:** there was an internal engineering transfer programme available. However, I became aware of it at quite a late stage - bearing in mind that it can take up to 8-10 months or a year to do enough work to be considered eligible for the scheme, plus you have to be an employee for more than 10 months. You have to do an online comp sci course, independently, and then a bunch of tests - of course, with enough time I probably could have achieved it, which is what eats at me. However, in September/October 2019 I was struggling with health problems, anxiety, regret at missing the other opportunities, and general depression. My sister and I were squatting in a rather manky hotel, being unable to find a good place to rent. I fell ill, and went home for a period of time.

In the midst of this I went to an interview for another software engineering apprenticeship, based in my city, with another company - not as prestigious, but relatively well-known. I went to the interview and a few weeks later received an offer. I was happy and inclined to accept at once - the salary was pretty decent for an apprenticeship role, and the training company is known to be quite good. However, I was still struggling with ill health at the time, and explained this to the recruiters. They very kindly agreed to let me in on the February intake. I agreed, and signed a new contract to start in February.

Since then: I've been trying to wrap up here, I've had multiple talks with my manager, and I don't think he resents me. HR, on the other hand, have not been great. Too cut a long story short, this was a bit of a struggle at the end of last year - they were pressuring me to make a decision - are you staying or going, are you going to give notice, if you don't leave at the end of December you won't get your holiday pay, etc. Bearing in mind, I'm an apprentice, not a full time employee - holiday pay isn't a carrot to me, learning and getting value from the people around me is the real value. Though they profess to be all-accepting, championing diversity etc, I resented the way they treated me, and the attitude to the apprenticeship programme as whole - it's very much a mechanical/batch approach. Here's the first batch...along comes the second. I think I am worth more than that.

I'm still finding it hard to leave mentally, although i've officially given my notice, withdrawn from the crappy apprenticeship qualification, and my last day is this Friday. however, I will miss all the communities/groups I'm part of, talks I've had, and I do feel miserable and depressed. but there's no going back."

I really enjoyed a computer architecture class I took last semester, and ended up taking the more advanced version right now. I also got a research position with my professor in this class, which I can go more into detail about in the comments if needed. However, I've never really thought of what kind of industry jobs this leads to. I've always found it really cool how companies like NVidia, Google, etc. make specialized hardware to run certain applications (like GPUs, Google's TPU), but I don't know exactly how lucrative that field is, whether it will be expanding or contracting in the future, nor what sort of background I should have to enter the field. 

I currently don't have an internship lined up for the summer, and so I'm pursuing this architecture research, but I don't know how much of a benefit that will have going forward, and want to guage my plan of attack for this summer and future semesters. 

If it helps, I'm also taking all of the machine learning / AI classes at my university in the future, and I guess I was hoping that I could eventually end up working on hardware acceleration of machine learning applications.

My older brother is a very hard worker and he brought home an average of 97 (to get into university our parents wanted him to get a 98).

He's been trying to get a into a co-op program as an intern for job experience. We heard back and he didn't get in. My dad understood that he worked very hard but people make mistakes, however my mom keeps bringing up the fact that he can never make them happy (which is incorrect beleive me). To make things worse she keeps praising me about how I can accomplish whatever I want and always make them proud, which is also not true. We immigrated here and we didn't have lots of money so my brother couldn't get access to all the facilities or privileges he needed until high school (computer, phone etc). Despite this he has an average of 97, me on the other hand I had everything I needed by grade 6 and I have never gotten an average over 86.

evv5b4,2,2020-01-29,Remote Work Options in Finance,Thisnamefakeyall,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/evv5b4/remote_work_options_in_finance/,"Ive been lurking this page for awhile and after doing a decent amount of searching, decided to post a question i have seen some discussion on and am interested in myself.

Im a non traditional student and just started my first semester as a junior at a middle of the pack business school in Texas after transferring from a community college for a finance degree. Mid 20's, past entrepreneurial experience with decent success, it was a grind and learned a lot but lost the passion for the industry (was not an industry that is easy to generate great income) and decided to leave it to finish my degree I was almost half way done with. Busting my ass in a tough industry with low financial returns in comparison to most industries, and then leaving that put a lot in perspective for me personally. I was working 40-50 hours a week in a very physically active environment while also doing 10-20 hours of computer work outside of those direct working hours. After 2 years, i was burnt out and not in a great headspace. It was very much a passion project, but I realized i wasn't getting, nor was i likely to get, a lot of the things in life that i wanted. 

With all that said, I am no stranger to hard work and am not at all one to shy away from it. What I did realize is that in my career pursuits, work / life balance is probably highest on my priority list. In short, i'm not interested in investment banking and doing the much discussed 2 years of insane 70, 80, and 90 hour weeks for great exit opportunities. Money is obviously a priority, but it is not as high on my list as the ability to work from home or have a stable and healthy work life balance. 

Among the many hobbies i have,I love to travel. My ideal job, it would be something that I can work almost completely remotely from that allows me to only need an internet connection. Basically, a lack of a required geographic location. Im open to all and any industries or job positions that are likely to support that type of ability to work remotely. What are some good industries or job positions to look for that would have a high likelihood of completely remote work in the finance industry? 

Im not looking for a miracle, im a very reasonable person and dont have any unrealistic expectations. Before i get shit on, Im not looking for a job with a starting salary of 200k+ with 30 hours a week of super easy work and complete remote abilities etc., i know thats unrealistic. Just looking for suggestions of starting places in industries or roles that would lead in the remote work direction. Starting to look at internships and wanting to have a good compass on what to look into and what to avoid. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

Looking for suggestions on industries and roles in finance that offer, or are more likely to offer completely remote work and a good work life balance.

In 2018 I started a job as a Desktop Support Tech for a small consulting firm doing jack of all trades work. I was a month into my first semester of college IT Networking classes when I got the first job and was working on stuff I probably shouldn't have been doing that early in my IT career. May of last year I started a Network Infrastructure internship at a regional government agency where I learned a lot and gained some pretty decent hands on experience for an intern. I was there till Decemeber 2019, and while there I also obtained my CCNA. I decided not to extend my internship another semester and look for a full time job thinking with my experience (not that much), certification, and also the letters of recommendation I got from supervisors and senior level coworkers where they spoke very highly about me wouldn't be so hard, but man was I wrong. 

I've had so many good sounding leads go cold, and it's starting to make me lose motivation and make me feel really unconfident about my skills which was super high not to long ago. This last interview really kind of made it the worst. I applied for a entry level NOC Technican role the other week, I seemed like a really good fit judging by the posting, didn't say anything about experience, but the duties sounded like something perfect for me. I got a call back last week and had the initial phone screen which went great, they scheduled an in person interview yesterday for me to come in this morning. Interview went great, so an hour after the in person interview, I had a conference call set up the same day with two managers which was supposed to be the third and final interview. Everything was going great until the second round of technical questions. I'm a very anxious person especially when getting put on the spot which I need to work on. They were asking me a lot of questions about Microsoft Server, AD, some routing questions, etc., a lot of questions which didn't really quite seem to fit the posting. I answered questions when I could, and told them honestly about stuff I wasn't sure about, which they appreciated and said ""no don't worry, thanks for being honest..."" After the interview I kind of beat myself up over the technical aspect, but everything else so far had gone great so I tried not to think about it to much. Well 30 minutes after that final interview, I got a email saying that I wasn't the best fit and lacked the technical background. This really killed my confidence, I was feeling so good about everything leading up to this. Am I maybe being a little to overconfident? Should I lower my standards? Everyone I've talked to at my past IT experiences have told me not to sell myself short, thay I have a good work ethic, hard worker, willing to learn, etc. So I've stuck to that but it's seeming to not be working out for me.

Sorry to rant, it's just been a stressful couple months trying to find a job, and today really got me. Wish I would've stayed at my internship at this point, because now I'm miserable at my job, unlike at my internship where I was so excited to go in and see what was on the agenda for the day. Thanks guys!"

evvxuu,1,2020-01-29,Sample interview problem discussion,wellzey,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/evvxuu/sample_interview_problem_discussion/,"Hi. The below code is part of a sample problem to help with preparing to apply to internships as a part of the co-op program at my university. I'm still early in my learning, but I want to begin to approach and solve problems like this.

This is my first post here so I hope I'm formatting things properly.

The goal is to find any bugs and provide thoughts or comments on the implementation of the code.

How should I work through something like this?

My initial thoughts are:

* I'm most familiar with c++ but there are some syntax differences that make me think it's not c++ but it's close.
* obviously we are missing other functions/data types used by this function, but I think that's the point since we should be able to infer how it works
* I'm not familiar with the function parameters specifically the ""out"" outputs? I haven't seen this before likely a language difference if it were c++ the outputs would be reference parameters i think
* I think a dynamic array of size 2 is being initialized in line 17. I'm not sure the syntax is correct because I'm not sure the DateTime\[\] beginning the line should be there.
   * but it appears DateTime is a function in line 20
* line 18 I'm wondering if "".Length"" should be the size of the array or if this is the length of the month? I'm not sure what .Length refers to.
* line 20 uses the function DateTime to return a string into the array monthStart
* line 23 it appears there are 3 functions one for UTC timezone one for local and one that compares the two to get the offset but I'm not familiar with the syntax
* then in line 26 and 27 we are finalizing the outputs but adjusting them for the offset
* I'm not sure if I have thoughts on the implementation, I wonder if getting the offset earlier would improve efficiency

* **Current Essay Ideas:** Developing how to share my voice amidst severe diagnosed social anxiety and what it has taught me, and how Cornell's unique take on Communication could help me with that. Also, a lot of kids here are really solely focused on stats and resume boosters, not actual learning/passion, fortunately I've already found mine so I kinda feel out of place... not very developed ideas clearly but I'm planning on working on them more once midterm szn is over
* Edit: **LOR's:**
   * History Prof: Yale undergrad + Stanford grad alum, pretty cool prof
   * Boss at Rec, have a good relationship
   * Band member (UCLA Alum)

Overall, I haven't really been challenged by courses here. I barely go to class and basically just play the system which I hate. I want to learn things that are actually interesting to me and be surrounded by people that feel the same. Also marketing opportunities are really limited here, I literally had to cold call for one of them; I feel like I've reached a ceiling for it. I believe Cornell could really enhance my college experience but I know transferring is always a crapshoot. Any advice you could offer is greatly appreciated, thanks!"
evx7xk,3,2020-01-29,3+ years unemployed Digital Media major/Journalism &amp; Professional Writing minor. Can't even find unpaid internships.,TomTheJester,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/evx7xk/3_years_unemployed_digital_media_majorjournalism/,"As the title suggests, I am now entering my fourth and hopefully final year of unemployment since graduation. I currently do work a casual job at a local cinema, and have come VERY close to three different full-time job positions (lost to just one candidate in all three occasions).

On the side I create film content that has premiered at festivals and produced many contacts, but ultimately none of them have led anywhere.

After another run of about 10 rejected applications in the last batch, numerous resume updates, and otherwise complete radio silence in my job search, I'm starting to lose hope. Graduates who studied the exact same degree as myself, have left university immediately into positions, even the years behind me, and none of my other friends in my degree seemed to have the trouble I do.

Recently I even began reaching out to companies to offer myself as an intern, and those have been met with either complete silence or ""no's"", suggesting I can't even work for free.

I feel lost, stuck and increasingly useless as my very relevant and practical skills, seem to be going to complete waste and being overlooked.

How do I project myself more into employer's radars? How do I stand out?"
evy087,10,2020-01-29,Do colleges check social media?,theadmissionsangle,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/evy087/do_colleges_check_social_media/,"For the first time, students who have grown up with social media from a  young age are applying to colleges. This means that there is the potential for years of embarrassing data to be dug up and exploited  right? The short answer: Not necessarily‚Ä¶ but maybe.

But before getting into the details of why you should check your social media accounts or how you can prevent any future issues, make sure you're taking care of other aspects of your apps, like LOCIs, extra letters or recommendation, or waitlist strategies. You can read my previous post about things to work on while waiting for admissions results [here](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2020/01/02/college-applications-are-done-now-what/).

## Why would colleges check social media?

According to [a survey by Kaplan](https://www.kaptest.com/blog/press/2018/11/27/kaplan-test-prep-survey-social-media-checks-by-college-admissions-officers-decline-due-to-savvier-applicants-and-shifting-attitudes-2/),  in 2015 up to 40% of college admissions officers admitted to checking a  student‚Äôs social media at some point during the admissions process. In  2018, that number was actually down to 25%, in part because colleges  were not turning up much useful information on existing profiles.  However, this doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre in the clear.

According to the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers‚Äô [2017 survey](https://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/research-docs/social-media-monitoring-and-the-admissions-process---july-60-second-survey.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=4dd22026_4), 11% of respondents ‚Äúdenied admission based on social media content‚Äù and another 7% rescinded offers for the same reason.

As you know,  colleges care a lot about test scores and grades, but that is only a  baseline for deciding who to admit. Colleges look for students who will  be a strong member of the community and who uphold high standards of  character. And social media can say a lot about that character. Colleges  will check your social media to make sure that you don‚Äôt say or do  anything glaringly inappropriate. They may be looking for things like  bad language, name calling, or insensitive posts that appear sexist,  racist, homophobic, or vulgar. But more often than not, inappropriate  behavior is drawn to admissions officers‚Äô attention by outside sources.¬†

In  the past, there have been examples of students admitted to top colleges  like Harvard, who then had their admissions rescinded for such  behavior. In 2010, [Harvard rescinded admission](https://apnews.com/34ded9db81ab446ca4717c3544ab197b)  to ten incoming freshman after discovering sexist comments in a  Facebook group. Since then, most students have been clever enough to put  their social media settings on private, but even so, may not be fully  protected.

In 2019, Harvard determined that even screenshots of  private conversations can be used to deny or rescind an admission on the  basis of character, as in the case of Kyle Kashuv, a Parkland shooting  survivor whose admission was revoked after anti-Semitic remarks were  brought to the attention of Harvard admissions. Although his comments  were made before the age of sixteen and were in the context of a private  conversation, Harvard still opted to disassociate themselves.¬†¬†

## How can I protect myself?

When it  comes to social media or technology in general, remember that everything  is public and everything is permanent. It is a good practice not to put  photos on the internet that depict you in compromising positions and  not to use words that you would be ashamed for your mother to read.  However, it can also be a good idea to make sure all of your settings  are private, and even consider using a pseudonym.¬†

Another good  piece of advice is to not assume that everyone shares your sense of  humor, and that is a lesson that transcends the admissions experience.  In 2018, [a woman took to Twitte](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-woman-lost-a-nasa-scholarship-after-getting-into-twitter-beef-with-a-member-of-nasa-s-space-council)r  to announce that she was offered an internship with NASA, but did so in  foul language. NASA ended up revoking her internship and the gaffe made  international headlines.

Before you post something of  questionable taste, consider if it‚Äôs worth losing your dream college or  your dream job over. Even if a college doesn‚Äôt check your profiles, it‚Äôs still a good practice."

I don't have a T-10 or bust mentality but I want to go to a school that will provide me with a good education and opportunities as I prepare to apply to med school. 

&amp;#x200B;

STUDENT INFORMATION

School: Competitive school in Southern California

\*\*Grades/test scores\*\*:

GPA: 3.9/4.0 unweighted - One B in Calculus BC sophomore year. I made up for it with a solid A second semester and a 5 on the AP test. My first semester in 10th grade was a bit rocky with several A minuses and the one B in AP Calc BC but going from there, I had very solid grades with A's and A pluses

SAT: 1580  
ACT: 35  
SAT II Math 2 - 790  
SAT II Biology - 800

\*\*AP Classes\*\*: I have consistently taken the most rigorous courses available to me (our school is pretty weak when it comes to AP course selection). My AP classes and scores are: AP Biology (5), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Chemistry (5), AP Physics 1 (4), AP US History (5), AP English Lang (5), AP Government (TBD), AP English 4 (TBD), AP Statistics (5), AP Physics 2 (TBD)

\*\*Extracurriculars\*\*: I have good ones that mesh well with my career goal of med school and neuroscience. I also have some others that will stand out from other premed kids.

\- Leading member and captain of our school's high powered rocketry team - we compete in Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC), and placed 16th in the nation at Washington DC last year. We have also been invited to Huntsville Alabama by NASA to participate in the Student Launch Initiative to launch a huge rocket with an experimental payload. It's normally for college students but we are a pretty accomplished team netting about 20k in scholarships from Boeing, Aerovironment, Aerojet Rocketdyne, etc.

\- Over the summer - I did the Research Mentorship Program (RMP) at UCSB. I did neuroscience research one on one with a postdoc and got a lot from the experience.

\- The next summer I did RISE at Boston University. It's another month-plus long program in computational neurobiology. Did research and presented it. I also may be accepted to SIMR at stanford which is a cost free research internship for medicine over the summer and you actually get a stipend for working there.

\- Academic Decathlon Captain winning several medals over the years.

\- I've worked at Kumon all my years in high school. In addition to Kumon tutoring I tutor on the side at school.

\- I finished Calculus BC in 10th grade and went on to take classes at community college like multivariable and diffeq's

\- UCLA Math Circle, a pretty selective program where you attend math seminars and learn about higher math topics with graduate student mentors.

\- I have been teaching high level math classes at my local Math Circle for a couple years now.

\- I've shown a lot of personality in my essays, and I love skiing with my family in my free time. I play Tabla, an eastern percussion instrument and as an Afghan American it is a way for me to express my culture and heritage.

\- I have worked at a free clinic in my area providing free medical care to disadvantaged people and have learned a lot about the struggles people face to obtain quality medical care through my 3 years at the program. I have spent 4 hours every week throughout my 3 years working here and it has made a huge impact on me personally.

\- Finally, I think I will be able to seal the deal with neuroscience research with a professor from Caltech that I know personally. However it may not work out so just like the SIMR please judge me without this additional experience and with it too.

\*\*Recommendations\*\*: I have recommendations from my AP Biology teacher, AP English lang teacher, and superintendent. My Superintendent who is the organizer of our Rocketry team. He and I are very close and his letter is very meaningful as are the other previous teachers who I am also favorites of.

&amp;#x200B;

SCHOOL PREFERENCES

Location: I don't really mind where I go to school but I guess my preference if I had to choose would be close to home in California which is where I am from.

Size: I think I'd like a smaller school like Caltech but am sure I'd also in large schools like UCLA

&amp;#x200B;

I hope someone can give me an idea of schools that would be a good fit for me in the reach, match, and safety range."
evzf1e,3,2020-01-29,What's the competitive weight of undergrad internships? How do I see what colleges offer good programs for internships?,lilstrawberry0298,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/evzf1e/whats_the_competitive_weight_of_undergrad/,"Hi all! I'm currently trying to line myself up college in fall after taking a leap year and a half to sort out some mental issues and let my familial situation temper. I'm aiming to work and walk into college with $8000 in savings, and with my family's EFC of 0, go crazy applying for grants and scolarships. I'm not 100% certain what job I want yet, but I know I want to program. I've done it since I was 10 and having recently challenged myself to try to take on more complicated applications, I know it's my calling.

Two things hold me back. One thing pushes me forward.

GPA of 1.8. Honestly thought I was gonna off myself in high school putting up with so much mistreatment/borderline abuse and didn't try, but I tested exceedingly well. I've sorted all of this out, rebuilt my work ethic, and the college experience gives me a clean environment so I can prove what I'm worth! The other concern I have is living in a very rural area. I'm about two hours away from Kansas City, I'm not so certain I live in a booming tech center. I have very good friends, almost family, in Louisiana, and I'd like to get closer to that area, but I can hold off on it a while. I imagine if I intern while in college competitively, I'd have a GREAT shot at getting closer to them. Of course, they may be other places when the time comes, so, not set in stone - but looking for it! But due to all this, I worry my prospects may be limited. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and that's a boon, so how would I find out? How would I be able to see what internships or job fairs the colleges I'm looking at would offer? 

What pushes me forward is, hopefully, a portfolio. I'm starting work on a program for small business and e-commerce (Think Etsy, Shopify, physical mom and pop stores) that does bookeeping, inventory, workflows, resource management, tracking income, sales, profit, spread over items/item categories whilist tracking dates and amount sold (the idea is if someone wanted to grow, they could look at the margins for their various items easily and see how well they sold). This is just the *first* thing I want to build, and I can probably launch it before I enroll. If not, I'll be close. I have other projects in mind, and I really hope that all of this carries me. I also have excellent performance in game dev and programming classes I took in high school, and my be able to call back my old school and get a reference if I need it. As a side, my year plus of retail experience gave me some great people skills, and if I land an interview, I'd argue I have a leg up on my competition in that scope.

Back to the main question - I'm essentially looking at two local colleges. One's a community college, and one's a traditional, four year, university. I may not get into the latter with my GPA, but I'm applying and starting a conversation anyways. The cc is a guaranteed hit. The traditional university has higher tuition, but depending on my granting and scholarshipping, my loan take-out could rapidly become minimal or even null, especially if I can intern or work while enrolled. If I can verify that the university will give me better internship opportunities by a sizable margin, or I won't get any internships as an underclassman, I'll save myself the loans - unless there's other factors I should consider.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Trying to balance tuition costs, potential scholarships and grants, with finding a college path that's useful for a career in computer science/programming!"

I have taken multiple computer science classes. I have very good excel skills (like knowing index match instead of using vlookup) but don‚Äôt know how to make financial models.  I learned python and java in computer science I/II. Currently I am learning how to make IOS apps in swift.  I am also learning basic machine learning for economics in R this semester. 2 years ago I interned as a performance analyst intern (performance is basically risk) for a large asset management company. Last summer I interned as a business analytics intern at a biotech company. I have already accepted a position as a tax consultant at a big four, despite only taking one class in the business school. I have no intention of becoming a CPA. Because of this, I know I can only last 2-3 years max in the big four. I am only graduating with 120 credits whereas you need 150 credits to become a CPA.  Therefore, I would have to spend a year getting my masters in tax just to be able to be eligible pass the CPA exams. This seems unrealistic considering I will be working 50-80 hours a week. Also, it seems like a useless degree that considering that the big four only care about the CPA and nobody outside of tax cares about a master in tax. I can‚Äôt justify the cost and time considering I don‚Äôt have a passion for tax and only accepted the job because it was a good starting salary with a good reputation. I had barely started my application process with other company‚Äôs so I accepted. I figured I will at least get good training while I figure out what I wanna do. I could also make connections with some of my clients who will mostly be in financial services. After spending all this time grinding through upper level math classes, I feel like I should at least do something relatively fun or interesting with it. I could shoot for investment banking but I‚Äôve never taken finance courses, and it‚Äôs no guarantee I‚Äôll like it. I could maybe see myself working on the financial planning side of biotech but I have no experience. I liked being at a biotech company that had a groundbreaking drug that helped people, but im not going to try to get a PhD in biochemistry or anything like that. I was always much better at math than science but think it‚Äôs cool/interesting. I don‚Äôt think I have nearly enough of a science background to get into engineering. I‚Äôm into sports so any job in that industry could be interesting but i would have to accept much less pay if I can even crack into it. I know the basics of a lot of programming languages but don‚Äôt think I want to become a full time software developer. I‚Äôm good at coding but I‚Äôm not the type of person who lives to code. There‚Äôs also no way I want to switch to something like audit in the big 4. I also considered being an actuary for a long time and studied for the first exam but decided I was not interested in it. I used to do a little construction and dont want to be a project manager. I have a lot of skills, can pick things up very fast, and have a great work ethic. I know i will give it my all no matter where I am, but as the reality of working 60-80 hours is hitting me, I am realizing I would much rather work that hard towards something I actually care about. I think i could be pretty good at tax because I like navigating complicated systems and problem solving. I could potentially see myself being self-employed in the future, or at least find ways to generate passive income. I don‚Äôt mind grinding long weeks while I‚Äôm so young especially since I‚Äôm getting paid decently well. But I feel like other then the big four reputation this is a dead end job and I need to figure out an exit plan. I want to go all in on something but don‚Äôt know what. I know a lot of things I don‚Äôt want to do but can‚Äôt find anything I really do want to do."

So some background info:

I recently graduated from Stony Brook University with a BS in  Computer Information Systems and a specialization in Systems and network  administration.

I'm also enrolling in a certification program that trains you for 17  weeks in  order  to attain your  Cisco CCNA Cyber Ops Certification. The  institution is called Per Scholas and I've heard there a other programs  like this where they'll invest in people who prove they are qualified  to be accepted and trained and that the the program is free for those  with low income. This training program also helps the accepted  individuals professionally (resume, elevator pitches) and to network  with IT professionals and to also help you land decent entry level  positions like a cyber security analyst etc. It feels like this could  help me transition into a full time position. There's  also a chance for  the students who complete the program could get a paid internship with  Barclays after the program since they're one of the sponsors for the  program.

reference:

[https://perscholas.org/apply/cybersecurity#faqs](https://perscholas.org/apply/cybersecurity#faqs)

‚Äã

I've also been accepted into a cyber security Grad program at SUNY  Polytechnic Institute (18 month program in Utica) but the real issue  lies here. Because I come from a low income background I was able to get  financial aid to help with the undergrad, but I know grad school  doesn't. And the costs go even further if you have to move out closer to  this distant school. But it's been recommended to me and I've  personally read about this grad program and it seems quite reputable.  But there's a diversity scholarship that will cover the costs of tuition  and offer a stipend to live near and further grants awarded if you  dedicate yourself to additional responsibilities if you get it (of  course it's extremely competitive) and prior to getting into grad school  there are 2 courses they've required me to take at a local college  before they fully allow me to enroll but at this time no further  financial aid will be given unless its loans so there are further costs  to consider. So this path while seems to have a lot to gain has a lot of  financial risks. I don't think there are any CUNY grad programs that  offer a cyber security program unless I missed them (correct me if I've  missed any). The plan was that if I get the scholarship I would decide  to pursue this MS program. Otherwise I would try to make the best of the  certification program

One last part to the grad program is that the school offers the  entire program online. But I don't know how effective it is to take a  grad course online or if that it's worth considering.

Last questions:

So how necessary is grad school for a career in Cyber security?  Although my major leans in the field of network administration, there  are many concepts I've learned that are also needed in this career. So  the practical knowledge is what I value. And both the certification  course and grad program emphasize on physical/practical knowledge and  testing that will help make me qualified for a solid career. Is it fine  to build a career in NY, what are some other states you would recommend  looking into building a career whats a good salary to aim for?

I'm more interested in a technical career, I don't have an interest in managerial positions.

Last thoughts, I'm 22 so I'm trying to weigh my options so I can  properly plan my future so any thoughts, concerns, and recommendations  are appreciated. Thanks for reading."

For the first time in a few weeks, I'm crying. Not an overly dramatic sobbing cry, not an angry cry just... a quiet, painful, lonely crying.

So much has been going on the past few weeks.

My relationship of a year and 3 months is, well, probably going to end soon. And, I'm probably going to be the one to end it. I still love and care about them, but the relationship has just gone south and honestly I'd be fine with just being friends. Plus I just... don't think I feel the same way anymore. This was both our first relationship, and things just got so serious really quickly, it's almost just a bit too much to handle.

And I don't want to hurt their feelings but I know it needs to be this way. We're in a break and their in another state... hes not gonna like it but I have to. I can't be with someone who makes me feel anxious and who I feel uneasy around.

I know it isnt official, but I feel single again. I forgot how lonely it felt, and how badly I just wanted fo  cuddle someone.



And then, oh God, my dad. I'm not 100% sure what is going on with him. And I thought he was getting better but I guess I was wrong.

He gets in these moods where he just yells at everyone and is just cold and... scary. I'm scared of him, I don't know what he us going to do or say. He's mad a bout a lot of things right now but he is partially mad at me. Idk what I'm doing after school and he is furious. Nothing I do is ever good enough - not my grades, my past internships, I dont get into trouble, and it just isnt enough. I'm losing weight like he told me to. I'm dieting and exercising again, and it's been hard as hell and I hate my body but I'm doing it. And none of it is enough.

My mom keeps saying if I don't do what he wants then its gonna be hell for her and all of us. And I've finally realized how toxic that is to make it seem like it's my fault if he acts like that. I can't control if he gets all pissy and starts screaming? How dare you, make me feel like it's my fault. I've felt that way for years and still struggle with it. The next time she does it I'm telling her to stop."

A few weeks/months later, he lands a more attractive offer. Can/should he renege on his previous offer acceptance? How unethical is this? Is the intern likely to get in trouble/screwed by his former bank?"

I am yet do to my graduate internship and I have chosen London as the area where I want to do it. I am an EEA citizen as well, if that makes any difference.

I have about 1.5 years of experience in the industry as a front-end developer in a company in my area.

I have have worked with Vue.js, React but mainly Angular. I know Git (needless to say) and have used Docker and Docker swarm in the past. I have worked Agile with sprints, Kanban etc.

I have also written relatively simple backends with Node.js and deployed them on AWS.

With this limited info about me, how much do you think I can get from a grad internship in London? I would like to hear some estimates or range.

Thanks!"

I am currently a student in college going for a degree in Cybersecurity/information security and would love nothing more than to get an entry-level position or an internship in that field. However today I have an interview with a manufacturing place through a recruiting agency. I have worked a couple of manufacturing jobs while I've been in school to help pay for it. I am fairly positive they are going to offer me a job today, but I don't know if I should accept the job and get some more money to help pay for school, as I don't have a job currently. Or should I continue trying to apply for internships and entry-level positions because it's what I want to do?

I have applied to at least 20 internships and haven't heard back yet so it's been a very discouraging journey thus far."
ew5xs2,32,2020-01-30,We Clean up Scientific Mistakes - Final,RoVlo,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ew5xs2/we_clean_up_scientific_mistakes_final/,"[I screamed](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/evcmhz/we_clean_up_scientific_mistakes_part_2/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and cried for what felt like hours. The gas slowly ate away at my exposed flesh, and the pain it gave me was too much to bear. Not only was the gas already designed to deliver a slow and painful death, because it could only reach me through bits of torn armour, it could very well take hours and hours before I'd even come close to dying. Still though, there was little hope for me. Even I understood that. 

It wasn't that I didn't want Brooke to come rescue me as she might have heard my screams, but it kind of was. I wanted to live, of course, but I also knew that even if Brooke stormed to the rescue, it would probably end with two people dying instead of one. 

So I just lied there, crying in pain. In the few moments were my vision wasn't obscured by my own tears, I could see the creature was still standing on its one remaining leg in the distance, observing me. I was still surprised how quickly it had learned to use the canisters against me, and wondered whether it was still learning, even now. Or perhaps it got some kind of sick satisfaction out of my misery. I suppose it didn't matter.

Slowly but surely, I started to lose touch. The constant pain was growing to be too much for me to handle. I was practically begging for it to finish me off or at least knock me out, but naturally it didn't move.

I started slipped in and out of consciousness, lost track of time, and the pain became slowly more and more manageable because of it. 

I was about to close my eyes for good. At this point, death felt like a mercy to me. I leaned back against the wall, and closed my eyes, waiting for the inevitable to set me free.

If only it had done that.

The doors at the end of the hallway slammed upon, and the corridor was immediately flooded with dozens of lights. I immediately opened my eyes in shock, and tried looking down the hallway, only to be blinded by the lights. 

""Brooke? Zeriyah? Richards?"", I weakly muttered, thinking for a moment that my mates had finally come to save me. 

""There!"" I heard a distorted and metallic voice boom throughout the corridor. ""Hook it.""

""Yes sir"", an similar sounding voice replied.

Suddenly, a loud sound was heard and I could briefly see a dark spot coming towards us, blocking out a small part of the lights. The dark object suddenly struck the creature, impaling its chest. Even though it stayed silent, the force knocked it off its remaining foot causing it to fall to the ground.

""Hold it in place"", I heard the first voice say before a bunch of rapids footsteps could be heard coming down the hallway. I noticed the lights come closer to me and the creature, which was now trashing on the ground, a few meters in front of me. Some kind of hook with a wired attached was lodged in his torse, and the rock that had grown arround it had only ensured it was stuck there.

And then I saw them. Huge white sets of armour came running into view. I could only assume that there were humans underneath, but I wasn't one hundred percent certain at the time. They looked like walking tanks, and carried strange weapons and equipment.

Two of the soldiers held the creature down with incredible strength. The third placed his foot on top of its chest, and started aiming his weapon at it. I heard three shots. 

""Pin it against the bloody wall"", the third man said as he stepped off of the creature. The other two just nodded and lifted the thing into the air. It wasn't until then that I could see what they had done. The third soldier, supposedly their leader, had completely severed the remaining limbs from the creature's body. Now all that remained was a body coated with rocks, and a confused head on top of it.

Their leader now knelt down next to me, placing his hand on my shoulder. ""If you can hear me, boy, know this: you're going to be okay.""

I didn't completely understand the first part of his sentence at first, but I did when I tried to respond. It was like I had lost control over my own body and mind. I felt tears continuously rolling down my face and every time I tried to talk, I produced nothing but meaningless grunts and other noises.

He looked over his shoulder at his mates and shouted something about getting rid of the gas and securing my armour. I wasn't entirely sure what he meant anymore at that point, but it didn't matter either, because soon I lost consciousness.

***

I awoke in the foyer, where the bright lights coming through the taped off windows burned my eyes. My head felt heavy and the world seemed to spin around me. I tried to focus my vision as best as I could, causing my headache to grow worse. I knew these symptoms... I had them before once, but when?

I looked around the foyer, which had been turned into a small camp. A bunch of people dressed in white unknown armour walked around, hauling all kinds of equipment, ranging from normal weapons and lights to stuff I had never seen in my entire life.

They weren't the only ones there though. I saw someone crouched down, but she was dressed in black armour with a few red stripes.

Red stripes.

Then I remembered. Purge Red. My team, we had come here together for a mission. Were they alright? Had they suffered as much as I had? I frantically looked around the room, trying to recognise any of them.  Eventually I remembered who the girl was. It was Brooke! And she was talking to someone in similar armour who was sitting on a bench. He sure didn't look healthy. I could see red water all over his face.

No. Not water. Blood.

The man was covered in blood, and I knew him. It was Zeriyah. He looked terrible, but at least he lived. I was glad, because something inside me told me that he had been in quite a dangerous situation. I saw another man dressed in black tend to his wounds, but this one had silver stripes on his armour. Oh well, at least Zeriyah was in good hands.

I soon saw the commander, who was lying on some kind of bed with wheels. I feared for his life, but could see his chest rise ever so slowly. Or at least I thought I could. He hadn't died had he? A few images of a monster on top of him danced in front of my eyes. No, that wasn't possible.

I still missed one though. I knew I did. But who did I miss? I found Brooke, Zeriyah and the commander...

It hit me when I looked to my right. There he was, standing near the wall on his own. I let out a relieved sigh when I saw Richards was okay too. He didn't seem to be too beaten up, in fact, I don't think he had a splatter of blood on him at all.

One of the white armours with robotic voices knelt down next to me. It took my eyes a painfully long time to focus on them, but eventually I was able to see them clearly. They were holding a needle. 

""Here. Sorry for the delay, we lost a few among the way. This should help you get back to your senses pretty quick"", she told me. Even through the distorted and metallic voice I could still hear the slightest influence of a female voice. 

I didn't have the faintest idea what she meant though, but it became clear enough when she injected something into me. I was confused how they did that for a moment, but soon realised I wasn't wearing my armour anymore. 

I didn't know what they injected me with, but it worked rather quickly. The dull feeling in my mind faded away, and my thoughts started to come back to me. I remembered more and more. The mission, the creatures, the gas...

And then, as my full consciousness slowly returned to me, I was suddenly filled with a feeling of dread, although I didn't know why. I looked around the room, trying to find whatever it was that creeped me out, or to prove there was nothing to be scared about. Either one would work.

The woman who had injected the substance into me walked back towards me. She knelt down next to me and placed a hand on my shoulder.

""How are you feeling?"", she asked.

""Confused"", I replied, still slightly struggling to speak. ""But better after whatever it was you just gave me.""

She nodded her head in response. ""Good. Now, don't panic, but you were hurt pretty bad. Had to give you a few heavy batches of medicine, so don't be surprised if your head starts hurting like hell or if you cannot remember a thing or two. What I just gave you should prevent any of that from happening, but you never know for sure.""

""Thanks"", I nodded. Medicine. That made sense. It would explain why I had felt so miserable just moments ago, and it was probably also the reason for my feeling of doom. I sighed and leaned back against the wall. I was alive. Screw the mission, it was out of our hands now. My team was alive, that was what mattered.

I was still interested in what was happening though, so I started to try to actively understand what was going on, and overheard a conversation of two distorted voices near me.

""... probably in some kind of shock. He doesn't respond to anything, just stares into the distance and occasionally walks around.""

""Well, can you blame him? They're just a Purge team, and who knows what he has seen in those corridors.""

""That's true. I kind of feel bad for them. Say, do you think the locks will hold?""

""Yeah, of course. We've got this place secured. Just need to get the remaining Reds and Silvers healed up and out of here before we can start eradicating these things.""

""I heard they can't be killed though. That Red woman was muttering something about one roaming around without his head.""

""Eh, that was probably just her mind playing a trick on her in the darkness.""

""I don't know. I think I'm going to ask Five, he actually encountered one of those things when they tried to rescue one of the Reds.""

""Sure, whatever man. But if you ask me, it's just a bunch of nonsense.""

There it was again. The same feeling of dread. I'd felt it throughout their entire conversation, but I wasn't sure what exactly sparked my fear. It sure as shit weren't the drugs though, I was sure of that now.

Parts of the conversation still echoed in my head, but I didn't know why. For some reason, my mind kept repeating the sentence about shock, and someone staring into the distance. 

I looked over to my right. 

Fuck. No. No no no. That wasn't possible. It shouldn't have been possible. He shouldn't have been here.

I immediately stood up, pain shooting throughout my entire body in the process. I heard the medic behind me telling me to slow down, that I wasn't supposed to get up at all. I ignored her.

I wasn't supposed to get up, but some else wasn't supposed to *be* here at all.

I exhaled loudly, looking around for any kind of weapon. Luckily, there wasn't a shortage of them, and so I soon had a semi automatic pistol in my hand. It wouldn't do much, but I would do enough.

None of them were able to stop me in time. I raised the gun and managed pulled the trigger three times before the medic slammed it out of my hand.

The shots alerted every soldier present, and soon I had more than ten people aiming their guns at me, yelling for me to get on the ground. Still struggling to talk, I chose to remain silent, and instead dropped the gun and just pointed towards something behind him. Towards the man I had shot.

Richards' blood coated the wall behind him, but he was still standing. His emotionless eyes stared straight back at me, and I knew then that I had made the right choice as the memories of my old friend lying on that disgusting pile of bodies washed over me.

A couple of soldiers had come to his aid, surprised to see him still standing. It didn't take long for them to back away though. More and more soldiers turned around, shifting their attention from me to Richards.

And each and every one that turned around immediately knew what I had somehow known all along.

The three holes in his head had already been filled with brown rock by the time the soldiers had arrived to check on him. It didn't take long before every single gun in the room was aimed directly at his head. It was the only choice, because Richards, or whatever it was, was still wearing armour. Still though, I wondered what good it would do.

""Sir?"", I heard one ask.

It took a little while before he received a response. It seemed like the leader was weighing his options. After all, Richards didn't seem to be aggressive at the moment. He reminded me of the ones we had encountered in the sewers, unaware and completely docile.

And then it smiled. 

I don't know why, but the mere sight of it instantly made shivers run down my spine, and I knew I wasn't alone. Soldiers started shaking, and a few started looking over their shoulder without any reason. 

The leader was growing uncomfortable too. I could sense it.

""Iudicium-Three, hook this stupid a-""

The leader's command was cut off by loud banging. I looked over towards the corridors and saw that the doors had been sealed off with heavy security locks. Nevertheless, that was definitely the place the banging came from. Things were slamming itself against both doors, making them budge with every impact. I looked back at Richards, but he still stood there, smiling just a little wider.

While most soldiers were preparing for battle or pinning Richards against the wall, a few came towards us, the remainders of Purge Red and Silver. They'd been ordered to get us out of there, for which I'm still grateful. There was nothing more we could've done, except die there.

They dragged all of us down the steps, back into the sewers, and towards freedom. Or, our version of freedom anyway. I know it's not a glorious end of our mission, but life doesn't always work that way. I was glad I didn't have to go back into those nightmarish corridors, and that I would never have to see those bodies again. It wasn't my problem anymore. I do wonder just exactly who those men were though, and whether they succeeded to carry out our mission or not. 

But, I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

After we were rescued, we were brought into an abandoned building. We met up with a couple of others who worked for our organisation, or whatever it is, and were told what to expect. Strangely enough though, every form of communication we had was either through radio, or thick glass.

No-one knew of our existence when I was part of Purge Red, and that was because of one clear rule. Anyone that ever got into contact with us either joined our ranks, or died. Funnily enough, that is also how I originally ended up in this mess.

Naturally, the same rule, albeit a bit stricter, applied to the soldiers dressed in white. We had seen them, so now we had a choice. We could either join them, or we would be given one last meal of our choice.

I chose to keep my life. I had already been in countless situations that had scarred me forever, had already seen things I could never unsee. I supposed it didn't really matter whether I wore black or white while I did it.

First though, before we could get started with our training, we needed to heal. We said our goodbyes to one another, knowing full well that we might never see each other again. Then we were each send off to a different place to recover. 

Personally, I'm pretty sure I've been sent to Italy, although I'm not entirely sure. I was sent to live in a large villa in the middle of nowhere. I was all alone here, and deliveries where made either by a plane or by a helicopter. A large fence surrounded the massive property, so I didn't have any chance of getting out of there.

I still don't have any, to be honest.

Well. I'm at the end of my story. I suppose there's no reason to delay the inevitable anymore. After all, we all have to face the truth eventually. 

And the truth is that I didn't share this because it was a horrific, terrible or terrifying experience. Sure, it was exactly that, but I have had plenty of similar encounters over the past few years.

No, the reason that I chose to share this is something else entirely. I just wanted to apologize to the family members of the people I've killed over the years while I still can. Some of them deserved it, but some were just an intern in the wrong place at the wrong time. I really am sorry. 

Now, it's time I accepted my fate.

Life was good here, and my recovery went well, if a little slow. I only had to take two pills every day, and change the bandages around my torso every morning. For the rest of the day, I was free to do whatever I pleased inside the mansion.

A couple of days ago, I stood up at around 10 in the morning, and walked downstairs to make a sandwich. When I walked into the kitchen, I realised I wasn't really hungry at all, so I decided to change my bandages first. I headed into the bathroom, grabbed some tape and fresh bandages, and took off my shirt. 

I placed my hand on top of the bandaged wound, curious to see if touching it would hurt a little less than it did yesterday. It had become a little habit of mine. 

This time though, when I placed my hand on my wounds, I felt nothing. There was no pain at all. At first I was both surprised and immensely relieved at the quick recovery, but that soon changed when I realised how... hard my wound felt. Through the bandages, it felt like I was touching something completely solid underneath instead of the skin and flesh that should've been there.

I quickly took off the old bandages, and immediately dropped them when I looked into the mirror. 

My wounds had healed completely, but they hadn't been replaced by healthy flesh and skin.

No, instead, my old wounds were filled with those same familiar brown rocks."

I‚Äôm currently a senior with a non-CS (but still STEM) major that started taking computer science classes as a junior in college, found it interesting, and now I‚Äôm pursuing the minor. I still have a handful of classes left after this semester but there‚Äôs a chance I won‚Äôt be able to get into the ones I need next semester since I don‚Äôt have priority enrollment over declared CS majors or undeclared underclassmen that also need these classes (especially since I‚Äôm already declared). I‚Äôm currently looking into what me or my advisors can do to ensure my spot in these classes, but at the moment I‚Äôd like to know what my chances are if I don‚Äôt get the classes, meaning I can‚Äôt get the minor before graduating. I can‚Äôt take summer classes either because I will be interning at a tech company located outside of my college town.

TLDR; might not get into classes to finish CS minor before graduating in Fall 2020; I have my first CS internship this summer as a full stack SWE intern.

How does having a minor + experience help with your chances at getting a full time as a new grad, versus just having experience?"

Thought I was going to go back to finish school but never managed to save up enough to be financially comfortable with it, and by now I'm not sure it's even worth it. I have 6 years of experience doing IT work, started with basic help desk and I'm not far off from that now, working as a Tier 2 support agent supporting Windows, Android and iOS devices. Most of my experience is with Windows hardware and software support.

I don't have any certifications and I've been researching the available ones to see what I'd be best off pursuing. I think I'd rather skip the fundamental CompTIA certs and go for something more serious / specialized, since I'm already comfortable with most of the basic stuff and have the experience to prove it. Eventually I'd like to get into Cloud since that's where the demand seems to be moving, but I think going straight from basic support to that might be a bit of a leap, so I'm thinking I should probably try to move towards something like Systems Administration next. Maybe do something like get my MCSA (Windows Server 2016?), then MCSE after that and start working on getting Cloud certified next. Likely with Google or AWS instead of Azure so that there's some diversity with my certifications instead of putting everything in the Microsoft camp.

I'm not really sure if this is the best approach though, so I could use advice. What would you pursue next in my shoes?"

I have insomnia but i work as an intern at a psych ward, I just turned 21 and I work from 6am to 3pm everyday except Sunday. I'm usually pretty out of it, between all my immediate family dealing with mental health, the mental health of my friends and my girlfriend sometimes too.

Ok so heres what's been pissing me off. I feel alienated from a group of friends because they invited a friend who just flirts with my girlfriend even though we intentionally introduced ourselves to everyone has boyfriend and girlfriend in voice to avoid any altercation because we just want to play some games. He continues, he's honestly very creepy my girlfriend completely ignored him and I think to myself ""this shit happens ler her deal with him and just focus on having a good time"" I give him a pity laugh most of the jokes he pops out but I dont say anything, next day he jokingly says ""i love you."" And literally hyper focuses everything to be sexual when hes around, as a psyche major i can see him attempting to manipulate the conversation to get to certain points. I leave the voice because I want my girlfriend to have HER FRIENDS even though I've known them longer. I poke fun at him because in a little ""about me"" he was the only one with anything sexual despite supposedly having a girlfriend. (Word for word I said ""Careful ladies I'm bdsm oriented."" Which is what he typed out.

 I learn that he flirted again on the second day, and politely in group chat ask him to please stop flirting with her, he makes all these excuses, I leave it alone, and after 2 1/2 hours thier friend comes back in igniting the conversation again trying to ""end it"". I had them on my server previously and accidentally forgot to change thier roles so they saw me venting about how this snake literally doesnt respect our relationship, yet claims he does when I call him out on it. So my venting got called ""toxic masculinity"" when I literally pointed out his hypocrisy. I even apologized for mocking his ""BDSM oriented lifestyle."" Because apparently that pissed him off, even though I said it to his face so he talked shit behind my back and when I left my girlfriend in there a second time the conversation was about everything that transpired, and she told them about how in the past i snapped at everyone that tried to be her friend, even though I literally ask if she wants to join them (I have insecurities about her making new friends because she Is desperate for friends, she hasn't had many, and I think that's fine but people have things that matter to them no matter what, I dont scare them off I literally tell her when I get suspect, I communicate because it's a big issue, and I want her to see that I really do want her to be happy and to have friends. Many of her friends I have conversations with despite my feelings, trying to just be cool and know what makes them laugh) So it hurt a lot that she shared that about me. It honestly shattered my trust but I'm still trying because I get it, I just think I handle it as well as I can for my first relationship, so it was really soul crushing. 

Anyway I told him I wont be talking to him after I apologize and I havent, he attempts to reconcile but this guy is a snake, he compared her to his ""number 1 waifu"" and brought up yet another conversation topic like a month after that that we've already been too with her ""how everyone got thier names."" Where he called her his waifu because her name is ""my name""s Waifu because I made a joke she liked when we were alone. I learn this after not being able to sleep because I know my girlfriend goes in there to play games cause our main chat doesnt do anything anymore, and hes been getting more and more ballsy actually going in there and he talks to her ALOT. 

So after not being able to get sleep for days s usual I wake up to him calling her his number 1 waifu, I dont do anything. After a while I tell her in front of everyone. ""I told you other people thought you were amazing girl."" But I cant let go of being angry that he would rate her in front of me basically on top of the fact i get very uneasy when I'm about to go to sleep, someone's always bothering me or something bad happens when I do. So she gushes about a show hes also into they talk briefly and he calls her his #1 waifu as I explained earlier, issue with this is that we've had conversations about him since this affects our other friendships but she says she doesnt like him and says she was being nice to him to avoid conflict? So which is it? I just want some consistency so I'm not looking over my fucking shoulder. His friends aka the people who invited him there protect him at every turn ""oh that's just who he is."" I cant say anything because apparently I'm the villain even though I'm ignoring him and hes doing the exact thing I asked him not to, so all responsibility falls to my girlfriend and that doesnt sit right with me because of how she's handling it"

So in other words, I will have completed my first year of CS college education, which many Software Development internships are seeking.

I of course want to apply to these positions but of course they require some form of resume. I'm not too sure where to begin with this process, especially since it has only been my first year and I don't really have too many impressive projects to speak of. But I have completed a Programming 1 course in which we learned programming essentials in C++ and I am currently in Programming 2 which continues teaching programming concepts in Java. I have also taken Calculus 1 and Linux Fundamentals. I am also currently in Calc 2.

I suppose my first question is the following:

What can I do to make a resume that is actually good for the experience level that I have? For instance, I'm not even sure if in my case, detailing projects that I've done would even be part of the question or not because the programs I've coded have pretty much been various Console Applications in C++. Specifically, our final project in Programming 1 was to create a console application that simulated a movie theatre ticket purchasing application where the user could do the following:

\-View available seats (this would print a large grid composed of '#' for available seats and '\*' for purchased seats)

\-View or edit ticket prices (this would read/write values from a .txt file that gets opened (or created, if nonexistent) at the beginning of the program)

\-Purchase Ticket(s) (allows the user to select which row and seat they wish for each ticket they purchase, this will also change the character of the seat on the seating chart from '#' to '\*' upon confirmation)

And yeah. This is probably my most formal project I can boast. It's something like 300 lines of code.

Is it possibly too early for me to build a resume? Should I wait until I'm further along in Programming 2 to build my resume? I only ask if this is the case because I just want to try to get ahead in the employment process, but at the same time a lot of these places that are hiring in the Summer want early applicants, so I guess I'm just not really sure what to do.

I've done some research into resume building, but I just want to also explain my specific situation to someone just for some, I don't know, personal insight? So that I guess is my reason for posting.

Some things I just want to throw out there that might be relevant to my situation

\-I have an Associate's Degree in music, I was going to go for a Bachelor's but towards the end of earning my AS i realized I don't really want to make a career out of music, but instead software development. So i've returned to the same community college to earn my CS degree. This also means I've already taken a lot of non-major courses and electives (English, various liberal arts courses, science courses, etc) so the only classes I need are computer science related.

\-There is an internship fair coming up in two weeks at my school (I can't find which specific companies are going, but I've been told there would probably be some CS recruiters of some kind) and it is advised we bring resumes. So, if possible, I'd like to get on that.

Thanks in advance for any helpful words."

Great company like the people but don‚Äôt like the location where they are headquartered at.

Offer B is with a company in my dream city with a good reputation.

I want to ask the firm I am currently at (1) to return to clerk until results are released, after the exam, and (2) to stay on as an attorney if I pass. It is standard to stop working when studying for and taking the bar. I think for the purposes of this question, it is best addressed as though I was an intern looking for a full time job. 

The partners I work for (who want me stay), suggested waiting until March to discuss it with the managing partners (i.e. the people with the power to hire and fire). 

Here is my current plan of attack, any advice and suggestions always appreciated:

1. Email requesting to discuss the bar exam and post-exam
2. Enter meeting, thank managing partner for taking the time to meet with me
3. Explain how much I have enjoyed working at the firm
4. Explain that I am in the last year and will be taking the bar exam that summer
5. Request to continue as a clerk following the exam while waiting for results, and to become an attorney with the firm once I hear if I have passed in November (cut to the chase)
6. Explain that I have always been very busy
   1. Who I have done work for
   2. What I have done for each person
   3. On average how much work I have
7. Show that I have had extremely positive feedback
8. State that I believe that I can and will be able to heavily contribute to the firm, if kept on.
9. Ask if there is anything I can do to help them make this decision

How does that sound? I want to show how much I want to stay, how much work there is, therefore showing they have the work for another associate, and how much people like the work I do. The other partners I work with are also planning gathering together to give positive reviews of me leading to the meeting.

Any suggestions?"

ewduhh,1,2020-01-30,Are 7 weeks of interim experience as the head of a tech department worth the trouble?,leclair63,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ewduhh/are_7_weeks_of_interim_experience_as_the_head_of/,"A TL;DR of the situation: Interned at a school district for a year and a half. The head of the department left for a new job. I take over as the interim head of the department. I applied, interviewed and came in 2nd place for the job. The person I lost out to is forced to turn down the job, school turns around and offer the job to someone that didn't even interview for the job. They need me to stay on as the interim for at least another month. Is the very brief amount of experience as a department head worth sticking around for?

**Full context**

Summer of 2018 I took on an internship at my old high school as a field experience course for my Network Administration degree. Once the semester was over I decided to stick around as an unpaid intern as a favor for my friend who was a team of one for the entire school district(Small district but still a pretty tall order). 

Fast forward to just after New Years my buddy is offered a job too good to pass up and puts in his two weeks, he was to be done by the 20th of January. The next day his position was posted and I applied for it. Skip forward to his last day, the superintendent finally realizes that he's not going to have anybody running any of the IT for at least 3 weeks until they figure out who the new District IT Coordinator would be. My friend suggests he hire me on as the interim and the super asks me to stick around. Trying to make a good impression I agree to a very friendly temporary rate of $14/hr to cover the next 3 weeks figuring they'd probably back pay me if hired on permanently. 

Interviews happen a few days later. In a blatant display of nepotism, they offered the job on the spot to a teacher that had applied for the job despite having no qualifications or relevant experience. Now in an even bigger pinch, the superintendent breaks the news to me after buttering me up about how well I interviewed and I made the decision hard and following it up with asking me if I would be willing to stay on as the interim through the end of the school year(beginning of June). I knew it was coming beforehand thanks to outrage allowing word to spread quickly and I had already planned out what I was going to say. I tell him I can't stay on for 4 months at $14/hr on top of my full-time overnight job and full-time college schedule(in my final semester) and tell him they need to pay me a lot better if they wanted me to stay on. He asks me to throw out a number and I request the hourly equivalent of the previous coordinator's salary(about $28/hr) since I was going to be doing his job for the next 4 months. He balked at my number and told me he was going to go talk to the payroll manager and bring me a number they can work with. He comes back with $20/hr and I begrudgingly accepted as I don't have a ton of experience in the field outside of my internship and didn't want to leave the teachers and students hanging. 

Well for reasons I really don't understand myself the teacher they offered the position to was forced to turn the job down and my hopes of getting the job suddenly skyrocketed. That lasted about 3 days when today I catch wind that they had offered the job to someone who had applied 24 hours ago and never even formally interviewed for the position(They worked with the Super in a different school district a few years ago). This time around the person they chose is definitely qualified for the job, but they still need me to stay on as the interim for at least another month until the newbie can take over. 

At this point, I've been spurned for the job twice and I've gone sour about the whole job and am contemplating just quitting. Me quitting would put the school in a really tough spot as they have zero reasonable options beyond me. They could contract the position out at what I can guess would be an absurdly expensive rate, or they could try and pull the new hire into the job a month early, or they could pray our local tech co-op can spare any time to fill in whenever possible(They manage 14 schools, so not likely)

**My question:** If I stay on through the end of February I'll have 7 whole weeks of experience as the head of the IT department of an entire school district that I can put on my resume, the superintendent has also offered to write me a *glowing* letter of recommendation, plus some decent money. 

As the title asks, is all that even worth putting up with all of that? Or am I just being bitter and should take as much experience as I can get on a resume?"

-put name labels on all test books
-sharpen a pencil for each of them
-create and organize test schedule 
-type up and prepare parent testing notification letters
-distribute letters
-create student testing passes
-distribute passes to students in the right order
-locate enough CD players for the test instructions (easier said than done apparently)
-email individual testing calendar to all teachers with each students name 
-get called to random meetings with county supervisor to discuss student learning gains and collaborate to create new ways to support students (aka more work for me)

ewgxg2,1,2020-01-30,"Psych undergrad.. I'm having an incredibly tough time picking ""one"" thing to pursue/work towards",justpickapathXD,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ewgxg2/psych_undergrad_im_having_an_incredibly_tough/,"I'm a recent BA Psychology graduate that's a little lost. Soul searching wall of text incoming.

I'm 25, and through a little bit of a twisting and winding academic road I finally ended up with something I'm passionate about. I started my academic path as a computer science major, but I slowly realized that I could not do it for a living. However, I always enjoyed programming, specifically in Python/R and working with data sets and manipulation.

I have little work experience in relevant fields (Data entry at a small company, wrote some small scripts to make my job easier. Student assistant for Uni System Admins) and did not take initiative to work as a research assistant. My gpa shows a strong upwards trajectory from where it started. (Psych Major GPA 3.9, overall trajectory from 1.8 -&gt; 3.15)

At first, I was planning on becoming an LCSW. I was always the ""easy to talk to"" and ""open-minded"" friend that was the go-to person for friends in times of need. I never looked at this as a skill until seriously considering a career as a therapist.

Things that I enjoy about this career path:

Ending up at private practice with my own hours sounds absolutely amazing. I like the idea of eventually getting to ""own"" my own company/business, rather than always working upwards.

I love the idea of decorating and having a cozy office I can call mine, rather than being stuck in a cubicle or some other form of...containment.

I do love talking to people and feel like I have qualities such as a above average EQ/very open mind/lots of experience talking to people about various struggles that would be very well suited for this occupation.

&amp;#x200B;

However, a few things have recently dissuaded me from pursuing this career path:

I feel that I would burn out all too quickly, as my current situation in life has greatly shredded my patience and optimism that formerly hoisted this career dream.

I'm not sure I have it in me to grind through all the required internship hours along the way. I've been in and out of school for seven years, and I'm not sure if I can take anything much longer than a few years for a master's.

A...cushy secure 9-5 with good benefits seems to have its fair share of perks.

&amp;#x200B;

The dissuading factors have made me consider an occupation in fields like I/O, data science, and UX.

There are some universities here that have nice I/O and Org Psych programs, and there is potential for further education in academia if desired. I find the idea of working as an I/O Psych for a tech company very appealing, as I am a very ""computery' person and would feel at home in that environment.

Data science was also an area of great interest. I took a graduate level Biostats course where I got to work with DNA/pandemic plotting/much more in r/Python, and it is most likely one of the most enjoyable courses I've ever taken.

Money...also seems a little easier to come by more quickly in these fields.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just...very indecisive and scared to make the wrong choice. I've been wasting my time for quite a long time now because it's incredibly difficult for me to commit without having a path planned out. I want to pick the path I feel like would grant me the most satisfaction and success in the long run, but I guess I won't know till I actually try.

I'd appreciate any and all advice anyone could throw my way, and bless your kind soul if you actually read through all of this."

I am currently a Junior at a target school. Recently, I started my search for an internship and very luckily got an offer at a decently established company. They are a medium-sized (and growing) company, and although pretty known for many people, I don't know if it has a big reputation for being an engineering firm. If you told other software engineers you work here they would probably not be very jealous. They said they will pay me around 20/hour with OT pay, for about 12-15 weeks of internship. I would probably be doing and learning a lot during the internship, and would definitely will have sufficient responsibilities. The company itself I am satisfied with, the people seem nice, and the atmosphere seems great. It's headquarters are also near my school so I wouldn't worry about housing or transportation or anything like that. Overall, a satisfiable option.

However, should I be continuing my search for a better internship? Currently, the biggest company I am still in the process for is IBM. I am currently considered for 3 of the 4 positions I applied for, and they are all at the same step to complete the Hackerrank. Should I really try to get IBM? I know for sure that they will not respond in time before I have to accept the offer. The offer expires feb. 3rd, so if I do IBM I would have to do it behind the other company's back. Is IBM really worth it? I know for sure they do pay better than the other company, so that's a plus, but both of my friends who's work there before did not specifically enjoy the amount of responsibilities they had there and did not want to return.

What are your thoughts? Should I be reaching for a better resume experience or a better learning experience? What do you think about the pay for the other company? The other company also basically guaranteed a full-time offer when I graduate as well, so I would be gaining a safe option."

First of all, I'm in college.  I'm nearly halfway through a CS degree (I have nearly 60 credit hours).  I found that I can still change it to Cybersecurity without damage.

I've learned in my first Computer Science class that I don't like Java.  No more.  So I don't want to write code in Java anymore.

In fact, I don't want *java* to be the main responsibility of my future job - If I can avoid it, of course.

I must make it clear that *can* code in Java all up until interfaces, something extends something else, private classes, abstract classes, polymorphism, support classes, events and listeners, all of that.  This is probably the reason I don't like code.

So what are my options if I don't want that to be the primary focus of my job?  What about internships?

What do cybersecurity people do?

The current situation is that we want to hide the partners/clients OU objects, such as users, from the employees because we dont want the names of our partners/clients to be visible for every employee in the company. This means that employees cant find the specific partners/clients  when they use the ""net user /domain"" or ""net group /domain"" command or search in file explorer for these specific AD objects.

I've tackled the problem that you cant find users with ""net user /domain"" by denying ""List Content"" for all the employees on the specific OU advanced security setting for the partners/clients. But this does not fix the problem when an employee searches for a specific Global Group with ""net group &lt;groupname&gt; /domain"".

ewnfvv,849,2020-01-31,Help your future job search . . . Start networking now regardless of what year you are in,solrose,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ewnfvv/help_your_future_job_search_start_networking_now/,"*I shared this on my LinkedIn account and modified it a bit for this audience as I think many of you will find it useful . . .*

**MYTH:** You don't need to be active on LinkedIn because you are not looking for a job

**FACT:** Networking is not simply about whether you are active in the job market or not 

It's about . . . prepping and having contacts IN CASE you are searching one day in the future. The quality of your network will be weak if you wait until you are in crisis to build it.  

It's about . . . supporting one another to learn.  I have used my network as a learning tool to reach out to others regarding topics where they have more expertise.

It's about . . . helping others find jobs.  You may not be looking, but perhaps you can make that connection to help someone else in their search.  Along these lines, you may be looking to hire someone and can use your network to find the right individual.  

Here's some additional Q&amp;A to get you started . . .

**As a student, who makes a good network connection?** Try to connect with prior alumni from your engineering school, professors, engineers in the field you are entering, co-workers from your internship, and perhaps even your parents friends.

**DO you just reach out like a cold-call?** No.  I always recommend you use the 'Add a Note' feature.  In the note, explain who you are and what it was about their profile that made you reach out.  Something along the lines of ""Hi, I am a student at XYZ university and came across your profile.  I see you work in alternative energy and wanted to reach out to connect as this is an interest of mine and I wanted to gain from your experience"".  If you came across them due to a specific article or project, then note this as well.  This WHY is very important and should be personal as this greatly increases the chances that they accept your connection.

**Following up afterwards to maintain the connections**. The key is to try and develop connections and not just add lots of people to your connection list.  If you had an internship one summer, try to stay in touch with them during the year.  They may not have a job for you the next year, but they might be able to make a connection for you.  One great way to stay in touch is to share something you learned in class and how it applied to something you did during the internship.  Similarly, you can share an article based on some of your internship work.  This shows them a continued interest in the work you had done and that you actually took some of it to heart.

**What about Networking events?** These can be great and I recommend you try to attend some.  However, don't be fooled into thinking that going to one of these events every few months is enough for networking.  These can be very superficial or perhaps the beginning of a relationship, but are not the primary goal.

ewnzfe,7,2020-01-31,Using Arduino with PlatformIO,TheRogueGamer,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/ewnzfe/using_arduino_with_platformio/,"Hey guys, junior( BSCpE ) and long-time lurker here; lately I've decided to get into embedded programming since I've personally found that that to be one of the most engaging sub-disciplines of Comp. Eng. and would like to work on personal projects so as to have something to use in applying for internships and also for my own education.  I already have an Arduino Mega 2560 and having browsed this sub regularly I am aware of this subreddit's disdain for the platform due to design limitations, the level of abstraction by the official Arduino IDE, and that other platforms like STM32 are far more utilized in the professional atmosphere. **I am only planning on using my Arduino to get started in embedded** and plan on jumping to something more professionally applicable at a later point, but I want to ensure that I actually learn rather than letting the IDE abstract all the low-level operations from me.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what is the best way to go about this? I have already installed PlatformIO and plan to use that as my IDE, but are there any other considerations I need to take in before I begin?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
ewo3ja,3,2020-01-31,Should I start looking for a new job?,black_widow48,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ewo3ja/should_i_start_looking_for_a_new_job/,"Some background info about me:
- Data analyst with 1 year of full-time experience (not including internships before that)
- Graduated undergrad May 2019
- currently in grad school
- Aspiring data scientist / machine learning engineer

I currently work for a Fortune 500 company which seems to be very behind in terms of technology. I am the only data analyst on my team (and the only person who is at all computer-savvy on my team). My team basically consists of me, my supervisor and his manager. Neither of them do anything related to CS.

In my job, I create reports using Power BI, design databases, write PHP scripts to gather/manipulate/store data in databases (using cron tasks to run them on a scheduled basis), and also build websites (also with PHP on the back end).

Because I have no colleagues who do the same work, no senior developer or anything like that above me, I have no one to review my code or to give any sort of insight on what I'm doing. Everyone seems to like the websites and reports I build, because they work. But there's not really any way of me knowing whether I'm using all the best practices or not.

I also don't know if I am performing up to par with how I should be as a data analyst/web developer, since I have no one working alongside me. I have no deadlines either, and just kind of work at my own pace. I sometimes feel like I waste too much time sitting on my phone as a result, and that I need to stop screwing around and focus more on my work. I've been attempting to fix that (using the pomodoro technique and things like that) but I'm still not where I want to be (sleep deprivation sometimes plays a part in this)

I currently make a base salary of 62K/year. But I am about to get a promotion. I'll be doing the same work I do now, but my pay grade will rise to either 70K, 88K or 106K based on my qualifications (probably 70K I'm assuming, but I'm going to try to get 88K).

My question is, should I try to work somewhere more technology-oriented and competitive now? Or should I wait until I graduate with my master's and can qualify for a data science/ML job that hopefully pays a 6 figure salary?"

This is my first proper internship of this kind and I have to say that I expected more. Days seem to be really slow - there seems to be no rush or urgency ever. As an intern I'm a few weeks in and yet to do anything meaningful. Despite this being an industry leader (I'm interning in one of he India offices of this company), I dont get a very techy vibe from the place. Just getting access to codebase needs permission from multiple people. I feel like this isnt the place to be to learn loads everyday. Is this true for most giant companies or no?"

I've been at my job for 5 years now.  I enjoy my job for the most part,  although it can be boring at times due to the nature of work I do (seasonal per se). I'm actually going to school working on getting my bachelor's in the field. My issue: a co worker that I just cannot work with anymore. 

I've never felt this way about someone in my life.  I despise this man.  He is an older man who has been at the job for over 20 years.  Most,  including our supervisor,  love him, but I saw right through him the moment I met him.  He takes an hour and a half lunch when he's supposed to take 30 minutes,  hours on 40 minute breaks twice sometimes 3 times a day and im not exaggerating at all. Both of our work is seasonal,  though he really does nothing for 11 months out of the year. And yes,  he gets paid bank.  

I know some will tell me who cares about what he does,  right? It's on him.  But my biggest problem with this guy is that when I first started working here,  he was sexually harassing me from the get go. Whenever he discusses women he has to comment about thier body type and how attractive they are.  He discusses how he refuses to let his wife get into bed with anything but lingerie. He constantly has his zipper down,  like constantly.  He once came over to tell another coworker how someone let him know it was down and he told her not to worry,  that his little guy wasn't excited,  eww. 

The worst time was when I had to travel with him in his truck.  He ""forgot"" his badge to get into our building and asked if we could go to his home to get it.  Sure,  no problem,  until he asked me to go inside with him.  Uh no. And after that I refused to go with him in his vehicle. 

I have not mentioned anything to anyone due to fear of retaliation. 

So my question is: I have a few interviews lined up,  should I move on or suck it up? Especially since I would be able to do my internship at my job and I love everyone else but this guy.  He just makes me miserable to the point where i want to leave.

ewws3h,23,2020-01-31,Why are Software Internships so damn competitive?,Lenewnicemaymayman5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ewws3h/why_are_software_internships_so_damn_competitive/,"I'm an Electrical Engineering major so I've applied to both software and hardware internships. In my experience, hardware internships (as well as mechanical, civil, finance internships that my friends told me about) look for good soft skills during an interview and good hard skills on a resume. Software internships both of these things but also require potential to answer questions about both the theoretical and the practical aspects about their education on the spot. Plus, they often have to complete coding challenges before even being considered.

Why is this? If there is such a shortage of CS graduates even with all these H1B visa holders, then why are CS internships (and I assume jobs too) so hard to get? Most engineering managers understand that young college kids don't know everything and can do some learning on the job. In software it seems like if you don't know the big O notation of a stack you get kicked to the dirt.

Just so you know: I've had a decent amount of interviews and I've somehow gotten lucky enough to avoid a hard technical grilling.  But my CompE roommate has been struggling with them and he's taking some CS courses this spring

I graduated from University of Toronto (UofT) majoring in Computer Science with a GPA of about 2.5. I didn't go to class, I didn't study. It took me 6+ years because I didn't prioritize my education and instead complained that I hate school. I would say, ""I'm paying for my suffering, and the parking"". I regret these things, I didn't pay attention in High School either. 

While at UofT, I interned at 2 different companies. First was a public-funded health company (twice), the other was a big 4 (once). While at these internships I worked mainly on front-end related projects with very little back end work. I enjoyed it, and succeeded; landing return offers for both companies. At the health company I took on responsibilities of a regular engineer as well. I thought I was competent enough, definitely enough to have a healthy career.

Fast forward, I took the big 4 offer so that I could make 100k+. Simple as that. I've roughly been there for a year and every week is a struggle. I'm no longer working on front-end projects and feel way out of my depth. I've been useful, but I feel the want to quit everyday. It's exhausting. I don't know what to do. I've shown initiative, I've been forward with how I feel. I'm succeeding externally so far, but feel like I really need help. I've temporarily become the most senior engineer on my team (teams have broken apart and reformed under new org). It takes me days to make simple changes, and the amount of anxiety is insane. I know that I'm a week engineer. I don't really understand design patterns (never learned them), I don't really know object oriented programming (I know it in theory, but in practice I'm probably like a first/second year student), everything seems unnecessarily complicated to me all the time. I'm sure that majority of time important trade-offs were made, but I don't know how to navigate through these code bases, and make changes that involve so many different files. I understand what i have to do most of the time in theory, i just can't understand how to actually do it.

 I think I'm more of a somewhat-capable programmer than a software engineer if that makes sense. I'm scared to reach out for more help on this in my company, because I feel like my problems aren't something that an engineer should have. I definitely feel that I'm near the bottom of people in this position, even though result wise I've been fortunate. 

I'm working on many aspects of my life, and my career is something that I also need to tackle. I don't think I would be able to manage work and school right now, due to my depression. I don't think I'm mentally strong enough yet to handle both of those things. I have 30-40k saved up in CAD, that I could leverage into putting me back in the right path. Obviously I would like to use very little money. I want to be a capable software engineer, I still expect to be challenged in a work day, but not to the point where I want to quit once I get a story.

I will have been at the big-4 full time in a month or two, so at least I will have the on my resume for the future.

Thing I have considered:

* Masters in Software Engineering

Would I even be able to get in a decent program, I have so many fails on my University Transcript and a 2.5-ish GPA.
Would this even help? 

* Bootcamp

I don't even know if these things are scams. Could one help? Any suggestions. I know people come from no formal education and succeed, so there must be a way for me to make it back.

* Self-learning

I think I would prefer something with more structure. I'm not sure I trust myself enough to put together a curriculum. Open to thoughts."
ewxa2d,1,2020-01-31,Not hearing back from hiring manager,ConvulsiveFlavin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ewxa2d/not_hearing_back_from_hiring_manager/,"Hi everyone -

I interviewed for an internship position 2 weeks ago, I was told that they were conducting interviews and looking to hire 4 interns ASAP. I wasn't concerned I hadn't heard anything yet, but on Wednesday I saw on LinkedIn that someone had started the internship for the position I was interviewing for. I emailed the hiring manager (who I have had contact with previous to my interview) Thursday morning if she had any updates and have yet to hear back. It is coming close to 5pm on Friday, so I'm a little worried at this point.  Normally she takes a few hours to respond, but it's been almost 2 full days. Am I worried about nothing? I figure if it was a no, it wouldn't take her very long to get back to me, but it seems suspicious it's been so long with no response.

Thanks in advance!

ewxg64,725,2020-01-31,I'm so happy right now...I just got offered my dream job!,TheyCallMeMrFantasy,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ewxg64/im_so_happy_right_nowi_just_got_offered_my_dream/,"I've known since my first analog electronics course that I wanted to be an RF/telecom engineer. All the courses I took were in RF, microwave,radio design, telecom etc, but I never got very high grades. I graduated a year ago and due to my poor grades and lack of internships, I couldn't find any radio jobs that would hire me. So I took a non-radio job and worked there for a year, but kept on applying to radio related jobs, but no one would give me a second look. 

Thankfully, one of my professors saw something in me. I kept in contact with him after I graduated, and mentioned I still wanted to get a radio job but didn't have the experience. In response he made the best offer I think I could have gotten at the time - he invited me to help him with his research in my spare time. So every day after work I went to my old university and did projects for this prof. After doing a couple of projects with him, I started getting a much better understanding of what I missed in school, and I was able to put good quality material on my resume.

After that I started hearing back from more companies that I applied to (A lot of them I still didn't get) but I was actually hearing back. But today I got the best news I think I could have. My first choice company offered me a junior radio hardware designer position - my dream job at my dream company. I'm shaking right now, I can't believe it finally happened.

What I learned from this though - profs are a fantastic resource! I owe so much to this prof that took a chance on me. I can't wait to start my new career!"
