I'm struggling to decide between two really good choices and thought I'd get some input from people online..


So recently I got accepted into UC Berkeley for CS but not UCLA or USC.  I also got a job offer from this company I have been working at for about a year now as an iOS developer which will pay 65k for part time (~25 hrs) so I could go to school as well.  However, the thing is, my work is located down in LA so I couldn't work from Berkeley (full remote might be a possibility but I'd rather not since it might be too distracting).  I'm going to try to appeal to UCLA first and see if I can get in.

However, if I still can't get into UCLA through appeal I'm trying to decide between these two options:

1) Go to Berkeley full time and focus on my education (get a few internships as well if I can)

2) Go to Community College for 1-2 years (depending on how many AP's transfer) and then switch into UCLA for CS all while working at this company part time as an iOS dev.


My question is, what do you think would be better for my career/which of these would be easier to get a good high paying job after this one?

Thanks for helping!"

However my goal in life is to be a developer, and not to stay in consulting for long. If i were to take this job, I would have many opportunities to study up on certificates or other skills when I'm not on a project. I understand there is a lot of travel involved, but my main current concern is if I were to work here for a year or so, would I be limited in trying to translate my career back into development? From what I understand, I wouldn't be too far from development in the first place, the sales team is who bring clients in and the consultants are the ones who are placed on the projects. I would be building a skill set through varied projects, but I would have the ""Jack of all Trades"" syndrome and wouldn't ""master"" one. 

Some background on me, I've never had an internship, but I've held a job for all of school. It was a computer lab job, so semi-related to the field but hardly technical. I'll be graduating this May, and the job offer is for after I graduate.

What I'd like to do is get a vector map of the streets within the city and import that into illustrator, but I can't seem find any sites that work. Most sites I've found have either been wrong, or include such insane level of instructions that it's frustrating.

The first (and major step) is to ""be large enough that street names are visible for at least most of the streets of the city"", which requires the streets to have a width rather than single line.

My opinions are based on my experiences and should not discourage anyone getting the help they need. 

When I was pregnant, I was 17 (I'm now 21) and I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts on a regular basis. I knew I needed help, and so my doctor sent a referral to a psychiatric team to help me. The wait list was 1.5 years, but due to cancellation I was able to get in a month after the referral was sent. 

Initially, I met and saw an intern for the psychiatrist on a weekly basis. She was amazing, fully understanding, attentive, and helped me realize I wasn't a bad person for feeling the way I was, that it was normal with hormonal imbalances and such. I felt great leaving her office every day, and felt like the depression was ebbing away because I learned how to deal with it. She also recommended, post partum, I get put on antidepressants since talk therapy won't help like pills will when it comes to PPD like she figured I would get.

After 2 months, her internship was over and so I switched to seeing the psychiatrist I was supposed to see. From day 1, it was horrible. She told me once I sat down that she will not be giving me medication post partum because she believed talking for at least a year will help. She ordered blood work to check for chemical imbalances as well as drug use because of my age. The results came back that all i had wrong was a B12 deficiency, leading cause of depression. She refused to diagnose me with depression or anything aside from separation anxiety and adjustment anxiety. She didnt even recommend I take vitamin suppliments to correct it. She said nothing about fixing it.

 She was dismissive of most everything I said, barely interacted with me, and showed her true uncaring colors after I had my son.

She saw me weekly after I had my son, and continued seeing me after he showed signs of illness and was admitted to a local children's hospital. We didn't find out a diagnosis until November, when he was 3 months old, which showed it was a genetic disorder causing chronic kidney disease.

 I turned 18 in October and so couldn't see that psychiatrist anymore. When I saw her a final time, I was a wreck. I thought I had somehow done this to my son, my depression and suicidal thoughts were at an all-time high, I was terrified of losing my child to an unknown disease and I was ripping at the seams. I asked her to send a referral to an adult psychiatrist because I knew I needed help and she refused. She said I was perfectly fine and don't need to waste a psychiatrists time when there's nothing I need except a venting mechanism.

How can you talk to your loved ones about wanting to end your life? How could you explain to them the feelings mounting inside you when you don't really understand them yourself? How can you face your family with that elephant in the room every time you're around them? How could someone expect you to do that when it'll make everything worse for you mentally and emotionally?

I never got the help I needed because a psychiatrist who was full of it wrote in my file that I was over exaggerating what I was feeling and she ""does not recommend I see anyone"" about it. One month later, my son crashed after major surgery and we almost lost him. I almost lost myself. I needed help which wasn't there for me because of my age and a doctor who doesn't believe in helping people who actually need it.

It took a long time, but I trained myself to feel better. I rewired my train of thought and the first thing to go was the suicidal thoughts. I overcame them by remembering that my son needs a mommy, that my fiance needs the love of his life, that my parents need their little girl, that everyone in my life needs me for one reason or another.

I haven't felt suicidal in about 2 years. I haven't felt majorly depressed in about 1 year, but I still am depressed. My anxiety has strengthened, but I'm dealing with it. All of the negativity and anxiety has been severely reduced because I, myself have helped me. I still have flare-ups, I still get in depressed moods, but I can talk myself up from it and feel better quickly.

I have supports in my life that help if I need it, but I never tell people how severe it is or what exactly is happening so they can't help more than what they try, because I have too much anxiety to divulge in such things.

Canada may have free health care, but at the end of the day, it's yourself that changes the way you think. It's your mindset, your emotions, everything that you're made of. I embraced my negativity and worked on rerouting those emotions to positive ones, thank God my man is understanding about it and knew I was trying, because he's stuck by me through all of my mood swings, break downs, psychotic episodes and everything. I feel like I'm a better person now, a better mother, soon-to-be wife, daughter and friend, and it is absolutely no thanks to Canada's mental health care."

Compared to UMBC's  program(which I am still considering, as they gave me a 10K/year scholarship [w/no honors college]), what advantages does UMD's program have above the competition?

Also, does being a ""small fish in a big pond"" make it harder to compete for internships and the likes? Or do most students get an internship by means of the program reputation and connections? 

Just some background on me. I have a good deal of programming experience. Although I don't consider my self amazing, I think I'm fairly good at it-- although at UMD, I fully understand I may be in the middle of the pack. 

 Although I am strongly leaning on going here, I just want to know what I'm getting into before I sign up.

So I am graduating with my bachelor's in electrical engineering in a few months and am scouring for a job still. I never thought I'd have this much trouble finding a position because my grades are good, I have internship experiences, and I've been told my interviewing skills are great.


My main issue is that I would love to stay in the area I'm living in (Dallas, TX area) as I have friends and family here. Looking around on sites such as Glassdoor though, it looks like salaries (especially entry-level salaries) are very low for this area. I realize this is partially due to differences in cost-of-living, but I'm seeing average salaries here being $15k, $20k, sometimes even $25k less than other states. I really do think I am work being paid well due to my skills and experience, even though I am a new graduate.

Anyway, I interviewed at a company today and things went well. After interviewing with multiple people on-site, I was emailed a questionnaire including a question about salary expectations. I'd imagine that they looking for an actual figure or range, correct? I've done quite of bit of research today, but the salary range I'm finding is quite large. I know entry-level salaries typically depend on size of the company, and it is a small-ish subsidiary of a huge international company ($5-10 billion/year).

I guess I'm looking for some advice on how to approach this situation, perhaps where I should go from here and where to look. It's difficult making huge decisions on how to start my career path, for example knowing that switching jobs typically results in a new higher salary based on your old salary, so wouldn't it be more beneficial then to start working in an area with a higher cost of living?

How relevant, contemporary is the course selection? 

2) How accessible are classes - I've heard nightmares: waking up at 5 AM to register for an intro Math class - to not finding a spot and having to wait out an entire term. How true is this at UCLA Engineering?

3) How appreciative, encouraging, vibrant is the UCLA environment for Startups, Hands-on Engineering as a whole? What resources, courses, competitions are provisioned for entrepreneurship on campus? How prevalent and accessible are project-teams/early stage student startups on campus?

4) How valuable is a UCLA degree for employment in tech, SV preferably? What kind of starting salaries, internships, jobs have recent graduates commanded with their degree and performance on campus?

5) How accessible are grad schools like Stanford, Wharton for MBA after a UCLA Engineering degree? (thinking far too ahead...)

6) As an international, the COA stands at $60k - what additional costs are common for students?

I realise I've asked a lot - everything is quite ambiguous, alien (and hence exciting!)

I need your opinion on this. Since I graduated from my Master's degree in business (3.5 years ago) I've been working as a freelancer in writing novels. I've been VERY successful, been making about 3000-10.000 Euro (I live in Spain) per month, and I love what I do. I love writing stories, I love being flexible with my time and people like my books (I even have fans on my Facebook fan page). 

I'm 28 now, and I start worrying a bit. The money is still great, nothing has changed, BUT I'm worried if I will be able to do this my entire life or not. I'm scared that in a couple of years, my books won't sell anymore and then I won't have any source of income. If that happens, I won't have practical experience from working in a company, which means no company would employ me (I guess my Master's degree won't matter anymore since I don't have any practical experience except of my internships during my studies). That means I would probably have to work as a waitress, in a call center, or something like that. I really don't want to do that.

I'm still young and I know that now I could still get a good job in a company (I've even had a few companies contacting me through LinkedIn), but I think it won't always be like that. So I could take a job in a company now, but that would mean I won't be able to do the writing anymore, at least much less frequently (since I'd be working full-time). Plus I wouldn't be able to manage my own time and be flexible anymore. If the future didn't count at all, I wouldn't take a job in a company because I love what I do (writing) and I love my life. Also, living in Spain means not very high salaries, so my salary right now through my writing is higher than it would be in any company that would offer me a job now. But the future really worries me. I don't wanna be 40, suddenly unsuccessful at writing and be dependent on a waitress job (no offense against being a waiter, it's just not what I want).


I would really appreciate your advice. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Take a job in a company to be more secure, even though that's not really what I want? Or keep writing and do what I love, even though that could mean a risky future?


Thanks!"

I'm currently doing a full stack web dev internship and I really don't like the work. The job itself is fine, the people are fine, the company is fine, but holy hell the work is so boring I can't stand it. I do not feel challenged at all - which has led me to think hard about what sub field I want to go in to.

I'm all over the place with my interests and I can't narrow down what I want to do. I know that it's good to keep an open mind ect ect.. but how can I get good enough at something to get a job in it without dedicating a bunch of time to that specific thing? I feel like I'm frozen, I can't make a move to start learning something because I may not like it or it may be a bad career move and then I would have wasted all of my time.

I have interests in AI, security, space (possibly doing simulations), embedded systems, molecular modelling, neuroscience.. you name it and I think it would be cool to work in the field. I know people will say 'just jump in and start working with one', but I can't justify doing that in my head without an end goal, hence me being frozen. The most important thing to me is that I'm challenged, but I also want to make sure I can get a job and that I'm actually interested in what I'm working on (the pay isn't terribly important). 

Does anyone else have this problem or is it just me being indecisive? I've been known to change majors my fair share. "

I immediately took the first job offer I could get as an Environmental, Health and Safety Engineer for a manufacturing company in November and was told I would temporarily work as a technician, then move on as a full-time engineer.

I have been able to reduce my time spent on ‘tech work’ from 90% to about 70%, but I strongly believe I have reached a cap.

**My question is:** Do I now look like a job hopper? Right now on my resume I have my first job with no job title listed, just the company. For my current job, the title and company are listed. Would it be dishonest to list the internship title under the first job and omit the full-time job title I had? Or should I omit the first job/company entirely?

I think it's probably because I have no experience so I'm trying to find specifically New Grad/Entry Level but I'm struggling to find those job listings. I got a code interview for Google for a New Grad position but aside from that I got nothing going for me. Is this normal for new grads or am I screwed?

I may be able to knock all of the credits out in two semesters, I've always had high credit hour loads so far so it isn't a huge deal. So would a co-op leave me struggling to find a job without an internship or would they look at the co-op as sort of an internship?

I of course plan on doing a side project during my next couple semesters. One of my classes I'll have to take is Mobile Development for iOS, so I actually have a plan for a project already thought out. I've been keeping relatively decent grades, around a 3.5 GPA, which is only getting better now that I'm doing good in school.

For me this decision is between UIUC and UMD and I'm having a tough time figuring out which school I'd rather attend. Here are the factors in play so far:

Major

* At UIUC, I'd be in the #5 ranked CS program in the engineering school as ranked by US News
* At UMD, I'd be at the #15 ranked CS program, but because it's not an engineering school, it could be easier to double major and I could also major in the #10 ranked Applied Mathematics program

Location

* I live in New Jersey, so UIUC is much farther from home than UMD
* UIUC really doesn't have anything nearby besides cornfields 
* UMD had DC close by which is pretty awesome 
* In terms of culture, I might feel more at home at UMD because it's east coast whereas UIUC is midwest.

Opportunities 

* From what I've heard, people at UIUC have a much easier time finding summer internships and jobs 
* UMD is near DC so there would be a lot of opportunity in the government and with government contractors. 

Price and Honors 

* UIUC didn't give me any scholarships and I didn't get into their honors program 
* UMD is giving me $12k a year and I was accepted into the honors college 

That's what I've considered so far. Am I missing anything? What's your guys' opinion on this?"

USC:
Pros - California. Good racial diversity. Lots of undergrads yet small class sizes.

Cons - I heard they use grade deflation. Also there are a lot of students I'd have to compete against for internships and research opportunities.



Dartmouth:
Pros - Obviously the name. Strong alumni group and small class sizes. Large endowments.

Cons - Freezing winters. Strong Greek presence (I don't want to rush). Almost in the middle of nowhere



Emory:
Pros - Fantastic medical school nearby. Pretty campus. Fun things to do in Atlanta

Cons - In the South (I'm from the South). Sciences aren't ranked as high as the other two schools.

* Awards: National Merit Letter of Commendation, some other random MUN stuff (irrelevant)
* Extracurriculars: Basically I did not have a variety of clubs, but rather leadership positions in few clubs that I continued through my HS career. Had a great summer internship over the summer--I think this DEFINITELY helped me since it made my interest in business clear. I wrote about this internship in any supps that asked about ECs, and my boss wrote me a supplemental letter of recommendation which I believe helped my app a lot.
* Essays: These were probably what made or broke it for me. The schools that I got into I wrote really good essays for that I was proud of. The schools I didn't get into were essays that I reused without tailoring it to the prompt. The only school I got rejected from that I believed I had amazing essays for was Princeton, but Ivies are always a toss-up so I'm not in any way disappointed. I changed my Common App essay entirely from my early cycle to my regular cycle, but I don't think it really made that much of a difference (other than give me piece of mind).
* Teacher Recs: My two teacher recs were probably excellent, and my counselor rec was amazing. I doubt these hurt me in anyway.

**Final Notes**

Listen. The college process sucks. My #1 tip: DON'T DO THE ESSAY FOR YOUR DREAM SCHOOL FIRST! My first essay was for Penn and it was definitely my worst, even though I spent months on it. The essays I wrote for Georgetown, even though they took me about a day or two, were incredibly strong (in my opinion). Another tip, have a balanced list. I'd like to think my list was pretty balanced, I threw on a couple reaches at the end (Harvard &amp; Dartmouth) just because I didn't want to regret not applying there, and I had already gotten into two great early schools (U-M &amp; UChicago). But I have friends who applied to seven Ivies with less-than-stellar stats and now they're incredibly unhappy. On that note, MAKE SURE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY GO TO YOUR TARGET/SAFETY SCHOOLS. USC was a target for me, and I would've been happy to go if it was my only choice. I was so lucky to get the Trustee scholarship, and now I might be getting a $20,000 stipend. It's amazing when a college makes you feel wanted, especially a college that you want. Make sure you apply to places you WANT to go to, and at least a few of those places will return the feeling.

CollegeConfidential is definitely a source of stress but for me stressing about college was my way of having control. Make good decisions folks, and I promise your hard work will pay off. Think about finances when applying to college, because colleges do NOT give as much FA as you think in most cases. I always thought I'd go to Georgetown over USC, but FA might change that for me. To seniors reading this, congrats WE MADE IT! Now is the first time in the college process where WE have the control, where we send colleges OUR decisions on THEM. To juniors, good luck. Be organized. Don't leave your essays for the very end. I finished all my essays early and ended up scrambling to help all my friends edit their essays. AND ALSO TRY HARD YOUR SENIOR YEAR--your grades that year matter a lot. To sophomores/freshmen, keep in mind where you want to apply. Maybe start visiting colleges now-ish, so that you don't have to when you're busy junior/senior year. Think about what you want to do. If you don't know, that's alright too. A lot of kids apply undeclared to colleges, and a lot of schools (particularly liberal arts schools) allow for a flexible curriculum/changes of majors.

And on that note, I'm out."

This seemed great to me, except the pay was lower than expected (around 10k less than the average for graduates of my school/entry level jobs in my area). I tried to negotiate the offer with no luck, but another ""perk"" they have offered me is a signing bonus. The signing bonus is a ""significant"" amount of money for me (around 10% of the salaried offer)

My initial plan was to take the job offer and search for jobs in other locations until I found something really attractive, but I am now having second thoughts. Is it terrible to leave a job after only a few months of working there if I find something better? Should I turn down the job offer and hope to find a job in another state in the next few months? The money isn't really a big deal to me but I would like to maximize my value and earnings potential.

If I do end up staying with the company how early is too early to leave? Should I feel guilty about taking a signing bonus and leaving too soon after?

Right now, the only thing I can think of that is big enough in the sense that I will learn a lot and will show that I've actually done substantial amount of work, while also small enough that I can complete in 3-4 months is a mobile app; either on iOS or Android.

It's been a huge stumbling block in getting internships because I can't commit to 40 hours a week for the whole summer. I still have one more summer, so I'm not panicking, but I don't want to waste a summer doing nothing, so I narrowed it down to a few options:

* try and get a research position with one of my professors
* cold call a few machine shops and try to get some unpaid industry experience
* learn programming/arduino 

No matter what I choose, I also plan on getting some Solidworks certifications.

I don't think I've learned enough actual engineering to take on a whole project of my own, so which of those three would be best?"

4d88za,3,2016-04-03,Filipino Computer Science graduate in UK &gt; Germany/US,ragdolls,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/4d88za/filipino_computer_science_graduate_in_uk_germanyus/,"Tl;Dr: I am a citizen of the philippines currently studying Software Engineering masters in the UK, currently considering my options in terms of getting away from the UK and the Philippines. Considering Germany and the US. Help?

I studied for Computer Science for three years in the Philippines, where I was getting exceptional grades – I was consistently on the dean's list and the president's list, which allowed me to get accepted into a university in the UK studying for a Masters of Engineering in Computing (4 years) degree. I still get good grades, although I'd be lying if I said that I'm doing as well as I did in the Philippines, mostly because the education is to a much higher standard, and I’m finding it more difficult even with prior experience. I’m coming up to the end of my third year now, and am considering options. 


Some points:

* I have plenty of work experience in diverse fields: cashier at a fast-food restaurant, technical support in a call centre, barista, waitress, accountant and graphics designer at a café (family owned), computer science student ambassador (current). I have good relationships with my lecturers within the university who will be more than happy to endorse me by providing glowing references. The problem is that I don’t really have personal projects of my own nor have I worked for a company that is directly linked to my degree. Internships are hard to come by where I live (Wales) and I’d practically have to move to London and live in a shoebox for a few months to get an internship. 


* I’m a woman, and as sexist as it sounds, I’ve heard from multiple sources (professors and colleagues alike) that women in Computer Science are valued as there aren’t many of us in the field and employers want to keep the workplace as gender-neutral as possible. How true is this in the “real world”? 


* I’m lucky enough that my university is within the top 15 Computer Science universities within the UK (7th in the 2016 Times University Guide, 11th in the 2016 Guardian University). It’s quite a small university and not very well known, but we’re not far from Oxford and Cambridge. 


* This particular degree is also accredited for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status by the British Computer Society. 


* I can borrow money from my family, Although I’d like to refrain from doing so as they’re already sponsoring my degree. They live in the UK and are quite well off so money is not such a big concern.  


* Being a holder of a Philippine passport, I practically have to have a visa before landing in another country. This makes it difficult as all job applications/interviews will have to be done online. 


* I have a very generous and loving boyfriend who is British but can claim German citizenship. We’re eager to learn if our relationship can help my chances at possibly working and living in Germany. Something similar to the UK’s unmarried partner visa, without having lived together formally? 


* The UK’s current government seem to be working to keep a lot of foreigners out, or at least make it as difficult as possible for us. I find it rather distasteful to work and pay taxes for a country that would rather keep me out when there are countries who embrace talent no matter what nationality. I really want out unless it significantly affects my career negatively. 

How difficult is it to find a job abroad? Currently I’m considering the US and Germany, which would be a better choice for my degree? I am willing to learn German, and have excellent written and spoken English skills (I scored 8/9 on the IELTS test before I came to the UK, I'm sure I'm more fluent now!). Will my being a fresh graduate hinder my chances at finding a job abroad?

Would staying in the UK be better? I’m afraid I won’t get hired as I have British friends who are switching to a master’s degree because they haven’t been able to find jobs. If it’s that hard for them, how much harder would it be for me? It’s not just a matter of nationality either, I have friends who achieved higher than myself and do better at university, yet have not been able to even land an interview.

I've been teaching myself Java for about a year now and I have a couple of questions about the industry. 
1. I know that once you learn one language, it's easy to pick the rest, but I'm wondering what language to pick up next (I'm a sophomore in High School and I'm looking to go into Computer Software Engineering/Computer Science). 
2. I feel like what I'm doing is pointless right now, and I want to apply my skills to the real world. Is there anyway I can get an internship as a High Schooler?
3. Whats the difference between Computer Software Engineering and Computer Science majors?

4d8qn5,1,2016-04-03,Advice about internships/co-ops for someone in my situation,MathOrProgramming,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4d8qn5/advice_about_internshipscoops_for_someone_in_my/,"Long story short, I was a computer science major for three years. I did quite well (4.0 GPA), but realized that computer science was not what I really wanted to do. Fast forward to the next year and I am at a new university studying ME. So far, I've put a year into the program and have a pretty solid GPA (Anticipating 3.7ish after this semester). In the best case scenario I would graduate in 1 more year, but this is very unlikely to happen. In reality, I'm looking at 1.5/2 more years to complete my degree.

Now, this worries me because I do not have an internship or co-op at all. My resume has a couple of pretty GPA numbers, but nothing else of any substance. If I were to end up being able to graduate next spring I would be fairly unprepared. I applied for internships and co-ops for this summer, but have come up with nothing so far. 

Of course, I would like to graduate sooner rather than later as well. I'm already going into my 5th year, possibly looking at six, and feeling pretty burnt out. An internship over a co-op is looking better and better simply because it wouldn't delay my graduation even more. A co-op would likely be more beneficial though. Student loans are something creeping up as well, but those aren't too bad yet.

If it looks like I'm going to have to do a sixth year I will definitely be looking for internships again, but I'd like to know what you guys think I should do if this isn't the case. Anything that I would do this summer that wasn't an internship would also have to work around my work schedule. At this point I plan on working as many hours as possible serving tables (I've worked at the same restaurant for almost 7 years now) to try and avoid taking any private loans out for the additional years of school. That would leave me with just part of this summer to put something useful onto a resume. 

So, what do I do? What should I look for? How can I make myself more desirable from an employer's perspective in a short amount of time?"

One, because most employers never heard of petroleum engineering outside the industry. 
Two, the job prospects are null for new graduates right now unless you have a parent in the industry. 
Three, I have extensive programming and I am getting my minor in computer science, I am even getting a computer science related internship this summer; but, when the time comes to apply for jobs, I don't want to scare away potential employers with a ""Petroleum Engineering"" degree because they may not know what that is.  

**Any thoughts on this?** I am sure some of ya'll may have some ethical issues with this but technically I am doing enough chemical engineering to include the name in my title. Oh, and petro-chemical engineering sounds more badass than petroleum. I'm open to all criticism.

Takes up most of my time.
* Multicultural Club, Dance Group Leader - Multi is a club at my school that celebrates cultural diversity through dance. There are several cultural dance groups at my school and I'm a member of several of them. We spend the entire year practicing/rehearsing for an annual 2-day show held in the Spring of every year.

In addition to these activities, I also program/code in my spare time and have a lot of side projects I can talk about/discuss.

**Hooks:** First Generation (This I think was a big factor for a lot of my acceptances), Low Income (Pell Grant eligible)

**Essays:** My common app essay wasn't anything out of the ordinary but it at least demonstrated my personality and my passion for computer science. My supplements were alright too. I did my best to avoid being cliche and I took some risks by going with some non-conventional essay topic choices and I guess it worked.

**Strengths:** First generation, low income, competitive GPA/courseload, high success in AP course load, strong passion for computer science, unique EC list

**Weaknesses:** My SAT score could've been better, lack of STEM related school activities

**Reflections:** Admissions are totally a crapshoot. I wasn't expecting to get into Brown or Johns Hopkins nor was I expecting a half-tuition scholarship from USC (Which is my #1 choice as of right now). At the same time, I wasn't expecting to get deferred or rejected/waitlisted from Illinois and Chapel Hill. I'm glad I gave these competitive schools a shot and now I have some difficult decisions to make down the road.

I will most likely end up enrolling at USC if their financial aid package is anything close to what their NPC estimated. It offers a computer science/business administration major that is pretty unique and I was accepted for that major. In addition, I was awarded a sweet merit scholarship with awesome benefits along with being selected for their engineering honors program. When I visited the school, I fell in love with it and I believe it offers the best environment out of all my schools and is in an ideal location for me to develop myself at. Still, I need to weigh my options cause these other schools are just as great, it's all about finding out where I fit the most at this point."

Option one is Gettysburg College, very small and focuses on a liberal arts education. Option two is Penn State University Park, very large research based university. I'm mainly worried about the merits of a liberal arts college's computer science focus to employers. Is the degree competitive? What will my opportunities for research and internships be like? 

I hope to eventually pursue an MBA or a MS I'm computer science (not sure yet). 

In all likelihood, I will end up at Gettysburg because it is much cheaper with scholarships and financial aid as compared to Penn State. If after one year and I feel like the program won't take me where I want to go, I may consider transferring to a large school like UT Austin or University of Maryland (again, that would be based on financial situations.)

I am a senior that should've graduated this semester but changed majors late and as a result, I haven't taken real coding courses until 1 semester ago and will graduate after an extra semester at minimum. I am not confident in my coding abilities whatsoever yet and have very little hope of landing a summer internship (especially since the last career fair in my school had passed) but I plan on studying and working hard on my own during the summer (doing decent in classes (actually doing well, but they are only theoretical classes with no coding...) but quite depressed at the moment, though I'm confident all I need is time as I'm willing to put in the effort).

I'm not sure if a fall internship while in school is possible but it is very unlikely (a fall internship would at least give me time to brush up on programming knowledge), since most are during the summer and career fairs focus only on summer ones. Also, now would probably be the time to apply for them and get an interview, but again, my programming knowledge is lacking at the moment.

I am super depressed because I keep hearing stories about internships being a must just to have options at entry level jobs and without an internship, there is no ""easy"" path to an actual job. I understand this but I also have no chance of an internship given my lack of experience with coding at the moment.

Any tips or information is much appreciated--I will benefit from seeing a different perspective.

Some backgrounds: I'm in my 2B term in regular computer science. I've had some coop experience back in high school, and I just came back last term from a tier-1 software company in SF bay area as my first internship. I'm also Asian but I grew up here, and both of my parents are divorced &amp; have remarried. I live with my mother &amp; stepfather, having said that  

I feel no love and joy whatsoever in my life. I feel guilty when living with my parents, and I treat all my relatives as if they're strangers. The only (kind of) joy I have is when I'm looking at my C++ code. I know they all love me, but I simply don't love them back. I never noticed this until yesterday my mother called me a cold-blooded person and mentioned I seems to have started behaving this way after I started university. I'd happily demand rent from my cousin &amp; grandmother and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that  

I avoid girls, literally. To me the path looks like this: look at girl -&gt; love a girl -&gt; have girlfriend -&gt; married -&gt; have kids -&gt; divorce -&gt; financial ruins (look at Donald Trump's 1st wife). I couldn't come up with a single reason why people want to live together as lovers  

Sometimes I feel like getting away from my parents as far as possible (like for the next 30 years) or just commit suicide so that I don't waste their money &amp; stop making everyone around me unhappy. Part of me says ""they're your parents who loves you unconditionally, you should be happy"", while another part of me says ""you're already 18+, they have no legal obligations to take care of you""  

Is this normal for university students? I have never had this kind of dilemma in high school.Have anyone had similar experience? Should I consult a doctor or counsellor?

4db1uq,1,2016-04-04,Summer jobs and interships,constermonster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4db1uq/summer_jobs_and_interships/,"Hi, I am a freshman computer science major in college, and I was wondering if there were any types of tech related jobs or internships that would look good on my resume that I would be able to do at my level of experience. It seems as though most tech internships discussed require a lot of knowledge and I don't think that I am at that level yet. I have taken a 101 class in java and I have worked my way through the “automate the boring stuff” book in python so I know some basic python too.

4dbm0w,21,2016-04-04,Been a developer for two years now. Should I go for a Master's in CS? I majored in Info Sci.,narett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dbm0w/been_a_developer_for_two_years_now_should_i_go/,"When I was in uni, I wasn't able to complete a CS major at the time since I was a sophomore by the time I knew that CS was an actual thing I could major in (I came from a very small high school in a very small farming town). I managed to graduate with a B.S. in Information Science from UNC as well as getting a double major - B.A. in comm studies where I basically made video game demos for projects.

Now I've been a developer for two years professionally. I somehow netted an internship for a data storage company for 6 months. A few months after that, I got a job at a local credit union as a junior dev maintaining teller software. Now I've been at a Fortune 100 company for a whole year as a web developer mainly doing Node work with a hint of Flask.

The reason I'm interested in getting a Master's in CS would be to finally get the CS education I feel I never got. I always feel like I'm lacking knowledge. Yes, I can code, but I feel I can be better than what I am now. Throughout the past, I've tried to hodge-podge together self-guided dive into CS theory - of which I only have the barest fundamentals of, if even that. What's worse is being a web dev kind of invalidates much of what I sat down to study, such as thinking about efficiency of code. Also, a part of me found CS theory to be kind of fun, but again that was outside of the class setting. Back in school, I remember hating learning about data structures, but I think I was too young and immature back then. I'm 26 now. I find reading about them quite fascinating.

As for a career guidance, I don't know where I want to go. When I think career, my head draws blank. I just want to make things. Those things, so far have been videogames and I've been having a difficult time getting back into them due to personal doubt, but web dev is getting quite boring.

I don't think getting a Master's in CS is the only resort, but it's the only one that comes to me. I also feel that, though mad expensive, I'd be able to get out of the 'real-world' a bit and dive back into education with stronger resolve than I had back as a undergrad.

All this said, any advice would suffice. Cheers!"

4ddb46,15,2016-04-04,How much of a guarantee should universities have for employability?,AetherThought,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/4ddb46/how_much_of_a_guarantee_should_universities_have/,"A friend of mine, /u/SometimesICryAtNight, posed this question on Twitter a while ago, and though we had a short discussion on it I think there's worth in talking about it at greater length.

So essentially, should going to university provide some guarantee (however small) on the employability of the people who graduate from their programs?

At first, I want to say no - you can make the argument that university is a purely academic institution, and the theoretical knowledge that you earn during your time has no effect on your employability. But thinking about it further, there's a few reasons to believe why this might not be the case.

1. Almost every non manual labour job requires a degree of some sort or other. 
2. With additional programs like co-op, it's almost undeniable that schools like ours market our programs to potential students purely on the value of internships on potential employment later on.
3. Nowadays, it's rare that people want to pursue strictly academic career paths when they begin an undergraduate degree - though it's just anecdotal observation, the majority of people I know in my program (and others) are in it with the view of a stable job in mind.

So if the answer is no to any sort of guarantee, should this apply to colleges or technically-focused institutions? It's not rare for things like programming boot camps to offer some sort of employability guarantee, so would it be correct for universities to do the same?

And finally, is it even fair or honest to market your school based on the employability of its students?

I'd love to know what you all think about this, I think it's a very intriguing topic.

Edit: So is it responsible or reprehensible that the university uses things like its co-op placement statistics to imply that there are many job openings in all sectors when the placements are skewed extremely heavily by the popularity of the tech sector?"

I chose CIS (Computer Information System ) over computer science because I liked coding but it wasn't a thing I imagined to do forever. (JAVA is like love and hate relationship) anyways.. I browsed some stuff what I wanted to do and was really interested in Database Administrator and Security. I really want to do Security since I want to be the hero of the company fighting hackers! spammers! and the bad evil guy on cyberworld. ^^ 

Since CIS is a very broad major, it really didn't prep me for a particular career. So my question is what can I do to prepare myself for a career in Security or database?

For security I know there are alot of certifications like Network+ and cissp. Will those help me land a job? Of course internship is a must too.

Two internships under my belt, good relations at both places, I spoke with a recruiter whom I knew from one of them and got an interview at a local shop. 

Interview goes very well, I ended my morning speaking with the CEO who told me ""if engineering doesn't offer you a job, come talk to me, and I'll offer you one."" The recruiter comes to pick me up after our meeting and he flat tells her ""give him an offer.""

So I had a good interview, the company clearly wants me (both CEO and engineering) and based on my performance they are skipping entry level and bringing me in as a level 2 dev.

Offer details:

Base Pay: $65k.

Stock options (though company is currently private) and benefits. Potential 10% bonus annually. Unlimited PTO as needed.

However, I've done some research, and (according to Indeed and Salary.com) median pay for SD2 in the area is $72-76k.

So clearly I want to negotiate a little higher. How does the following email sound?

&gt;Hey Recruiter!

&gt;Thank you for offering me a Software Developer II position! I would like to express again how excited I am to begin working for [company].

&gt;However, before I can accept, I would like it if we could discuss compensation. As we have previously discussed, my background is quite strong, and I have a wide set of skills that brings a lot to the table. Overall, I think I would be a great fit for [company]. 

&gt;All of that said, the research I’ve done on comparable salaries show that a base salary of $72,000-$76,000 would be the median market value of a Software Developer II position for the area. The current offer of $65,000 is notably lower; Based on the above, I would like you to consider as a compromise a base salary of $72,000.

&gt;I can certainly see a future for myself at the company, and I’m confident that I can bring a lot of value. I know that we can come to a mutual agreement on an acceptable salary.

&gt;Thank you for your time,

&gt;Potential Hire


Is my offer too high? I am expecting the recruiter to come back with a lower number."

I have a 4.0 GPA, and 33 score on the ACT. I have completed intro to programming, and currently enrolled in AP CS. I am also in an honors math class. I self taught myself python and learned java from school. I do not have many extracurricular activities as I have a job and was never very good at sports.

I recently applied for an internship, and got an interview, but was not accepted. I also did a job shadow there and learned some very important things about the job. First, they use SQL a LOT to interact with the database in their insurance company. I also found an internship for mobile dev, but it wants college students.

What could I do to make myself more employable for these businesses and IT in general? I was thinking of getting certified / taking a class on SQL after seeing it's use. I was also thinking about making an android app (I already know java). What are things could I do to make sure I can get an internship / job, to get the VERY important work experience needed? Also, how could I go about getting certified in SQL or making an android app ( I was just thinking a YouTube series or online class, plenty of those for Android development fortunately!) Also, how to get into the security area, as its very intriguing to me.

4de46s,8,2016-04-04,Found out it's going to be a bit longer then I expected till I graduate.

I know summer internship jobs are a thing, but is there such thing as part time grunt work in software development? At this point I'm desperate enough to take just about anything.

I'm pretty desperate at this point: I absolutely hate school. I'm a re-entry student who has already put in a lot of work in different majors but I don't have enough gas to put my life on hold for another three years. If I could get the ball rolling professionally

I was thinking that it's viable to get the technical skills to apply for an internship job, next summer at the latest. If I can land an interview I feel very confident in my ability to compete with the majority of other applicants. But what I would like is the possibility to work part time in anything related to software development.

So does such a thing exist? Is there bitch work out there that a student could do? So far what I've seen available is either internship, then full time entry level positions.

If it's possible, I can do what it takes to get it. I eventually want to become a full stack web developer but I'll do anything to get any kind of experience at this point. And anything is likely to pay more then what I'm doing right now. I got some good coding chops but everything has been school projects up to this point. 

I know these kinds of posts are common, and I appreciate the responses. I'm feeling the depression spike up at the thought of losing an additional three more years. I appreciate the people who don't agree with this perspective, but my situation is such. I won't bore anyone with the details, but take my word for it... it ain't great."

Is it hard to change majors, in particular into computer engineering, at UIUC? 
Is there anything you wish you knew before coming to UIUC? How are the professors? Class sizes? Advisers? Opportunities for research and/or internships? Would you say one school has an advantage over another? If you had the make the choice between UIUC and Cornell, which would you choose?

4dezl2,5,2016-04-05,TIFU by letting a mentally ill homeless person into the back area at work,redwiffleball,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4dezl2/tifu_by_letting_a_mentally_ill_homeless_person/,"This actually happened on Thursday but today I was confronted about it. The title mostly speaks for itself. On Thursday I worked a little bit late (I'm actually an intern) and I stayed late to finish a mailing because I didn't want my coworker to have to do it the next day. It was 5:30PM and as I was leaving, a man approached me. I should have known that something was off about him, and in hindsight, something was, now that I reflect on what the interaction was like. 

He asked me if I could please let him into the back area/kitchen/break room with my key card. I didn't even think anything of it and figured he worked there; I hadn't seen him before but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I assumed he worked there. I didn't consider the fact that if he had worked there, he would have had a key card like everyone else. I didn't consider the fact that this is in a downtown location and some sketchy people hang out downstairs; many of them homeless. I was being fucking negligent.

Today I was informed via email that there will be a new rule prohibiting interns from being there alone, and that there will be heightened security measures. Just as I was putting two and two together, my boss talked to me. 

She told me everything that had happened and that the person I let in was in fact mentally ill and that some theft occurred. From what I understand, things went missing or somethings went down (I'm unclear) and then they saw surveillance footage of me letting the person in. I'm unclear on most of the details right now. 

Everybody at my work is so upset with me right now. When my boss stepped out, I spoke to my coworker and asked if I was being fired; she told me they had had a meeting about it before and that I'm not. I am so upset with myself. I kept it together when I was there and actually got a lot of work done. It was a productive day but I wanted to die the entire time. I'm a horrible and negligent person and I'm still afraid of being fired. I'm there 4-5 days a week and don't know how I'm going to handle being around people who are so angry with me.

This is the last time I will be telling this story at length; I have spent so much of today crying and panicking and I am at a point where I am so emotionally exhausted. 

I have apologized (but not profusely; I've tried to be as professional as I can). I also have offered to take full financial responsibility if need be. I think I made things worse when I attempted to return my last paycheck to my boss. I told them that it was in case of any damages incurred. I think my boss took it as an insult but I didn't mean it that way... I just want to do whatever I can to fix this. I am happy to cover damages. But it only made things so much worse. Even though it doesn't look like I'm going to be fired (right now), I'm still terrified. My coworker has told me in the past that an intern hasn't been fired from our workplace. I would have been (and still could be) the first to break the rule. I hate myself. 

Also, what if he had been an active shooter? What if he had been violent? How could I be so careless? I hate myself and I don't think I'm going to feel better about this for a long time

TL;DR - I let a mentally ill thief into the back area at work and he stole stuff. "
4df9tj,15,2016-04-05,What is a good pre-entry-level job?,xianbaum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4df9tj/what_is_a_good_preentrylevel_job/,"Hi! I'm having a lot of trouble finding an entry-level/junior position in programming. I recently graduated with bachelor's degree in computer science, and I have a portfolio website, an active GitHub, and side-projects. I've applied to a lot of jobs, some of which I have been interviewed for, but for the most part, I have been completely rejected. I'll admit, my interviewing skills aren't the best because I am shy and nervous.

What I especially seems to be really hurting me is lack of internship experience. I did apply to a couple of places in college, and I did get interviewed, but I was rejected for all of them, and I just thought they were optional then, since my degree didn't require it. I still search for internships, but all of them require ""actively-enrolled students only"", and, well, I'm already graduated.

Anyway, I am a little upset that I can't find a job of course, but if I can't find an internship, is there any other job that can count as some good experience before an entry-level job? I have been a janitor for almost two years, but employers seem to be very unimpressed by that. Besides that, I am doing other things to help my resume. I am still working on more side-projects and I'm also going to meetups, mostly in hopes of networking. Also, I will continue to apply for entry-level jobs. I think what I lack the most is professional experience. But I'm not sure what I can do to get experience for an entry-level job."

Essays: 

I don't know. Some creativity in some of them, but I suppose I can fairly solidly say they were bad, or at least the majority of them were. Even though I poured my heart and soul into my Cornell supplement, I looked at a rejection the other day, and my main Common App essay was painstakingly crafted. However, I don't really see other things that could have been the real weak point, even though my extracurriculars aren't great, I thought the way that I structured my essays could help with that. I had a LOT of feedback on them from peers and teachers, and was told they were great, but it seems like they kind have missed the mark.

Thoughts: 

I really was hoping to get into a private school, and I tried extremely hard during app season to get write essays that'd get me into one. Unfortunately, it didn't pan out, and all of the private schools I applied to rejected me. I'm satisfied going to Berkeley, and it was my original dream school, but my girlfriend got waitlisted there and my best friend got into stanford and will be attending there instead of berkeley, so it seems like I'll be going at it alone, which dulls a little bit of my happiness. I don't want to sound entitled, because I think berkeley is an amazing school, and I'm honored to have been accepted, but I put a lot of work into trying to craft a good application and to see every single common app school reject me was just a sad event. Even making sure I got solid A's on all of my midyear grades, pulling all-nighters to balance the 5 APs and the 2 DE classes that I'm taking this year, was for naught. None of the schools that I was accepted to care about midyear grades. I did learn things about myself and about life through this process, and I'm glad I did exert the effort to succeed during the first semester and to craft my applications, but seeing all that effort mean literally nothing is a little bit disheartening. 

I'm assuming I'll get a bunch of people telling me about how amazing Berkeley is as a school and I shouldn't let it bring me even the tiniest twinge of sadness, and you're absolutely correct, but that's not really my point. The rejections sting, and adversity is only ever interpreted contextually, so comparing what I was hoping for to the reality of the situation is a little bit upsetting.

If I have any advice for current Juniors reading my post, it's that you should work on your essays primarily over summer and have them all completed for the most part, then get critique over the course of the months leading up to deadlines. Also, don't be afraid to not use an essay, even if you've worked on it for 30 hours, if you have an idea that seems more creative and more fitting. And, after you've written your essays, gotten critique, and been satisfied with them, submit your applications and stop worrying about it. 

There's so much in this process that's unpredictable, the best thing to do is just ride it out and try to occupy your mind with other things after the applications are submitted. People can say that undergrad doesn't matter, and while it's somewhat true, what's most true is that it's useless to concern yourself with that that is unchangeable. I wish I could be at MIT this fall, but I'm not going to MIT. I'm going to an amazing public school. It might not be exactly what I want, and I'm looking at 6 (basically 7) rejection letters, which is definitely not what I want, but I won't worry about it anymore. This post is my way of reaching a sense of finality with my decisions, understanding that sometimes life doesn't work out the way I'd hope it would, but that everything is still fine regardless. I've been happy at my low-income public charter school I've attended, or at least somewhat happy some of the time, so it's fair to say I'll be significantly more happy at an amazing public university that's better than my highschool in almost every way. And, really, putting aside my goals for success, what I want is to be happy. I won't let rejection letters limit my happiness. I won't give the schools that didn't like me that power over me.

After all this, I can say that I'm truly excited about Cal, and I'll see all my fellow Golden Bears there on Cal Day!! Thanks for helping me out on here and on /r/applyingtocollege throughout this process, you all have been amazing! I'm glad I got to ride through this insanity with the help of all of you nice folk on here."

Hi I'm 18 y/o and a 2nd semester freshman at uni.
just some random concerns i've had so far... (idk where im going with this)

I've pretty much screwed around in since my last few years of highschool (where I completely senioritis'd APCS) and my first semester of college. I took a basic Java course during my first semester at uni, and really found myself uninterested/unmotivated to do the labs/projects. I barely got by in the course and chose not to take the proceeding CS course the next semester. I didn't look into any internships because I felt i didn't have many technical skills other than basic java and I was a first year. Basically, I had an epiphany and realized that i should probably start taking college seriously, but i feel like I'm a bit behind. Now its almost summer time, and apart from working full time to pay next semesters tuition, what should i do to catch myself up with everyone else? (assuming I want to continue down the CS path)

TLDR;  I fucked up and learned nothing about CS so far in college. What coding languages/opportunities should i learn/find this summer to catch up to other ""second year"" CS majors?

Also is it normal for first year CS majors to feel completely useless? We have these coding labs and problems that we do in our courses, but how does all that translate to ""real"" cs work?

thanks :)

In order to understand what exactly they're doing, it might be a good idea to learn about the CAN bus.


I'd love to learn about in-vehicle communication (CAN, LIN, FlexRay, etc) and ECUs and things.

Are there any resources that can teach me this? I've looked into MIT OCW and there doesn't seem to be anything that can help here. Might anyone know if coursera/udacity/codeacademy/khanacademy etc has any classes/information sessions?"

Looking for advice on how to proceed into a career.,incmonkeyprogrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dhcap/3rd_year_cs_student_decent_gpa_lacking/,"I'm a 3rd year CS student, approaching the 4th year, with 3 semesters left. This leaves me with 2 summers with for internships. I have a GPA of 3.8 cumulative. I lack a lot of programming experience for a variety of reasons. I also have no working experience or internship to my name. The language I am most competent in is Java since it is what they teach at the university I am attending.

To sum it up, I've only started programming 1.5 years ago and have taken not too many CS courses. I've completed the intro to Java courses, object oriented design, and data structures and algorithms. I haven't done much programming in my free time since I wasn't so sure about CS in the first place. I also have no retained much from the courses. 

I'm don't have much interest in programming, but I am looking to find something that I can do. I've only recently smartened up and began reviewing my prior courses and started doing treehouse courses in Android and web development. I've completed one class project, and have no outside project that I've done in my free time. This leaves me with not much to put on my resume, but I am still looking for an internship to gain more experience and knowledge about programming in the industry. 

I've read posts for a few weeks and saw that QA is a good place to start for an internship. I don't believe I have the skill set to reach for a entry level software developer. If I do not get an internship, it seems, from reading posts, that I should work on a program or something over the summer to show off my programming competency. Is my line of thinking correct? Anything else that I am missing? I am looking to get back on track so any advice is much appreciated. "

I want to study in a business school for undergrad and these are my top three choices at this point. 

WashU has an amazing community/environment. I was there for a scholarship weekend and everyone was so kind. I honestly love it there. I also will be getting some scholarship money, which is a plus. Cost of attendance isn't an issue for my family though so it's mostly just the fact that I already am so close to a group of friends there that are so talented and amazing... I really would love to spend the next four years of my life with them/at WashU. The major problem I have with WashU is that it is not well known, which could put me in a bad position after graduation when I'm looking for jobs. Also during college, when I'm trying to find internships and stuff I feel like the connections/opportunities at WashU wouldn't be as strong as some of the other schools I've gotten into. Also, their business school isn't as highly ranked - they seem to be known mostly for premed. 

NYU also accepted me to Stern, which is SO GOOD for business. I do want to go into finance, so the job opportunities and internships there are wonderful for my future career. I definitely don't want to stay in the midwest after graduation, and apparently 57% of graduates stay in the midwestern area after graduation from WashU. Also, NYU is in the vibrant city of New York! I feel like you can't go wrong with that... However, I don't really like the campus feel - I want more of a traditional college campus... 

I also got into Berkeley (in state) and it's a really good choice I guess but I just don't like it. I know the type of kid that goes to Berkeley, and I really don't want to spend four years of my life with kids like that. The competitiveness/the asianness (i'm asian and I've spent my whole life around other asians. I want to branch out and explore! meet new people!) Also, it's too close to home. I want to be in a different environment! However, the business school is TOP RANKED, and it's near silicon valley which has amazing job opportunities, and I would have a much higher chance of getting a job on the west coast, which I think is ultimately what I want.  But I feel like going to Berk is such a typical choice, like everyone I know that does decently well in high school ends up at Berkeley. I kind of want to go somewhere else; take a risk for once in my life! 

Sorry for the long post, and thanks in advance for your advice. I really appreciate it! "

I am a third year cs student and i will be finishing this study year in june. I was thinking about doing an internship this summer, since i think i have the necessary skills to do well in a working environment and i want to gain some experience.

I have applied to around 30 internships online (a week ago) and i got 2 phone calls that went pretty good until they found out that i am available only for 3 months. Most of the offers are for ~web-devs, from startup companies and they are looking for a student that can intern for 6 months available for hire afterwards.

I also talked with one of my teachers and he offered me the chance to do an unpaid internship at my university in a research lab, i will be working with him, developing a project in Clojure. The thing is that i'm studying at a top university here in Europe and i'm burned out and this project isn't how i see myself spending 2 months of my summer.

I don't know if i should accept this internship if i don't get any offers or just use the summer to get some rest and learn the things that i never have the time to learn during my school year.

(Reading on system-developing, learning a scripting language [Ruby most-likely], learning LibGDX, continuing my compilation project etc)

I am trying to figure out what is the best thing for me here ...

Also if you could pls critique my cv that would help a lot... http://imgur.com/0TZW6xF

I did a search but couldn't find anything directly related to my question, but I sincerely apologize if I missed anything.

I'm a sophomore CS student with a few CS courses under my belt. I have a 3.9+ GPA and did a development internship last summer and a co-op last fall at relatively respected non-tech companies. However, over the past 2 years I have realized that I strongly dislike coding.

Other people have been in my situation before and the typical advice is that they should pursue CS-related careers such as product/program management, software sales, business analysis, etc. I'm a people person and have decent business acumen so this advice makes sense for me. However, my questions have to do with the availability of these kind of jobs.

How much harder is it to land one of those ""orbiter"" positions at the companies that pay good money?

What are the ratios of developers to BA/PM/Presales people at the top companies?

Can you not be super into Hackathons/Side Projects/LeetCode etc 
and still get those kinds of jobs?

I go to a a big football state school and not a top school like MIT/Stanford/Harvard. How does this affect my chances?

Could I switch to Software Development?

Looking up, it seems that some people value industry-related internships a LOT higher than research-related ones, but is this more or less a bias, or is there a solid reason one would turn down a research internship over an industry-related one?

The research internship is also paid with a $5,000 stipend, and from what I've heard, most internships are unpaid, so would that also influence a decision over which you would pick (unpaid industry vs paid research)? 

Am I correct in assuming the topic matters as well? The area of research I'm doing is Parallel and Concurrent Programming, and the mentor I have has MANY publications and is very well renowned, so I was wondering if the person I researched under also held sway as well.

I'm not humblebragging (... okay, maybe a little) but I want to know if some people who hire would dismiss the research as being nothing. Would you?"

Hey guys, unfortunately I was rejected from the College of Engineering under the biomedical engineering major. I think my low GPA is the main factor, but there were many circumstances that hindered me from being the best I could be. During the summer after my freshman year, one of my friends died due to disease, and that caused me major depression which led to declined performance throughout the year. Also, the fact that my father lost his job caused me to take on more responsibilities around the house, and thus lose time to study/pursue extracurricular, etc. In junior year, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and this once again threw my school year into jeopardy. This situation was also one that caused me a great amount of depression, and forced me to do most of the housework. My mom's treatment, which was at UCLA Medical Center, cost a lot, and thus I had to find work in order to help my family pay for my AP Testing which again took up much time. All in all, those events in my life have caused me to mature and note the fragility in life, which caused me to choose the major of Biomedical Engineering to help people in the future. Also, the fact that my mom was treated at UCLA gave me a personal connection in that I want to give back to the school that helped her. During my senior year, my mother having successfully gone through chemotherapy and my dad finding a job allowed me to do better than before and have more time to pursue extracurriculars. I believe that my other stats are within the bounds for UCLA, and I hope that UCLA will consider me in a new context. I am also considering asking to be considered for the major of Biology within the College of Letters and Sciences because it is more related to my future goal of being a physician and is a bit less competitive.

for people who didn't read my previous post i'm a 19 yr old uni student in australia and i've never had a job before and have been trying to find one since i finished high school. in all this time i've only ever heard back from 3 fast food places, got interviews at each and rejected each time. every time they ask about my lack of work experience at this age like it's some super suspicious horrible thing that i have to explain away and it's only gonna get worse as i get older. i didn't try to get a job in high school but honestly ever since i turned 15 i have felt like a ticking time bomb getting more and more worthless each year (bc workers up to age 21 get paid less the younger they are here) and gotten more stressed and pessimistic about my job prospects ever since i started looking, i should have just gotten a job back then, now i honestly feel like i ruined my life and i'll never be employable simply because i'm too old for fast food places which are basically the lowest starting point for part time unskilled jobs (trades aren't an option because i'm a short skinny girl). i know it's melodramatic but the more time passes the more i get stuck in this rut of feeling worthless and like my situation can only get worse, and i don't know how much longer i can stay unemployed before my self esteem gets so low that i will never have a chance at suceeding in interviews or even manage to fill out an online application without being completely overwhelmed by embarrassment at having the nerve to apply at something i'm so obviously unqualified for.

i can't even focus on my uni degree and i honestly haven't even thought about what i might do after it because i feel completely unworthy, how can i even dare to consider graduate jobs when i'm not even good enough to get hired at maccas? by this point even getting a minimum wage part time job feels so impossible to me that the idea of having any sort of ambition for an actual career is just a completely foreign concept that i can't take seriously because no employer in their right mind would ever take me seriously. i'm scared i'm gonna waste so many opportunities because i go to the top university in my country, am in an okay-ish field job prospects-wise (i think, like i said can't bring myself to research it properly) and have pretty good marks, but i'm never gonna have a chance at the graduate jobs all because i lack some kind of past employment and i'm so distracted by this i havent even thought about things like internships or networking, they just seem like some sort of bizarre fantasy concept to me. people talk and complain about sending out hundreds of personalised applications and struggling to find a graduate job within a few months, meanwhile here i am having sent out hundreds of applications over the past year to ever retail, restaurant, and fast food job i can think of and barely getting any response, i feel pathetic and humiliated and honestly the idea of having a career doesn't even register with me anymore because if i'm this hopeless at getting a minimum wage job that apparently most people can get with no effort then why even waste the mental energy that i don't have thinking about jobs that are actually competitive? it's another thing that makes me feel like time is running out because if i don't get anything before i graduate (and it gets more likely every day as i get older and have less excuse for not having a job and i get more and more pessimistic with each rejection) then i'm pretty much screwed for life, no place looking for graduates will want to risk someone who's never been employed before and no minimum wage place is going to want someone that old and inexperienced.

i did a short barista course to try and get a job at a cafe or something but everywhere wants 2+ years experience (yes i applied to all of them anyway, never heard back from a single one), i did a medical administration course that was absolute bullshit just intended to get a recruitment agency money from the government (they claimed there was a job at the end then i never heard from them again and the ""job listing"" is still open months later), i was a girl guide for ages which i keep hearing employers love but apparently they dont give a shit, plus i quit a year ago so it sounds even more pathetic to say ""i WAS a girl guide"" as the one slightly useful thing about me. i'm going to start volunteering at a cafe soon and honestly i would have started volunteering someplace earlier, i genuinely don't mind the idea of it and want to do something with my time except it feels like i'm accepting defeat - it's like the ultimate stereotype of someone who is basically unemployable, the first thing people suggest is volunteering and i feel like it's just going to be shameful to start volunteerig at a bunch of places now because it will be blatantly obvious that i'm just doing it to get a job.

i'm honestly starting to feel like i deserve all this, because i didn't work in high school while others were working from age 15 onwards and had no choice, i had the privilege of having more time to study instead and ended up being one of the top students in the year level and getting into a good uni, other students would have wanted a better uni/score but couldn't spend as much time studying due to work, i got what i wanted, to get into this uni, and i feel like i can't complain about not getting anything else even though i feel like not having a job is affecting every aspect of my life right now.

i honestly don't know what to do. i keep hearing fast food jobs are all about availability, at my mcdonald's interview the other day i told them i can work almost any hours, it was a 15 min walk from my house so i could easily and reliably get there, and in general the interview went ok (not great because as i said my self esteem keeps getting worse and its hard to really sell myself in an interview when i keep believing im a worthless piece of shit, but supposedly fast food places only want to know youre not really lazy or a complete weirdo anyway), i don't what else i could possibly do to please them other than............you guessed it, have prior work experience! i can't even rely on connections to get a job because none of my friends who live in the area have jobs either (makes me wonder if there even are jobs here??), they are in pretty similar situations afaik (although i get the impression not many of them are applying for fast food jobs because they think that's beneath them or something, tbh i didnt actually start applying to fast food places til about 6 months ago because so many of my friends had that ""ugh im not working at maccas"" attitude that made me kinda ashamed to apply, another thing that i wish i'd done earlier but can't take back now)

i'm not really sure if i'm writing this to get help or if i just wanna vent, either way advice is welcome, along with any commiseration or related rants you wanna make

TL;DR overdramatic 19 freaking out after a year and a half of job searching after finishing high school and never having had a job before, looking for a minimum wage part time job while at uni with barely any response (only heard back from a few fast food places, was unsuccessful), feel like time is ticking before i become completely unemployable due to lack of work experience, search for part time work is completely distracting me from actual career goals, situation is starting to feel completely hopeless and my self esteem keeps getting lower which only makes my chances worse"

I am totally up for things that would help me dive further into C or just things that I'd have to write that would impress the person. I think- at this point- I favor software development over web development, but I like both.

Anyways, I spent 2 years in CS being force fed information on programming and scripting and feeling like I was getting absolutely nowhere. 2 classes on JavaScript, 2 classes on C++, and a lot of mandatory garbage (at least in my opinion) classes in between being taught languages such as Scheme, Prolog, how to create circuits and microprocessors and other weeder classes where I was just shoveled PowerPoint presentation lectures and regurgitating info back onto tests to get a letter grade and then forgetting the info afterwards. 1 year ago I switched to a new program within the art school at my university and my degree will be a BA with a focus in Media Processing. This degree still has me taking many of the same computer programming courses but a lot less of the 'garbage' courses I hated and a lot more courses that have more bottle-necked teaching: Mobile Application Development, Game Engine Development, Mac Development in Industry and for the Media Arts, etc. I have only been taking these classes for a semester or so and feel I am learning so much more than I did while in Computer Science. But the thing is, I spent over half my time in college (5 semesters out of 8 to graduate) in CompSci feeling like I was going nowhere and learning nothing of value, or at least that the things of value I was being taught were not engaging me enough to the point of retention. Coding classes where I read off a PowerPoint from a professor who spoke broken English left me with programming skills that I feel are fairly inefficient and severely lacking in depth as I only really know basic Java and C++, with a very minute amount of C#. No Perl classes, no Ruby, no Python, none of the bigger name languages had classes here, and even if they did I am skeptical to how efficient they would be compared to just looking up lessons online or buying a book. The only real skill I can honestly say I picked up from college is that my ability to work in teams is pretty efficient. But with college debt looming on the horizon, I feel like I need to start preparing myself for the prospect of actually looking for a career, and this concept feels so foreign and terrifying to me. I don't believe I have half the skill of some of my peers who were in their program for their full 8 semesters, and I only have 2 internships that I can really put on my résumé; 1 of which was working for a local firewall company where all I really did was disassemble old firewalls, reassemble new firewalls, flash hardware and prep the systems for shipping with a small amount of on-site troubleshooting with clients, and another internship with Mayo Clinic that is about to begin working on creating medical simulators, and I don't even feel qualified for this internship.



TL;DR I don't feel like I have picked up any/many worthwhile skills that will prepare me for the real world or a career from college. I also feel like I have to find a job after graduating college asap due to student debt and the pressure from that doesn't help. Am I alone in this? And to any of you guys who have felt this way before, any advice? Will I learn half my skill set for a career in the field or am I to be expected to have the skill set going into the interviews?"

I came in as a bio major, however I knew going into medicine wasn't for me, so I changed to CS, with no prior experience in programming.

I wasn't learning much in that college, after two years I didn't even know what a method or constructor was. I really didn't enjoy CS, kind of just did it because I knew it would pay off financially. 

Fast forward to the end of my sophomore year(last year), I realized my current university wasn't cutting it, so I transferred to a top CS school in my state, even though it  meant I had to stay an extra year in college. The work load has been exponentially more difficult and time consuming, but I've actually grew a real passion for CS now that I'm finally becoming a great programmer. In a year I went from not knowing how to make simple codes, to getting an offer to be a TA for a upper-level programming class next semester. 

My issue is that I feel like it's getting too late to start putting myself in a good position to get a job after graduation. I can't take on an Internship this summer because I need to take summer classes( If I don't it'll take more than an extra year to graduate), and I wouldn't have time to take on an internship during the school year. I have no CS experience ( besides the TA job for next semester). I'm learning a new language every semester , but again, I feel like I need much more, seeing how competitive my university is. 

What should I start doing now to put myself in the best position to get an internship next summer, and potentially get a job after graduation?"
4dnbnc,1,2016-04-06,Should I bother negotiating internship offer?,negotiateinternship,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dnbnc/should_i_bother_negotiating_internship_offer/,"Background: I got an offer recently offering me $x per hour to work at a company that I am considering working for. 

This company is in a high COL area, and would require me to relocate for the summer. They don't offer relocation, and my apartment is still under lease where I live pretty much for the entire duration, plus my girlfriend will need to be living there anyways since we have our dogs/stuff there. This means that I will have costs both at my residence and during the summer.

The offer is probably *just* enough for me to scrape by if I don't do anything fun and literally pinch my pennies the entire summer, but that's even ignoring the cost to get out there. 

Should I bother trying to negotiate? I am still in the interview process with a few companies who I am more excited about and who probably pay better. Their hourly rate is equal to what I made last summer in my extremely low COL area, so I do think it would be hard to make it work. 

I know that internships are for the learning opportunity, but it would honestly be easier financially to just stay here at my current job (research), which pays only $1 less per hour and wouldn't require the extra rent and moving costs. They mentioned at least ten times how excited they were to have me there, so I know they really, *really* want me, but the money would just make it too stressful in my opinion for it to be worth it.

**TL;DR I was offered an internship that I don't think I can afford to take without significant sacrifices. I am in the final interview stages with 4 other companies. Is it worth negotiating?**

I enjoy going to school though, despite not having stellar grades.

I also have not done any research. Does anyone have advice on what I can do to increase my prospects of graduate school?

For this reason, I am curious to hear feedback on these company's internship programs. Has anyone interned at any of these companies before? How was your experience? How easy was it to convert to full-time? What sort of projects did you work on? How was the culture? 

The compensation is around the same. I know Cloudera is probably in better position (ton of VC funding, great revenue), whereas Pandora is in slightly unsure future - I heard stories of it trying to self itself. I am probably more interested in Cloudera's product (Apache Hadoop) than Pandora's music streaming service. I think Cloudera is definitely more innovative.

Because of the fact that neither of the two are determined, it kind of feels like a random position that the company could possibly fill up with anyone else. After talking with the manager for the program, I was told I was going to be doing some coding and business related things depending on the location. However, again I won't be told how much coding I will be doing. I'm worried that they may have me write one or two scripts and the remainder of the internship is more dedicated on the business aspects of it. 

I'm basically unsure on whether or not LDP internship is worthwhile. I looked on the subreddit couldn't find much and most things I could find on Google were stating it's not very useful. I was wondering if anyone else had experience with any LDP Internships. 

So the dilemma is, I'm a junior in college and I haven't had an internship yet. Since it's April I feel like it's coming down to the wire and maybe I should accept the offer and be safe as opposed to trying to hunt for another and potentially end up without an internship.

I'm a junior in high school looking at becoming a computer scientist some day. First, a little bit about me and my experiences this year.

I moved from another part of the United States to the northwest last summer with the only computer knowledge under my belt being an understanding of Scratch and a built gaming PC. I took AP Computer Science this year and soared. I also took AP Biology to test the waters and see which science I preferred. Long story short, Computer Science has won. 

I've learned Java this year under Microsoft's TEALS program (current Microsoft employees coming into class to provide help and guidance). Already I know much, much more about computer science than my peers back in the southeast, and while I've not always gotten an A on tests in the class, I've always made clean, concise code (according to my TEALS volunteers). Recently my class went a trip to Microsoft and I got the opportunity to speak with a Google employee who also does hiring. She said that my knowledge of Java in my junior year is a good jumping-off point for a potential out-of-college internship at the company, pointing to a link with everything Google wants from interns (https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html). So, with all of this in mind, 

1.  I've learned Java and will continue to test out small projects to hone my skills. That's a good start, but not when my peers are talking about how they know like, seven programming languages. **After Java, what's the best language to learn next? C++ or Python? Which one is used more often in industry?** The Google representative said that from most used OOP to least, the order is Java, C++, Python. Is this true? **After this, what ""other programming languages"" should I learn first?**

2. What the Google employee said could have been complete rubbish and he/she might have sugarcoated my standing in CS to potentially increase my interest in working there. **Is only knowing Java in my third year of high school a good start if I want to work at one of the Big 4?** 

3. **Any thoughts on where I should move from here? What did your senior year of high school look like? What should I do that's computer science related before I go into college (most likely UW or, if the fates align, Berkeley)?**

tl;dr I'm a high schooler looking to advance beyond Java in the future and go big or go home in terms of getting into a Big 4 company. Thoughts?"

I thought it would be cool if we have a conversation about everyone's upcoming summer internships if you have one planned.

I think it would be interesting if we could have some networking among ourselves as well.  So if you're up for it post the city and state your internship is in so we can pm and network if nearby.  

I can attest to the value of this as my internship this summer was recommended to me by a friend, and I likely wouldn't have gotten one without his recommendation.  

So I'll start.

They have basically every mainstream language (C#, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, etc) which you can rank and also basically every mainstream application domain (Web Front, Web Back, iOS, Android, Desktop, Databases, Dev-Ops, etc) which you can also rank. I'm not entirely sure what criteria I should use to make my decision. Is there some combination that would be particularly marketable and/or educational?

I work on a IT servicedesk for about 7 months now as an internship.. Yesterday we had some troubles with our Labelprinters (These are about as big, if not bigger, as your usual deskjet printer, and are a complete fucking disaster to work with.) Somehow the network configuration of printerY screwed up, all the sudden DHCP was turned on, this results in the ERP system not being able to print store labels or price tags. (Since the print server can't find printerY on it's static IP) 

With ease I found the IP that was assigned and remoted in to printerY webinterface, here I changed the IP.. Now comes the part where I fucked up: The store has another labelprinter(X) which IP ends .51. I meant to change the IP of printerY that had DHCP on to end .52 as defined on the print server.. I made a typo and saved the configuration. Great, now we have an IP conflict and both printers cannot be used. 

I phone call the manager of the store an appologize for the inconvience and ask him to unplug printerX that used to be working fine(ending in .51) so there wouldn't be two devices with the same IP. He asks one of the employees to walk up to printerX and unplug it. After about 30 seconds this seems to have happend, I remote in to the webinterface of PrinterY again to undo my stupidity.. Heh, I time out again. I call the store again and ask them to turn off printerX, they do so but the same thing happens again. 

Turns out employee was pulling the powercord, waiting 15 seconds and plugging it back in before I could undo my changes. 

**TL;DR made a configuration error on a printer resulting in an IP conflict - Asked store to unplug one of two printers so I can resolve the ip conflict - Employee keeps powercycling instead of turning it off.**"

Dear Carol,
I’m afraid I have a dirty little secret to confess! I assume you’ve already looked in the bag, and you’re probably wondering what on earth could satisfactorily explain me having so much of your clothing!
Well, here it is: sometime before Christmas, I was cleaning my laundry in the communal room, and I must have been in a great hurry because somehow I managed to empty the drier into my laundry basket without noticing that those were your clothes. Not mine!
Anyway,  it took an embarrassingly long time to notice my mistake – I admit, I’m not always the best at staying on top of chores!
Hopefully you’ll just find solace in the fact that you eventually got your clothes back. I still haven’t found mine, haha!

Dear Carol,
I feel secret admirers are somewhat outdated, don’t you? Therefore I hope you’ll forgive my decision to clearly reveal my emotions. I can easily see how happy your marriage is, and so please don’t worry – I know you love your husband, and wouldn’t want to leave him. Don’t feel pressured, but that just makes me want you more.
However, every single day I see you, I wonder, does anyone appreciate you like I do? The universe could not possibly adequately show its gratefulness for your beauty, grace and charisma. So I decided, a long time ago, to save you up some flowers, (I’ve been planning this since November!)
I hope it isn’t too weird that the roses are all dead. Since they’re so pretty, they’re so expensive, but I thought it would be sweet to give you a hundred, so I’ve been creeping around florists, and shoplifting for months. I hung each of them up to dry. That's how much I love you. All the effort is worth it whenever I imagine you opening your front door to a sweetened rustling and a torrent of red. And then you’ll have to dig though all that falling crimson, wondering just who cares enough to do all this, and eventually you’ll find this card...
It was me! I am the one who loves you!

Carol

Accent wall papered in teal flowers,

Flowing through my mind for hours, 

Spent in my cube version of your room,

White walls make a peculiar tomb,

You have more than a hundred knick-knacks,

While I only speak with an axe,

Your daughter’s room, yellow, blue,

Mine is empty, lonely too,

Nursery decorated with Ted bears,

My cupboard is full of prayers,

But my closet is full of dried flowers,

Yours’ hold a fascists trousers.

Dominic, 732

To My Darling Carol, 
I hope you're smart enough to think of a way to explain this to your husband! Just kidding – I know you are! So I got you this PlayStation!!! It’s the latest kind, I forget the number, but I’m so sure Maisy will love it!
Lots of Love
Dominic Candy
No 732

Dearest Carol
I know, I know – it must be dangerous to leave notes stuck to your door this often – who knows what your husband would do! But I just couldn’t let your generosity be overlooked. You donated more than three hundred and fifty dollars worth of electronics to charity this week – who could overlook that?! I swear, no one else in the whole city is so selfless. I know I should be offended that you gave away my gift, but I am simply blown away by your charitable nature.
I worry if maybe you only gave it away because you were scared of your husband. I hope not! It would be horrific of him to hide your goodness from the world. And to keep such a treat from your children.
So much love, Dominic Candy, no 732


29 May
Dear Carol,
I’m so, so, sorry, Carol, I know you’ll hate this. But just try to remember how much it would hurt both of us to keep our love a secret, and I hope you’ll understand.
It was difficult – please don’t think I’m trying to show you up as a mother! Quite the opposite, I’ve been planning this ever since your bastard husband sent the cops round my apartment in April (can you believe he did that?! Did you even know?) but you’re such a good mother. I can’t wait for you to have my kids!
Anyway, don’t worry! Maisy is with me!
Looks like you’ve finally got an excuse to visit apartment 732 ;)
Love from Dom


5 June 
Dear Mark,
I’m sorry for the sudden gap in my correspondence.  Of course, that cannot compare with my regrets regarding that night with Carol.
Words cannot express my sorrow. I am so sorry, I genuinely believed that your wife loved me, as I did her. Obviously I was mistaken.
It was this belief which engendered me to commit acts which the law technically calls kidnapping. I do not agree with this terminology,  but I apologise for any distress which may have been caused by me taking your loved ones.
I am, in fact, rather sorry I took Maisy in the first place. Given what I now know, this must have cause Carol incomprehensible fear.
I am also sorry that I could not initially comprehend Carol’s emotions towards me. It must be understood that at this point I had spent several months dwelling on my dreams, of Carol and I absconding with both the children. I thought our lives would be perfect. Therefore, I find it quite acceptable that upon her (rather violent!) entrance to my home, I, in my shock, fought back, and I even feel justified in my choice to transport her to my second apartment across the street, and to transport her body later on.
It has been rather frustrating to me that no media outlet (to my knowledge) has commended me for my dedication in keeping Carol alive, which resulted in at least 36 hours of further consciousness. I felt this was a considerable achievement, given her physical state (I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but during the majority of that period her skull had the crushable consistency of a 3D puzzle. I should be in medical textbooks.)
Anyway, if you can accept my apology, both me and Maisy would appreciate it if you could publish a press release acknowledging my kindness. For example, even if you cannot forgive my continued custody of Maisy, I believe our relationship would be greatly improved if she realised the sacrifice I made when I left Ben behind. I think that if you just tell her it’s okay to call me Daddy, she’ll accept me and be happy. 
Yours sincerely
Dominic Spencer

The problem is I'm only partway through level B1 in German. I've noticed most civil/structural/transportation engineering jobs require fluent German. Is it realistic for me to be able to land an internship somehow? I've tried looking at international companies with openings in Germany but didn't have much luck.

Please help,DesiSoldier,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4drfdt/so_confused_as_what_to_do_right_now_please_help/,"Firstly I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this. I am currently in a rather difficult situation and would love some insight from more knowledgeable people. So currently I have two main internship opportunities, one in London and one in Hong Kong. I am a UK citizen however I have been doing a year exchange in HK.

The internship in London is with IBM and I am currently at the matching stage which is their final stage where I would wait until they call me for a phone (business) interview or outright offer me a position. This stage has no time frame as they told me that it could take a while and to remain patient.

The internship in HK is a 2013 start up that deals in cryptocurrencies/advisory services. Both placements would be software development. The HK internship has just emailed me with an offer which I have to accept/decline by 11th April. The problem I have is that I would rather go with IBM as a priority. I also wouldn't want to accept the HK placement as a safe choice to cancel it if I got the IBM offer because they would start with visa applications when I accepted. So if I decided to cancel that would be really bad.

What should I do? My sister told me to email IBM and say that I have another offer and worded correctly it would make me seem like a desirable candidate. I would really appreciate any feedback you have for me. Thanks!"

Hi all,

I'm graduating this May. The startup I intern at has offered me a job. Now everything is great but the pay is a little low. 

It seems to me that 50-55k is good for starting out in Pittsburgh (would you agree?). I was offered just a little under 50k. What I would call a trivial amount. Now, going to 55k...well that's a bigger gap there.

So I want to ask 55k and take 50k. How do I take myself up? I already know the system. I've learnt a lot this past several months. I enjoy the job, the company, etc. Is that what I say? Like I don't wanna walk in like I'm some asshole who thinks he's a genius programmer, I'm not. But I do think I'm worth enough to get the newbie average.

Worst part is. I'm doing this in person, since I work here all the time. I'm pretty damn nervous. 

Thanks all!"

[It would be a dream job of mine to do what you do; freelance write (I am more privy to creative works\) and travel the world and attempt to enjoy all of the amazing offerings it bears.  My question is, what are the best initial steps towards making such a lifestyle a reality? What did you do before shipping off on your endless voyage and would you do anything differently?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tt2w7?context=5)|The initial steps that I took when getting started as a freelance writer was to create profiles on all of the writing sites such as Upwork and PeoplePerHour. I didn't have any previous writing experience, so I applied for any writing job I could and I took the bottom of the barrel jobs that really didn't pay very much money. I did great work on them, so that I could have at least something to include in my portfolio. Once I started to get a few things in my portfolio, getting the next jobs became a little bit easier.  I built the freelancing work up while still working part time - I would just write in the evenings and weekends. Eventually the freelance work started to grow to the point where I could go part time at my day job, then a few months later I was able to quite the day job entirely and make a full time income from writing.
 |Would I do anything differently? No, I don't think I would. The last few years haven't been perfect and we have gone through good and bad times and made mistakes, but I really have learned so much from everything I have experienced. I wouldn't want to change a thing, as I wouldn't be who I am today without the good and the bad. 
[Where does a freelance writer find the best bang for the buck?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1todjs?context=5)|When it comes to a destination that is very affordable but very rich in travel experiences to write about, you can't beat Southeast Asia. Of course, that means that there are a lot of other bloggers writing about it. There is also a lot of interest though.
[What's been your happiest moment while traveling, most humbling?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1todjs?context=5)|Back in 2011 we did what we called the ""Digital Nomad Experiment"" which was renting an apartment near the beach in the Algarve region of Portugal to try out this lifestyle and see if we could do it. When we realised it was working and that our dream could become reality, it was a very exciting time.
 |Most humbling? I think that seeing some of the poverty in certain countries was very humbling. It made us realise how fortunate most people are in the Western World, even if they are comparing themselves to their neighbours.
[How did you get started and how could i start? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tsiof?context=5)|I basically built up my freelance writing career while working a normal job (daycare).

I'm a freelance writer and that provides the majority of our income. Lee also works remotely making websites.
 |Where we stay and eat depends on the place. We are currently in Thailand, a place we use as a central hub when travelling in South East Asia. We are staying in a guest house in central Bangkok for around $15 per night. You can get cheaper, but we like this one. It's pretty comfortable for the price and has reliable internet which is important for our work. We generally eat out, it's just cheaper to do that here. When we are in more expensive countries we tend to stay in private rooms in hostels that have kitchens to keep the cost down.

P.s., I'm an undergrad from India!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1ttvil?context=5)|I write mostly about travel, but I also take on other projects as well. My advice when it comes to looking for writing jobs is to diversity when you start out and take any gigs that you can get.

We go through a lot of power cords. We learned the hard way never to put the laptop in checked baggage when one was smashed during a flight from Washington to Bangkok.

We really miss our friends and family when we are away and we often miss things such as birthdays, weddings and other events. I sometimes wish I could teleport myself around the world just for a night so we could be close to our loved ones on these occasions.

However, we go to so many different countries that becoming fluent in all of them would be incredibly difficult. Luckily, English is spoken by many people all over the world - especially those who work in the travel industry.

We were always greeted with big, welcoming smiles.
 |I think it might have been because there was significantly less tourism and travel in Sri Lanka in the recent past. It seemed like the people there were really excited to see visitors, rather than being jaded by them like some of the locals might be in other more popular destinations.

Some background: I'm at my second year at university, studying to become a computer engineer. I love my calculus classes, my physics classes and my programming classes. I can't get enough of learning more about the languages I know, but lately I've been feeling like the things I learned so far aren't useful, or are at a lower depth than necessary for the industry.

The languages I'm more comfortable experience are C and x86 Assembly. I've studied for a few months C#, C++, Java and Python,  but every time my interest fades, because I feel I'm just learning the basics and going nowhere and it impacts nothing on my life outside the university. I've considered applying to some internships in my area, but I feel like I know nothing that might be useful to someone.

I just want to make something using what I've learned that does something other than earn me a grade. I'm sorry for this rant, I just know what to do anymore.

Through work and other activities I've realized that my professional interests lie in supply chain rather than in communications and marketing.  I was wondering if anyone with experience could give me any guidance on how to enter this field.  

I am interested in hearing answers for these questions specifically:  

* Is it possible to get an entry-level position or internship without a supply chain bachelors or general business degree?  

* What would I have to do in order to get hired for those positions if not?

* Should I get a post-baccalaureate certificate from my undergrad university in additional to an APICS certification?

* Should I get a job as a warehouse associate while I look for entry-level jobs in specific areas like procurement and logistics?

* Are there any other things I can do to augment my experiences and resume for roles in supply chain?

* For those currently working in supply chain, what is your current role and what got you to that point?

I am currently a high school junior. The plan I thought I had was to major in chemistry and then apply to medical school. But, my mother is adamantly against it because of dangerous chemicals, and she says that if I can't get in to medical school, I won't be able to get a good job. And lately I've been doing more research and it's pretty depressing hearing about how hard chemistry/chemical engineering is, the few job prospects, the low pay, etc. My mother wants me to do business but I've never even thought about that. I've taken every AP science and I have a biotech internship lined up for this summer. It seems that the only well paying jobs for a bachelor's are computer science related, which I have no experience in (but am planning on taking classes next year.) Sorry for the long post, but I'd like to hear some thoughts on this. I don't even know if I would like chemistry when it gets really hard, or if I even want to be a doctor, and I know nothing about business or coding. I know colleges like to see students with *some* sort of direction in life and I'm just lost."

(x-post /r/labrats),dalamplighter,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/4dtr9u/should_i_be_worried_or_am_i_just_being_neurotic/,"Hi, I am an third-year undergraduate biology major, who hopes to one day become a researcher in his own right. I was able to somehow able to score an internship in the top lab in my field of interest, under a PI whose work I have followed for years (you would likely have heard of his work if you studied biology in college). So far, the PI seems to like me and told me I ""show promising signs."" This is obviously the opportunity of a lifetime, and I want to make sure I exploit it to the fullest (Please keep reading, I'm not trying to brag but merely give context for why I'm so nervous).

I started work 2 weeks ago, and though I am unfamiliar with some of the methods he uses, I have gained a basic knowledge of how these methods work and what they try to assess. I feel like I have a decent rapport with the post-doc I work under, but at least a few times a day, there will be a miscommunication between us or I will make a minor mistake. It will not result in any major issues with the experiment, but they take a few minutes to rectify before we move on. 

I would like to become a better researcher and improve upon my flaws (one being communication, obviously), but I also do not want to be perceived as lacking attention to detail or being an overall hindrance. What can I do to cut down on these miscommunications? Are these miscommunications and mistakes expected of undergrad researchers? Are there any things I can ensure that I do or do not do to make a good impression? Am I just being neurotic and worrying too much?

I'm sorry to ask all of these questions, I just really do not want to disappoint my PI!"
4du14x,3,2016-04-07,"I'm so frustrated with job searching, it feels pointless",Anthor325,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4du14x/im_so_frustrated_with_job_searching_it_feels/,"So I've been unemployed since February, I'm an engineer, who graduated about 2-3 years ago. When I left college I had all the boxes ticked, 2 internships in engineering related fields, a 3.7 GPA from a really top tier engineering school, several years of extracurricular activity, a great senior design project. I wasn't the super top of my class but I was reasonably close. But despite all those advantages I spent the year watching as all my friends, many of whom were less qualified than myself got jobs. Meanwhile I was rejected from the company I interned with, they never explained why besides the standard line about deciding to go with other candidates, this despite the fact that I had done exactly what they asked me to and tried to make myself useful to everyone around me. I got rejected from dozens of other jobs I applied for at career fairs, even though I got several different interviews. I know I interview relatively well because I did years of public speaking in high school and college and while i may not be perfect I'm pretty good at coming up with answers and being personable. 

So after spending the whole year getting rejected over and over again I graduated and had to move back home with my parents. I tried to connect with people I knew, but most of them weren't in engineering. The few connections I did make resulted in an interview where the interviewer literally asked how someone as qualified as myself didn't have a job, right before passing on hiring me a few days later. Eventually I found a job because a family member refereed a problem form work to me that required me to write a fairly complicated program, which I did in about 16 hours, and based on that I finally managed to land a job with an oilfield company as an engineer. It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it paid well enough and my boss was nice, so I stuck with it and within a year I went from being the new guy to being the go-to engineer for most technical problems. Then about a year and a half ago the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia decided to put us along with everyone one else in oil out of business. I held on through three rounds of layoffs and a bankruptcy filing based on my performance, before finally being let go when the company basically collapsed entirely (The last year and a half has been the worst time of my life thus far like a low point that keeps sinking lower every single day it drags on). 

So now I'm out of a job, and since the oilfield industry in the US is basically collapsing into a black hole and the city where I worked was mostly oilfield dependent I realized my only shot of getting a job would be to move somewhere else and basically switch careers. The end result was that I had to move back in with my parents at 25. Now I've been at it for about a month or so and all I get back in response to my applications is the standard thanks but we decided to go with someone else email. 

It's particularly frustrating because  most of the job descriptions for engineering jobs are nonsensically specific. Back at my old company I helped out with one or two interviewers and typically we were just looking for a relatively intelligent person who was ready to learn. But the job descriptions online are ludicrous, especially entry level jobs that require lots of experience???? I know that behind all these postings are engineers just looking for someone who can learn fast and solve problems...like me. But in between there is this impenetrable HR wall with algorithms that other people much like myself wrote that now filter me out from the job application pool because I don't tick all their boxes. (I even had a teacher back in college who described exactly this sort of thing happening when he tried to hire someone). Basically HR people aren't qualified to hire engineers because they know nothing about engineering. If I thought it would help i would just lie and pretend I did check all the boxes to get past the gatekeepers, but I can't bring myself to do that plus I think it may be illegal or something. Anyway that's not an option. 

I suppose I could try calling engineers directly, but back when I was working I actually had something like that happen to me and it made me feel that I really didn't want to hire that person even though he might have been a decent fit, I'm not sure why... it just did. Looking back I really sympathize with him now that I am on the other side, knowing you are qualified for a lot of things but unable to get your foot in the door. I had a few friends suggest headhunters, Aerotech is one that i worked with in the past right after college, but they really didn't seem very impressive to me, they took months to find anything and it was typically just contract work where any day can be your last for any reason whatsoever. 

It just feels like i am sitting there facing this massive wall with no way over, no way around and so my only option is to kick it down, so I kick and kick but no matter what I do nothing happens, and I know that if I could only get around to the other side and get a job I could deal with pretty much any obstacle, because I've done so int he past with great success, but I don't have that chance because it's impossible to even get a job in the first place. It all feels so completely hopeless and unfair. 

All my friends from college still have great jobs... why? Because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia didn't decide to make them unemployed, and that's pretty much the only differentiatior, some people on the other side of planet earth decided to screw me and not them. I know I'm not supposed to be measuring myself against other people, but it's hard to sit there while a bunch of people, whom you know you are just as capable as, have jobs, get to take cool trips overseas, and pretty much have a great time in life, while I'm stuck here desperately trying to find anything that will pay me a wage all because of reasons completely outside my control. I don't mean to sound jealous, because I don't wish them any harm or anything like that, I just wish who would give me a chance, because I know that I've succeeded in difficult situations historically. But this is the one sort of situation that I can't math and science my way out of. 

I've tried to go through my resume and highlight all my accomplishments, but it doesn't' seem to matter because I don't have the '2 years of experience with (insert specific software package)' and as far as the sorting algorithms are concerned, that's all that matters. Never mind that I've programmed my way out of all sorts of problems, or that I learned pretty much everything I did at my last job on my own, never mind that most people who know me are amazed by how much stuff in general I know, or that I can talk at length about numerous subjects, or that I've written at least six completed and unpublished novels in my spare time (At least one of which is actually decent) never mind that and a million other things. None of that matters because those aren't things that I can put on a resume, and even if I could, none of them check the job description box that the computer or the HR person is looking for.

When I went to college the people there loved to lie about how I could do anything, but the truth is that anymore it feels like I can't. I keep applying to jobs because I don't really know what else to do, it's a sort of personal holding pattern i am stuck in but every time I apply the rejection just gets worse and worse. Back before all this there were probably ten years of my life where I could count the number of times I had cried on one finger, but over the last few months it's gone from being something that I do when someone dies to something that happens weekly or anymore almost daily as the frustration grows worse. It's not any one rejection it's just the avalanche of rejection that feels like it's coming from every aspect of my life, including my job search, and each one makes it a little harder to get past the next one, like it's slowly chipping away at whatever willpower i have left.

Looking back, I'm sorry for the text wall, I didn't mean to write all this, and I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I just needed to say it to somebody, even if that just means one anonymous reddit account talking with another. I know there are people who have it worse than i do, but it doesn't make the frustration of being constantly rejected in job searches any less."
4dudgb,12,2016-04-07,"[Rant] dealing with crazy, hypocritical, and religious Asian dad.",chibichaan,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/4dudgb/rant_dealing_with_crazy_hypocritical_and/,"TLDR: I have a crazy, hypocritical, religious, useless, racist, Asian dad.

I've pretty much been lurking on this sub-reddit for a while and because of how my dad has been on his moods lately I've finally gotten the courage to post on here. A little background on myself, 23, fresh out of college working, but unfortunately due to various circumstances and stuff I was unable to get a job straight after graduation and was forced to move back home. While I'm currently working and saving up the money its currently not enough for me to move out with the amount of bills I have to pay with my student loans. 

Now onto my parents. I have a great relationship with my mom, at least I would like to think so. 

My dad is a whole other story, he's one of those asian parents who really dislikes the culture in the US and when I ""disobey"" him and stuff and goes off on how if I was raised in the Philippines i would have more values and things like that. He believes that he is absolute because he is the father and that he doesn't have to respect me because I'm his kid. On top of that he believes that he doesn't have to do the housework or anything like that and dumps all of that to me and my mom, he also doesn't get up or do anything for himself because he expects me and my mom to do it for him like serve his food. He also has various health problems, and he refuses to take his medicine and everything and it has already bitten him in the ass, but at this point I really don't care lol. (as harsh as that sounds but yeah). Earlier today he got pissed at me just because I didn't move my car earlier and I tuned him out and to punish me and my mom apparently he turned off the internet. (I'm using my mom's phone as a hotspot so I'm able to post this and rant) 

So both my parents are also super religious. I was always forced to go to anything religious, and when I turned 13, I began questioning everything I was seeing and I discovered what atheism and agnosticism was and I began identifying myself as agnostic while putting up with the overly-religiousness. Being super religious my dad is anti-gay, anti abortion, super conservative and all of that stuff. Since I don't agree with anything like that, my dad constantly believes that the reason why I don't believe in the same thing as him is because of the college I went to and it was too ""liberal"" and that I should've went to a conservative college so I would once again have values. My dad also has an incredibly annoying holier than thou attitude (anyone who meets him believes hes such a good person because hes so religious), he believes that anime and anything japanese is evil, like when I refused to do anything religious he would start blaming it on anime and japanese things because he believes that its made me hard headed and he hasn't put two and two together that I stopped being religious because of him shoving his incredibly crazy beliefs down my throat. He also believes that social media and that the ""pajama generation"" as he likes to call anyone my age has influenced me to not be religious. I constantly question everything he tries to shove down my throat and then he gets pissed by accusing me of worshipping anime and the devil. Nowadays though, I'm more catholic than agnostic but I do it on my own terms. 

Now his political views, if you're from the US, you've probably heard of fox news and believe me that's all he watches and he listens to those conservative talk shows, and because of that he has a serious case of Islamophobia.

So since I was in my junior year of high school, my dad hasn't held a job or anything like that and has become super stingy on money and everything. Recently he's been trying to find ridiculous ways to cut our money spending among them being cutting the cable and just relying on streaming sites. Another way he wants to cut spending is by cutting our internet access and just have us use our data plan on our phones. My mom and I have common sense and tell him, that its a stupid idea, and my dad says, it doesn't affect me I just use the internet for email anyway. I obviously call him out on it and he starts saying I'm disrespecting him and that if I want the internet so much I should pay for it. Also, my dad who doesn't have a job constantly attempts to keep me from going out by saying I should just stay home and do nothing and save money, and yet he goes out every weekend for a religious event. 

Now going off on the whole I couldn't move out right away and all that stuff, once again it was thanks to my dad indirectly. When I was getting ready to go to college, my dad kept pressuring me that I had to graduate within 4 years, while he himself graduated within 5 years. So much so when I got my schedule, I had the perfect schedule with the elective I wanted to take (Japanese) but I wasn't scheduled to take biology and chemistry at the same time, when he found that out, he personally dragged me to the academic dean's office in my school and yelled at the deans in charge of registration to put me in chemistry instead of taking Japanese. This had some consequences, you can image, because I ended up failing both bio and chem and my dad ""accidentally"" opened my letter addressed to me being on academic probation. Since that he realized that i wasn't going to graduate on time and forced me to take summer classes just so I can graduate on time. Thanks to that I was unable to do like an internship and get some experience in my field since most internships were usually in the summer. 

Now onto the judgemental part, most Asian parents believe that their kids are morbidly obese no matter how skinny or muscular they are. I know I'm incredibly overweight as an Asian but most people see me as pretty fit and stuff like that. My dad would tell me that I looked better when I was younger because I had a bowl cut and because I was ""skinnier"" too. He would constantly judge me for my weight and he would say look at me, I'm skinny and I'm healthy, when he's clearly skinny and looking like he's not healthy. (if that makes sense). Whenever he judges me for my weight I would call him out and say ""you were bullied as a child and in order for you to make yourself feel better you project all your negative energy on me by making fun of my weight"" then he would go off again on me being disrespectful. 

I pretty much call my dad out on a lot of things with the end result of him acting like a little kid and throwing temper tantrums. Like I said earlier in my post, in order to ""discipline"" me and have me ""respect"" him he turned off the internet thereby pissing off both me and my mom. I'm 90% sure that my dad is a narcissistic parent because of the way he acts and I was going to also post this in raisedbynarcissts. Dealing with an Asian parent like him, I had to resort to standing up for myself by calling him out on all his bullshit which he calls ""disrespect"".

What I want to know is how much does it really help me? Does it allow me to command a high starting salary once I graduate (and if so how much more), or does it just make the transition from academia to industry less of a shock since I have somewhat of an idea how working in industry is like from these internships? I just want to know how much of a difference having internship experience really makes for the average student?

Also for my specific situation 2 out of my 3 internships where dealing with software development, the 3rd one was system administration and network architecture (no big 4, just a defense contractor and 2 medium sized tech companies on the east coast). Thank you :)!"

The big company is near my place, and the start up one requires me to reallocate. But in the end, after minus all the expense, the money I get will come out equal.

In term of experience, I like the smaller, start up more because I think I will learn more there (better mentorship, more connections), and I will actually build features that make impact to the company. Their project also interests me because I am going to use all the cool stuff: Django, Python, React + Flux...
The smaller one also say they will consider full time employment offer to me after I graduate, if I perform well in the internship (Which I desperately need, since I am an international student).

The bigger company, closer to my place, I can commute there, the team, that I am going to work with, is actually pretty nice, small team, but the project is as not interesting, C#, PhP, Database, Refractor &amp; clean up other's people code. However, the company said they will not make any commitment to consider hiring me after I graduate.

I had done my previous internship with a small start up, and I actually learned a lot. That's why I prefer the start up one more.

In short, The bigger one will look good on my resume, but I will actually learn more from the startup.

HOWEVER, I have to accept the offer from the bigger one tomorrow, I have been stalling, asking for more time, and they already gave me more than a week.
The smaller one hasn't sent me the official offer letter yet, they emailed me the ""casual"" offer (with salary), and they are contacting my references before sending me the official letter, they already knew about my deadline.

So my question is, what should I do? :( Should I decline the official offer from the big company for a ""verbal"" offer from this small company?

Am I making a right decision when I chose the smaller, start up company?

Thank you!

What should I do?",pineapple_catapult,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dwswu/accepted_a_software_engineering_internship_but/,"So last week I verbally accepted an offer for a software engineering internship (10 weeks full time, paid, 22/hr).  While waiting for the written offer to arrive, I interviewed at another place for a Data Analyst position and was called back for a second interview next week.  It's full time, and I'm thinking it will pay somewhere in the range of 45-50k + full benefits and 5 weeks paid time off (pretty decent for my area, I'm not in some crazy expensive region like the Bay area or NYC).   I'm thinking that I could be getting an offer from this company, the first interview went well.  I still have one semester of school left after this (graduating in December), and I think the company offering the full time position is willing to work with me for that, as my classes would be mostly at night anyway.

I'm conflicted as to what I should do:  on one hand, I have a solid internship lined up for the summer, that pays way better than the job I have currently, and is more in line with what I want to do (I went back to school specifically for programming/software engineering), and I'd have to renege on the offer, but at the same time, a real full time job is hard to turn up.  And, I'm not against a big data type job, I just didn't necessarily see myself in those shoes when I went back to school.  It could be lower stress/pressure than doing a programming type job, which might fit my personality better.  I'm just a little conflicted and was wondering if anyone could provide some insight."

They haven't hired anyone for ML till now but my interviewer (and also my would-be mentor) told me that they are hiring a data engineering guy. As it is a startup, he is expecting me to work a lot at the place and they are offering a good salary based on the area. So, it will be gruelling work for sure. 

I am really excited for the position but I feel low on confidence on coding interview questions because of my lack of preparation. Straight after the internship, on-campus placement season will begin at my college to hire for full-time opportunities. I am nervous because I don't know how I'll manage time to practice my interviewing skills and prepare for interviews while juggling with the internship. Some people I have talked to are advising me to prepare for interviews in August rather than taking up a summer internship as I am not expecting to take up a full time job at the same startup as well. Needed advice from you guys on the same.

Right now I am able to travel for free because my dad works for a major airline. I have gone overseas a handful of times, but it was always to the same country for a week or two, and I spent most of the time with relatives I couldn't connect with very well due to the language barrier. This privilege lasts for another year or two.

On the other hand, I don't feel like my university has instructed me enough in my field, which worries me to no end. An internship would likely be my best shot at gaining experience and becoming desirable in the job market after I graduate. Choosing to do this feels like the more responsible decision, but travelling and getting outside of my comfort zone seems fairly important as well, as it would force me to actually talk to people to around. Any guidance would be very much appreciated.

Me: Recent grad school grad (Envi. Sci with significant coursework in GIS/stats) who has been looking for work for about 6 months.

Potential internship position: Small planning department, working on transportation/zoning mapping and other various planning tasks.

Here is my quandary: this internship is slightly out of my area of interest (I'd eventually like to end up in something with both GIS and environmental aspects) but pays decent ($15 per hour, midwest USA) and has long-term potential. My hesitation is that since the department is so small, there isn't anyone else in the office with a ton of GIS experience that I could learn from- I'd basically be on my own or asking advice from other planning commissions and other connections the office has (what they have said they've done in the past). I did some investigating and their past interns have stayed around 1-2 years each- so I'm thinking they couldn't have been that unsupported? I'd say I'm pretty good at teaching myself things as well. Hours would be on the higher end of part-time.

I have an official offer for this position, but am also waiting to hear about a second internship I interviewed for that is closer to what I'd ultimately like to be doing, is under a GIS specialist, full-time, but also has a much shorter duration (typical summer internship), and pays only $10 per hour. Both internships are public sector positions.

At this point, I've been looking for work long enough to not want to wait for something better, I'm feeling so lazy and worthless sitting at home doing nothing (other than trying to teach myself python) and want something to give me some experience and income while I look for a permanent position. 

Should I go ahead and accept the longer-term planning position with less guidance that is not quite what I'd like to do- or hold out to see if I get offered the shorter-term lower-paying position that may give better experience in the field I'm interested? Thoughts, advice? "

I'd be interested to hear about your situation and if you have found happiness in computer science. 

I'll first start with where I'm at currently. I'm a sophomore at a public university in the mid-west studying computer science with a focus on security. My grades are good and I'm an intern at a fairly large company doing very low-level enterprise-level IT tasks. I also tutor computer programming a couple days a week at the school I go to. Considering these jobs plus classes, it's quite a lot of work.

Now, how did I get here? When I started to pursue computer science a few years ago, I set out to really learn as much as I could. I started with programming and have since expanded to many other computer science topics like design, operating systems, etc. I have really learned a lot about IT as it relates to business but also have an intrigue into what is to come with more advanced computer science topics. Through all of this, I never found something that has fulfilled me. That feeling you get from a day well spent from accomplishing something meaningful has never been felt. Each night I double-down and say ""tomorrow is the day when I will be fulfilled"" only to be disappointed by idiot students that come in for tutoring or one of my fellow desk jockeys at work. 

One of the reasons I think this is, is because my time has not been allocated to the best of my ability. Sacrificing regular social interaction for more work and more classes has not paid off. Moreover, cramming my day with mind-numbing work leaves me mentally exhausted at the end and wanting to be alone. My mind is very scattered at times and doesn't quite have the time to relish what exactly I am doing with my life. It's the feeling of ""going very fast, but going nowhere"". It's almost to the point where I can't sleep or eat. I literally have dreams where I am trying to solve a problem and get stuck in an infinite for loop. Maybe it's my bladder signalling that unless I go to the bathroom, I can't proceed with the dream, who knows. I also find myself eating abnormally, eating large meals, skipping meals, etc. Even with a roommate, living has really gone downhill. 

So what does this mean for the future? Without finding other like-minded people --especially in the computer science field-- the path seems short and dry. But, by taking on a new project, meeting new people, bouncing a few ideas around, I think I can experience the path of computer science which is long and fruitful.

Is this on par? How have you found fulfillment in this field?"

I've been tasked with finding two summer interns and creating a program for them for 4-6 months. Ultimate goal is to hire one or both of them if they work out. We are looking for seniors about to graduate from either business or CS/IT programs. Help desk experience preferred but not required.

We are a MSP and mostly deal with Dell servers, Sonicwall firewalls, VMware. The primary objective is to have them help us create standard documents (mobile device setup, spam information, email continuity, etc) plus shadow help desk calls. I want to teach them how to talk someone over the phone get connected remotely via LogMeIn Rescue. Once connected, help desk staff will walk them through fixing the issues.

Now, we have enough work to keep one intern busy full time but I pushed for two. My rationale is they should spend half their time working on client documentation stuff and half of their time learning. I am going to set up a lab and have them go through the Introduction to Windows Server course on pluralsight. I also am going to have them go through a bunch of specific vendor sales/technical training courses.  

I think getting two interns is better than just one. This is focused on teaching them the basics of IT. In my mind, two interns will be able to both bounce ideas off each other and share ""war"" stories with each other. I see the learning curve being pretty steep so the students will have each other to lean on for the course work.

Sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR - Hiring two interns. Have enough work to keep one busy full time, but with two I want to structure half of their jobs in a way that will teach them IT basics. What do you think would be the best things to teach two super green IT interns and how would you do it?"

I've received summer internship offers from two mid-late stage startups in the bay area. I'm having some trouble choosing between the two.

The role at company A is going to be more DevOps focussed with probably most of the code written in Bash and Python(one of my stronger languages). At company B they've promised me a ""breadth of projects"" that will help me gain experience in various facets of software engineering so I feel it'll be a little more full stack i.e. more Java/Javascript (both of which I don't know). 

Considering this is an internship, my main goal is to learn as much as possible to allow me to apply for full time roles as a backend software engineer in the Fall. I feel I'd enjoy working on the core product of a company. Building the product from the ground up. DevOps doesn't seem to fit that category and the opportunities offered by B seem to be more conducive for that. 

However, I don't want to make a hasty decision and go for company B without inputs from other people in the field!

Now that I've spoken about the background of the two companies I'll come to the questions I have (about time!).

1. If I were to take up the devops intern role, would I automatically eliminate the possibility of applying for full time roles in the field I mentioned above?

2. Are the skills required for a DevOps role different from those required of a software engineer who works on the product itself i.e. the engineers who use the tools that DevOps builds?

3. Are DevOps engineers looked at differently by software engineers or vice versa? (Sorry about this slightly awkward question!)

That pretty much sums it up. Any comments/answers would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks guys!

I will apologize if I have any typos as I am typing this on my phone on the go and I will try to make this short.

I am currently on my last year of college. I am graduating with an Applied Math Major and minor in Computer science. I was planning on going into engineering. However my current GPA is not where I want it to be, which is 2.7. This is not like me at all, and was depressed and had problems that affected me in college. I know I am very capable of doing better and have been the best semester or two. 

The thing I am worried about is that, im just ""screwed"". I won't be able to get into graduate programs or finish a degree in engineering like I wanted to do with such a low GPA. I really wish I took a semester off early to rethink things, but my family pushed me to stay in college but I do not want to blame this on them. I also still have to do an internship and have a summer and fall semester left to do so. 

I am feeling like ""this is it"" and ""this is the end"" and won't make it in life. It is in the back of my head everyday and affects my mood knowing this. I know it really isn't the end of the world but it is just upsetting that I KNOW I could have done better but I messed up. 

I would like the honest truth and any advice would be appreciated."

I am 25 years old. I graduated from a respectable state school with a B.S. in Psychology, certificate in Neuroscience, and a minor in Biology just about 2 years ago.  After graduating, I realized my degree was kind of worthless (ok, I realized before graduating, but I was already too deep in and I loved what I was learning). I moved to Florida, and ended up working as a line cook. I love to cook and enjoyed this, but even getting above standard pay for a line cook, I knew this was not an industry I wanted to stay in. I started applying for different schools and ended up accepting a scholarship at the state school I graduated from for an M.S. Health Informatics program. After 1 semester, I realized I had no idea where I would fit in or find a job. So after 1 semester I switched to an M.S. Data Analytics program. I ran into the same problem, I was learning things that just didn't apply to me because I didn't have the fundamentals of computer science. Yes I am learning a lot, but I constantly look at job descriptions, and didn't feel at all like I was gaining the skills needed to get a job I desired.

tl;dr - I have a b.s. in neuroscience, minor in biology, lots of experience in the restaurant industry, and I am half way to a M.S. in Informatics with a specialization in data analytics.

This semester, I have taken a concepts of programming languages undergraduate course, and have steadily been completing online programming tutorials. I also have an internship creating public health data visualizations for a non-profit (which I love). I have found a huge disconnect between the masters program, and the skills needed in industry. I want to stop the Master's program and focus on learning web development. 

SO..... My question is whether I should go for another B.S. in computer science, or just try to learn on my own for the sake of not building upon my already frightening debt situation, and how to pay the bills during this time (may be a question for another subreddit, I know). I have taken concepts of programming languages, and this summer I am taking server-side programming for the web (I have to be enrolled in 3 credit hours to continue the internship). The internship is paid, but it is pretty much just enough to handle my bills. 

tl;dr - my question boils down to whether I should get a B.S. in computer science or learn informally on my own. Also, is there a good way to earn money and get good experience while doing this? 

I think I want to eventually be in web development. I also really enjoy data visualization, and would love to eventually work in big data analysis. I am pretty familiar with general concepts (control structures, loops, subprograms, data types, parameter passing, databases and such), and I am experienced with Python, Java, a little C++, SQL, and I am now learning HTML and CSS (planning to learn Javascript next). For my internship and through the program I have used Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, KNIME, R, and SPSS. Job descriptions are vague and list a lot of requirements, experience, and degrees that I don't have. 

I will give any more details if necessary. I guess I am just looking for advice on gaining skills and earning money at the same time while I get to where I want to be, and a formal post-graduate education was not cutting it for me. "

Advice on the switch / negotiation.,stozzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e2kea/considering_a_change_advice_on_the_switch/,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can. I'm 10 months out of college with a BS in CS. I'm currently making 65K as a software engineer in the eCommerce sector of a large agency. My company has tried to pigeonhole me into more of a consulting role since I'm one of the few members of the team who have experience with the ExactTarget platform and one of our clients depends heavily on it. As the only technical resource on the project, I've learned a lot, however, it's not what I want to be doing in the company. I have pushed many times to get put on more projects that require more traditional software engineering and not consulting work, and have only recently been put on projects that will allow me to grow in the direction I want. There are many other reasons I haven't been happy here regarding the culture, management, and overall growth.

During the time that the management had been pushing against my interests, I was looking elsewhere for employment. A previous manager of mine during an internship has recently joined as a partner at a startup company doing similar eCommerce work. One thing led to another and after a couple of interviews I have been offered a position at this company. I've already determined that I want to go to this company. The people there are extremely talented and I know I have the drive / mentality to do well in a startup environment. My internship under the direction of my old manager went very well and I have a good working relationship with him. I see a lot of opportunity to contribute and grow. 

I'd be employee #9 at this small startup. Initial offer of 75K. 0.25% equity in the company. Healthcare and 401K, but no 401K matching. I made the mistake of telling the manager before the interview process that I'd be looking for something in the 80-85K range. My cost of living is quite low, and 65K has been plenty to keep me happy and be able to live my lifestyle. That being said, I do want to be solidly in that 80-85K range. How should I negotiate to get a bit more? It is a startup so I know money is tight, but I do have some experience in the field and do think I'll be a solid contributor. Should I ask for 85K? Or would asking for more equity be the long-term right ask?"
4e2oby,7,2016-04-09,Need help deciding between two colleges,Flagauster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e2oby/need_help_deciding_between_two_colleges/,"I am a senior in high school and will be entering college this fall. I live in New Hampshire and I will be majoring in Computer Science.

I have narrowed down my options to 2 schools: University of Washington and University of New Hampshire.

I am in a big predicament. There are three reasons:

* I absolutely hate being in a small town/rural area like where I live now (small town of 2500). Being near my family kind of sucks, they always are fighting and there is not a lot of love amongst each other, so it's not the best environment to be around. Also, there is no opportunity for me here, and I can't stand how the ""rural/country"" way of life works. I want the city more than anything. I have spent some time in Chicago already so I kind of have a feel for it, and it was great. I definitely want that kind of life. So the difference between Seattle, Washington and Durham, New Hampshire is huge. I feel like just being in Washington will help me land internships and maybe have some opportunity to work at some great companies, or even some huge corps like Microsoft/Google whatever. Obviously my sights are set on Washington for that.

* UNH is basically where all the ""bros"" from my school go. B's and C's students that just kind of chill and go through school like ""whatever man fuck it hahahhahaha amirite"". From my understanding, UW is not like that, especially for Computer Science. I really want to be somewhere where I am surrounded with others that want to learn and excel and just be in that kind of atmosphere, not some place where the kids from my old highschool 20th in their class go to just bro out.

* Money is the most important thing for me. Say what you will about me, it's fine. I understand the dislike for my money mindset... but money is extremely important to me for many reasons. I want to have the opportunity to have a great salary, by whatever means necessary. I know this sub hates the extreme circle jerk around ""big 4 hur dur"", and I do too, but I want to be wherever the money is (where is it?). So yeah, the biggest factor here is that I want to maximize my salary/money making ability and maybe UW will help me get my foot in the door to those opportunities (or will it not??)

So yeah, the final big kick with this is that it will cost me around $30,000 per year to go to UW, and I have a full boat to UNH. My parents will be a helping (roughly $10,000 a year), so UW is really $20,000 and if I go to UNH, they will set the money aside (so $40,000 waiting for me when I get out of UNH debt free, versus $80,000 in debt out of UW. So $120,000 difference...)

I really don't want to stay in NH at UNH with the same old shit i've been living in for the past 18 years... I really wanna leave here and go to the city and start my own life. But I dont know.... this is a fuck ton of money we are talking here... Is it worth it?

I really need help here guys.... the more the better. I just wanna hear it straight. Which school will help me make the most money? Which will offer me the best education/best time? Or does it not matter? Thank you for reading!"

She's interested in CS as a major/career, and has registered for a Visual Basic programming class next semester.  Her high school also has three CS classes (all Java) with the last one being AP CS, which I'd imagine she'll eventually take.   I was wondering what productive ""things"" she can do during summer breaks, but also potentially during the school year as well.  I'm thinking summer programs or (optimistically) internships.

I thought of three optional (but preferred in my mind) criteria.  Feel free to say whether any of them are unreasonable:

* Requires physical attendance.  My sister's first brush with coding was a Codecademy Python tutorial a few months ago.  However, she never completed it because she got ""busy"".  Self-learning/building websites is a simple option, but I'm not confident that high schoolers have the best diligence.
* Hosted by well-known companies/organizations/universities.  I feel that their programs would be better structured.  Participants will also get some familiarity with these types of companies (Big 4, startups, etc.) and universities.  Google has their [summer camp](https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/computer-science-summer-institute-cssi/) but its for graduating high school seniors, which doesn't satisfy the next criteria.
* Can help with college applications.  This basically means that the ""thing"" must have started by application period, which is around the beginning of senior year.

That's all the criteria I can think of.  What would you guys suggest?  Hopefully this thread can be a useful resource for aspiring computer scientists in high school."

I found a great place in VA, but like so many other apartment complexes in the area - subleases and assignments are not permitted by the original lease agreement. The apartment management and the current tenant suggest that I be added to the lease instead - I will be added to the lease in May and the lease will end in August. I'll be paying the rent for that period. 

He will vacate for the summer months and will apparently be out of the country. He will return at the end of the lease period. He has already payed the deposit on the apartment.

I am also concerned about the current tenant's request for a furniture deposit. He asked for a deposit to cover potential furniture damage which will be returned at the end of the lease period. 

**I have several questions**:

1. Can I be liable for damage to the apartment that occurred before I was added to the lease?
2. Will a separate agreement between myself and the current tenant, in which he agrees to vacate for 3 months will I pay rent, be enforceable? Would there be anything stopping him from simply moving back in? Would that be unenforceable as basically being an assignment?
3. Can I terminate the lease agreement if he does attempt to move back in? 
4. If he does not return, or keeps my furniture deposit, would I be entitled to deduct my losses from the original deposit on the apartment?

$1000 CAD (Canadian)

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 I can overlook if some of the following are missing: 6+ hours of battery life, a GPU as strong as a AMD 7850 (probably being delusional, but it's a 3-4 generation old GPU, so I'm sure there's mobile chips that are just as strong as that desktop chip), sturdy case (I won't be hiking up the matterhorn anytime soon, but I would like it so at most, it dents after being dropped 3-4 feet onto wood) 

* **How important is weight to you?**
 Like I said, I won't be hiking with it on my back. That being said, the lighter the better, but I'd rather have weight rather than bad performance. I am a stickler for the height of the laptop when the case is closed, so anything under 3.5 cm would be appreciated)

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 Doesn't matter, I'll just buy windows if I have to

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 1600x900 and above is great

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
If it can run league of legends at high settings, have 20 tabs of chrome open, and have photoshop just running in the background, I'd be insanely happy! If it can record, even better! Otherwise, my most used softwares are League of Legends, Skype (in conjunction with the former), Photoshop, Chrome (I use a lot of tabs), and rain meter

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
League of Legends at high settings. I'd like to play games like Far Cry 4 at medium settings, but I don't care too much about heavy gaming. After all, after I do my summer internships, I'll be relatively loaded for a desktop!

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I'd like a decent keyboard. I don't care much about the trackpad since I'll be using a mouse, not to mention I do most of my navigations through the keyboard anyways. I do need a decent webcam though (Idk what's considered good, but I'd like a decent picture resolution so that you can tell I have nostrils at least)

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I live in Canada. I am not open to purchasing a refurb laptop, and I'm willing to use just about any trustworthy site (Amazon, Newegg, Ebay trusted-seller, Tiger Direct, i.e.). Also, I don't trust Lenovo after they pulled two shenanigans in 3 years, so I'd really prefer not to go with them!

* SAT: 2330 (December 2015: CR 760, M 800, W 770). Should I take the new one?
* ACT: planning on taking this junior year, since some colleges I want to apply to don't accept it for my year.
* PSAT: 1470/1520 (CR 720, M 750) didn't study, since it doesn't matter this year
* SAT Subject Tests: Math 2 800, not sure what to take for my science (was planning on physics but I have found out that I am incredibly bad at physics), humanities?
* GPA: 4.00 UW, by the end of my junior year if all goes well I should have a 4.84 weighted. APs and GTs count as 5, Honors 4.5, Regular 4.
* Class Rank: not given until senior year, but I know for sure that I am in the top 10 out of about 350.

**Coursework:**

* Summer school: Health and Lifetime Fitness, counts as 4.0 in GPA
* 9th: English 9 GT, Precalculus GT, Biology GT, US History GT, Computer Science I Honors, Spanish II Honors, Art I
* 10th: AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science AB, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP US Gov and Politics, English 10 GT, Chemistry GT, Spanish III Honors, also self-studying for the AP Chinese test
* 11th (projected): AP Calculus BC, AP Microeconomics/Macroeconomics (taking both AP tests), AP Biology, AP World History, AP English Language, Advanced Data Structures GT (CS IV), Intern/Mentor GT (elaboration below)
* 12th (projected): AP Physics C: E&amp;M, AP Statistics, AP Psychology, AP English Literature, Differential Equations GT, Advanced Object-Oriented Design GT (CS IV part 2), Student aide (probably for computer science or math)

TL;DR: 13 AP classes, 15 AP tests.

Additional Details:
I have one of the most rigorous schedules of my grade. Five other kids are taking AP Calc with me this year, three other kids are taking AP CS, and I am the only sophomore in Mechanics.

My school uses GT classes to give students a solid foundation in the AP version of the class. The weight is also used to mark classes which don't have an AP equivalent as challenging.

Intern/Mentor GT is a special research-based class that my school offers, where students are paired up with mentors (university professors, company employees, etc.) and work at their mentors' workplace for at least 5 hours a week. They must come up with a research paper topic (or do what their mentor tells them to do, especially if in a STEM field and the mentor is currently working on a project) and write a paper on their findings. Popular places of internship for computer science/engineering are JHU APL and NASA Goddard, both of which I am ineligible for because I don't have US citizenship :( but I will probably end up at University of Maryland College Park. I was also considering JHU’s downtown campus but the commute is an hour and it doesn’t seem to be worth it.

At my school, our AP Calc BC and DiffEq teacher is a former professor from MIT :) (known for his involvement with a particular card game back in the 70s) and I hope to get his letter of recommendation.

**Extracurriculars:**

* FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) (9th - present), treasurer this year, hopeful Captain for the next two years
* Programming Club (9th - present), vice pres this year, will be President for next two years
* FBLA (10th - present), my first year, Desktop Application Programming. States is coming up next weekend and not many people do this event so I'm feeling hopeful for making nationals, probably will not try for an officer position, and may drop next year because the timeline overlaps with robotics too much
* Maryland Technology Honor Society (10th - present)
* Math Tutoring (10th - present), at nearby middle school once a week
* Piano (8 years, plan on sticking with it for the rest of high school), testing for my Advanced Certificate in a month, Senior Theory Award
* Karate (4 years) first brown, don’t think I’ll be able to earn my black belt before senior year
* I plan on applying for NHS when I’m a junior.

**Summer:**

* before 9th: took Summer School to get Health &amp; Phys Ed requirement out of the way
* after 9th: CTY Investigations in Engineering at JHU, SAT camp LOL not going to mention this one
* after 10th: Terp Young Scholars at College Park (3 credit tech class), might intern at UMD/JHU to get Intern/Mentor hours early so I’m not panicking and scrambling for hours come robotics build season. What else isn’t too late to apply for at this point? I don’t want to sign up for an expensive pre college program at a prestigious college, because it just sounds like a waste of money. Do they actually help in admissions?
* after 11th: planning on applying to RSI and all of the summer programs at MIT. Any suggestions for other selective programs?

Also, an issue somewhat unrelated to school:
In elementary school and middle school I loved creative writing, and I would spend hours a day roleplaying on forums, even starting a bunch of my own. In 8th grade however, as my attention shifted to programming and technology, I slowly lost that passion, and now I can’t bring myself to write creatively anymore, unless it's for a school assignment. One, I’m constantly stressed and I never seem to have enough time for anything because I have a huge problem with procrastination (hence, my addiction to this website). Two, I’m terrified. I guess I can’t think as romantically as I used to anymore, and now whenever I write like two sentences, I criticize the hell out of it and quickly become discouraged because it sucks so much. Either that or I find it too cheesy and I cringe so much I have to delete it. My writing is still fantastic -- for essays and literary analyses; I’m also great at addressing abstract ideas and explaining them in vague and profound ways (read: bullshitting). When I try, I’m one of the best, if not the best writer in my grade, verified constantly by every English teacher I’ve encountered. But when it comes to generating and implementing my own ideas as stories in creative writing, I just can’t anymore.
I really want to find pleasure in writing again, but I also don’t know how to make myself start writing again. I’m afraid to start again, and it’s going to take time and effort that I can’t spare right now.
Any thoughts?

I think my main problem right now is that I have no hooks or awards.

If I manage to get something cool done through Intern Mentor, I may participate in Siemens or Intel.

As of now, I plan on applying to:

EA: MIT, Caltech, UChicago, College Park (safety: 140 kids from my school were accepted last year)

Reg: CMU (CS 1st choice, Eng 2nd), UPenn, UC schools, JHU, Cornell, HYPS just for the hell of it if I find the time

Suggestions (for extracurriculars or for college choices)? The more thorough, the better! Thank you so much for reading all of that, by the way! I really appreciate it! :)

4e5a4v,0,2016-04-10,I am from a poor background. Should I stop hanging around with wealthy and successful people?,ronsoness,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4e5a4v/i_am_from_a_poor_background_should_i_stop_hanging/,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the best thread, but here goes.

I am from a very poor and dysfunctional family. My dad died at 3, then my mother's schizophrenia emerged at 5. They were farmers from another country before immigrating to the US. I ended up in foster homes at 10. Dirt poor, traumatized, socially not adjusted, and with no one looking out for me. Then I did a funny thing. 

I was going to this middle school in a very ghetto part of my state. I mean, minorities and immigrant kids amok. Bullet casings found on my campus sometimes. Dress code is full of gang-related things. And I got street cred for living in a shitty street. Anyway, I apply for a scholarship to this high school in my state that was $10k/yr tuition (today it's $20k/yr ) and where the smartest kids go. I got in. 

High school was hard. I was socially not adjusted and being from the poorest segment of society and then going to school with people from the wealthiest segment was rough. There were scholarship kids there too, but none were probably living in a foster home.

At 18, I graduated high school and also got kicked out of my foster home. My social worker told me I had scholarships for college, so I went to my state college. There, I was living on my own. Working shit jobs like stock boy, janitor, retail. I was catching the bus, then riding a moped. I was shit poor. Yet, for some reason, I was constantly around middle class + people. I also ended up befriending many of those kids from my high school. And then I kept meeting more middle class + upper class people. I even got a sweet internship through a wealthy friend that paid me $20/hr while in school. I started hanging around people and going clubbing with them... they had nice cars and didn't even work. 

When I graduated, I moved to another country to be an English teacher. I was still around middle class + people. They were all educated (you have to have a bachelor's to teach) and I don't think any of them were poor like me. The problem was that teaching was a dead end job, and I wanted more for myself.

I moved back to my home state to try find a job. No luck. With a 2.9 GPA, I simply couldnt make the cut for the jobs I wanted. I'm a smart person, but I lack experience and mentorship. I ended up being self employed for the past 4 years as a web developer, making a living wage, doing fairly interesting work, but feeling like I am not doing anything with my life and not living up to my potential, work-wise, status-wise, and money-wise.

The worst part is that because I have been around so many middle class+ people and went to a prep high school, so many people I know are now with great jobs and ""successful."" It's easy for me to see the connection between their resources and their current success, but it really makes me feel like shit. 

So my question is this: should I stop hanging around wealthy and successful people? I feel like they are good to know and I can learn much from them. Yet it makes me feel so poor and inferior. Yet I can't hang out with poor people because I have little  in common with them anymore and some of them lack ambition and just talk about the same stuff over and over."

So I'm an incoming Maths &amp; CS student at a top 10 UK university, and I've been exploring the tech space for a while. In my search, I've pretty much confirmed that it is possible to land internships in the US from a UK school, but I wanted to expand upon this a bit. So without further ado, here are my questions:

Perusing my LinkedIn network, I've come across numerous Imperial grads that have undergone Software Engineering internships in the US, and not a significant number from my Uni. Are the top tech companies more welcoming to Oxbridge/Imperial students or can a Warwick/Bristol/Edinburgh student get an interview too?

How possible is it for me to apply to far flung offices (i.e. Google Tokyo, Microsoft HK etc) without full fluency in the local language? Would my CV be binned straight away?

It's common knowledge in the UK that most students complete internships in their penultimate year of university. However, if I were to apply to the US HQs of some of these top tech companies for an internship before my penultimate year, would I even be considered? Also, are there any other programs besides Google's STEP program?

How should I position myself best during my first year (projects, knowledge etc) to stand a chance coming from the UK?

Thanks :)

This guide applies to incoming freshman in the summer, freshman, and sophomores. **Edit** - This advice isn't for everyone. Life isn't just all about work, and you're young and you have so many opportunities to experience and learn about the world. Also I'm just a sophomore. I don't know as much as most people on this subreddit, but I've talked to many recruiters and currently recruit underclassmen for internships. Feel free to not listen to me.

I'm a sophomore studying CS and Economics at a rank #40-50 school. I've managed to be successful despite the low ranking and low GPA. I had an internship after freshman year, and have one secured this summer at a good name. I also get into summits and scholarships based on all the work that I've done.

You're going to study Computer Science this fall. Yay! Your school might offer a BA or BS. What's the difference? Honestly, general education requirements. You still take the same CS courses. 

Okay you probably took AP Computer Science, and aced the AP exam which means you got placed out of the introduction to CS classes. Most likely your first CS class will be on data structures. Most of your interviews for the next three years will be based on what you learn in this class, so you better pay attention. At my school, we implemented and built data structures while in a real life setting, you can use libraries with pre-made structures. Building the structure helps you understand how and why it works. 

Maybe you didn't take AP CS. Okay then you'll probably take an Introduction to CS class which teaches you a programming language and the basic syntax. Usually these classes are in Python, Java, or C++. 

**Also, don't expect to be spoonfed everything you need to know in your classes. To me, the CS classes are to develop your thinking and problem solving skills. Outside of class, you'll teach yourself what you need to ""know for the job"".**

Everyone has their own goals but here's how you can succeed if you want internships after freshman, sophomore, and junior year, and hopefully employment after senior year:

Often internships and job applications will ask for your resume, occasionally a cover letter, and then links to your portfolio and online presence. 

*  Make a resume, Github, LinkedIn, Twitter, and account on whatever company you're applying to. I've filled out maybe 100-200 applications and probably &gt; 50% ask for Github, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  **Why do I need a Twitter? Applications have asked for it and with an online presence, recruiters can reach out to you. Twitter is not necessary but doesn't hurt to have one.** Also, you better make a website. Teach yourself HTML and CSS, and use an easy framework like Bootstrap. Your website should display your portfolio and links to your profiles and accounts.
* So now you have your Github and portfolio, but you have to fill it up with stuff. Make projects and teach yourself new technologies. Go to hackathons. You can find university hackathons here - https://mlh.io/ If you don't enjoy staying up for 24 hours developing awesome software, then yeah just teach yourself. You can easily google ""how to build a web scraper"". Also check out subreddits for project ideas. You can also join student groups at your school or ask your friends to work on a project with you. 
* Omg what should I learn? What languages and technologies? Which frameworks? If you really want a specific list, explore the occupations that you'd be interested in and usually they list out qualifications. They'll tell you what technologies, stacks, etc. to use. 
* You're a freshman but there are lots of freshman internship programs. Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Pinterest, and Facebook all have freshmen internship programs. Just google ""Google freshman internship"". Make sure to apply all of these and start looking starting in **September** or **October**. For big companies, the internship applications usually close up in **November** and for medium sized companies, they start in the spring and end in **March**. Get your shit together and apply, otherwise you're going to lose amazing opportunities. Don't be lazy. 
* Apply to as many internships as you can. Google ""software internship"" and tons of listings show up. Getting an internship is a numbers game. The more you apply to, the more likely you'll hear back. As a freshman aim to apply to 50-100 internships. 
* Use the resources at your school. Your school might have a career center that does resume review. Attend all the career fairs. Check out which companies are visiting your school and attend all the info sessions. Network, network, network. 
* Interview prep - look for resources on this subreddit, get Cracking the Coding Interview, and solve hackerrank coding problems. Also a lot of coding challenge interviews use hackerrank, so you'll get used to the interface of an interview when you practice on hackerrank. 

Anything I leave out please comment suggestions and corrections. If you want any help, please private message me. Thanks! Also I don't know why people are trolling, but I just wanted to offer advice :/ "

However, I am from Southern California, so I am worried that the cold will force me to stay in my dorm all day and be miserable. I have also heard bad things about their campus food (lack of healthy options). Arizona has better weather, and is closer to home. However, I like the big city atmosphere, and UofA seems to lack it (and maybe the job opportunities and internships that come with being near a big city). I am also worried that the partying at the school will negatively influence my grades. Arizona does seem to have a more active lifestyle, and more healthy food options. Both schools come out to be around the same price, and I plan on studying political science (with a possible environmental studies minor). Can someone  please confirm or deny my assumptions about each school, and give me some opinions on where they would go and why? "
4e738e,11,2016-04-10,House Sitting,awkwardmeghan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4e738e/house_sitting/,"Ever since I started as an intern at my current job, I have done a good amount of house sitting for several of my coworkers.  A few qualities make me an ideal house sitter:  1)  as an unpaid intern, I desperately need the money  2)  I am in my early twenties and single with no pets, so little household responsibilities of my own, and 3)  I am fairly responsible for my age and a bit of a hermit, so need to worry about having strangers over for a party in someone’s house while they are away.  

Recently I was house sitting for a coworker for 10 days, 10 nights while she and her husband took their two young daughters to Washington to visit family.  Their house is located in a more rural subdivision where houses are on an acre or more of property, so each house has plenty of privacy.  During my stay there I was only responsible for taking care of two low maintenance cats and a very elderly golden retriever, Ripley.  She’s such a sweet dog, but is almost completely deaf, has cataracts in both eyes, and has some hip problems, which means she spends almost all of her time laying down and sleeping.  

Normally I’m always a little apprehensive the first night I stay in someone else’s house.  It takes time getting used to a new location, new routine, new bed, new noises of the house settling at night.  I was exhausted my first night at this house after a long shift and oddly enough fell asleep without any problems.  The next day I came back to the house after work, parked my car in the garage, and entered the house through the garage door which opens into the kitchen.  From this door you can either walk left directly into the kitchen or go straight down the stairs that lead into the basement.  It always gave me an uneasy feeling to shut the door to the garage behind me and look straight down the stairs into the dark hallway of the basement.  There is also a bank of light switches to the right of this door for the kitchen, garage, and basement.  However the wiring in the house is a bit odd, so it never made any logical sense which switch belonged to which light.  I would often end up flipping two or three switches before finding the correct one I was looking for.    

That same night I fed the cats, gently shook Ripley awake to feed her, and watched Netflix on the couch.  The cats went outside and the dog slept in the same spot on the carpet in the living room where she had been seemingly 90% of the time since I’d been there.  Like I said, Ripley was sweet but she only ever got up to eat or go to the bathroom outside.  Around 10 I decided it was time to go to bed, so I walked around the house, making sure the doors were locked and heading to the kitchen to turn off the lights before I headed to the other side of the house to the room I was sleeping in.  When I went to turn off the kitchen light switch next to the door, I mistakenly turned on the light inside the garage.  I glanced through the window in the door leading into the garage as I flipped the switch off and froze:  there had been someone sitting in the passenger seat of my car.  My breath hitched and I felt a painful rush of adrenaline in my toes as I flipped the switch back on.  There was no one there.  Just my car and the gentle swinging of the bare bulb that lit the garage.

The next few nights were uneventful, but I dreaded each night when I would have to turn off the kitchen light, making sure not to accidentally touch the switch to the garage.  My fourth night there I made the same mistake.  This time, although my car was empty, there was the figure of a man just at the  base of the stairs into the garage.  I screamed, turned to grab the phone, but when I turned back he was gone.  I called my friend, Brian, to help calm me down, and he convinced me it had just been a shadow, and my paranoia was getting the best of me. 
As I was shutting down the house the next night I made sure, again, not to touch the switch for the garage light.  As I turned to head for the bedroom I realized I had mistakenly turned on the switch for the basement hallway.  I peered down the stairs in horror as I noticed the same figure at the base of the hallway.  I grabbed my phone and ran out of the house, begging Brian on the phone to walk through the house with me and make sure no one else was actually there.  Brian stayed that night on the couch and there was no sign that anyone else was or had been with us.  

My ninth night in the house I made Brian stay on the phone with me while I turned off the lights in the kitchen.  Once I was finally convinced it was safe, I ended the call and headed down the hallway to the bedroom.  I stopped walking when I noticed Ripley was standing, facing me in the hallway.  Her cloudy eyes were focused past me as she started barking.  I hadn’t heard her bark once since I’d been there.

I never made it to my tenth night in that house.

How would one transition from area of the field to another?",dy_over_dsex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e8v1h/if_i_do_an_internship_in_web_development_will_i/,"I've accepted a summer internship at [non-Big 4, southwestern company]. I'm really excited for it because I will getting paid to code which is really where I want to be, but I'm concerned that I might not be ""as happy"" in web development.

Notably, the internship is explicitly for frontend - not even full-stack stuff. They have some interesting stuff going on with Backbone and React, so it won't just be vanilla JavaScript (which is nice), but the interview involved a fair bit of CSS questions. I know CSS stuff, but I just find it **incredibly, incredibly boring.** Honestly, I don't get as excited about problems that are sort of ""design-based."" I find much more joy in the problem-solving that comes from ""ooh, how do we represent this data? How do we transport it from A to B? Ooh, what algorithms do we need to use here?""

My favorite language is Java, but I've been having a lot of fun doing my undergraduate research in Haskell (I'm well aware that the job market in Haskell is VERY small). I think currently I'd really like to be working either on enterprise software (that might be - but doesn't have to be - web-facing) or stuff on the backend (I've been learning some NodeJS in my free time, and it's really exciting to me, too). I know C decently enough (haven't touched C++ outside of helping fraternity brothers who use it for their freshman programming classes or aerospace engineering coursework, though), but I don't feel like I'd enjoy embedded much. Mobile is interesting from afar but I'll see how I feel about it after my capstone project next fall semester (which at my university is to build an Android app).

---
---

Ultimately, my worry is this: I take this internship doing mostly/entirely HTML/CSS/JavaScript; maybe I even go work there for a while after graduating - but then, any time I apply for a job as a ""software developer"" or ""software engineer"" with other technologies, I'll be instantly rejected on the basis of a lack of experience, and my career won't be as satisfying.

Are my worries unfounded? Has anyone here made the switch from webdev to other stuff?"

Edit: If anyone is interested in helping me make a decision, I'll list the pros/cons(that I know of) of taking the internship.

Pros:

* Experience in the IT field(possibly helping with getting a developer internship). However they did say there would be a good amount of grunt work, so I'm unsure how much actual IT stuff I will be doing.
* 

Cons

*  The pay is less(- $3) than current job
* I will have to stay at school during the summer. I wanted to spend a lot more times with friends over summer as I feel I've been neglecting them. Side-cons of this are buying/preparing my own meals.
* Most likely leaving current job, which I would like to keep for as long as possible. My current job is online, and I'm basically a camp counselor that gets to work from home.

Im taking all the same Computer Science courses as a person doing the BS would, so I don't think my computer science foundation will be hurt at all, but I am starting to wonder if when employers see that I only took Calc I &amp; Stats in college, it will raise some type of red flag? Specifically, I was talking to someone in the field who was going to try to get me an interview for an internship next year and he said he looks for how students did in Calc III.. I didn't say anything, but whats weird is he hires from my college all the time but the BS students don't have to take Calc III so I don't know where thats coming from.

I'm having a hard time choosing between two summer Software Engineering Internships. I have until end of day on Tuesday (4/12) to make a decision. Here's the breakdown:

First, both companies pay the same and rent in both cities are roughly the same. So the financial component of this decision has been completely removed (thankfully)

Company A:
The company has hired 6 interns to work on an intern project together and present to leadership as the conclusion of the internship. As a group, we'll have access to a few mentors. The tech stack is .NET and React/other JS frameworks. Company based in my hometown.

Company B:
I've been paired up with a Lead Software Engineer who I'll be reporting to. The stack is PHP/Javascript and maybe some Java. Based out of state for me. 

For background, I graduate next year with a B.S. in Math and am looking to make a career as a Software Engineer.

So I'm most concerned about which internship will help  most in that..am I overthinking it? At the end of the day, does it matter because either way I'll be working on a development team?

Also, should the stack each company uses be a factor? I ask because I know .NET is everywhere with Enterprises and I rarely see PHP on job applications.

Any advice/insight/anything else anyone can share will be so greatly appreciated! 

Thanks!"

4eb93u,2,2016-04-11,I'm in the middle of crisis mode to try and find a job. I have no idea what to do right now and need advice.,JustinPSports,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4eb93u/im_in_the_middle_of_crisis_mode_to_try_and_find_a/,"**Warning: This is a long post because it's kind of a complicated situation. I feel it's better if I explain as much as possible than to leave out any context.**

For the past month, I've been trying to find a job. I've been applying for positions across Canada related to what I studied in college - journalism - and a few retail openings.

I'm in crisis mode right now because I have only gotten any response for two of the more than dozen applications - one saying they would email me in May (which is not a sure thing in my opinion since it was sent in March) and another which led to a job interview over the phone which, in my opinion, was a complete disaster.

I don't feel like I'll be able to find a job in my field because I didn't graduate from that third-year program. I also don't have any opportunities to add any new stories to my portfolio outside of doing stories for the college program's newspaper in September - an offer which felt like a slap in the face because it showed how confident my professors were for me to be able to find any work despite getting praise from all of them for two and a half years.

I also don't know if I can accept any job offers out of province because I only have a G2 license. That's because my mother refused to let me get a G1 until I had to force her to drive me to the DriveTest facility when I was 18 years old and refused to teach me - I haven't even driven since my G1 Road Test in January. I was only able to get the G2 license after she let me take driving lessons. As well, I can afford to buy a car right now, but can't afford to pay for car insurance or gas until I get a job. In the journalism field, having a driver's license (sometimes a G2, sometimes a full G license) and a car is required to even be considered for a position. Also factor in all of the things you need to do when you move and I have no idea how getting an out-of-town job will work out.

I also can't find any retail jobs that I'm even qualified for because most of them require at least a year of experience. Also, I live in a city that, up until two months ago, was 'The Unemployment Capital of Canada' (unemployment rate dropped because a local car factory hired a few thousand people, which led to spin-off manufacturing jobs). That being said, I'm competing against 300 people for a lot of the applications I make in this city. Also, those retail openings are few and far between (there are more than 300 openings - mostly full-time positions - posted on Indeed.ca right now). The only types of workers in demand in this city right now are for people who are coming from my college's trades and apprenticeship programs. Also, before you ask, the temp agencies don't have many non-factory openings right now either.

Now, why am I looking for a job right now? Well there's a few reasons:

1. In January, I pulled out - not dropped out - of my college program at the time due to a mental health crisis and was planning to take the time to work on my issues. I was also told I could go back to finish the program the next school year. Instead, I'm now worse than I was before in part because I've been struggling to find any places to get proper help in a timely fashion (and not in six months to two years) and because the program is now cancelled for 2016-17 because only one person registered (most people planned to enroll in April. Also, the college wanted 25 students to register for a program designed for 12 people at once).

2. I'm sick of getting disability payments for having Asperger's Syndrome (which never affected my stories or classwork. While it's on the mild side, my social skills are not that great for things like casual conversations). Some people both online and in my personal life have judged me because I get just enough money to live on my own - $610 a month plus $500 a month for rent. I can't afford to buy food more than a couple times a month or buy a car to get around with how much I have to pay in bills. I can barely afford to pay for the bus as it is. They also judged me because my grandmother saved enough money and then some to pay for my tuition and equipment.

3. Because of what I've said in the other two points, I've been told by some people such as mental health professionals, my family and even a Statistics Canada surveyor that I should just keep staying in the house all day and/or to not bother getting a job for now. The StatsCan person also told me I'm listed as permanently unfit to work. I'm sick of people telling me I should work in a store or trying to give me booklets for hospitality (cooking for restaurants) courses at a community centre or offhandedly saying I'm delusional for wanting to go into journalism - one person even said I'm delusional in a psychiatric report because of that. I just want to prove everyone wrong.

4. At the same time, I'm also feeling pressure from some of my former classmates too. After everything that happened earlier this year, I had one of my better friends from the program I was in tell me she and everyone else noticed me slipping downward. But, while some people tried to give suggestions on what to do and walked away back then, they also thought it wasn't a big deal ""because I was the perfect journalist"" and thought I could deal with them on my own. A lot of them (especially in the second year of the journalism program. Before you ask, the program I pulled out of is separate from the journalism program and is technically its optional third year) keep telling me I'll be the most successful out of all of them. I also have people telling me I should go into magazine writing or photojournalism or anything else they feel I'm best at. I have a lot of pressure to not let those people down too.

I'm just in crisis mode about all of this. I'm sick of sitting around the house all day hoping to get lucky or to hear back from an employer. Some people in here might say to keep doing that, but I'm losing my mind doing so. I feel like I'll be able to get my mental health back in order by doing a ton of work at a job. I also want to get the heck out of this city as fast as possible and can't do that if I have to work retail or in a factory for a few years.

So, what am I supposed to do right now?

UC Santa Cruz on the other hand has a beautiful campus, still a good CS program and is close to silicon Valley.

4ec08v,21,2016-04-11,Overcoming Third quarter slump and Anxiety,thirdquarterslump,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/4ec08v/overcoming_third_quarter_slump_and_anxiety/,"Every semester around this time (around third midterms) I get into a stupendous slump. I get overwhelmingly depressed. I don't leave my room the entire weekends. I find some sort of substance or activity to abuse and escape into. I feel genuinely anxious about everything to come. In short, I get into a really negative spiral. This is after doing reasonably well during the first portion of the semester. 

I am doing it again. Previously these activities and avoidance harmed just me. For example, I lost an A in a class that I had a 97 one summer. This was unfortunate but fine. Now, as a junior, more people are depending on me, between parents, girlfriends, classmates, lab-mates, and groups I am leading. My actions are hurting them and impacting them, and this is bothering me. It hurts seeing the disappointment in my parent's eyes when they come to me for support, and all they find is me hiding in fear of life, shirking all responsibility. In semester's past, I was able to keep this part of my life secret from my family and friends, so all they would see is an acceptable GPA and assume all is well. Somehow, I let it slip this semester. 

Usually if there is some sort of organized activity, like a lecture or a group meeting I am fine. I go there, just so I can accomplish the bare minimum, and I go to sleep a nervous wreck. But whenever there is little to no structure like on the weekend, I devolve into a state of anxious, substance abuse. It will start off with ""just one for old time's sake"" which will cause immense guilt that will then explode into a weekend long relapse where I accomplish no work or have any fun. Sadly, this has been each weekend since mid-February.

I am not sure how to get out of this negative spiral. I keep digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole. In the past, I have tried to ask for help, and each person has helped me to the best of their abilities. However, for a number of reasons, that I am not too sure of, I keep finding myself in this situation, each and every semester.
 
Like at the moment, my life *should not* be stressful, and I *should not* be in this state of anxiety nor should I be trying to escape reality. The assignments I have remaining are things I have managed to do well on in the past. My schedule is fairly light, after dropping a course. My ""future is bright,"" as I have a summer internship offer at a pretty high profile company. My friends and family really support me, and come to my aid. Like all things are well, but I am just falling back to nervous, anxious, avoidant old me. I really have nothing to complain about.

So my questions are:

* **How do I get out of the negative spiral I am currently in?** I have basically completely disengaged from my life for the past three or four weeks. Replacing it with anxious substance abuse, and each time I try to get up, I convince myself, ""it's too late. You already screwed up so far.""
* **Has anyone experienced this before and overcome this**
* **Does anyone have any insight why this keeps happening at the exact same time each semester?**"

Heres my lengthy write up. Photos attached in Imgur Link. 

The name of this PC comes from my 2 favorite Anime Characters in Naruto. Neji and Itachi and hence a fusion. So far naming all my PC’s and routing equipment using an Anime Motif. 

I knew from the beginning that I wanted to build a killer game PC but I previously did not have the means to do so. After getting an internship I made sure to save up as much funds as I could to put towards building my future PC. When it comes to my electronics I never hold back and I usually always go for the top-of-the-line (I’m often told not to do this but I can’t help it  ) I immediately decided that I would have to go with the 5820K, it was one of the best CPU’s in Intel’s enthusiast/professional class CPU’s at the time and it was a pretty good price at that. I also had to wait because I knew that I would need to get the 980ti. It was just a rumor when I first heard about it but I decided that I would hold off and wait. 
I purchased pretty much all of my parts on Amazon since I had prime and I can get everything in 2 days. There were only a few items that I can get on Amazon such as the custom cabling as well as the H240X. I built the PC around August 2015. This was actually my first ever pc build. After this I built the other Bankai Build for my siblings. 
This build may seem over the top on price but considering it was built summer 2015 this was the going price for parts back then.

I went with the CPU simply because of its performance was Intel’s top-of-the-line and I had to have it I decided to pick it up in Micro Center since it can be had for a little bit cheaper than Amazon at the time.

**CPU Cooler- Swiftech H240-X 90.0 CFM Liquid**

This was a really good performer at the time and since I wanted to expand my loop later to water-cool the GPU and CPU so I decided on Swiftech for their modular coolers. Let me tell you however these things are very hard to get. They are sold out almost instantly and you have to keep checking their website every day. I had a whole fiasco and you will see that I bought a corsair cooler in the meantime. I learned that you do not want to power up your system especially without a cooler. Plus the X99 series CPU doesn’t come with a stock cooler since Intel expects the enthusiasts to buy their own lol. I bought a corsair H100i GTX then I bought a H220X when I found one online. However The H220X I bought had issues so returned it and got the H240X and have been happy ever since. This is why some photos above have the H100i GTX. 

**Thermal Compound- ARCTIC MX4 4g**

Not much to say her. One of the best thermal compounds you can get from all the reviews on it. 

**Motherboard- Asus X99-DELUXE/U3.1 ATX LGA2011-3**

I ultimately decided on this from all the features it has and somewhat good price. I initially was going to do a red and black theme like most so I was looking at the ASUS Rampage V Extreme as it was the top of the pecking order lol. I have an issue with always wanting the best even if I might not utilize all the features. However reading about some issues on the rampage and it was was quite costly so I decided to get the next best thing since I really wasn’t going to be doing crazy over clocking anyway. Decided on this board and had to change my whole theme from red and black to black and white. 

**Memory- Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (4 x 4GB) DDR4-2666**

Corsair makes good products and since I wasn’t springing for the exorbitant prices of the dominators at the time this seemed like a good deal. The Color matches well with my build a well. Plan to add another 16GB’s soon to top out at 32. 

**Storage- Samsung 850 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5"" SSD**

Bought this as a scratch drive since I would be using the 512GB 840 pro that was in my other laptop. It was on sale and still a good SSD for the price. Storage was just a little small for me. 

**Storage- Samsung 840 Pro Series 512GB 2.5"" SSD**

This is my main drive in my PC now. Runs windows 10 smooth and no issues. Don’t store any games or anything like that just a lot of programs. 

**Storage- Western Digital BLACK SERIES 4TB 3.5"" 7200RPM**

This is my main work horse. All of my files are on here including all the games I play. Never noticed any sort of speed degradation or anything like that. Not too loud as well. I would recommend them for those who need a lot of storage at a good speed and at a good price. Plan to pick up another soon. 

**Video Card- Gigabyte GeForce GTX 980 Ti 6GB**

This was the Magic component at that time lol. They had just been announced and I pushed off my build waiting for these to be released by NVDIA. It was expensive but they power through all the games I play. These were also hard to get and I had to camp on amazons website since they sold out fast. At the time it was between EVGA and Gigabyte for me. But after hearing many good things about Gigabytes coolers I decided to go for them. I really like ASUS but hey were dragging there feet and the strix model wasn’t out yet. I also planned on getting multiple displays so I needed a good amount of display ports. I also liked the way Gigabyte arranged the ports. 

**Case- Corsair 750D ATX Full Tower**

I just always like the way this case looked. Clean lines and nice aesthetic. I liked this and the 760T as well but ultimately decided on this. I had to have a big case with a large window. Looking at these online you may be deceived. These full tower cases are quite large in real life and it fits everything I need and more. Plan to add some water-cooling soon so the added space is a good bonus. 

**Power Supply- EVGA 1000W ATX12V / EPS12V**

Not much to say here. Very good power supply and EVGA makes great stuff. I also know a bit overpowered for my build but you can never be two careful. Adding another card later or some pumps should be no problem. 

**Case Fan- Corsair Air Series AF120 Quiet Edition (2-Pack) 39.9 CFM 120mm**

A fan is a fan lol. I do like the colors of these however. Did look at some Noctua fans but they were more costly and louder apparently. The colors scheme was atrocious as well but heard they have started changing up colors lately so may look into those later. No issues with these so far. 


**Fan Controller- NZXT Sentry Mix 2 Fan Controller**

Nice fan controller. Simple and looks good. Quite a bit of cables coming of it though. May look into changing or swapping these out later to save some space with all the excess cables it produces. 

**Monitor- Dell U3415W 34.0""**

This was another part that took me a while to decide on. Knew that I need a large screen for doing homework and gaming. When I saw the first LG that came out with 34 inches of space I was hooked. Shopped around, read up on all the issues and kept waiting. Eventually was going to get the LG 34UC97 but saw the dell come out and it would work just fine for me. Even better I ordered it from Costco so if I ever have any issues it’s a simple return. Was waiting for the model with G-SYNC but so far have never had any screen tear issues. This monitor is great for school as I can have 3 Microsoft Word/PowerPoint windows open at once and read all of theme. Highly recommended for productivity. 

**Keyboard- Corsair K70 RGB**

I really liked this keyboard. When I saw all the customizations and programming of lights and actions you could do I had to get this one. Has been solid form e ever since. Only issue is dust shows easily so must be regularly cleaned. 

**Mouse- Corsair M65 RGB Wired Laser**

Same as the keyboard. Solid for me no issues so far and they can be linked together with the software to show the same lights. 

**Custom- NZXT HUE/LED Lights from Amazon**

Haven’t put this in my build yet. Bought another set of amazon ( Link : http://www.amazon.com/SUPERNIGHT-Waterproof-Flexible-300leds-Changing/dp/B00K5MW1X2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage . The cheap ones with the controller lol. Like that I can change the colors with the remote. Saw they came out with a new model so may look into that. I still have this one unopened. 

**Custom- Ergotech Freedom Arm**

This was a little bit of a hassle for me. Funnily these are rated by monitor weight so heavy duty and normal. The monitor I got is too heavy for the normal one but to light for the heavy duty model according to the specs and customer service rep I talked to. They said since the monitor was to light for the heavy duty the tension wouldn’t be enough and it would always be high/extended. Planned to tape a bag of rice to the back of the monitor but I have had no issues. It stays in the spot I put it in with the heavy duty so not sure what they were speaking of. 


**Custom- CableMod E-Series G2 / P2 Cable Kit – BLACK / WHITE**

I knew from the beginning for me since I had a big window I had to have the custom cables. These were pretty hard to find and I had to order them from an obscure website just to get them. They are quality cables however and I love the look. 

**Conclusion/Plan For Updates:**

Ultimately my first even PC build was exquisite and quite simple. A few months of research ended in a short and quick PC build. I was surprised at how fast I put everything together once I got them. I would recommend for new builders to just watch a lot of videos and read on forums. Since Pascal is around the corner I’m waiting to see what’s up. May just get another 980ti however and SLI them. I’m looking now into how to expand the Swiftech H240 x to include the GPU and CPU in the loop. Plan to get some EK extras as well however. Was going to purchase a second Dell UC3415W but may just get a 50 inch TV on the side. Still debating that one lol. 

**I would appreciate any comments or questions and should get back to you guys shortly. Thanks for reading this wall of text lol.**

Throughout my first year here, I've been in about 3 Testing roles and one Software Analyst role, all with different clients.

I've received an offer from Goldman Sachs' Technology Divison, on a much better contract. The pay, location and professional qualifications I've been offered to work towards on my 4-year-paid-intern position is much better than the same 2 year paid intern deal offered by Accenture, but I'm not sure where the experience would be better.

Granted I won't move around as much and won't see nearly as many clients and mainly working with in-house softwares etc, but it's also in the Finance sector and is a big name in the tech startup space.

Looking at it from a standpoint, would making the jump to GS be more beneficial than ACN?

Thank you to anyone who can provide any input on this."

I am pretty proficient in java and know bits of JavaFX for GUI work (not that that would help at a large company), for the third requirement I am a high school senior headed to UMD for cs this fall so hopefully that will be close enough to what they want. The second requirement, microsoft visual studio, I do not fulfill but hopefully I could learn it before summer? I would like to know what to include on my resume for this internship application, and in case I dont land that opporotunity for jobs as well. 

My thoughts are: 

Over 200 hours of community service including:
-x 
-y
-z thing, not shown for privacy

I have enough experience with Java to create useful programs with minimal online research/reference and a growing knowledge of JavaFX, a Java GUI library.

Working knowledge of Google Analytics (id call myself like a 2.5/5 on this one, but feel like it is a good thing to write down)

Well... thats about it that I feel like I should 100% include, other things could be GPA, SAT (probably not? although I got a very high score), sports, clubs. Anyways thanks for reading, if you could leave advice for both types of applications (the internship, standard job) that would be great!

EDIT: so just found out that MVS is actually for app dev, I actually created an app dev club at my High School could be a good hook for my resume should I learn MVS and word it right.

I am going to be graduating in a month with a CS degree and will be starting a CS PhD program in the fall. Because I didn't decide to go to grad school until late, I just started looking for internships, and so I haven't had much luck. I'm also specifically looking for ones in Seattle which doesn't help.

I've done many (4) internships already, two at Google, and have interest specifically in NLP and computational linguistics. I'm really not picky about pay or type of work, because I've been either working or in school for 4 years and will probably feel really bored if I don't have some kind of job. Obviously I'd prefer something in my field but I have many personal projects and research going on in that area so it's not so important.

I've been looking up startups in Seattle (I figure many of the major tech companies are out of internships; I know that Google is unfortunately) and trying to get a list of some other companies which might be hiring anyone involved in tech... even low-level IT jobs (I never had that experience, so might as well do it now!). Does anyone have suggestions on where else I can look (job boards, list of companies, etc.)? Or even better, larger tech companies that you might know are still hiring?

Thanks!"
4eegwx,0,2016-04-12,Miscellaneous questions(and frustrations) of an atypical applicant,CSjrthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4eegwx/miscellaneous_questionsand_frustrations_of_an/,"Hey guys, hopefully this post maintains some semblance of organization, but I decided to make it on a whim. And I know the information I provide won't be enough to make a true judgement call regarding job offers/interviews/etc. but I would like your opinion.

Background: I have ~3 years of college under my belt, which was cut short by financial issues. I am coming up on the 1 year mark of being out of school, and have been unable to land myself a job. Throughout this year of free time, I have been doing freelance work on Upwork which I thought would be a 'plus' on the resume (I have also greatly enjoyed doing it). All in all, I have been programming for about 7 years and have done non-trivial projects in C++/Python/Java, along with varying experience in C#/Javascript/HTML and a handful of frameworks. I've also developed on Windows / OS X / and Linux, and deployed to both AWS and Azure.

My freelance projects have ranged from webscrapers and server utility scripts to openCV+OCR text extraction solutions and business acquisition software for the largest franchisee of a well-known franchise in the US. Most of these are on my github, either in their entirety or redacted/dumbed-down to look-out for my clients with competitors.

Now for my questions, directed mainly at people with experience doing the hiring.. in regards to an entry-level position, btw.

What would be your initial thoughts if a resume with these things on it crossed your desk? Call / don't call? Incomplete education is a red flag, but how big of a red flag?

Have any of you heard of a more unconventional internship for someone like me, since I am struggling to get hired full-time(US)? I haven't come across any in my job search.

My confidence has taken a big hit over this time period, which I think has reflected in my interview experiences. The 2 coding interviews I have gotten, one I did great on and got denied (I think they doubted my ability to explain technical details to clients), and the other revolved around a language not even on my resume so I did not do well at all. I have also gotten 2 HR type interviews, where I didn't get to proceed to a coding interview. 

My resume and cover letter were reviewed by my University's career department as well as by various people that I respect. I have applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs.

The only big mistakes I may be making are a) I am only applying to jobs within ~45 minutes of my current residence, b) I don't live near where I grew up or went to University so I have no contacts, c) I haven't had the nerve to ""cold call"" potential contacts on LinkedIn d) anything I may have over-looked. It also just occurred to me that I could attend local meet-ups to make connections, does anyone have experience with this? Did you get a job from it?

Any other advice for someone like me?"
4eekev,1,2016-04-12,How I used the Informational Interview to get an Account Executive job at the 5th largest ad agency in town,slightlyabovenormal,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/4eekev/how_i_used_the_informational_interview_to_get_an/,"I was living the dream as the VP of Business Development for a website development agency. At 26 I had a corner office in uptown Charlotte and spent more time on the golf course than ever before. We were selling websites for $50K to $10M+ companies and had a great time doing it.

&amp;nbsp;

I park my car and head into the office. The owner is sitting at his desk. He looks at me and says ""There's no reason for you to be here, the company doesn't exist"". He and his business partner had a disagreement and dissolved the company.

&amp;nbsp;

Shit.

&amp;nbsp;

I had just married Shannon the month before where my best man referenced the agency in his speech. If I ever forget the name I'll watch the wedding video.

&amp;nbsp;

Up to this point my resume reads as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

Economics degree from party school

Car Sales - 3 years

Website Sales - 8 months

&amp;nbsp;

I had just gotten out of the car business and could easily go back and make great money. However, I wasn't willing to put the strain on my new marriage. I was lucky that Shannon had an income and was able to buy me some time to figure out the next step.

&amp;nbsp;

What to do? I reached out to Peg, our neighbor, and asked if she would help me find a career. I wasn't asking her to call in a favor, just to help me with the process. As a wedding gift she agreed. To this day, that was the best wedding gift we received. The owner of the website company came in second with a full set of All Clad stainless steel cookware.

&amp;nbsp;

**1st Meeting: What do YOU want?**

&amp;nbsp;

Our 1st meeting was over coffee at Barnes &amp; Noble. I felt smarter just sitting there. The whole meeting consisted of her helping me find out what I would actually enjoy doing day in and day out. We focused a lot on the environment, e.g. indoor/outdoor, people/no people, travel/no travel, computer screen/no screen, AM/PM, etc. No one had ever asked me these questions and it was an enlightening experience. My homework was to spend some time thinking about those questions.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**2nd Meeting: So this is want you want.**

&amp;nbsp;

At our 2nd meeting we reviewed and came to the conclusion that being an Account Executive at an advertising agency was my dream job. There was just one glaring problem, my resume. No agency would higher me or even take the time to interview. I might have been able to start as an intern and perhaps worked my way up. However, Shannon's funds were running low and I needed to make a good paycheck right off the bat. Peg knew I was good in front of people, it was just getting in front of them was the problem.

&amp;nbsp;

**3rd Meeting: The Informational Interview**

&amp;nbsp;

At our 3rd meeting Peg brought a large magazine. It was the Book of Lists for Charlotte, which as you guessed, lists the top 50 of every imaginable category. She had bookmarked the page that had the top 50 advertising agencies in the city. She pointed to #1 and said that I need to call them and ask for the president and get a 10 minute informational interview with them. She explained that an informational interview is where I ask what the perfect Account Executive looks like in their eyes. I was to report back at our next meeting.

&amp;nbsp;

So how did I pull this off? A lot of people get hung up on the receptionist when calling up a company. They can't get past them to talk to the president. This is one of the advantages of the informational interview, it is completely innocent. Most people are receptive to helping someone else if it doesn't require a lot of their time and doesn't put them in a bad light. Know this, and this is true of 99% of CEO's, they love giving advice and hearing how great they are. The absolute best way to get in front of them is to stroke their ego. Let them know you are asking because they are the best in the business, and if they can spare 10 minutes, you are happy to meet them when &amp; where they want. Usually the best time for them to meet is early in the AM before their day starts or late in the PM after their day is over. It's important to stress this will NOT take a lot of their time and even a few minutes is appreciated. They will give you more time if the conversation is going well. Once I got the meeting I went in, stroked their ego, asked my questions, actually listened to their answers, and thanked them for their time. All questions were based around ""what the perfect Account Executive looks like"" and then a few additional questions that expanded on possible answers. e.g. responsibilities, attitude, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**The 4th Meeting: Rinse &amp; Repeat**

&amp;nbsp;

At our 4th meeting I proudly reported on the completion of my assignment. We reviewed what I had learned. There were a couple of phrases and acronyms used during the interviews that I didn't know and had to look up. Little did I know I was learning the vernacular (the way the CEO talked) through this exercise. Peg smiled and looked and me and said, ""now do the same thing for #2 - #5"". I got to work.

&amp;nbsp;

**Holy Shit: This is an actual Interview**

&amp;nbsp;

By the time I got to agency #5 some interesting things were happening. My comfort level about what was required of an Account Executive was extremely high. The level of my questions were advancing since agencies #1 - #4 had given me a ton of info. I was dropping names of the CEOs of the top #4 agencies relaying how I had meetings with them as well. The #5 agency said they would provide more info at another meeting if I was interested. I happily agreed. It was only halfway through the second meeting when the VP said ""this position would require you to do"" that I realized I was in an actual interview. We finished the meeting and I reported back to Peg. She suggested that I follow up with a thank you gift. She suggested one baby Timberland boot in a box with a note that said ""Thank you for your time. I'm ready to kick some butt"",  piggy backing of the phrase ""kick butt"" which was used during the second meeting with the agency.

&amp;nbsp;

I got the job and the salary of an Account Executive with 2-3 years experience.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a great example of being [slightly above average] (http://www.stephenhuneycutt.com). It took a phone call and maybe an hour of my life for each Informational Interview. I'm not brilliant, I didn't say anything witty, I just took the time to learn. I know a lot of people who have spent more than 5 hours in finding a job.

&amp;nbsp;

Not a bad weeding gift at all.

4eeue4,8,2016-04-12,What to do if I can't get an internship offer?,bhargavat,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4eeue4/what_to_do_if_i_cant_get_an_internship_offer/,"So I'm a Software Engineering major. So far, it looks like my first 2 years have not exposed me to coursework that gives me the confidence I need to sell myself to companies. For most of my projects, there was always someone that was far superior at developing than the rest of the group members, which made it difficult for me to prove to employers that I played an important role in that project. 

What I don't get is that several people with the same level of technical skills as me are getting internships while I am not. Their extracurriculars are stronger than mine, but I fail to see how that will help them in a technical environment. I have a 3.6 GPA in my university and around 3.5 if you count the courses I transferred over. A part of me thinks that I don't have a strong technical background and another part of me tells me that what I have is enough for an internship level position since some people who relied mostly on coursework to teach them the skills needed were able to land internship positions. I believe it's too late now because most of the internship listings are too old and there aren't very many of them anymore. Seems like I missed my chances of landing one when I failed to get an offer after 3 of the interviews that I received. 

What I plan on doing as a backup is enroll in community college to learn new programming languages and perhaps do a personal project, while working part-time at a electronic store or something. "

* Five years of solo law practice (financial privacy, asset protection, regulated industries/financial sector, and varied litigation experience).
* Four years teaching databasing and applied programming (TA in grad school, MS Access and VB, 1500 students).

**Gameplan**:

1. I'm in a small-ish town (1.5M people in the metro) with a newly-opening 24x7x365 SOC for a large regional bank.  I'm gunning for their SOC analyst position (BS + interest in cybersec posted minimum quals) to get back into the fold.

2. In two years I hope to move into a more specialized position within the SOC or the security team (at the same company or elsewhere); either SOC lead or on the incident response team.  I think IR makes the most sense from my background and interests.  I intend to get the CISSP (because HR drools on it &amp; the experiential requirement) during this time.

3. I figure I may need to relocate to a bigger city/change employers after 2 or 3 more years for a managerial position steering operations or perhaps security architect, get the CISM, and maybe another move after a few more years for a C-level position steering policy and risk management.

**Comedy Alternate Gameplan**:  Enlist in the Navy for 6 years.  Do cryptologic technician (""Navy hacker"") rating to wipe out my student loans and get certifications, and then do main gameplan beginning at #2.  I think this is a bad idea because the private sector has more potential in information security and policy than the government.  Even including government contracting, which I figure is full of ex-officers and retired career enlistedmen with a strong good old boy network.

**Questions**:

1. Are there other roles after the SOC that merit consideration over incident response based on my background?  Is there a speciality that is more frequently a feeder for executive security roles?  I considered audit but figured that there's less promotion potential out of audit than incident response.

2. Security+ (like a lot of CompTIA) seems like a retread; I get 90% of the practice questions right.  Should I get it if on my own dime?  I put my odds of doing DoD 8570 work pretty low.

3. Any opinions of the Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP/US)?  Encounter any in your work?

4. Would staying firmly in one regulated industry (e.g. financial or health) be preferable over experience in that and another industry, or in a less-regulated industry (consumer goods, tech startup, etc.)?

5. Should my gameplan include a stop at a vendor/managed service provider/consultancy (e.g. Accenture, Palantir, Dell, FIS, Big 4) or stay in-house the whole way?

**The $64,000 questions**:  Is it feasible?  If I perform like a goddamn superstar is it reasonable?  If not, what changes would you make to the gameplan and expectations?

Thank you for your wisdom and for having read this far."

So I'm currently a 21 year old studying Computer Science in college. I've also been playing the piano for 11 years (Started when I was 7, Stopped when I was 17 for personal reasons and picked it up again when I was 20 over the summer). The three year gap really did me in though as I forgot most of the pieces in the repertoire I built up but the technique is all still there (I took lessons over the summer with 3 teachers and a professor who all said that my technique was still impressive). As I did my software engineering internship this past summer, I realized that I don't want to be coding my whole life. I don't mind coding for a while but I just don't want to do it my whole life. This was around the same time I was struggling with a depressive episode and picking up the piano and playing it again made me realize how much I missed playing the piano. I was playing around 5-6 hours a day and I found myself loving the instrument again. When the school year started, I always made sure to block out time to play the piano for 2 hours a day and I still block out this time unless I'm completely swamped (ie finals week: where I still managed to get 2-3 hours a day...). Anyway I thought about alternatives since I don't want to be coding my life and after a lot of sleepless nights, I think I want to go to music school after I graduate in CS to pursue a piano performance degree. I don't want to be a performer of any sort, I dislike playing in front of people and I don't think its plausible at this point. However I really enjoy teaching the piano to others, I taught my friend the Chopin Nocturne Op 9 No 2, and the rewarding feeling I got when he finally could play the whole piece was something I never got writing code. I guess I just realized my passion to teach and play music this past summer.
Anyway now I'm wondering how plausible it is for me to go to music school. I've put a lot of thought into this and I really would like to go. I've talked to my parents about this and they said they would consider supporting me since I already have my computer science degree and my teacher has always been supportive. So I wonder out of the options listed below, which is the most reasonable.

1. Graduate, take a few classes part time while programming (theory, history and aural training), expanding my repertoire and studying with a teacher, eventually stop coding and go to a full time grad program for piano performance. (This is my preferred method but I realize that I may need an undergrad. Advice is welcome)

2. Do the same thing except go for an full time student undergrad degree for piano performance before going for a grad degree.

3. Both are unreasonable. You're being stupid.

4. You don't need a degree to enjoy playing the piano or teaching it

Any other options are welcome too. Also if I was to transfer credits, how long would it take to finish an undergrad degree even with recital requirements? I don't want to be in school for over 3 years, but if it isn't reasonable to finish in 3 years, I would be OK with staying longer.

Tl:dr - I realized my passion for playing and teaching the piano this past summer again and I want to go to music school. How plausible is this?"

I have two years of college, 6 months internship, 6 month Jr Engr contract, and about 2 years of freelance.   
   
I was offered a part-time position for a ~1000 person company in NY, NY for $20/hr. I've been looking for about 2 months and this is the first offer I've received. My first instinct was to take it because I need the experience, but now that I've had some time to think it through, $20/hr seems absurdly low. During my internship I made $22/hr and they gave me a $2000 moving compensation. I also charge $90/hr for freelance web development work.   
   
NYC is freaking expensive and $20/hr or $40k salary would barely give me any wiggle room. I was hoping to make in the realm of $28-$32/hr. Am I being unrealistic with my limited experience and no bachelor degree?"

They knew when I was going to graduate, and I have to imagine that that was considered when they decided to give me an internship offer. However, this semester I had some personal stuff come up and I had to drop some classes which means that it would be very hard for me to graduate in 2017, I'm looking at graduating more towards summer of 2018.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experience with this situation. Assuming they want to give me a full time offer, are companies (especially Microsoft) willing to work with you in this situation? Would they be willing to invite you back for another internship to give you time to finish school? Or is there just no way to know?

Thanks!"

which started its life as research project led by the
[Cristal Group][cristal-home] at the [INRIA][inria-home], the renowned
French research institute.  Yes, you got it: a language with that
passport usually meets a lot of disdain outside of academic circles
and is the object of many clichés thrown by (usually misinformed)
practitioners.  Nevertheless, over the years this language and its
cousin F# have settled their mark in the industry, as the
[growing list of consortium members][ocaml-consortium]
testifies.[^1]  Some recent events reflecting this adoption are
the
[acquisition of Unikernel (an OCaml shop) by Docker][docker-unikernel],
or the
[release by Bloomberg of an OCaml to JavaScript compiler][bloomberg-ocamljs].
There is however still a domain where OCaml is not expected to be met:
*operations*.   We started to use OCaml for operations at
[quintly][quintly-home] in place of the more obvious
Python or JavaScript and I am writing today to share our experience:
this is an excellent choice!

*Your questions and remarks are welcome!*


## Just the facts, ma'am

Here are a few facts:

- We wrote an OCaml daemon to prepare and publish custom metrics to
  closely monitor some particularities of our systems.  This daemon
  perfectly illustrates the
  [*when it compiles, it works*][yminsky-tweet] phenomenon: it has
  been deployed on thousands of servers and various settings, with
  uptime ranging from a few day to a few months, and never failed nor
  required a bug-fix of any sort.  Really.

- We write custom deployment scripts, effecitvely implementing the
  immutable server pattern, which are written in OCaml.  The scripts
  are robust, had little-bugs (mostly caused by details about the
  underlying system) and are easy to extend, adapt.  Various
  refactorings never broke functionality or introduced regressions of
  any sort.

- We write custom backup procedures for some of our databases.  After
  a week of development, the script entered the final phase of
  testing, and had exactly one (trivial) bug.  It now dumps terabytes
  of data over hours of operation, without a hitch.

After these, hopefully teasing, statements, I would like to present
aspects of the recent development of this last program as a short
testimonial.


## Description of the backup procedure

We have some NoSQL databases hosted as a managed service in the AWS
cloud, the largest ones being several terabytes large.  Unfortunately
the managed service does not offer any backup procedure and we decided
to roll out our one.  It is made of three procedures *dump* performing
a full-dump of a database, *incremental* monitoring and writing down
subsequent activity of the database, and, of course, a *restore*
procedure, whose inputs are the artefacts produced by the previous
*dump* and *incremental* procedures.

The *dump* procedure must read all the items from the database, write
them to a file, compress this file and transfert it to a permanent
storage where it is archived.  In order to make the procedure more
resilient to errors, we decided not to work with a huge archive file
holding all the items but with several smaller archive *volumes*.
This choice:

- makes it easy to concurrently fetch items, compress and upload
  volumes;

- allows to work in constant disk space, independently from the size
  of the database being dumped;

- makes it easy to resume reading items or to resume uploading archive
  volumes if the process gets interrupted.


## Choosing OCaml for the job

The AWS cloud services we use are easily accesible using JavaScript
(NodeJS) and Python API and no native interface is available.[^1] This
means that picking OCaml implies writing a bit of plumbing code, which
can take up to 2-3 days of development.  This might seem a bit of a
drawback and many developers will prefer to use a language for which
an API to the required services is readily available.  This kind of
decision is usually sealed with the “We don't need to reinvent the
wheel” cliché.  During an internship at TÜV Rheinland, I had to
process geographic information automatically and decided to write my
programs in Python because I could find a library capable of reading
and writing ESRI shape files — the *de facto* standard for storing
geographic information.  This turned out to be a poor decision,
because the library was very brittle and not very nicely documented,
and also because I am not nearly as productive when writing Python
programs than when writing OCaml programs (I program OCaml since
1998).  You will recognise these points in
[the nice list][blog-dimitri] prepared by Dimitri about the
*disadvantages* of code reuse. Of course there are lot of situations
where code reuse is desirable, but it is worth noting that it also has
its trade-offs, especially since many persons consider this a
no-brainer.  Based on this experience, I decided to write the *dump*
procedure in OCaml and taking advantage of the JavaScript API to the
required services, using the [js-of-ocaml][ocaml-js-home] compiler,
turning OCaml bytecode into JavaScript.


## Development

The development occupied me roughly 8 days, spending about 4 days
writing bindings for OCaml to the JavaScript API.  While
**js-of-ocaml** makes this as easy as possible, it took longer as
expected because the original JavaScript is very sloppily documented.
For instance, if they write “The member X is empty.” we cannot
determine if it means “X is the empty string” or “X is set to null” or
even “X is not defined in the structure”. This sloppiness implies that
many tests need to be conducted.  The nice side of using OCaml is that
the signature of OCaml functions cleanly document, once for all, all
these accuracies.  Time spent clarifying the original API is time well
invested because it produces an artifact put under version control and
does not need to be done a second time.  If the API had directly been
used in JavaScript, then the time spent clarifying the API would most
probably not been saved in concrete artefacts, so its results would
“stay in the air” for a while and once they vanish, the time needed to
producee them must later be invested again.

On the 4 remaining days, 2 were spent writing the *dump* procedure
itself and 2 were spent writing a deployment script and performing the
first operational tests.

Writing the *dump* procedure was really fast, mostly because OCaml has
a wonderful threading library called Lwt, which continus to work after
the bytecode has been translated to JavaScript.  This library proposes
a monadic interface to compose cooperative threads, and many useful
higher level abstractions it provides can be leveraged to quickly
implement rather complex workflows.  Using a monadic interface to
write multi-threaded code is a far superior approach to the callbacks
used by JavaScript either in its usual form or in conjunction with
promises.  The reason for this is that the monadic approach allows to
simply compose treatments, while callbacks are just spaghetti code in
disguise — debugging or refactoring any significant application
written using this technique should be a convincing experience!
To put it shortly, a program structured in the form of callbacks
presents an inside-out control flow, where the elementary operations
occupy the control operations of the programs are nested one level
deeper, inside the callbacks.  Monadic code is easier to write and
understand because it presents a traditional control flow, where the
elementary operations are hidden under higher level abstractions.
*Promises* perform the same salutary reversal, however many APIs are
still rely on callbacks, so that using *promises* with them still
needs to write some adapter code.

At a higher level, the *dump* procedure prepares the streams of items
to be saved from the database.  This stream is a lazy structure, which
under the hood handles all the low-level details for item retrieval
(such as pagination of results).  This stream is then subdivided in
smaller streams of fixed size, each of them is given to a sink that
write its items to a volume file, compress it and upload it to a
permanent storage.  There is two little additional logical units. One
to ensure throttling of item retrieval, so that the *dump* procedure
interacts nicely with normal operation. A second that guarantees that
no more than a configurable but fixed number of volumes is being
compressed and uploaded at a given instant, which implies that the
procedure works in constant disk space, independently of the size of
the database being dumped.

The first test uncovered a single, trivial bug, that was quickly
fixed, after that, the program could be used to do a full dump of a
2,5 TB database in about seven days — the throttling made it last so
long.


## Maintenance

In the first iteration of development after the completion of the
working prototype, was expanded to split the *dump* operation across
several machines.  This iteration worked perfectly from the first time
it compiled, meaning that the refactorings performed introduced no
regression.  This is mostly imputable to the typeing system of OCaml,
which is a powerful ally when refactoring, as it signals through type
errors most of the the places where a given code modification induces
problems and needing some special attention. I am now working on the
second iteration that should improve logging facilities and the
monitoring of the dump procedure.

Hello everyone,

I graduated from a competitive liberal arts college with a communication BA in May 2015. Upon graduating I came back to my rural hometown to live with my parents so I could work my normal summer job. I worked for a few months to get the financial boost I needed and then started the search for my career.

I had no idea that 8 months later I'd still be searching (11 months after graduating). Yet 200+ job apps later, here I am.

Here are some of the problems I'm encountering:

1 - The terrible career beginning double bind: I need experience to get the job, but can't get experience without getting the job.
2 - Lower level jobs turn me down because I am overqualified and they want someone that will work for $13/hr for ever. 
3 - I live in {very} rural America so it's impossible for me to start as an unpaid intern. I need a job that is worth moving for.
4 - I'm long-distance job searching. I've mostly been looking for jobs in a larger town 1.5 hours away and Portland, OR 3 hours away. That's doable, but I'd would be interested in moving to a different part of the country if that was possible.
5 - I have exhausted my network. I can't think of anyone else I am close to that I could ask for help.

Most of my work history is small campus or summer jobs I worked because I needed money. I don't have a long CV of irresistible experience, but it's not blank either. 

My academic success isn't terribly elite, but I am far from being dumb. Why can't I find some hiring manager that sees value in me?

I am honestly at a complete dead end. Does anyone have any advice for what to do next? "

HTML and CSS have a level of rigidity in their structures that makes for a much easier learning curve  - I can build something from scratch in those, jQuery takes more hand-holding. 

* **Anyway beyond your general feedback, my main questions regard improving load-time: Where does one begin with improving load-time? How do I teach myself to calculate a websites loadtime in dev-tools?**

Any feedback on my resume? I recently changed it to this since I wasn't getting anywhere with my old one. Is my history confusing? I went back to school at 22, so I had a bit of a career before school, followed by internships, and then graduation.  If I do temp work, will that make it look like I don't stay at jobs long?

4ehh8j,5,2016-04-12,What should I do for the summer?,timestop007,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4ehh8j/what_should_i_do_for_the_summer/,"Hello everyone!

I have been a follower of this sub for a few months now, and I really need some advice. (BTW you guys are awesome, every piece of advice that I see here is so helpful)

A little bit of background:
I am a transfer student from a small college in Texas and now I am attending the University of North Texas and pursuing a Bachelor's in BCIS. I have an estimated 2 more semesters left. I have a 4.0 and I am going to start attending AIS (Association for Information Systems) meetings, as well as I just got through an interview with the Professional Leadership Program and will find out if I make it or not in late May (it is a year long program starting in the fall). I love to help people and I am very good with people/public speaking (my dream job someday is to do things such as TED Talks or be in some type of management position).

Over the last winter break, I was conflicted on trying to get an internship or not for the summer. I know that I need the experience and networking because all the jobs I have had since high school were all customer assistance oriented and not related to the information technology field at all. I decided I would try for a few internships anyways even though on a resume, it really is hard for me to show any technological background.

I was unfortunately turned down from the internships which I presumed is because of my background and lack of technical experience. So now I am at a stand-still on what I should do for the summer because most internships now are out the window due to time-constraints.

What could I do for the summer with 3 months of free-time to help sharpen my technical skills and give me some extra stuff to add to my resume? Should I look into some certifications or maybe try to learn a programming language here or there? I'm taking my first course in Java this semester so i'm just dipping my toe in the water. I really want to get some real world experience to help separate me from other students so I have a better chance after graduation to land a decent job and work my way up!

(Side note: A lot of advisers are telling me to go into things such as security or mainframes, but I don't start security classes until the fall and mainframe classes start in the spring of 2017, so for right now i'm leaning more towards security but that is just because of the job security (hehe) and opportunities it could offer once I graduate.)

Any piece of advice you guys are willing to sharing would mean the world to me. If you honestly want to call me stupid and say I'm on the wrong track, do it. I don't want to graduate and then find some job that I'll be stuck at for 15 years. I want to be a leader someday and help motivate people when it comes to things in the information technology field. 

Cheers!

I think my resume is strong for software development, but it would be really cool to get something more computer engineering based. But I feel like I've cornered myself in and don't know what to do.

4ehlhg,14,2016-04-12,In-Depth Guide to How to Use Snapchat to Market your Small Business,seanfalconer,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4ehlhg/indepth_guide_to_how_to_use_snapchat_to_market/,"""What is the big deal with Snapchat &amp; how can I use Snapchat to market my small business?""

This is a question I am seeing all over the Internet lately.  

Most people think Snapchat is a way to send a NSFW photo only to have it disappear within seconds.  Others think it's just a place to take a picture of yourself puking a rainbow.  

[How to Use Snapchat Infographic](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/665285/hubfs/snapchat-marketing.jpg?t=1460474032794&amp;width=818&amp;height=4008)

**So, what is Snapchat and why is everyone talking about it?**

Snapchat is an app that allows users to create “snaps” which are photos or short videos.  These snaps can be sent to a user’s friends or added to a “story”- a collection of photo and/or video-based snaps that live for any followers to see for 24 hours from posting time. 

Snaps, in their nature, are fleeting moments unlike the often highly-curated and planned photos created on the visual powerhouse, Instagram.  

Once a user creates the snap, they have the option of adding text, stickers, emojis, geotags, playing a video snap backwards, fast forwarding or even drawing on the image or video.  In addition, using the front-facing camera, a user can use an ever-changing variety of “faces”, morphing a user into anything from a cat to a wide eyed version of themselves puking a rainbow, because why not?

**All of that sounds fun (and it is!) but what does Snapchat have to do with your small business?**

Snapchat boasts over 100 million daily users. 65% of Snapchat users are active and collectively create approximately 400 million snaps a day!  Another huge draw for Snapchat is its user base.  With 60% of smartphone users between the age of 13-34 active on Snapchat, it taps into a huge Millennial market for businesses. 

Due to the high usage by Millennials, large businesses &amp; brands are latching onto Snapchat.  They use it to promote and provide access to live events, to engage followers by creating specialized content, to offer promotions and giveaways and to partner with other influencers to further engage a potential customer base. This is just a small sampling of some of the ways a business can use the app.

Additionally, Snapchat has been implementing huge changes throughout the app that make it much more than a place to take throwaway pictures. These changes have resulted in the average Snapchat user spending 25-30 minutes on the app everyday.   

**What are people doing for 25-30 minutes everyday?**

Aside from creating, sending and watching snaps, users can also access news and content from huge brands. Discover, for example, can be accessed by swiping left on the camera screen,  Here, you will find channels from both old and new school media outlets.  These powerhouse channels include WSJ, Daily Mail, Buzzfeed, Mashable and more.  Other brands, like Burberry, have run 24 hour content on Snapchat, a campaign that reportedly cost the high-end luxury brand anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000.  

While a $50,000 or $100,000 24-hour advertisement campaign is not likely in the budget for a small business, the move in the direction of native advertising bodes well for the future of Snapchat brand visibility.

How businesses use Snapchat marketing everyday (and how your small business can, too!):

**1. Coupons or Giveaways!**

Some businesses run giveaways and contests through their snapchat accounts.  This offers a great way for current and potential customer bases to get excited about the brand and share their own stories.

A great way companies have promoted flash offers is by posting the deal to your story.  This offer or code will have a 24 hour limit that expires once the story is no longer live.  A great example of a big brand using Snapchat for this purpose is GrubHub.  GrubHub has used series of snaps to reveal discount codes, enact an interactive scavenger hunt and even to hire interns from their own company.  If there is a company that has utilized Snapchat to its full potential, it is probably GrubHub!

**2. Behind the Scenes Access**

Another great opportunity to engage (for free) with your customers is by posting behind the scenes access to your business.  Aer Lingus, for example, has taken followers into the cockpit of their airplanes via snaps. 

HubSpot is a good example of a company currently using SnapChat to showcase a ton of behind-the-scenes footage. They showcase different offices around the world, products they use at HubSpot and their own employees at work.  

**3. Sneak Preview**

Snapchat can also be used as a hype tool, as if there is anything more Millennial than that!  Some companies can post daily snaps announcing a countdown or a sneak peek  to a new product or service.  

Taco Bell, NARS and Acura all gave a preview of their new products in exchange for a follow on Snapchat.  Small businesses could easily build excitement with sneak peeks or countdowns! A restaurant, for example, could preview an upcoming dessert special by posting a series of snaps depicting a pastry chef creating it! This is a proven engagement tactic as users love to go behind-the-scenes.

**4. Live Events**

Live events are hugely popular on Snapchat, whether planned or unplanned.  A few notable events that gained exposure on Snapchat are Coachella (planned) and the mid-Atlantic’s “Snowmaggedon” (unplanned).  

A small business could utilize this by snapping its own special event or by engaging in the events going on around you.  Is there a music festival going on down the street from your small business? Snap about it!

**5. Have Fun**

A business could also use Snapchat for its initial intention, to have fun!  Some brands will engage their followers by asking a question or encouraging them to share a doodle.  Of course, you could turn this into a contest or coupon giveaway.  Sometimes users are satisfied solely by the exclusive customized content being delivered to their phones by their favorite businesses and brands.  Snapchat allows users to interact on a very personalized level (a handwritten, exclusive snap!) unlike anything you could share on Facebook or Twitter.  

Again, GrubHub is a shining example of a company using Snapchat to its full fun potential.  Check out this PR Case Study of all the different ways GrubHub has combined these different methods of engaging with its followers.  

As with any social media platform, with a little trial &amp; error,  you will find out what works best when it comes to marketing your small business.  Some businesses live and die for Facebook and others find it useless.  In terms of marketing and engagement, Snapchat is an incredibly versatile app.  With a little creativity, there are endless ways to engage, entertain and delight your followers!

What do you think? Anyone have any experience using Snapchat for their business?

I have two offers to work as a Software Engineering Intern this summer. Here's the breakdown:

First, both pay exactly the same and rent is the same in both cities so the financial component is not relevant for this decision.

Company A:
I'd be working with a small group of other SWE interns to work on an internal app that we present to leadership toward the end of the internship. We'll also have access to a group of mentors. Tech stack is .Net and JS/Angular.

Company B:
Not entirely sure what I'll be working on but I'll be reporting directly to a Senior Software Engineer. Tech stack is PHP and Javascript and maybe some Java.

I want to go with the option that'll open more doors for when I graduate next year. For background, I'm a Math major and this will be my first Software related internship.

Thanks for any advice!"

I'm graduating with my CS degree in May, and have been applying in more of wider net search around the New York City area.  In addition to taking my 6 courses required to graduate, I am working 40-45 hours a week manning an IT helpdesk, and managing various IT projects.  

I've gotten a few calls from recruiters, but they seem to be interested in my previous IT experience.  

My main issue I think, is confidence.  I don't think I do many things well, specifically programming solutions.  I can visualize the issue, and know *how* I want to solve it, but many times I simply do not know the correct syntax to use.  A simple google search helps out with this, but obviously, when applying for jobs I can't whip out my phone and google the answer should a question arise.

Whether it comes from a lack of experience or not, I do not know.  My summer experiences consisted of working in IT, and I did not find a development internship in time, or one willing to allow me to work for them part time.  

Given that my schedule is *very* hectic, and the days are long, I am finding myself not having enough energy to begin studying and reforming my skills when I get home.  A typical day is:

* Up at 5:00am
* Work till 2:00pm
* Class till 8:00pm or 11:00pm  

Rinse and repeat.  

In my courses I have taken Java I &amp; II, Python (For an AI Course), Distributed Database Systems (SQL), Data Structures, and Algorithms.  Other classes were also taken, but these are the fundamental core of my education.  

My job search as of today consists of using Indeed, Glassdoor, and my schools Career Services site to find anything involving Java, since that is my main focus, and what I am most comfortable with, and I think I have applied for roughly 50-75 places so far.  Perhaps more.  

I have one standing offer from a place called FDM group, but from my research, it seems that everyone gets an offer from them.  They promise two years experience, in exchange for a two year committment, and from what I can see, are generally regarded as a bad choice to work for.  The pay is *very* low compared to what I am seeing elsewhere, but perhaps the experience may be worth it.

My questions for you fine folks:

* Am I missing out on any resources to locate Entry-Level Jobs?  The ones I am seeing are asking for 3+ years experience, and while I know that is their optimal qualification list, I don't think I would be cut out for that level of work.  Not yet, anyhow.

* Would it be worth going to a BootCamp or other training course to enhance my programming skills and confidence?  I know the theory, I think, but falter on the actual code-writing.

* How do you deal with thinking you don't know enough to do anything in your desired field?

TL:DR

Low confidence, feeling like I know nothing.

Not getting many responses from my applications, probably due to mainly IT experience, and not programming / software development work.

Offer from New-Grad Scheme company, for a two year committment.

Thank you for reading my post, and I hope you all have an awesome day!

I have a (most likely) technical phone screen in a week-ish with a med-size/established company and wanted to ask some CS students a couple of questions. This is mainly geared toward people who had freshman internships.

Option A: Company is one of the largest and most well-known in my field - to get to location will take 30 hours by car

Option B: Company is very large and broad, but relevant division is newer and much less well known in my field. Offering 16% higher salary, and location is 16 hours away by car

Cost of living is about the same in both locations.

Company A gave me the first offer with 72 hours to decide. I was very excited as they were my top choice, due to the company's reputation in my field and the experience i would gain from the project I would be working on. I spent 48/72 of those hours researching housing in the area, and was in communication with the in-house recruiter asking for advice regarding housing and such.

On the final day to accept offer A, company B sends me an offer. I really did not expect this as I did not think the interview went too well and did not hear back from them for weeks. I emailed the recruiter from A to notify her of this competing offer and discuss it with her - she gave me a call and sounded irritated, and asked for information regarding the offer. She said they would not be able to match it, and I thanked her and told her I would have a decision shortly.

I ended up going with company A, and sent in the signed offer well before the deadline ended. I chose them because the experience I would gain there greatly trumps the few extra dollars I wouldve made over the span of the summer at B.

What's bothering me is that ever since that phone call, I have not gotten any followup from A. I am supposed to be receiving background check information, as my offer was conditional based on that. I am worried that I may of insulted/greatly upset the recruiter and they have reconsidered, and now I may be left with 0 options from 2. 

It's been 3 business days now since I emailed my signed offer, and still no followup. 

Am I worrying over nothing or did i royally screw this up? "

I was very depressed about having to get a minimum wage job having nothing to do with my degree which would mean my resume would have no tech experience (but at least minimum wage is 10$/hour now). Then I heard back from a tech start up I applied to. I interviews with them and they offered me a job as a ""1099 independent contractor"", and the pay is also 10$/hour (What exactly does being an independent contractor entail for taxes?).

What do I do now?",osututorhelp,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/4ejs4c/had_to_drop_out_of_classes_for_two_quarters/,"So, long of the short, I have completed 5 courses so far in this class, with the last one being Data Structures.  I was having my company pay for the classes.

However, this health problem basically shut me down from doing anymore classes and even semi threatened my job.  

Well, long of the short, I can't take doing my job further anymore.  I am probably going to have to quit after the summer.  I hated this job before, but it was at least tolerable without this issue.

I'm considering transferring to a local school in my city that also does second bachelor degrees for CS.  I wouldn't be required to take the gen ed's again.  Also, I get the impression the program would be more ""thorough"" (take Calculus courses, Linear Algebra, etc.) and cheaper (It would cost me $14,000 total for 2 years.  VS. $18k for the remaining 10 courses [assuming OSU doesn't increase tuition more, which I've seen them do once]).  Also, I would be eligible for health care through the school (OSU seems to not allow online students to get health care through them).  

I'm just debating what would be the best course of action at this point.  Do I complete this degree with this program still?  Or do I transfer over to the local college and give that a shot?  

The advantage I like with this program is that I can watch videos online and almost pace myself with things.  I've gotten A's and B+ in my courses so far.  

The advantages of the local school is tha it would be cheaper for way more courses.  Also, I would have connections to jobs in the area (many internships are linked to the city I'm at).  Also, heard many people who graduated from the program get jobs.  I know of some internships specifically made for the school as well (one that is about 1 1/2 years long with BofA for example).  But, of course, it would probably take longer to complete.

Also, currently attempting to get back somehow to a ""normal"" by learning web dev on my own right now.

I'm just at a lose of what to do at this point.  I have already determined I'm most likely quitting my job after the summer.  I just question what to do.  

Family is pushing me to go to local college.  But, I feel that is because they have the ""old"" idea in there heads that online college isn't serious and you need in person contacts to get places.  I agree in person can be helpful, but I don't see why I need to go to in person college to get that.  

Anyways, any thoughts on the best course of action for me?"
4ekh6u,6,2016-04-13,All the things that no one knows. And I just want it to look like an accident,homealone17,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4ekh6u/all_the_things_that_no_one_knows_and_i_just_want/,"I feel like I was meant to die young.  That I was always meant to kill myself.  The thoughts of death and hurting myself weren't very frequent at first, but I remember having such terrible feelings even as a child of 7 or 8, of being unloved, hiding under blankets and crying because I felt so out of place and worthless.  It wasn't all the time, just every now and then it would be horrible.  

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 20, was put on hormones.  I thought maybe that would fix everything.  Things got bad my junior year of college.  I had good grades, classes were easy for me, I had gotten this wonderful scholarship, gotten an internship for over the summer, I had friends that had become roommates and we would have fun together, but towards the end of the year, I started not wanting to do much with them, except for maybe drink.  I figured if I got drunk, I could just escape for a little while.  And it was fine for a short time.  

When I went out of state to do an internship things got really bad.  I met a lot of nice people, and a friend from my major was with me, but I felt so alone.  I felt like I needed to harm myself, but wasn't exactly sure how.  While everyone else we were working with went out and had fun, I stayed in and cried, drank alone, started taking handfuls of whatever OTC medications I had on hand, which wasn't much or anything good, and washing them down with alcohol.  I didn't know what they would do, I figured I probably wouldn't die, but I wouldn't mind harming myself.  I remember lying in bed, facing the mirror on the closet door, with my heart racing, skin strangely splotchy, and pupils completely messed up.  

Then I did something dumb.  I told my friend how I was feeling and what I had been doing.  He flushed whatever otc meds I had down the toilet and kept close watch of me.  At the time, I guess I felt grateful.  But as time went on, I wish I hadn't told him.  I didn't want him to stop me from doing anything dumb, but more importantly, now I felt like a burden.  I hated myself even more for stressing him out.  We don't really talk much anymore.  He's married and seems to have a good life.  

I told my doctor about how I was feeling, and she put me on 10 mg of citalopram. It didn't really help.  When I got back to college after that summer, I should have been so happy.  It was my senior year, I was living with my girls I had known since freshman year, they were all so excited.  At first I tried to act ""normal,"" we would go out to bars or parties, spend lots of time together.  But that got tiring.  I just wanted to stay in my room, live off of alcohol in hopes that I could forget everything, and hurt myself.  I started burning myself with a curling iron, I'm not sure why.  My thighs were covered with blistered burns.  Initially they left faint scars, but eventually they disappeared.  

The don't really remember when that stopped being enough.  But I do remember that the first time I cut myself, I didn't know what to use, so in desperation, I wrapped a beer bottle in a towel and hit it with a hammer.  I tested the pieces to find a sharp enough one and kept the shard in my nightstand, but soon I graduated to an exacto knife.  I didn't want to bleed out, I didn't want anyone to know I was doing this, so I only shallowly cut my upper thighs.  Somehow just watching thin cuts bleed was calming and made me feel better.  I still have the scars over 4 years later, but no one knows.  

My doctor increased my dose of citalopram.  I guess it kind of helped.  Somehow I made it through my senior year, somehow I got A's even though I missed so many classes, telling everyone I was ""sick.""  I guess it wasn't a lie, but I don't think anyone knew what was truly wrong.  There were I few times that year that I told myself I was nuts and threw out my exacto knife, but then I would just go buy another and repeat the cycle: cutting, convince myself I'm insane, throw it out, buy another a few weeks later.  The worst was when I got the codeine cough syrup from the clinic because I was ""coughing all night and couldn't sleep.""  I got super drunk alone in my bedroom and drank the whole bottle.  I was very upset to wake up the next morning.

I never applied to grad school like I initially planned.  I lied to everyone who asked why I wasn't going to grad school right away.  Time at home was strange.  I got a crappy job that I didn't particularly enjoy just to do something.  I was afraid to cut myself at home, afraid my parents would go in my room and find the blade.  But eventually the cutting cycle continued.  I'd take a razor blade, for the box cutters, from work, cut myself when I needed to, throw it out, then grab another a few weeks later.  Eventually I got fired for a ridiculous reason.  My parents were out of town that week.  I cut myself a lot, but always made sure to hide the razor blade.  

I thought things would be better when I went to grad school.  My doctor finally ended up changing my hormone dose, and I think it helped a little, but I felt alone and friendless in a new city, because I was.  That first year of grad school was the last time I cut myself, though I still do feel like I want to sometimes.  

Most of my time in grad school was relatively uneventful, but I did meet my boyfriend before my second year.  We've been together over a year and a half.  I love him so much, but even that isn't enough.  I finished most of my classes, but I don't think I'll ever graduate,  and I have lost all motivation to finish everything.  

I got a shitty job after I finished my classes, one that doesn't pay a whole lot, but somehow I'm still doing it, I guess I'm a moron.   I feel like half of the people at work hate me and the other half just put up with me.  I certainly don't think any of them would miss me.  

I don't even know if my boyfriend would miss me.  I think I just hold him back.  He doesn't know that something is wrong with me.  If he did, I don't think he would have gone out of town.  He's been gone for a few weeks.  He took most of his guns with him, but there is an assault rifle under the bed.  Part of me is upset that he took them, but then part of me wouldn't want to shoot myself and leave a terrible mess anyway.  

I just want to plan it out right.  I bought a ton of poppy seeds online.  Right after my boyfriend left, I shook up some of them with some lemon juice and water to see if they could get me high.  After I drank the liquid, I felt very warm and eventually couldn't keep my eyes open, I was so at peace.  When I woke up I got very dizzy and vomited a few times, but it was good to find out that the seeds worked.  

I still have about six pounds of seeds left.  I don't know how many I should use to make a strong ""tea.""  I guess I could use them all, then get really drunk, down the ""tea"" and hopefully fall asleep and not wake up ever again.  

I can't do it yet though.  Is it weird that I don't want to die on a day I'm supposed to go into work?  If I plan it right, I'll fall asleep forever on a day off, and hopefully they will find out in enough time to schedule someone to cover my shift.  Thankfully, my boyfriend should be coming home around the day after my days off.  I don't want him to walk in on me and call an ambulance or anything, I don't want to be in a mental hospital. I don't want there to be a lot of decay or anything by the time he gets home, I'm sure coming home will be a bad enough experience.  I also don't want him to have to drop everything and come home early if he doesn't hear from me.

I have a little over a week left.  I don't think I'm going to leave a note.  While it would be nice if the assholes at work felt bad and guilty if they knew I killed myself, I don't want the people that I like to feel guilty.  Part of me does want to leave something reassuring to the people who aren't assholes, but then that will give away that it was planned, and I don't want kind people to blame themselves.  After all, it's not their fault, this is just me. 

I feel the need to clean the house before next week, so I'll have to work on that for the next few days.  I bought a huge bottle of rum that I can wash down with poppy seed tea.  I just hope that everything goes the way I intend.  If I wake up next Wednesday morning, I don't know what I'll do.

4ekiuo,1,2016-04-13,Changing Majors. Planning to take 22 hours. Horrible Mistake?,aychtooessohfore,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ekiuo/changing_majors_planning_to_take_22_hours/,"I'm changing from Chemical Engineering -&gt; Computer Engineering this semester. In order to catch up and get on track with graduating on time, I plan on taking 22 hours this semester since it will be mostly lower level courses. Here is my schedule:


 * Intro to Programming (C++) - 4 hours
 * Discrete Math - 4 hours
 * Circuits I - 4 hours
 * Logic Circuits - 3 hours
 * Physics II Lab - 1 hour
 * Stats - 3 hours
 * Art class - 3 hours


I've done a large amount of programming for internships (3 work tours), so I don't think the Programming class will be too challenging. All of the homework for it is posted online as well, and I've done all of the assignments just this past weekend (just to make sure I could do it). I would have the option to test out of the class after the first few weeks, which I will likely try to do. 


Circuits I and Logic Circuits are both taught by amazing professors at my school and are generally considered fairly easy to do well in. The art class should be an easy A. Stats has a bad professor, but from what I've heard the actual content is pretty easy. 


Physics Lab and Discrete math are the two classes I'm most concerned about. Physics lab since it has a reputation at my school for being an awful amount of work and discrete math because I've heard it's very different from other math.


I do plan on trying to review basics and read ahead for at least some of the classes over the summer.


So what do you guys think? Doable or not?

Hi! My name is AJ, I’m a freelance filmmaker from New Zealand who loves telling stories, being creative and collaborating to make cinematic magic happen.


I’m a creative guy, I spend both my free time and my time on the clock working on storytelling as well as the whole filmmaking process.


I have studied 2 and a half years at the New Zealand Broadcasting School and now have a degree in Film and Television. I completed a six month internship at Tait Communications + stayed on an extra 3 months to help finish off a few projects.


My experience at Tait has made me very savvy with corporate video, things like interviews, promotional videos, in-plain-english animations and educational material. Since leaving Tait I have filmed and edited for several well known companies, such as Harcourts, McDonald’s, Fifa, Microsoft and I am also the go-to film guy for My Milk Ltd, a subsidiary of Fonterra.


My passions lie in the more creative side of filmmaking, I love telling stories through writing, directing and video editing. I have written and directed a few short films among my friends. My 2014 team for the Royalto Channel 48 hour film festival got runner-up in Christchurch with our short film “Something New”. We also received several awards including “Best Script” and “Best Editing”.
For my final project at Broadcasting school, I wrote, directed, produced and edited a 20 minute Sitcom pilot called “Stubble”.
I run a Youtube webseries called “Cult Popture”, where myself and a few friends discuss different aspects of the media. I write, direct and edit most of the episodes.

Please help me find target schools!,atlatlist,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/4em80x/super_crap_gpa_like_honest_shit_but_everything/,"Ok this will need a preface. My GPA is crap. Honestly just straight shit. But my test scores aren’t half bad, and not to toot my own horn but my extracurriculars are pretty stellar. With an insane passion in niche fields and majors, and actual experience through internships, I’m a pretty interesting applicant. I write relatively well and have some pretty weird interests and hobbies. My letters of rec are very strong, coming from teachers and counselors. I really need advice on what schools out there might be for me and where I have a decent shot at. This is my first reddit post, a friend of mine suggest I post something here due to my unique disparity between my GPA, test scores, and extracurriculars. 

**Demographics:** Male, Hispanic, Nevada, Magnet high school, Junior, First gen, lower middle class

**Intended majors:** Archaeology, Anthropology, Environmental Studies

**ACT:** 33; English-32, Math-29, Reading-36, Science-36, Writing-33

**SAT:** 2100/2400; 680 Reading, 680 Math, 720 Writing

**PSAT:** 1410/1520 (new PSAT scale) currently in the running for NM, commendation recipients announced yesterday

**Class rank:** top 25% unsure on my exact rank but I know it’s in that percentile.

**UW/W GPA:** 3.1/4 UW, 3.7/4.8 W  yeah, yeah, yeah I know it’s shit. Please don't give me unnecessary flak for it

**Coursework:** So far I've taken APWH, got a 4. This year (junior year) I'm taking APUSH, APES, AP Physics, AP Lang, AP Seminar (part of the AP Capstone program), and I'm self studying for the AP Human Geography test. Next year I will be taking AP Statistics, AP Government, AP Lit, AP Research (part of AP Capstone program), and maybe one other AP science class I haven't decided on yet (AP Bio, AP Chem, or AP Physics C). Besides the plethora of AP’s all other classes have been honors. 2 years of Jazz band, 3 years of Japanese, 2 years of Spanish. I’ll graduate with 5 language credits.

**Extracurriculars**: Ok so this is where the strength of my application is

- Speech and Debate: Lincoln Douglas debate captain, Vice President Junior year, President Senior year, top 5% ranked all around competitor in the state, top 10% ranked in the country, World Schools Debate qualifier for this year, heading to nationals in June.
- Model United Nations: Founded the club my freshman year. Officer position held every year, President elect for next year. Won Best Delegate in the Security Council at LVMUNIII this year.
- Varsity Quiz: Current Vice President of the most winning Varsity Quiz team in Nevada State history. Rerunning for VP for next year. 
- Habitat for Humanity Youth United: Out of school organization, Vice President for this and next year.
- Southern Nevada Water Authority Youth Advisory Council: Council member and project head for both junior and senior year.
- Mock Trial: Open only to juniors and seniors at my school, so this was my first year. Continuing it next year, running for office.
- We The People: The team for next year hasn't been picked yet but I think I have a good shot.
- Intern/volunteer with the UNLV Archaeology department: Work under Dr. Karen Harry, professor of archaeology at UNLV. Help out with lab work and on digs.
- RYLA: Rotary Youth Leadership Awards
- American Legion Nevada Boys State
- World Atlatl Association: The atlatl is a 30,000 year-old spear-throwing device. I happen to be only of only 3 registered WAA competitors and event organizers in Nevada. Atlatls are something I’ve studied for my entire life and along with other paleo tools and practices something I’ve become known for in the community and in the academic world, organizing community events and working with archaeologists from across the country on atlatl research. Still unsure how I’ll include that in my app but it’s such a huge part of my life I need to fit it in some how. Take a look at my username and you’ll see how important it is to me. 
- Part time job: Earl of Sandwich, junior and senior year.

**Schools:** I’m all over the place, but mostly looking at smaller, liberal arts colleges. I honestly have very few preferences on location or size. I need help finding target schools. With my crap GPA I feel like every school is a reach, which is bad.

- Oberlin (visited in February, loved it)
- Pomona
- UMich Ann Arbor (visited in February)
- Grinnell College (has an atlatl team! And archaeology professor is the most recognized atlatl expert/academic in the world, John Whittaker, aka goals)
- Middlebury 
- Swarthmore 
- UCLA (visited last year)
- UNR"

When a new employee is hired HR was *supposed* to give me around a weeks worth of prep for new computer setup (we can't do images), email, etc. So long of a heads up for my sake because shit goes wrong with computers sometimes or I'm working on a time sensitive project and need to schedule stuff to make it work. The habit with our new HR manager (been here ~6mo) is to verbally tell me the day of.

I have spoken to and emailed him multiple times about submitting a ticket and he started doing it about two weeks ago. Though he submits the ticket in the wrong format and with the fields filled out incorrectly. He also fills in info for our payroll system wrong, incorrect birthdays and stuff.

I have been keeping my boss informed about this and forwarded some email chains to him. Last week my boss sent an email to the HR guy and CC'd me, our finance director, the manager in charge of interns, and the VP (HR's boss). It basically stated that he's not doing his job and that if I am not given 72 hours or three work days (I agreed to this amount of time) notice with a *correctly* filled out ticket that I am not responsible for getting it done.

This morning I sent out another email to the HR guy telling him to fix the tickets he submitted incorrectly and CC'd my boss on it. The HR guy asked me to help him fix one to make sure he does it right, I helped of course. He then proceeded to leave work, at 11am not 5pm, before correcting the other three... Chances are he'll get chewed out by my boss again tomorrow.

Now to see if he starts to follow through. There's already one new hire next month that he hasn't submitted a ticket for which I'm not going to do crap about until he does his side correctly. This was my boss's command for handling it."

However if the tech company converts me to a full time employee (which is very likely given past statistics and my performance) they will expect me to join a month later. However I would need to get my joining date extended if that is the case. Do you think it makes sense to discuss this with my manager now, or should I wait until I get the job offer? Or should I just not go for the summer programme, which might mean losing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity? I need to make a decision soon, so that I can accept or reject the summer programme offer."
4emxfe,5,2016-04-13,Getting interviews but not job offers. Hitting a Wall and need some advice,Jayarch,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4emxfe/getting_interviews_but_not_job_offers_hitting_a/,"I'm job hunting in the digital marketing field which I've held a few previous positions in and have been on a number of interviews for the past year. Though, I seemed to have hit a wall in terms of getting offers am reflecting/ trying to take a hard look at my current interviewing skills. I've been on enough interviews where I should have received an offer or two but I haven't received any. I have been close for interviews where it's been a choice between me and someone else but almost getting the offer is still not getting the job. It's making me reflect since I don't remember having this much trouble getting my internship and entry level positions I've had in the past, I just applied for jobs like everyone else, went on a few different interviews, received a few rejections but most of the time there would be at least one offer from one of the places I interviewed with after only a couple of months of job hunting; this was the post recession economy too. 

It's a numbers game but now that I'm trying to move up into higher paying positions though can't seem to break through this wall standing between me and potential offers. I suspect it's largely due to my interviewing skills which were enough to get entry level jobs are but are not enough to get higher paying positions to move up in my career (though I've been on a few interviews for entry level paying positions where the responsibilities were nearly the exactly same as my previous jobs and didn't get those either). I've emailed for feedback a couple of times but have either received no response. The one time I did was a reply informing me “We can't give feedback to rejected candidates, just company policy. Thanks for your understanding and best of luck in your job search.” That interview went pretty well I thought.... It could've been a case of a candidate being more qualified or having better interviewing skills but my confidence is a bit dinged over these past couple of months.

What's strange is I've been told I have a good resume by a couple of my previous interviewers at the start of the interview but a few times when I talked about my previous experience I can see disappointment come across their face or they become disengaged when I answer a question honestly but it's not the answer they were looking for and made their mind up they're not going to hire me but continue on with the interview anyway. Then I'll recognize something just went wrong somewhere and wonder whether I should have said more about my experience, specific project, if I didn't tie my answer back to the duties of the position such as to the question “What's your greatest weakness?” or just am not selling myself as I should be since I'm understandably a bit nervous. Something is going wrong somewhere along the line. 

I think what's happening here is the good on paper scenario with with my resume vs me. In person my personality is a bit of reserved and modest but this can have a negative effect during an interview since you really need to sell yourself,  skills and experience. I think part of the problem is how I'm coming across to interviewers; a nice honest person who has some skills that they're looking for but probably leaving them with doubts about the depth of my skills/ not explaining them fully enough and possibly even not being a good cultural fit which can be a bit tricky since that deals with personality.

Another issue I think is my degree which in architecture but having much of my work experience from previous jobs in digital marketing. One reason for that is I initially applied for architecture jobs when I graduated but couldn't get any entry level jobs in arch since I lacked real world experience in the field (applied for internships in college but this was during the recession when architecture firms were laying off workers. I did manage to get a marketing internship in college which lasted a year and then got a low paid digital marketing position at a startup which lasted about a year also which lead to another digital marketing position which lasted a few years. Around this time I thought, “hmm.... a marketing career seems to be working out better than the arch; and I don't even have a degree in it strangely. But some interviewers have asked me when they see my degree on my resume. “So what about architecture?” Which is a deeper question really asking “Are you going to jump ship a few months from now if you find a job in your degree field?” I try to make it clear that I've made a career change to the marketing field which has more opportunities and even how there are even transferable skills between the two industries but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Though, there's plenty of people working in field which they don't have degrees in so they're navigating this question in a better way than I am.
 
Finally, I think some of my interviews are not going as they should is when it comes time for me to ask questions. I like to think I generally have good informed questions based on my research beforehand though have caught myself asking a general question which they've already stated during the first few minutes of the interview due to nerves or not asking questions that are in depth enough perhaps which can be shooting myself in the foot. 

Sorry for such a long post but I'm a bit frustrated and especially now being laid off, my saving getting low and seeing friends move up in there careers making pretty good money, buying homes, going on vacation, etc... It's not good to compare to others but it's dinged my confidence a bit and made me think “What are they doing that I'm not?” 

I'm thinking about just getting a part time job but worry if I can't even get an offer for a full time job how am I going to get an offer for a part time job? With a college degree and several years work experience at that since many part time positions seek college students or non college graduates. 

Can anyone relate or do you have advice if you went through the same thing of getting interviews but not offers?"

I've posted in here before, and will post again, based on my most recent thoughts.

I received my B.S. in Psychology in 2011.
I received my M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in December of 2015.

In the last year of my Masters program, I realized that although Counseling is fun, and has some excitement, the bad feelings towards it outweighs the enjoyment. I know it sounds crazy to not want to do something without even officially starting, but my loss of interest, terrible internship experiences, and overall lack of earning potential has really disheartened me.


I currently work as a youth leader at a religious institution for the last 4 years, and this year I have grown to not enjoy it. I am up for a promotion for the coming year, starting July, and I'm really worried that I will be miserable working there still.

I have discovered that I am more interested in things like budgets, benefits, etc, although lacking a solid knowledge base. I have been researching accountants, financial advisors, Human Resources generalists all as options to explore.

I am currently engaged, getting married in June of this year. I hate to put my fiancee through this uncertainty.


I would appreciate any direction or advice on ways to progress."

4en05b,0,2016-04-13,What can I do to get into HBS?,MBAGMATGUY111,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4en05b/what_can_i_do_to_get_into_hbs/,"Hello, 

I am currently a junior at Cornell looking for advice on what I could do to increase my chances of getting to HBS specifically.  The reason I am fixated on this school despite not having entered the work force full time is that I had wanted to attend Harvard for my undergrad but started thinking about my education/future too late while in high school and could not build a strong enough profile to get in, and want to avoid a repeat of that by getting a headstart. Also it's obviously a great school and very well suited to my goals. 

Moving on, my profile is as follows:

-20 year old Indian male (green card holding permanent resident)

-double majoring in economics and statistics, minor in government,  4.08~ GPA which I will hopefully maintain to graduation, but probably won't be able to. My GPA is higher than 4 due to some graduate level stats and Econ courses I undertook. 

-I have not yet taken  the GMAT but based on advice given to me in my other thread, I will probably start preparing for it soon before I am working full time. I anticipate that I will be able to score quite well on it as I have  always been quite good at standardized testing and scored a 2300+/2400 on the SAT and scored a 710 on a GMAT practice test I gave without prep. I anticipate that with a good amount of prep I should be able able to score 760 or above. 

As for work experience, after freshman year, I had an internship at a venture capital firm in India which i finagled my way into through ""networking"" i.e the firms director went to college with the father of one of my friends from high school. I am unsure of the value of this experience as it is not US based, but both of the firms directors hold M7 MBAs if it makes a difference. After my sophomore year, I was an investment banking summer analyst at one of credit Suisse/Barclays/deutsche. In the coming summer i will be a summer analyst at Goldman/JPM/MorganStanley. I was hoping to get an MBB consulting internship, as most other Indian males I know of at HBS and similar schools had MBB experience, but unfortunately was unable to. However, I do not want to work as a consultant myself. 

The main issue with my profile is that as a result of focusing mainly on my academics and work experience I have neglected my extracurricular activities. I have leadership roles in my schools investment and economics clubs. I'm also a member of some creative clubs but pretty inactive in those. I write a semi regular column on economic policy/politics from an economic perspective in a college news publication. Also I had a short research stint with an economics professor and group of undergrad and grad students but in hindsight it was pretty inconsequential. I participated in it because I was considering going into academia and getting my PhD in economics but after some self reflection I probably won't. Basically I want to know how I can boost my profile, especially the extracurriculars. I was thinking of starting a political/economics/stats blog like fivethirtyeight out of my own passion/interest but honestly I don't think i could take out the time and doubt its impact would be significant given the amount of time invested. Still, it's something I'm into and would like to do if I had the time. What are some activities or initiatives I could take up which could boost this part of my profile but not require as much of a time commitment?

As for my career goals, I want to work in finance. I definitely don't want to work in the sell side long term, and hope to work in either private equity or hedge funds, and am also considering VC. Obviously buy side jobs are very hard to get as a fresh grad, and I will probably work for in IBD after grad before breaking in. Is it worth pursuing opportunities in MBB consulting after grad given that I am sure that I want to work in finance long term? I ask because as an Indian male I face particularly stringent admissions standards and nearly all of the Indians I know at HSW have had MBB or tech experience. However if I were to somehow get into consulting, breaking into PE would probably happen only after my mba.

I guess I'm basically looking for advice on how to become the most attractive possible candidate. I'm  sorry for the long rambling post, I'm typing on my phone and English is my second language. Thanks for reading.

4en2qc,1,2016-04-13,Job advice,lostboy85,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4en2qc/job_advice/,"this is mostly an update, but advice is always welcome the original post is below. 

I took vacation, turned out to be unpaid, I thought I was salaried, but I guess I am hourly, while on vacation a few mistakes I had made came out, I realized I had made them right before, I got the calls on them, so after a good chewing out, I carried on with my vacation. 
First day back at work, my boss presents me with a list of shit I need to unfuck myself on, on there was a customer complaining about my children being too loud, all I can think and eventually say is, this woman isn’t even a paying customer, she is my bosses friend, he didn’t feel like providing her IT service, so he threw her to me, I helped her during my off time, and I monitored her computers until everything, was done while she was out getting drunk, and she call’s my boss to complain that my kids are loud, it was unprofessional and he fucking agree’ s with her, Bruh. 
So then after discussing that I no longer want to provide afterhours system maintenance, because it really interferes with my ability to get sleep, and complete my college course work, we have some customers who live at their desks, my pay gets cut $300 a month, which made no sense since I wasn’t even getting paid extra, to do the afterhours system maintenance because I thought I was salaried. So in 2015 I made $27k after tax, and in 2016 I am looking at just $23K, I saw the numbers cause he left his computer unlocked of the $300K the NY office generated, I alone brought in $120K and when I had to go to Miami that I had to pay, I brought in another $80K. Also the dude bought a Porshe. 
I have a Job interview with a new company on Friday, and 3 others interview next week.

Original post:
I have been at a small IT consulting company for 2 years now, I do owe this place a bit, I started off with just knowing how to format a hard drive and now I handle all the LVL 1, LVL 2 and some of the LVL 3, onsite, remotely and after hours system servicing. Recently I have been having the F@ck its. It maybe because I haven’t taken an actual day off in a year, even when I am away I still do remote support, on the other hand, my salary. My pay is based upon my certification, the more certs I have, the more I make, currently I have an MCSA in Windows 8.1 and have 2 test tests left till my MCSE in Server 2012 R2 Desktop infrastructure, but MCSE is my pay cap, with a family to support and only making $27k for 2015, if it wasn’t for my Veteran Benefits supplementing my income drastically, I most likely would have left a long time ago, but out of both loyalty and the fact that I received heavy exposure to different IT environments, I am staying in this limbo, it doesn’t help that I am relied upon heavily. Since our interns don’t last more than month, they all either don’t get it or fail there exams several times, the other guy had a psychotic break, after falling asleep on a train and waking up thinking God was trying to kill him, Seriously that happened. I think I should go, but it would hurt this company to go, at the same time since we handle mostly Microsoft, I realized that I allowed myself to specialize and not also learn the different OS’s in-depth and other virtualization technologies, so I am concerned that I may not be an appealing prospect. Well I am looking for advice to go or to stay or just anything really?"
4en6rm,5,2016-04-13,Freshman trying to network into a PWM internship and Need Advice.,sprezzaturian1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4en6rm/freshman_trying_to_network_into_a_pwm_internship/,"So I'm a freshman Business major at a CA community college who is currently trying to network my way into a summer internship for Private Wealth Management. I will be applying for transfer this Fall to UC Berkeley Haas, USC Marshall, UCLA, and a few others. I am trying to start a career in finance after college and I want to get a head start on networking and gaining experience. I have an Excel Spreadsheet with names and have been networking heavily. 

I'm still trying to get the hang of networking as it is a skill gained through lots of practice. 

I recently did an informational interview with the Senior Vice President of a Morgan Stanley PWM office in my area, it went really well and he was impressed by my knowledge of the industry and said I asked really good questions. In my follow up thank you email a day after the call, I said ""If you are offering any internship opportunities at your office over the summer please feel free to contact me. I would love to learn more about your company and the Wealth Management Industry. "" and also said that I hope to keep in touch. When I asked about whether their office offer opportunities for experience I was told that ""it depends"" and it was left very open ended. So maybe that is a good sign as its not a flat out ""no you don't have the experience"". 

Is this too forward and too soon? I understand you cannot outright ask of an internship but I think I worded it in a laid-back kind of way. I feel if I'm not at least a little aggressive I won't get one. They usually take juniors from USC and UCLA as interns so I'm really up against it but am determined to work for it. I also have been networking with my local smaller Wealth Management firms as well, but I really want that name brand to stand out. Worst case scenario I gain good contacts, mentors, and have great phone and in person interviews where I learn a lot, even if I don't get the internship opportunity. Am I being too aggressive or committing any faux pas? I am trying to show my contacts that I am smart, trustworthy, and would fit in well with their team over the summer. But I need to go from the interview to actually being offered a summer position.

I am currently a 3rd year EE student trying to get an internship for the summer. I didn't get one in my preferred field but a friend is trying to hook me up with one in a software company where he works. The job primarily uses SQL (and Visio) and so he has told me to modify my CV to show that I have SQL/Visio experience/worked on a school project which utilized SQL and/or Visio.

The thing is...to date I have never used SQL in school. I know it sounds weird but it just never came up. I think one of my 4th year courses brushes up on it and that's it. I did use SQL when I was operating a point-of-sale at an electronics store but that was almost 4 years ago. As for Visio...a quick google search tells me it is a data modelling software but that's about all I know.

So my question is this: what sort of projects or applications do you (or have you) used either SQL or Visio in? I know SQL is used to access/edit large databases but I would like really specific answers that give me some sort of technical idea of how these tools are used.

To start, my post-MBA goal is to join a F500 corporate working in a leadership development/general management/internal strategy/or product management role in NYC/NJ.  My girlfriend and I will be moving to this area together, but she is 1 year ahead of me in the MBA process and has an offer in that region for an internship already. 

I received some dough from Fuqua (&gt;$15k, &lt;50k).  Until recently, I was between Yale and Fuqua.  I think culture-wise, Fuqua is a better fit and the money is a nice bonus (Yale likely won't match). In analyzing the employment placement rigorously through conversations with multiple parties, despite popular belief that Yale places better into the area given its proximity, the numbers don't seem to support that.  Fuqua seems to have just as strong, if not stronger placement, for these roles in NYC/NJ both out of school and in looking at number of people in the top F500 firms from each school.  Yale is of course rising in the rankings (could make top 5 over next few years), has a better university brand (but not as good for BSchool IMO), and offers a more diverse experience. 

I had largely written off stern from the onset - never really liked the culture, don't want to be in the city for my 2-year MBA, and it is on a downward trajectory, possibly in a tier below the other 2 schools.  HOWEVER, in doing alot of recent analysis as far as alumni network in the region and corporate placement in the region, Stern definitely is the strongest given its regional status. 

My questions are - what would you guys do?  Is there anything else I should consider before making my decision?  Stern decision is due 4/18 (which literally until yesterday had been a non-issue for me), with Fuqua due the following week.  Do I go with the fit angle (and money) and pick Fuqua, expecting to still get a job through on-campus recruiting and individual networking (I am a multi-year experienced strategy consultant currently, not super worried about getting interviews). Or do I go with a shorter-term given with Stern, but not have as strong of country-wide network for the rest of my life.  Or pick Yale given the recent ranking increase?

Thanks in advance for all advice /sentiments - much appreciated!

Just because I have extremely high functioning Autism, and I am essentially normal (just a slight bit antisocial), my special education teacher, my parents, and my school, still insist that I have many more problems than I actually do. I hate almost everything to do with special education and I want nothing to do with it. The last thing I want is to be considered anything aside from normal. If I say outright that I have Autism to people I know IRL, then they will treat me differently. I know from talking to all of my female friends  that Autism is very unattractive. I want to be considered as attractive as I can to girls. In this past year, I have branched out in terms of relationships as much as I can, although no luck so far. earlier this year, I asked out a crush I had since 8th grade, and she misunderstood me. I never got back to her, so I still assume the answer is no. I just recently (last week) asked out my crush that I have had for most of the school year. Turns out she has either a Girlfriend or Boyfriend. I don't know which. I hate how people think just because someone has Autism that they cant feel empathy. I am a very empathetic person despite my Autism. I can feel and express my emotions very well. I don't really express my emotions too much because I want to keep a low profile, and I can also unintentionally become intense and come off as rude or angry. I act just like everyone else, except I don't talk very much. I am always one of the quiet kids. Compared to other autistic people, I am most likely the most articulate and socially able person. I don't have many friends because I am pretty shy, which has nothing to do with my autism. I do have my few friends, but they all live in another city. Luckily I am moving schools next year, so hopefully I can drop this horrible reputation as the weird quiet kid and actually gather a good friend group. One of the bigger things I hate about having Autism is that when I get angry and get a harsh tone of voice, people always assume ""Oh he's having an autistic fit"". No I am not. I am expressing my anger the way anyone else would. I don't raise my voice, and I don't hurt anyone. I keep myself calm and composed unless it is absolutely impossible. I, and most of the other kids I know, would say that I am one of the more mature and calm people in my grade, although my special education teacher doesn't seem to think so. I can get very aggravated, although it only comes up in the bigger arguments or fights I have. If you ask any random person I have known for at least a month, they would guess that I do not have Autism. Apparently my special education teacher and the rest of the school administration think I have major issues. They have only seen my bad side, which is only me 25% or less of the time. Another thing that really pisses me off is that whenever I have a ""major"" incident in class 75% of what actually happened gets lost in translation and then I get called out for only what my special education teacher heard. A little while ago, I was feeling frustrated because I knew I had failed a math test, so I got up and walked over to my teacher's desk to turn in the test. I put it down in a slightly frustrated way, and then apparently my math teacher goes ape shit, saying I ""slammed my paper down"" and ""stormed out of the room"", when in reality I did none of that. I just  handed my paper in, only slightly more exaggerated than normal. Another thing I hate is that they always take situations so much more seriously than they actually are. I was having an argument with my special education teacher about a letter of recommendation for an internship at a city planning and transportation department of my local government, and she mentioned at least 5 times that I have autism in the letter. This is not okay for me, because I want to keep this ""issue"" as quiet and little known as possible in the rest of the world. If she had kept this in the letter, I may not have been selected for this, or if I am selected, they may have treated me differently based on the minuscule amount of information about this ""condition"". The argument got heated, and I started getting slightly angry. She told me that she was offended in a very angry and disrespectful tone, so I was like, ""Nope I'm done. Fuck you."" and left. She then acts as if I had done something so much more horrendous than I actually did. Overall having Autism is a real struggle because people treat me much differently than how I actually am, and because they take my anger so much more seriously than it should be. If you meet someone with high functioning autism like me, don't treat them any differently. Speak and act to them as normal human beings, just as you would with anyone else. I am a special case, because I am so much more normal and so high functioning,and my personality is so indistinguishable from a normal person's. I get sarcasm, and I can tell when someone is joking, while a lot of other autistic people cant. I am sick of feeling abnormal and incapable of doing things just based on what other people think of me. "
4eovtm,1,2016-04-13,Summer Internship Decision,GoldStandard7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4eovtm/summer_internship_decision/,"Hey guys, I'm a current sophomore in CS at a well-established university, and I'm choosing between two possible first-time, full-time software engineering internships for this upcoming summer:

1. Accenture Tech Labs - Pays decently well and I'd be doing interesting work.  I would also be working with a number of other software engineers, though not many other interns, and the company culture seems pretty laid-back.  The software engineering internship program is small, but established, so I'd likely have some mentorship and guidance.

2. Startup - A very small startup that went through YC last summer, made up of only two people - a business guy and a CS guy.  Probably wouldn't be making as much money as at the other internship, but would have a ton of autonomy and responsibility.  It's also right by my school, so I'd probably have housing there already anyway.

As far as I can tell, both involve full stack development of product features, as well as shipping code.  I'm not as interested in money as I am in career growth and experience... though money is nice too, of course.  Ideally, I would choose the internship that leads to the most development as a software engineer and opens the most opportunity for future jobs.  Alternatively, I could just take summer classes and/or find something at my school's startup incubator.  What do you guys think would be the best option for me?"

My knowledge is EXTREMELY limited, please help.",justgotnoccedup,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4ep4lq/today_i_was_hired_as_an_entry_level_noc/,"Let me start with my background and what I do know:

   ‍   
I can ""build"" a computer from the ground up. With a little research to verify certain components are compatible as I don't stay up to date with new hardware until it's time to actually build a computer.

I do not know how to code, although I passed an intro C++ course with an A, I remember nothing. I have a fundamental comprehension of coding, but no active memory of the language.

I worked as an IT Help Desk assistant under a paid internship for some time. Mostly software issue diagnosis, password resets, printer issues, my mouse doesn't work, A LOT of backing up and re-imaging, you get the picture. Some bits of software updates pushed over the network using McAfee and LanDesk. It was with a BIG organization and made my resume look very fancy.

No certificates. Although I've studied for my A+, I can no longer recollect the difference between DRAM, SRAM &amp; SDRAM, or anything along those lines. If I don't use it I don't keep it.

I installed Ubuntu once or twice and played with it for a couple days.

I know that arctic silver does not taste good.

I'm very good at learning when it's necessary. This is why I'm here. I start in 2 weeks and I'd like to be directed towards the best resources possible to accumulate as much as I can before my training starts, and during my training period.

   ‍   

Now for the job info to help clarify my situation a bit.

   ‍   

They know my knowledge is limited.

Some of the monitoring software they use will require me to learn shell commands for Linux/Unix.

The position is contractual. If I acquire enough knowledge in the time frame of the contract (6 months) to impress them enough to offer me a permanent position, I'll officially have a career.

This is very important to me and I appreciate any direction you may have to offer."

So I only chose this major because 

1. Engineering majors lead to some promising jobs and internships

2. I like math and physical science

3. I like technology

I have no experience with computer science whatsoever, or engineering stuff in general. 

Also, idk if this is worth mentioning, but I have noticed that I am pretty bad when it comes to following instructions when building something. For instance, I tried to build a ping pong table and I had so much trouble with it. Maybe engineering just isn't for me? Or is computer engineering different? I specifically just don't like working with drills and what not (like construction work).

I am a sophomore studying CS with a minor in Finance and Advanced Technology. My internships fell through this summer due to recently switching to the major and lacking programming skills (I really only know web design, but I know that well).

This summer, I will work 15 hours a week (or more if I'd like) for a startup company that a friend (years older and graduated) recently started. It is just him and one other, both of them are salesmen for the company and could use some extra help. It is unpaid, but in return I will get my own office space to run my web design business after hours as well as the freedom to use the title of ""software engineer"" with his permission. He said that since I'm unpaid, I can really do whatever I want, but he will probably have small jobs for me to do and I'll be able to travel with him and the other owner on the company card for expos and conferences. They're both 23, graduated, and I'm 20 (he's actually an old high school friend of mine). They've made decent success so far and I think it will be impressive to work for a drone company instead of just working retail all summer.

**Company Summary:** They are a middleman for clients requesting drone footage/surveying. They find licensed drone operators who pay them a monthly fee, and in return they get connected to clients. Their main clients are large farms and real estate developers (for both land surveying and for mansions for sale that want an aerial video).

I would like to continue taking CodeCademy courses and finding projects to put on GitHub for my portfolio. I will be working on my web design business for about 30hrs a week as well, so I will make a good amount of money and hopefully raise my client count (about 35 right now over the last 3 years part time).

**What can I do that will impress employers for next summer's internships?** They already have a website obviously. He mentioned lead generation and developing a few scripts to fill out forms a lot faster. Perhaps work on a simple mobile app for the drone operators to accept jobs? Would that be software engineering? I would like to practice actual software engineering with the company and include it in my resume. It is a bold title to assume, so I want to ensure that I can back it up in interviews. I have very good social skills so as long as I get an inch I can make a mile out of it (as my southern grandpa always said).

What would you do?

My dream schools were UC Berkeley, USC, and Cornell. I actually can’t believe I got into 2 of my dream schools!! I will be attending Berkeley in the fall. Honestly still can’t believe I got into 2 super dreamy schools with my aggressively average stats.

Long story short is I'm 23 years old, I've been in this job for the past 2.5 years where I started as an intern, worked my way to a junior and now in a middle weight role. I've been feeling unhappy for the past few months mainly due to management putting too many time constraints on the projects that we get leading the team and myself to be unhappy, stressed, making mistakes because we're rushing etc.

So I'm at the tipping point where I've come to work on wednesday after a 2 day break and been told that a project that went on hold (the client delayed constantly for the past 3 weeks) has now started again and we have a weeks worth of time to do 4 weeks worth of work, no extra people helping out, just 2 of us. The project manager specifically said we were going to have to give up our evening and weekends to finish the project.

I asked for more time and they said no, I asked for more people and they said there was no one. I left the meeting room gob smacked and furious. I have commitments outside of work such as volunteering where I've now had to let people down. I reported it to HR later in the day who said she'd speak to the project manager and I saw later the two of them in a room together having a chat.

A day later, I've heard nothing. I've asked again if theres anything we can do to reduce the workload and the answer is a straight no. I'm considering quitting, but I dont have anything lined up afterwards and I've never got time to find a new job or go to interviews so I'm starting to think I should just blind quit and use my savings to support myself until something else comes along. 

I have no idea what to do so any advice would be helpful."

I applied for a data analysis internship position for another company and they told me the same thing but once again liked my previous work experiences and told me they want me for their marketing team.

I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I'm currently a junior and graduation is looming next year.

I'm not even looking for advice anymore I just have to get it off my chest. So back in September 2015 I ran into an old acquaintance on the bus. She was cute and to my knowledge she liked to dance. I very much like to dance. You'll understand what I mean by ""to my knowledge"" in a minute. So I was reeling back from an ex I could rant pages about if I didn't despise that person so much. The current girl I'm talking about, even to this day I can't say much bad about, that being said it's absolutely her fault we broke up. In all we're together about six months.

We were *courting* about a month before I even touched her. She was a really innocent type of girl and later I even find out, a virgin. She had rejected my moves to kiss her at least twice but at one point I asked her to hang out, she said yes, I finally kissed her. So now, we go another like two weeks before we go to a dance event a couple states away and I officially ask her out. The next weekend we have sex for the first time.

Now keep track of the time count, it's very important. After explaining directly that I was interested in her, we probably go a solid month an a half before ever having sex.

So the good times. The relationship is awesome. She's a little busy but I admire it because she volunteers under two charities, works for groups on campus gratis and is doing a major research study. Like I said, the girl is awesome. We get dinner and go to beer festivals and dances and road trip a lot. Nothing is setting off alarms for me at all. No fights for five months. Just a pretty girl, having fun, going out and well... just okay sex. But that was fine. 

The last month of our relationship comes along and we have this completely random hell week. Like on day her dog dies, the next day we go out to a concert and I almost get into a fight which she wants me to apologize for (not gonna happen the guy ran into me). We also learn I'm leaving the country for an internship and the same day she tells me she's four days late on her period.

Im panicking thinking she's pregnant but she gives me no mercy. I promise to get breakfast in the morning and I say let's go to health services to which she responds ""oh it's fine I had my period."" Note that I had stayed up all night and she didn't tell me until that moment. We have breakfast and later  that afternoon she decides she's going on the pill. From this moment, we never have sex again.

 A day later she has to talk to me so we drive to a restaurant where Im pretty sure she's going to break up with me. 

She doesn't but she talks about how I keep hurting her feelings and Im insensitive. Specifically she brings up that I called her lame when she wouldn't go sledding with me. That's true, I did call her lame, but as a joke obviously. And then she cried about it when she told me it upset her and she said I've been being to harsh on her since day one! Really?! So why didn't you speak up day one? You don't communicate until like month 5?

So from that whole conversation and that whole week everything goes down hill. I'm trying to reason my way out of it like I explained everything she was addressing and on top of that I now feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. So this is my greatest mistake. I ask her if these arguments have something to do with the pill. She loses her mind. *FUCK YOU! IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PILL! WHEN IM MAD IM MAD! ITS NOT THE PILL!*. Deep down I still think it was a reasonable question.

But she got off the pill and the bullshit didn't stop. She stopped coming out with me. This is why I said she liked to dance ""to my knowledge"". She would stay home and watch TV when I wanted to go out. Dancing no longer interests her apparently. Eventually Id relent and stay home and not have sex, but Id try to have sex with her and of course stop when she said no. But the thing was, she never ever ever initiated sex. It always had to be me, so how was I supposed to know if I was going to be able to have sex with her?

Skip to me asking her if we're going to last long distance. This isn't even an argument. It's a very reasonable conversation. I think this is the break up moment. I've been thinking I need to breakup up with her for about a week at this point. Things definitely aren't working out. I explain what I've explained here and she sort of apologizes but agrees we aren't right for each other. She does say things like I try to have sex too often... you know when she would never have sex with me. And she says she thinks we got physical too early, which was her doing. After we got back from that dance weekend she texted me one morning asking me to come over because her roommate's out. I walk in and there are lit candles everywhere. It's a clear message. Greenlight. But anyway, she brought it on so it makes me mad that she implies it was my fault we had sex ""too early"".

But then she sort of says something rude like:

 ""Do you think we're compatible because there have been a good few days when I thought otherwise.""

So what I thought she meant was, the 6 month relationship only had a few good days. What she actually meant, according to her months later was she thought we weren't compatible on some days. But thinking what I thought she meant, I got mad and I broke up with her. She collapses on the floor crying and I go home. I'm way too mad to sympathize. This is 2 days before my birthday.

The next day I ask her if she wants to talk and she says yes. I apologize, she's not really upset anymore it seems. She gives me a present with a card that says she loves me and she's happy to be my valentine. I get all remorseful and feel I was too harsh on her. I try to open a conversation but we go a couple weeks without talking. I ask her if she thought we broke up too prematurely or if we just weren't thinking. She doesn't feel the same way, she's fine with it now. Says she doesn't have romantic feeling for me anymore. Like a switch just went off in her head the moment I broke up with her. And that kind of scratches at my brain. It bugs me that she's fine, but I don't freak out about it. **She** asks if we can be friends so I say fine. We go another solid month not really talking but doing each other favors whenever. Like I needed a flashdrive for class and she ran it by.

But now I have about a month before I leave the country. I ask if we can get dinner, not as a date just to leave things off clean because Im not mad anymore or anything. She says no, I have to ask why. She says we aren't friends. I ask her why she thinks that and she says ""I feel like if we were friends you would try to turn it into something it wasn't"". **REALLY?!?** We've only been getting coffee once a week for the past month and walking to class together but we aren't friends because you think Im going to make a move on you? With what time I have left in this country do you think Im going to try to win you back at this point? Are you out of your mind? So **BOOM!** argument. She says decision is final. Im kind of pissed because this is condescending to me. I extend the olive branch to her and she spits in my face. I even get to the point where I tell her Im not trying to date her anymore Im seeing someone else, and I am. She doesn't care. Decision's final, we aren't friends. We need more time. I say ""Don't say *we* need more time when what you really mean is *you* need more time."" But she still seems to think Im trying to date her and there's no way to reason against that perception. Finally I see this argument really isn't going my way so I just start ranting basically this rant out to her and she says something about the break up to so I rant that whole thing out to her how it's her fault and I tried to fix things and she wasn't making any effort. She's unfazed. She says we have nothing in common, that's why we aren't friends.... We have nothing in common. How exactly did we date for six months then?! 

Jesus this whole thing just pisses me off. Im not suggesting she isn't over it, that's obviously not the case. But by the time comes that she wants to be friends Im just going to remember this whole thing. It's childish and condescending and an insult to me that she would act all friendly but when I suggest we're friends she pretty much says she's been humoring me the whole time.

Just. what the fuck, guys? I did so much for that girl and She's the one who wanted to be friends! I seriously thought for a while I was the one humoring her.

She hasn't blocked me yet. I don't have any more argument to give her. She participates, but I haven't gotten back about it. It's just a waste of time.

We could've been friends. But, just like the relationship this is pretty much on her. Okay, Rant over.

4et885,1,2016-04-14,I made a mistake,throwawayperson435,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4et885/i_made_a_mistake/,"I was doing okay about a year and a half ago. My treatment-resistant depression and anxiety finally ran into something that worked, for a while. I had TMS treatment. It was very expensive. My family paid around $8k for it. The insurance didn't want to cover it, even though I'd tried so many other meds with no effect. I felt really good afterwards though.

But it didn't last.

Now I'm back to freaking out all the time, self-harming, suicidal thoughts. I am miserable. And my life is good, I guess. I'm graduating this semester, my family is supporting me. I don't have a job lined up and I never got any internships or work experience in my field though, so I feel useless. I feel like I failed already. I never got my driver's license either. I've tried a lot but I'm too scared of driving, and my city has terrible public transportation so I really can't get anywhere without a car. Not reliably anyway.

About two years ago, I fell in love with one of my online friends. We dated long distance for a while, then got married. It was earlier than we really wanted to, but he was here on a student visa and it was running out. Not many opportunities in his field, and not much time to search for a job before his time was up, so we got married so he could stay. I would have been devastated if he had to leave. His country is very far away. He's provided me with so much support. I don't think I would even be graduating without him.

But the stress and fear of the immigration process has really taken a toll on me. There are so many ways I could fuck it up and lose him. Like even if things go well now, if we don't have jobs soon... it might be over.

I should not have married him. I was stupid. I thought my good state would last, but it hasn't. I don't think my family can afford another $8k treatment to fix me for a while. And now I hurt him. I hurt him when I freak out and he can't do anything to help. I hurt him when I hurt myself. I went into the bathroom to hit myself half an hour ago and he was gone when I came out. I don't know where he is. He was upset because he felt he couldn't do anything while I was freaking out.

Someday I know I'm going to kill myself. I've always known. Every thing I do to treat my illness just buys a little more time. But someday I'm going to do it, and he's going to be hurt so badly as a result, and I could have avoided it all if I had just not been selfish enough to marry him. Someday I'm not going to be able to stop myself. I'm not strong enough to live in this world.

I really fucked up. Don't get other people involved in your misery... no one else should have to suffer like this. I'm just a terrible pain factory. I cause everyone close to me to suffer emotionally and financially and all the pills and therapy sessions they pay for don't stick. I'm never going to be functional. I will always be a burden.

Maybe if I can stop being such a spoiled shit I can get better at bottling it up, so he will hurt less. I'm a terrible wife."

Im 22 now and I started out at a community college right out of high school and did okay the first year. Some crap happened in my life going into year 2 and i was dealing with some serious anxiety and depression and my grades really went down, but still transferred after that to a school pursuing a degree in Marketing. Was living at home for all this and during the first semester at the new school realized i needed to get away because i was still depressed and just needed a change of scenery. Transferred to a school about an hour away still pursuing marketing and my grades yet again were just bad but i started to feel a lot better. As i got out of my depression i started to really crank down on school but by this time my grades were ruined and i ended up having to switch to a degree in Interdisciplinary studies with minors in Economics, Sports Communication, and Entertainment Media because i couldnt get into the business school. Im now about to graduate with this and a GPA that isnt good, but i have managed to get way up from where it was after i started to focus on school. I really have no idea what to do and its started to get me really anxious and worried. I have no internships or anything. I have a real strong interest in Sports, really anything to do with sports, its my biggest passion and also i am quite computer savvy. Any suggestions on what to do?"
4eu2dx,0,2016-04-14,Fall16 Schedule,umd_throwaway_sched,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/4eu2dx/fall16_schedule/,"I'm considering taking the following schedule:

MATH241, MATH461, CMSC430, CMSC451, CMSC498I and ENMA150.

Am I crazy? Is this realistic or am I just going to hate myself for four months? I plan on self-studying a ton of Algorithms (interviews/personal interest) Linear Algebra and Calc3 over summer anyways, so I figured I might as well get credit for them. 

I have three semesters left to graduate, and I realized it's not too late to add a mathematics minor. But if I make that decision it's now or never. I've always felt like my math background was below where I want it, so I figured rounding it out over the next three semesters before I'm done with college would be my best bet. 

One of my major concerns is allocating enough time for interviews without failing anything. I'm fairly certain that I will be interviewing with a few of the Big 4 as well as other similar companies, and hopefully will land a few offers. I'll be doing a ton of prep this summer, but I'm a little worried that this schedule will end up being detrimental for my internship oppurtunities.

I'm not particularly concerned about getting a 4.0 in every single class I'm taking, but I also don't want to barely scrape by. I'm very confident in my ability when it comes to the CS classes, especially Algorithms, I don't really expect to struggle in those courses. But is the overall workload just too much? Even if I familiarize myself with the majority of the Calc3/Linear content?

I'm a new grad that's being offered full-time by my previous internship. I've been hesitating on accepting because of a couple reasons listed below. I am lost because I don't have mentors listen to.

Pros:
- I learned a lot there. Like the difference in my technical abilities is mind-blowing after the 8 month internship.  I'm working on important product features.
- I am treated like an equal, not a kid. It feels weird since most are in their 40s. But they respect me enough to contribute and listen to my opinions.  
- I like my coworkers a lot. Everyone is great to get along with. 
- I could live rent free and pay off student loans
- The product is exciting and the environment is fast-paced and fun. 
Cons: 
- Starting at such a small company could make my career projection worse than others. If I ever decide to leave, I will struggle a lot to find a job because my experience comes from startups. I never worked in a large corporation before and feel that it'll hurt me.
- The lack of guidance could hurt my growth. So far I had to figure out most things on my own. Nobody is senior level. I feel more like a hacker than a software developer.
- Reiterating above, but I did not learn deeply about something yet. I don't get to have training days for learning new technologies.
- I don't like the city and could enjoy moving to somewhere larger closer to people my age instead of a suburb. 

This community is great because it helps me grow. I have learned solid career advice, my resume is on point, and I am in the career for the right motives according to y'all. I love creating software, and more specifically working on interesting software. But I also love getting paid. So I'm trying to find the best of both worlds.

So I would appreciate your experiences, comments, concerns and advice. Thanks!"

Last Friday (2016-04-07), I was invited to Google's new Sunnyvale campus for a new Google campus outreach program currently titled Tech Interviewing Decoded. Over the course of approximately five hours, Google hosted a number of talks, panels, and demos to ""demystify the [Google] interview process and give you the opportunity to have your questions answered about launching your career in tech"". Approximately 100-150 computer science/engineering students from four invited Bay Area universities attended the program. I suspect that many readers here would have liked the opportunity to attend such an event so I've written up a quick summary of the day. I suspect that nothing here will be new to some readers on this sub but hopefully it helps some people!

## Mock Interview 'Demo' with Googlers

In my favorite segment, two Google interviewers demonstrated what the technical portion of a Google interview looks like along with tips on what interviewers are looking for. Both the interviewer and interviewee were named Jonathan so I'll refer to them as the interviewer and interviewee. I think it will be more useful if I describe some notable points rather than regurgitating the interviewer's code so the code/solution is left as an exercise to the reader (hah). 

Problem: Write a program that returns the length of the longest chain of consecutive numbers in a grid of natural numbers.

The interviewee began by asking clarifying questions about the problem. An interviewer may give you an intentionally ambiguous or vague problem to assess your attention to detail. Some questions asked in this demo included:

* Q: Can we assume that the grid is square (NxN rather than NxM)? A: Yes, let's say it's square for now.
* Q: Do we have to worry about the grid being so large that it can't fit in memory or anything like that? A: No, let's assume the grid is reasonably sized and will be given as a 2-D array (e.g. int Grid[n][n])
* Q: Do we have to consider diagonal elements? A: Nope. An element is adjacent to another element if it is positioned immediately to its left/right xor top/bottom.

The interviewee then solved an example by hand on the whiteboard to ensure that he was on the same page as the interviewer. Working out a problem by hand is also a good way to gain some intuition on how to design an algorithm for the given problem.

    [0, 1, 4]
    [2, 3, 5]
    [8, 7, 6]
    Longest chain is [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] with length 5.
    
    [0, 2]
    [3, 1]
    Longest chain is [1, 2] with length 2.


It was only after asking questions and solving an example by hand that the interviewee began to actually write code. He began by writing a suboptimal but straightforward brute force solution: iterate through every element in the matrix and see what the longest chain of increasing, consecutive neighbors you can form from each starting point. Keep track of the maximum length encountered and return it after checking all starting points. While writing his solution, the interviewer called a function for finding the longest chain given a starting cell rather than writing the entire solution in one block. Writing modular code in an interview is not only neater but also opens the door to the possibility that the interviewer lets you skip fully implementing some functions. In this case, the interviewer only asked the interviewee to describe how he would implement his getLongestPath function. 

The interviewee then noted that this solution is inefficient and repeats work. Iterating through the grid takes O(n^2) time and finding the longest path takes O(n) so his solution is O(n^3). If I'm not wrong, there seemed to be some inconsistency on whether n referred to the dimension of the matrix (e.g. n = 3 for a 3x3 matrix) or the total number of elements in the matrix (e.g. n = 9 for a 3x3 matrix). He then came up with an O(n) by creating a custom data structure that maps the value of a cell to its index in the matrix.


    [0, 1, 4]
    [2, 3, 5]
    [8, 7, 6]
    -&gt; {0: (0, 0), 1: (0, 1), 2: (1, 0), 3: (1, 1), 4: (0, 2), 5: (1, 2), 6: (2, 2), 7: (2, 1), 8: (2, 0)
    
    [0, 2]
    [3, 1]
    -&gt; {0: (0, 0), 1: (1, 1), 2: (0, 1), 3: (1, 0)}

Then he ran through his new data structure sequentially and checked if the current index is adjacent (e.g. x1 == x2 and y1 == y2+-1 and vice versa) to the next index. Since you only need to iterate through the grid once to fill in your data structure and iterate through the data structure once to find the longest chain, the new solution ran in O(n) time (where n is the total number of elements in the matrix). 

I don't have the interviewees exact Java solution but I whipped up a quick Python implementation of his algorithm ([link](https://gist.github.com/danong/67fe6d1c81cb3ba72c137cf7d64e4168)) as I understood it.

Tip: if you see the opportunity to write a class or use some design pattern, you might as well take it to demonstrate your knowledge of the OOP paradigm. 

It's important to note that throughout the entire interview, the interviewee and interviewee were talking to each other almost continuously. Instead of standing silently while thinking to himself, the interviewee thought out loud so the interviewer could follow his thought process. The interviewee also described what he was attempting to do while writing each line of code. Communicating your thoughts in an interview has the added benefit of allowing your interviewer to give you feedback and hints if you're going in the wrong direction. Multiple Googlers emphasized that your interviewer will want to see you ace your interview and solve the problem so if they give you a hint, take it. They aren't trying to trick or mislead you. Remember that interviewers are also assessing if they would like to work with you and ignoring their hints could make you seem like a stubborn developer who has to do things his or her way.

Tip: identify possible errors or bugs as you work. For example, while writing code to get a cell's neighbors, the interviewee noted that there may be an off by one error when the cell is on the edge of the matrix and said he'd go back to fix it after getting the general algorithm down. This prevents the interviewer from asking you 'gotcha' type questions when you finish. It can also be useful for the interviewer to know that you recognize a problem area so he or she doesn't focus on an error he or she thinks you missed.

## Follow up Demo Q&amp;A with Googlers

Following the interview, the two demonstrators answered questions and gave more tips on how to have a successful interview.

* Q: Will your interviewer run your code? A: Maybe. Some people take notes and run your code later while some don't. If you see your interviewer typing during your interview, it is highly unlikely that he or she is transcribing your code into an IDE however. They're most likely just taking notes.
* Q: How important is syntax? A: You want to show that you know the programming language you're using but it's not like missing a semi-colon is going to ruin your chances.
* Q: What language do you have to code in? A: Your recruiter should talk to you about what language you would like to code in beforehand and you'll be matched with an interviewer who is familiar with that language. We don't recommend trying to do an interview in some obscure language. You're definitely safe if you code in C++, Java, or Python.
* Q: Is it always a good idea to work on the obvious brute-force approach before giving a better or optimal solution? A: Not really. It's impressive if you can briefly describe the obvious solution and its time complexity before going right into a better solution. In this context, the interview from the demo wasn't actually the strongest interview a candidate could have given.
* Q: What if you get a problem that you have no idea how to approach? A: Try to stay calm. Panicking is going to hurt you even more. It's especially important to ask questions, do an example or two, and communicate your thought process to your interviewer.
* Q: I failed an interview in the past. Why didn't I get any feedback on what I did wrong? A: Legal reasons. If you're interviewing again, try to show noticeable improvement. It looks really bad if you fail to solve a problem that you failed to solve in a previous attempt.

## Googler Panel

Following the mock interview, four Googlers took the stage and opened the floor to questions.

* Q: What are some tips that you have for current students? A: Show your passion for CS by participating in organizations and events outside of classes. Work on your own projects or contribute to open source. Study hard and practice for interviews. Try to get as many internships and experience under your belt as possible.
* Q: What are some tips for people trying to get a job at Google? A: Persevere - I waited 5 years before I first applied to Google and when they finally hired me. Make your life easier by letting your know interviewer know if you're having any problems that they could accommodate. Practice interviewing on a whiteboard and do as many interviews as you can; the general tech interview form is pretty similar across companies so there's a lot of skill transfer.
* Q: How is the work-life balance at Google? Do you ever feel burned out? A: Google is so large that the atmosphere/pressure varies from team to team. All the panelists agreed that they had good work-life balance and a lot of stress they feel is self-induced.
* Q: I'm interested in CS education. Are there opportunities for this at Google? A: Again, Google is large. A better question would be what field isn't Google interested in? To your specific example, I know that Google often sends people to teach at historically black colleges and universities. 

## Spotlight Talks

Two Googlers gave slightly longer talks specifically about what they do at Google. The first speech was by someone who entered Google through the Engineering Residency program. The Engineering Residency program is a yearlong training where residents are attached to 2 different teams for training and hands on experience. Apparently it has a ~90% conversion rate and many residents like their first team enough that they choose to stick with it and convert to a full time role. This was the case for our first speaker and she ended up on the Chrome for Android UI team where she worked on implementing features such as the close all tabs button for Android on tablets. She is currently working on features such as split screen support on the upcoming Google N. 

The second speech was largely about the importance of data health, the process of building systems to monitor Google's data systems, and how Google deals with system failures. Rather than naively recording all system logs and informing everybody about the failure, Google has systems in place to identify the root cause of problems and only notifies teams that will be negatively impacted. He also talked about some of the techniques (e.g. power capping) that Google uses to reduce costs in their data centers. 

## Ask a Recruiter! Q&amp;A

The final panel consisted of four recruiters who took questions about the whole recruitment process.

* Q: How long do you spend on each resume? A: Resumes are actually sent to a dedicated resume screening team in Houston who take 10-15 minutes per resume. If your resume makes it past that stage, it gets into our (a recruiter) hands. Since there is such a high volume of applicants, it isn't feasible for recruiters to spend too much time on every resume.
* Q: If I'm rejected, how long should I wait before reapplying? A: Officially it's a year but it doesn't have to be exactly one year to the date.
* Q: How important is it to include links to your portfolio/GitHub on your resume? A: It's definitely helpful. Many interviewers will take the time to look at a candidate's GitHub before interviews.
* Q: What are some resumes do's and don'ts? A: Definitely include your GPA. Unless you have industry experience, keep it to a single page. Be truthful about your knowledge or experience.
* Q: What is the minimum GPA needed to be competitive at Google? A: Google takes a holistic look at each candidate.
* Q: When is the best time to apply for an internship? A: As early as possible after the application opens. It's tempting to wait to give yourself more time to improve your resume but recruiters will have more time to spend on each applicant early in the application period and there are finite number of spots that get filled up over time.
* Q: I dropped out of a PhD program. Does this reflect badly on me or hurt my chances? A: Google is filled with people from non-traditional paths. I wouldn't worry about that at all.

## Closing

In addition to the scheduled talks, a few lucky people were selected for their own practice interviews. Sadly, I wasn't one of those ~20 people. Of course, no Silicon Valley event would be complete some company swag. All attendees received a bag full of Google swag that included a subtly branded Google notebook, plastic sunglasses, socks, and a 2200mAh external battery pack. Some lucky winners also won a free copy of Cracking the Coding Interview.

I thought the event was very well run. All the speakers and panels were good about keeping to the schedule and there was no dead or wasted time. One issue was that other Googlers kept accidentally connecting to the projector in our room. I suspect they have some sort of campus wide conference call/meeting network setup but it was pretty funny to see the projector switch from the presentation slides to some random person every now and then though. Thanks again for hosting this event, Google!

Let me know if you have any questions!

This should be obvious but I'm not associated with Google in any way. The opinions and views expressed are solely my own and do not reflect the view of Google.

so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4a3nbc/thinking_about_leaving_my_new_job/) about a month ago about me considering to leave the retail job I was just hired for. Well I stayed, and now I do not feel so incompetent and it's becoming a part of my life, though I am still constantly applying for jobs related to the creative industry.

One week or so back, after applying for approx. 30+ places and 10+ rejections, I thought maybe the problem is the lack of my work experience, or a specialized skill, I have always been a generalist and never focused on anything except painting which I highly doubt can make it to a work, not at a moment anyways.

My work is a shift work, and I have two days off on weekdays (I work on weekends) so I thought hey why not, let's just apply for an unpaid internship at one of the local creative agency as well. It's only two full-days a week for a month, plus a potential full-time job in future, what will I lose. I can survive. And, great, I did get to their interview stage.

The thing is, now I finally started to concern about my time management skill and if I will need to confront my manager regarding my time shifts. 'A day off' in retail is never a promise. For three times already since I started working, my manager asked me to work on my day offs because something happened or somebody wants *their* day off. My usual excuse is that 'oh I've already planned a day' but I doubt that'll be convincing after a month.

So if I get an internship, the best option for me is probably to tell my manager about it and if I can get fixed days off during my internship (and I can envision a frown on his face perfectly well). I know that is the rational thing to do, that confrontation issue I can easily fix. All I am concerned now is about my time. I will literally working my ass off if I do get the position, and although I am 90% certain that I can manage, I guess I just want some inputs from you guys.

Any comments or suggestions will be appreciated."

4exh1r,9,2016-04-15,How do high-achieving ADHDers cope with the heightened expectations?,adhdnerevarine,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4exh1r/how_do_highachieving_adhders_cope_with_the/,"I was diagnosed earlier this year with ADHD-C. I'm 23, female, and no one ever hinted at something like this when I was growing up. (Well, they did, but they didn't know what they were hinting at.)


My (half, different dad) brother was diagnosed ADHD in the 1980s and my mother is a dead ringer for ADHD-PI. Mom and brother are more...typical, I guess? Mom is dyslexic and possibly dysgraphic, brother has severe test anxiety, neither of them finished college. They both hated school, but are brilliant at creative endeavors.


By some freaky genetic flip of the coin, I got the ADHD and all its awesome/suck, but combined with my dad's book smarts. In everything.


So all my life, I've heard the usual complaints: ""Doesn't follow directions."" ""Is sometimes a distraction to the other children."" ""Has trouble knowing when to stop talking and focus on the work."" ""Isn't living up to her potential."" But only because I'd get an A- for a careless mistake, instead of an A. School was easy but boring, so I'd race through the work or test, get bored and whisper with a classmate, and end up with a 93 instead of a 98. I didn't have test anxiety so much as I had test anticipation. When they said ""potential"" they meant ""potential to cure cancer/be a rocket scientist."" And the expectations rose accordingly.


I went to kindergarten a year early, fought to move on to first grade (Teacher: She's emotionally immature. Mom: She's a year younger than everyone else, yeah, but she's also reading before every other kid in that room. Teacher: ...crap.). Had to be tested at the end of 4th grade (Teacher: There's something wrong with her. She makes careless mistakes on her math sheets. Mom: She's bored. You've been doing long division for weeks now. Teacher: I put extra challenging work on the board and she doesn't do it. Mom: ...so you've just been offering MORE boring, OPTIONAL work with no incentive?). Testing revealed math capabilities at the 8th grade level, and reading ability at college level.


High school: more of the same, except directed at me instead of my parents. Every Honors and AP class available. Straight 90s and 91s with a minimum of effort, anything higher was fine but certainly not worthy of actual effort. SAT? Pfft. Drove teachers insane with my lack of f***s given. (I even had a teacher give me a B in her course overall, insisting my bare-bones essays would never be accepted on the AP exam. Guess who got the only 5 that year?) Got accepted to a top-tier college and decided to study computer science. Ran straight into the wall of No Study Skills Whatsoever, developed a wicked anxiety problem, but made it through with successful internship experience and a 3.2 overall.


Now I have a fancy job and great performance reviews and the impostor syndrome has never been stronger.


When I finally suspected ADHD could be the reason I was Little Miss ""THINK WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU APPLIED YOURSELF!!!"" I got a LOT of pushback. No way YOU could have ADHD. You don't do X. You can do Y. You did Z. That's impossible with ADHD. Now that the dust has settled and I'm getting treatment, the high expectations still remain. I've explained, over and over, that since early school was easy, I got positive feedback that encouraged me to keep at it. College, or any other project that requires a million tasks to actually complete? That triggers anxiety, which requires therapy, and lots of medicinal wine. Or it triggers virtually nothing, and I get distracted. THAT'S WHY I HAVE THE MEDICATION.


""But you didn't need medication to do this before!"" But I didn't do anything LIKE this before! *launches self into the sun*


tl;dr ADHDers who are 'conventionally' 'successful', how do you deal with this post-diagnosis bullhockey of ""it was easy for you before, so why [do literally anything at all to improve your life because it looks PRETTY GOOD TO EVERYBODY ELSE and asking for any improvement is UNGRATEFUL]?""

Okay so here's the story: I started as a Computer Science major in the engineering college at my university. I am required to take up to Cal 2 and discrete math, but this field isn't driving me to use my skills and talents. I'm not bad at math at all, Calc 2 is just damned near impossible for me, everything else I can do. I am going to change to a more business discipline and had to do a project for Cal 2 about the crash in 2008, which interested me into maybe going into Quant Finance instead of Management Information Systems. 

A little more info: Doing Quant Finance would net me a double major in Math and Finance and probably a triple minor in French, Chinese, and Economics. Would my language skills be useful if I were to go into finance? I know there's tons of opportunities for internships in Shanghai for American students. My school focuses more on mathematics than CS for Quant Finance, but I can code in C and C++ (not my strength) and a bit of Java. And I'm better at math than the average student (though sometimes I feel like I'm not as smart as the ECE's and Aerospace Eng's in my classes, but oh well). 

I guess my question is: what are the job prospects for Quant Finance majors? What would be some good reading material or online courses I could do to familiarize myself with the subject? Any words against or for? Or just any words of advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

So this is my situation:

Had 2 rounds of interviewing with Arista Networks and the first interview went okay, and the second interview was probably the best interview that I've had so far. I got along really well with both interviewers, and I was able to confidently solve the problems that they gave me. I even got them to mention that I had the best knowledge of C++ among all the candidates they've interviewed so far. At this point, they said they were interested in making an offer and wanted some of my references. I've done really well at my past internships, had great relationships with my bosses, so I'm confident my references would put in a good word. 

Then today I received an email saying my references were fine, but that they made an ""uncommon last step"" and reviewed their data and decided I wasn't a good fit. I am extremely disappointed and surprised with the outcome. I suspect that they made this decision because they reviewed my transcript and didn't like my 2.9 GPA. But it seems unfair to me especially since I did really well in their interviews, resonated with their values, and showed great thought process/problem solving skills. 

I feel like inquiring more about their decision and even try to convince them otherwise, but I think it will be futile. This honestly feels like a gut punch. Should I still try to convince them otherwise? Has this happened to anyone else? What should I do?"

**How I messed up (some context)**

I was a good student in high school, and managed to get into one of the top 5 schools in Canada, a school that consistently places at least within the top 100 in the world each year. Going into university, I had plans of becoming a doctor, but by the end of first year I realized I didn't want to become a doctor, and wanted to pursue a degree in astrophysics instead (I wasn't too sure where that would take me, but I did want to pursue graduate studies and eventually become a researcher).

In my first year, my grades dropped significantly compared to high school, from being an A average to a C average. Despite that, I still wanted to pursue a degree in physics. Unfortunately, my grades weren't high enough to get into the honours astrophysics program for second year (at my school you start in general science, then specialize), but I was still able to get in a 3-year bachelors program in physical sciences instead, and shadow the honours physics program until my marks potentially improved enough for me to switch in. My marks never improved, and dropped even further, to where I'm sitting at around a C- to D+ grade (I've also failed a few courses along the way and have retaken them).

Basically, all of my hopes of pursuing graduate studies and becoming a researcher are gone, and I'm going to graduate with a 3-year bachelors degree in physical sciences. I have no idea what to do now.

**What I have to work with**

I was fairly active throughout university in terms of extracurricular activities, being president of a few clubs, tutoring at a physics help centre, teaching guitar, and a few other volunteering gigs. The most significant thing that I have to show was that I was a volunteer intern at a technology transfer office (doing prior art evaluations for potential patents) for almost a year, and I do have a good connection with the business development manager there, as well as a reference letter. In addition, I got into computer programming sometime around second year after taking a scientific computing course, and have worked on it a lot on the side, building physics simulations and some basic apps and programs.

**What I'm thinking right now/looking for**

As of now, the only option I see is trying to find a science-related entry level job. I don`t know how realistic this is, but I do want to further pursue computer programming, and eventually get a job doing that. Are there any other potential options that I may have with regards to education?

I will be graduating in a few months, and am not sure what to do next.

Thank you very much"

I was at the school as an ESL instructor, my first career, and since I was in the process of getting a BS CS at the time, I was able to take on the project. Aside from the networking guy that set up the school's wifi, I was the only tech person there, and my boss told me that my title would be ""Database Administrator."" The title does pretty much fit what I did: designed/normalized the database, implemented it, managed it, monitored/backup up the database, etc. I also developed the backend php and frontend html/css for the student management system and got the interface on the school's server, which is outside of the DBA scope.

So here's my problem: I'm in the process of finding internships or part time dev jobs while I finish the last year of my BS CS degree, and I'm worried that having a title like ""Database Administrator"" would make hiring people think I'm inflating my title, which could cost me offers. To compound the problem, I can't use my boss as a reference to back up my claim because the school is closing due to enrollment and management issues, and I was also a whistleblower about some labor and accreditation problems happening at the school. 

Here are the choices I'm considering for interviews/applications:

- keep the title as is

- adjust the title (php developer, database designer, junior database administrator, etc)

In either case, I'll be clear about what I did and what my duties were. I also have the repo and database backups, so I plan on redacting everything personally identifiable and making the repo public as part of my portfolio after I do a fair amount of refactoring and rewriting to make the code nicer.

Thoughts?"

4f07w4,5,2016-04-15,Desperately need some college advising for CS and don't have anybody to turn to,wantingmore123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4f07w4/desperately_need_some_college_advising_for_cs_and/,"I don't know what to do. I made so many mistakes in my college career path and I'm only a freshman. Basically I'm currently a freshman at FIU and I'm insecure the university will set me up with an internship/job during my studies. Any internships available seem to be with these small wishes-washy local Miami companies that nobody has ever heard of. This page basically consists of all career options available for CS students: http://www.cis.fiu.edu/careerpath/

This is one major reason I want to transfer out of FIU. I have other reasons for leaving this school too (hate Miami culture and traffic, don't like the excessive focus on Hispanic culture among campus, dislike the ""commuter"" vibe at FIU since everyone goes to class and goes home, lack of student life, etc etc)

But I messed up on all my classes since I originally majored in business. Now I have a crap load of excess credits for a computer science degree and I'll most probably hit the 132 credit surcharge that the state of Florida imposed on all students

These are the classes I've been taking this past fall and spring



Fall 2015:

MAC 1105 (College Algebra)-not required for computer science WASTE OF A CLASS

SPC 2608 (Public Speaking)-satisfies humanities requirement

CGS 2100 (Intro to Excel)- not required for computer science WASTE OF A CLASS

SLS 1501 (First Year Experience)- satisfies university core curriculum

BSC 2023 and 2023L (Human Biology and lab)- satisfies university natural science group 2



Spring 2016:

CHM 2032 and 2032L (Chemistry and Society and lab)- satisfies university natural 
science group 1 but NOT the chemisty class required for CS majors! So I basically have to take chemistry again, this time CHM 2045 and 2045L

GEB 2011 (Intro to Business)- WASTE OF A CLASS, not required for computer science

ECO 2013 (Microeconomics)- satisfies university social science group 1

MAC 1140 (Precalculus)- WASTE OF A CLASS

So let's assume I decide to stay in FIU and finish my degree. According to their major track I am SIXTEEN credits behind schedule due to all the useless classes I've taken (GEB 2011, CHM 1032, CHM 1032L, MAC 1105, MAC 1140, CGS 2100). This is all assuming I stay at FIU which I mentioned before has several issues such as insecurity of job offers after graduation (I do not want to stay in south Florida for a job) and so on.

Now let's say I transfer to FSU/UF. This makes it even worse because I have no idea what credits FSU or UF would take from my FIU transcript. Their university core classes seem to be extremely different than that of FIU and I feel like more of my classes would just be a waste towards my degree. 

For reference here's both UF and FSU's CS tracks:

FSU: http://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/Maps/MapBScompsci.html

UF:https://www.cise.ufl.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CSETrackingSheetfeb2013.pdf

I'm really anxious right now. I don't know what they'll take. I don't have anyone to advise me on this. Obviously my FIU advisers can only advise me based upon finishing my degree at FIU. 

Please I'm begging you, give me some insight on this. Is it worth it to stay at FIU for the sheer simplicity of already being indoctrinated in their degree requirements? And if I do stay, will I have any luck in finding a job outside of south Florida? 

Or should I make the jump to UF/FSU where the career options are much more lucrative in terms of computer science?"

Why is this all important? Because an entire department mistook me and my department for the helpdesk due to poor undestanding of what the ""Development"" department actually does. 

I'm sitting at my desk, checking progress in the SVN trunk of one of my contractor's assignments, when my phone rings. 

&gt;Hello? This is KazuoKuroi. 

On the other line a woman frantically starts rambling about a problem with her login to the CRM.

&gt;Hi this is Ashley over in Billing, I can't login to the CRM and I'm really getting tired, your software sucks.

I facepalm and realize she's trying to reach the tech support department. 

&gt;Sorry Ashley, I'm not a tech support rep. I'm the manager of the Development team building the software to *replace the software you're having problems with*

She immediately gets angry, for seemingly no reason.

&gt;Yeah well the support department is not picking up! You have to help me, I've got a job to do! DO YOUR JOB YOU MORONS!

At this point I'm already annoyed, so I say,

&gt;Ashley, I don't have time to listen to you complain about a problem that's not my department's business. Call tech support, not development. 

I hang up. My phone rings again immediately. I look at the extension, its from Billing, so I unplug my phone. I look up the email of the manager of Billing, Allen. 

I go ahead and set up an email to him:

&gt;Hello Allen,
&gt;Today one of you reps called my phone, Ashley, proceeded to demand I help her with the CRM - when that's not my department or our responsibility. She should dial tech support, extension ####. I don't appreciate your staff calling me a moron when I politely tell them it isn't my duty to fix the problem.

I send, and no sooner do I hit send that one of my interns, Khalid comes in and says,

&gt;I've got a call on my desk phone from Billing, someone claiming to be looking for tech support from you for the CRM. What should I do?

I respond,

&gt;Tell them to call support, if they continue to call unplug the phone. I'm getting ahold of Billing right now. If others get called, unplug your phones until I tell you otherwise. 

I go ahead and plug my phone back in and dial Allen's extension. 

&gt;This is Allen.

&gt;Hi Allen, this is KazuoKuroi, Development manager. I need you to get your employees to stop calling us for problems with the CRM - they need to call support. 

&gt;But tech support's not picking up! We've been without the CRM for an hour now. Can you guys please help us out?

&gt;No, we know nothing of *CRM SOFTWARE* I'm sorry, we're not able to help. Tell them to stop calling immediately, your employees have no right to call us morons when we're rightly confused about why you're calling us in the first place!

&gt;Alright alright I'm sorry, we're just desperate to get back online.

I later found out in the employee lounge that the tech support department was having phone problems but were aware of the issue so they had no choice but to ignore their phones and focus on their work. "

I've done internships as devops engineer as well as software engineer (web dev), and enjoyed both. 

I enjoyed system admin work more, because there's so much to learn under the hood of Unix systems. And I enjoy the feeling of being the master of my own domain, unrestrained by the project specifications - I just have to make it work and scale well. However, SDEs are seemed to be more respected in the industry, and generally they are the 'revenue-drivers'. So there's some sort of dilemma here.

I unfortunately have a criminal record. Stupid decisions when I was younger. This has never effected my previous employment. I have a misdemeanor driving while ability impaired (like a minor DUI, .05 vs .08 BAC) and a petty theft misdemeanor. Both about 5 years ago.

I have always operated on the don't ask don't tell principle. meaning I dont talk about my criminal history until asked on the application or otherwise. For this position it never came up, and they gave me a verbal offer, passed me the initial paperwork, saying welcome to the team, contingient  on their BG check.

My concern is that they will rescind their offer after the background check. The BGC is due to be initiated in around two weeks. Can I request that the company HR rep accelerate the BGC and paperwork to secure the position for the summer? My concern is that I will end up having no job over the summer if they rescind the offer.

I do not mind sitting in front of a computer all day if I am doing something CREATIVE and fast paced.

Also really very interested in all aspects of business in general and plan on getting an MBA and like big picture stuff in general. I studied abroad and am very interested in interacting with people in places all over the world.

5.	Work Life Balance – I do not mind working longer hours if it fulfills the other criteria. But obviously, the less hours and more benefits the better!
6.	Flexibility – I don't want to be stucking doing the same thing over and over again, I want something that is flexible with alot different responsibilities and tasks every day.

But, I am planning to stay an extra semester to get me more professional experience and a minor in either Econ or Info Systems.

 Should I get that offer, I will probably have to decide before knowing the details of my Google return offer (or perhaps even if I have one).

Should I intern as a sophomore in one of these programs? Or should I start seeking a ""real"" Software Engineering Intern position? 

Would interning at the same company twice look better on my resume than the diversity of working at both Google and Microsoft?

Georgia Tech

Pros:

-High engineering ranking

-More research opportunities?

-More internship opportunities(Fortune 500 companies at Atlanta)

-More prevalent startup culture?

-Close to airport of a major city(means easier international transportation)

-More selective

Cons:

-Grade deflation?(How is this at UIUC? Is there grade deflation at UIUC too and would this affect me negatively in graduate school applications)

-Little social life?(Although I don't want to be in a fraternity, I want to go out and relax from the stress of classes. Also can somebody who got the chance to see both universities compare the social life?)

-60/40 male-female ratio

-Urban area(Higher crime risk?Does anybody know the reality about this crime rate?)

-Not as good as it is in engineering in different areas

UIUC

Pros:

-High engineering ranking

-Balanced focus on different areas

-50/50 male female ratio

Cons:

-Slightly lower in engineering than Georgia Tech in rankings

-Less selective?(I couldn't find acceptance rates for engineering at UIUC but I know it is 55% in general. However this is not a big con for me)

-Harder transportation

-Huge party/drinking scene(I am not into partying everyday although I would like to do it every now and then)

Also I absolutely don't like drinking. I heard due to stress, alcohol is a problem at Georgia Tech but since UIUC is a party school again drinking is prevalent. Can somebody illuminate me on these issues?

I want to get a graduate degree in highly prestigious universities(Stanford, MIT etc.) and become an academician in those universities(This is the most important thing for me right now. I am basically asking which school would help me more to fulfill this dream of mine.). Therefore, I am interested in undergraduate research. I am also interested in entrepreneurship and want to be in the university where startup culture is more prevalent. Thus, I would be grateful if somebody could help me to choose based on these points.

Georgia Tech

Pros:

-High engineering ranking

-More research opportunities?

-More internship opportunities(Fortune 500 companies at Atlanta)

-More prevalent startup culture?

-Close to airport of a major city(means easier international transportation)

-More selective

Cons:

-Grade deflation?(Is it that bad? Would this affect me negatively in graduate school admissions?)

-Little social life?(Although I don't want to be in a fraternity, I want to go out and relax from the stress of classes and want to have a social life without being in a fraternity. Is this possible at Georgia Tech?)

-60/40 male-female ratio(Freshman class is 50/50 but I heard ratio goes down as people drop out)

-Urban area(Higher crime risk?Does anybody know the reality about this crime rate?)

-Not as good as it is in engineering in different areas(humanities, etc)

UIUC

Pros:

-High engineering ranking

-Balanced focus on different areas

-50/50 male female ratio

-Great social life

-Less crime?

Now I finally have a decent job that will allow me, in a couple months, to buy a decent gaming pc: I'm planning to spend around 1500 euros at first, excluding the monitor (I still have a honest samsung 26""), and add a better monitor and a second video card a few months later.

TL;DR could you please help me out with the build? I need a power supply that will be able to handle a SLI even if I will start with only 1 video card since it's so expensive, and a good cooler (not sure whether to go for air or water, never had water before, but I would like to go for some mild overclocking), and a monitor: I'm thinking 1440p (no need for crazy latencies since I don't plan on competitive online gaming, but I am not sure if 144Hz is worth it), any comments regarding this (and the rest of the build) are appreciated.

-------------

THE 4TH-DIMENSION PSYCHEDELIC SUPER FROG

------


Have you seen the TED talk about the 4th dimension psychedelic super frog? The crazy old scientist that humiliated himself in front of the whole world? I know all about him, I've got his documents and recordings, and his video journal. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with them yet, but he’s not as bad as he looked on the TED talk, he had a pretty good reason to be paranoid. 


At seventy he was this disgraced scientist who knew he was overdue for dementia, the affliction having struck both his father and grandfather in their late fifties, so that his daily routine was filled with strange tests to his memory and critical faculties like counting and balancing and other processes in his every morning’s anticipation for whatever madness might be creeping at the edge of his vision. He turns on the camera, does the alphabet backwards like a sobriety test, counts his fingers, touches his nose with his eyes shut, lists colours and dates, then panics when he stumbles or gets something wrong.


So it was against the clock that he decided to salvage his reputation among the science community and rebuild his legacy and that of his demented lineage by pursuing his theories regarding a seemingly immortal species of frog that he thought could read his mind, or rather, a frog that died only after its predictable natural lifespan and not, it would seem, at the hands of the myriad natural predators of its surroundings despite the amphibian’s careless nature, nor by confused and frustrated trappers who left the island empty-handed (even as indigenous children were known to hold and play with the coveted frogs), so that although they were thick and meaty, brightly coloured, casually tempered, and totally without any natural defences to speak of, predators seemed to grudgingly obey some cosmic rule to leave them well alone even as they appeared so numerous and casual, languishing so closely, so trustingly, even resting near and even on the backs of panthers or the snouts of crocodiles.


Except the old man knew there was no rule. These carnivores simply learned not to waste their breath trying to lunge or claw or snap at the frogs because they were supernaturally impossible to harm, somehow predicting the very impulse and shambling away unhurried. This local legend had become an obsession for the old man and he resolved to spend his remaining life and life-savings on the study of these precious frogs that he might prove to the world what they were capable of and, perhaps, be the first clever enough to trap a specimen. 


He employs an intern named Tammy, who he discovered studying the habitat of the indigenous people around the island, admittedly unconvinced by the old man’s theories as she figures frogs are just real super difficult to catch—


No. They are not. Look at my machines, he insists. Even with my tools and creativity they evade me, yet look at them! Sitting there, sitting everywhere, watching me! I can step among them so very closely but if I dare stomp one there simply isn’t one close enough to stomp! These are not natural creatures. And, he only now realizes, it’s not that they can read his mind and understand his intentions, but that they predict his physical actions and the consequences of his super complicated traps, the hidden snares that even he sets off in error.  Traps designed so cleverly that no human could spot them, so that Tammy naively avoids his marked-off sections of swampland altogether, as if the old man restrains himself to trapping only marked-off sections, as if he would be so foolish.


Then, after finally setting the area around a pond on fire only to find the frogs who live there just happened to have abandoned it already, the old man faces his reflection in the water and the terrible fear that he may have lost his mind already. Except, just like that, an explanation occurs to him… that these frogs somehow exist outside of time, that they transcend the fourth dimension. With mad enthusiasm he hurries to Tammy’s tent, unzipping it without warning or permission. She scrambles away, hiding something beneath her coat.


On a piece of paper he shows her a crude maze scribbled in pencil around a little figure marked TAMMY in the centre, and urges her to solve the puzzle, handing her the pencil to do it. But, she says, there’s no way out. The wall around the maze is unbroken.


Precisely! You see, picture this drawing as vector flat, limited to only two dimensions. Your likeness on the page can’t escape these halls, she’s stuck as you have observed but she doesn’t know that without exploring. She can’t see beyond the walls I’ve indicated. But we can, can’t we? We can move over them from above, from the third dimension, we can see the entire maze laid out around her. We can see the turns ahead and those she’s left behind! This is our advantage, and that’s how these frogs see us! 


He stops, he can see in her face that she’s not paying attention, that she’s hiding something from him. He yanks her away and to his horror a frog is simply sitting there. It hops once, twice, then out of the tent and away.


“I”m sorry,” she mutters.


“Your tent was closed when I came… wasn’t it?”


“Yes, I should have called you. It wasn’t that hard to catch, though. I’ll yell for you next time.”


“No you won’t.”


“I will.”


“Then there is no next time. Don’t you understand? The frog saw the way in and the way out all at once. Make no mistake, it doesn’t gamble with its life.”


“But I was able to close the tent and trap—”


“You closed nothing. What were you doing with it?”


“I… licked it,” she said. “It’s quite wonderful, the effect. Just as the tribe says. This strange calm, and clarity. I know it hasn’t solved my life’s problems but they do seem to diminish, like little obstacles to step around. It sort of puts things in perspec—”


“You’re rambling on and on,” he said, and left her tent.


And over the next few months he quickly loses his mind, not to dementia but out of sheer frustration. He resorts deliberately forgetting the traps he lays out, preparing them absently in case the frogs do access his mind that his mind won’t know how to avoid the traps it set. Until one day he finally runs short of funding and (looking upon his most costly and inconspicuous machine whose active trap area of lush swampland could be measured by the sharp line of contented frogs incomprehensibly avoiding it) decides to quit. 


So it was that on the day he began to pack his bags to leave, that one of the precious frogs sprung at him from a ledge, giving him such a shock that he fell backward springing a trap which sprung another trap which sprung yet a third trap but in the end to his astonishment he held the frog in his hand. Other frogs just watched as his hand trembled not to let it go, yet not to crush it, finding it terribly difficult to balance between the two imperatives.


Getting up he gingerly navigates between other possible traps, sweating profusely and abandoning his bags for the rented jeep. The old man catches the first flight back to the city with his precious colourful frog impossibly trapped inside a simple tupperware container. So impossible that he risks everything to peek in on the creature to be sure this is really happening. On the ground at great length he convinces the organizers of an annual science conference to allow him a lecture to prove to the world the existence of frogs from the fourth dimension and his lecture is approved and so titled on the condition that if he fails to prove his claim he will be prepared to follow up with a candid Q&amp;A about dementia, its symptoms, and how it may or may not have affected his recent work in the rainforest.


He thanks the woman on the phone and hangs up as a sudden pang of guilt is followed by the striking thought that perhaps the frog had meant to save his life. Staring fretfully into the glass of the frog’s aquatic prison, the roof of which now bound with tape and rope and braced by a cinderblock, the old man picks up the phone and calls Tammy. Then before he can start she explains how the frogs on the island are behaving in very peculiar ways, how even those among the indigenous people rumoured to be pure of heart and intentions were no longer able to cradle or lick the them. How the people seemed to specifically blame him and even her and the traps and junk left all over and—


The old man hangs up and finds the frog watching him, “what are they doing? are they trying lure me back to the island? Do they think I’m meant to go? You shouldn’t be so sure. I’m determined to stay here, to do the lecture, with you. Make no mistake, this is going to happen.”


And so, over the remaining weeks before the event, the old man becomes increasingly creative with his behaviour, deciding to become unpredictable even to himself, even hundreds of miles from the island, even safe in his own home, his own city — totally erratic and bizarre in every passing decision or micro decision, that if his future isn’t fixed, if the map they see is in any kind of flux, this was the least he could do to scramble their predictions, that he would do precisely what he wouldn’t ever do, but without a visible pattern of precisely things he wouldn’t do, even often asking himself, “what wouldn’t I do?” and “what would I do?” and “whatever lies between that I might do instead?”


He gets off one bus at random only to get on another bus at also random, he removes one of his mismatched slippers (since wearing them on the wrong feet seems not sufficiently unlike wearing them on the right feet, since they belong on feet either way). It makes no difference where he goes, he thinks, only that it takes up time to go there, time between now and the TED talk, time that he knows doesn’t affect them…


Who? somebody asks. Whatever are you doing down there?  They say, let go of me! Put that down! Get out! What is wrong with you? They ask, why are you here? Why have you come? Why are you calling me? 


Well, he tells them, I’m trying to confuse the 4th dimension frogs because I don’t want anything to get in the way of my Ted talk. It isn’t difficult, I just have to remain in the city. I’m not going back to the island, do you understand? Do you understand me?


But nobody’s there, so he calls Tammy again. Was there any sedative in the traps that might harm him? That an allergy might make poisonous? Could it not be that the frog saved my life? Is that what happened? Please, it could have been so simple, maybe just a fall. What did that frog see? Do I owe it my life? What did it prevent? I must know.


The day of the lecture he puts his debt to the frog out of mind and reaches the conference sharply paranoid of his own brain and whatever the frog might know that it doesn’t. On the stage he unveils the animal on a table where it regards him with, he supposes, what you might expect the wisdom of the fourth dimension to look like on the face of a frog, mixed, perhaps, with a bit of disappointment in him specifically. And he invites the audience to look upon the legendary psychedelic super frog that has never been caught or consumed before a naturally occurring death until now.


He invites a woman from the crowd and presents her with a terrible mallet, ordering her to strike down upon the harmless creature so she might obliterate it. She laughs, I couldn’t possibly! It’s such a sweet little thing!


Ah yes, but I assure you, Pam from Chicago, that this frog is not restrained to this world, not this universe, not even this dimension. It is not afraid of you, it’s met you before, it’s dodged your mallet strike already! This frogs movements and decisions aren’t made in a linear sequence, it exists tomorrow just as it does yesterday and it does it all right now! What I mean is, you’ve already swung the mallet and missed.


So as the confused woman raises the mallet above her head a series of thoughts occur to the old man. The first, that the frog saved his life knowing that he would betray it and expose it as supernatural. That a media frenzy would result in some agency destroying the island to examine the species, a species that lived so contentedly, so harmoniously, even controlling its own population density and now, thanks to the old man, none of its kind would be safe from scrutiny again. And how the frog must have known all this when it surrendered.


Thinking this, the old man still doesn’t intervene. He lets the woman swing to save his career and his reputation before dementia can claim his mind, certain that otherwise all his journals and surveillance recordings to date would resemble the Sasquatch footage of a madman or, at best, a composite digitally compromised to make frog behaviour look unusual, frogs that appear in the coloured pixels only as deft at escaping predators at the very last minute as a pigeon, perhaps when you try to hit one with your bicycle.
 

However, the woman with the mallet deliberately strikes off the mark on the table by several inches, unable to commit to bludgeon such an innocent little frog and the old man watches in mounting horror as the frog compensates with the smallest jump into the mallet’s trajectory, a super-calculated little hop to be perfectly blasted into a smear of beautiful rainbow-coloured frog innards. The woman gasps and drops the mallet and shakes glowing entrails off her skirt that shot out of the amphibian’s ruptured body. 


The old man staggers and drops. He looks into the bewildered audience in a whirling daze, “I’m not insane, it chose this, it just killed itself. I’m not insane!” 


Stifled, confused laughter in the crowd before a second speaker appears to introduce an unexpected question period and set up a queue. 


On the stage the woman whispers, “what have I done? I killed a frog.” 


A young man from the audience leans into the microphone, “uh hi, I’m just wondering why you thought the frog couldn’t be hurt, or uh… why the frog would want to hurt itself? Could you explain more?”


Behind the old man’s glasses his big eyes plead against the faceless crowd, “to make me look foolish. To discredit my work. You see?”


And so the old man’s reputation as a thinking, capable man of science officially ends, and rumours of a frog that cannot be caught or killed are debunked by a popular TED talk depicting a captive frog’s exploding death and the subsequent comedic remixes on internet forums juxtaposing the old man’s boldest claims with too-close photography of the supposed all-knowing frog’s vibrant guts disclosed onto a frightened woman’s skirt - gaining sufficient internet exposure that supernatural claims are widely disregarded. 


With his shoes on properly the old man returns to the island of the frogs to find them gathered as if to greet him, their skin luminescent in evening twilight. And he kneels, frowning, and says he’s sorry, that the frog had to die to save the island, he’s sorry.


He sits and they hop around him. Hop into his lap. He picks one up, knowing how it knows he wouldn’t hurt it. But not knowing it himself, grimacing as his hand squeezes gently, teasing the idea that he might. Couldn’t he? Just now? Couldn’t he crush it in his hand? Is it so against his nature to do so? Is the future the frog can see so totally certain that he wouldn’t close his fist on its little body even to just to prove it isn’t? That he can’t be predicted? That he can do as he wants and squeeze its dumb, careless eyes out of its little head? To teach it to fear? That there are things to fear. Does it not concern the frog how closely he is to doing it? Why not? Because he won’t? He can’t? Why can’t he?


But as the frog has predicted, the old man lets it go… and weeps.


Then something strange happens. A sensation of something creeping closer, something looking in on him from above. Not above, but outside. It grips him with fright, whatever it is. Dementia? Is it happening? Has he lost his mind? Is this what that feels like? 


But no, it’s a wolf. Ripping through the shadows to snatch two frogs whole in its jaws and crush their glowing guts between its teeth. Another frog caught beneath its paw just as easily as that. The old man yelps. His heart broken. Terrified, not of the wolf, but that the all-seeing frogs didn’t see it coming. How they’d been so easy to catch, like ordinary frogs. No, worse.


Until he sees its eyes… smoking pitted eyes that smoulder with what could only be the wisdom of a fifth dimension timber wolf. A wolf that dips into the fourth dimension to satisfy its taste for the thin illuminating skin of rainbow-gutted frogs. This immortal being, grey and spectral in the dark, could only be visible to human eyes in the third dimension while reaching into the fourth snatch up unwitting frogs that now scramble and leap and flee frantically from the forest clearing. Terrified and clumsy in a way the old man has never known them to behave, no matter how loudly he stomped in their direction, no matter how he screamed and stomped and meant to scare them.


The old man sits alone as the wolf pulls and snaps at strips of the frog beneath its paw and then, satisfied, folds backward, seemingly out of existence - to wherever fifth dimension timberwolves go.


Or so the old man explains in his last recording, including in his documents some looping nighttime footage of him drunkenly pushing over scaffolding in frustration. I enhanced the footage with my computer, and sure enough, flipping between frames, you can see how the frogs in range of the tipped scaffold stir and shuffle at their leisure before he even enters the clearing to tip it. Those the scaffolding would have crushed rest just out of harm's way, and though it lands inches from them all around, they don't even flinch.

*****

&amp;nbsp;


Red streaks of electricity covered the woman's hands, shifting, twisting and circling each other as they slithered over her brown skin. They flowed down her arms and caused sparks to jump off her fingers, leaving a faint smell of ozone behind.

The woman was older than me, but still in her late twenties. Her green dress had dark patches where the electricity had burnt the cloth, but she had learnt to control it quite fast, all things considered, and the streaks now danced harmless over the dress.

She was laughing. It was a merry, carefree laugh, the kind that reminded me of Christmas mornings, of being a kid and staring at a mountain of wrapped presents, full of possibilities.

And why not laugh? She had just won the Talents Lottery. Big time.

I glanced around, at our little group of humans. Most of them were looking at the woman with frustrated, jealous expressions. As I watched, a couple turned and left the group, walking back the way we had come. Back to the portal. Back to Earth.

I felt a pang of sympathy for them. A trip off-world was expensive, even now, and some of these people would have been saving for years for this. Just to get here, to the Arrivals terminal on Sanctuary Nova. Just to play this Lottery once, for that elusive one in five chance of becoming something else, something greater. Of gaining a brand new life.

Our group was in a corner of the Arrivals terminal, cordoned off from the rest of the traffic by a rope barrier. It would be completely ineffective against any talented human, of course, but it did seem to give a false sense of security to the alien crowd that walked by the other side, glancing at us and the powered woman with curiosity.

I had never seen so many different species mixed together: Sulcis, Vhriss, Zortans, Altajans... green scales mixed with silvery skins, heads covered in fur, large decorative red feathers... I could have spent hours just watching the crowd walk past, staring at the creatures in it. And by the stares I got, the sentiment seemed reciprocal. Most of them would have never seen a human in the flesh, let alone *six* of them, with a flashy display of electricity thrown in for good measure.

I repositioned the backpack over my right shoulder, feeling the weight move inside it. I couldn't stop and stare. Not here. This was a transit area. You were supposed to either walk back to the portal -like the couple who had just left-, or walk forward up to the customs kiosks. I exhaled sharply, gathering my courage. With my right hand, I reached for my trolley case, and started walking forward.

I was only half way to the nearest kiosk when a door to my right opened. Another human stepped out of it, this one covered head to toe in a blue and black armor suit that only left the lower part of his shaved face visible. He was a Paragon, of course. I didn't even need to look at the patch on his shoulder to know that.

He walked by my side, giving me a quick once over, and ignoring me in favor of the electrical woman. I didn't recognize the hero, which wasn't that surprising, given that I was entering the most populous city in civilized space. Even if humans didn't even rank as a minority in Sanctuary Nova, there were still far more talented heroes and villains in this city than anyone could ever dream of memorizing.

In any case, I had learnt at least who the top guns were. And this wasn't one of them. I watched him walk up to the woman and put a hand on her shoulder. Gentle, amiable. He pointed towards a door at the end of the terminal, and they both started walking in that direction.

I knew what would come next. They would sit in a bare room, just two chairs and a table. He would offer her a drink, then a job. A lifetime position in the Paragon Guild. She would accept, of course, that was why she had played the Lottery in the first place. She would join the training program, then choose a destination among any of the alien worlds. Or perhaps she would stay here in this very city. She would fight villains, save people from disasters... become a hero.

She could always refuse, of course. But that meant walking back through the portal, back to old boring Earth, where she wouldn't have access to her newfound power, her talent. Under the Human Quarantine Act, no talented humans were allowed to leave Earth without a permission from the Paragon Guild. Doing so, trying to infiltrate an alien world if you were a talented human... well, that's the kind of thing that puts you squarely into the ""villain"" category.

It wasn't lost on me that this was precisely was I was trying to do.

I reached the kiosk, where the male customs officer looked surprised to see me. He was an artajan, with a broad humanoid shape and a gray, almost silvery smooth skin. His white uniform was ruffled and had dry yellow stains. I wondered for a second whether being assigned to the human area was some kind of punishment for his unkemptness, or if it was the other way around, and being around humans was the reason for his lack of care.

He pronounced a word, guttural. My smartband picked it up and translated it on the fly, replacing the sound in my ears with a far more understandable one.

""Name?""

""Maika Hadden,"" I replied.

He paused for a moment, looking at his screen. My heart was beating fast, but I tried to keep a neutral face. I didn't know how much he could read of human expression, but some tells were universal. Fidgeting hands, eyes darting around... He wasn't shouting, at least, and no one was running to arrest me, which meant my fake records *had* been successfully planted into the database, after all. A good start.

He looked at me, eyes narrowing. ""Any talents?""

""No,"" I lied.

He nodded, going back to the screen. ""Purpose of travel?""

""Work. I have an internship at Azcatech for the next six months.""

He frowned, or did what passed for a frown in his species, the eyes moving slightly downwards. I knew he was suspicious. It wasn't common for a company to hire ""just"" a normal, untalented human. But it wasn't unheard of, either.

""Did they give you an ID card?""

""Sure,"" I put a fake smile on my face. ""Want to see it?""

""Yes.""

The moment of truth.

I reached with my right hand into my jacket's pocket, and grabbed the piece of cardboard. It was just a blank, white piece of cardboard, with nothing written on it. But as the tip of my fingers touched its surface, I activated my talent.

I pictured the ID card. Its dimensions, its surface, its weight. The background a faint blue. Thin black lines framed by the trimmed corners. The stylized gears from the Azcatech logo. My name in print letters, both in Mutual and English. My position in the company: ""Intern / A33"". My ID code: ""RTI-2-47816"". I visualized the picture of my face on the upper left corner. A 19 years old human girl, smiling at the camera. Fair complexion, straight eyebrows, brown eyes. Dark short hair. No, better to have long hair. Yes, throw in a big difference, something to hide the small mistakes, how my eyes weren't as close together in real life, how the proportions were slightly off.

I composed the picture in my mind, and then willed it into the cardboard. I *nudged* the object, forcing it to become what I had pictured. I felt it shift in my hand as it grew wider and shorter, felt its surface become smoother. By the time I removed the piece from my pocket and placed it on the kiosk's counter, it *was* an ID card. A complete reproduction. An almost perfect forgery. An illusion, yes. But one so detailed, so complete, that the universe itself would take it for real.

That was how my sister had called it once. *Lying to the universe.* Make the lie detailed enough, compelling enough, and the universe itself would buy it.

For a time, that is. It wouldn't last, not if I wasn't touching it, keeping the lie alive. It would dispel in just a few moments. But it should be enough.

The artajan officer took the card -the forgery- and examined it, his eyes switching from the plastic piece to my face, then back to the piece. He then focused on his screen for several endless seconds, while his hands touched the input board, tapping icons I couldn't see. At last, he placed the forgery on the counter and slid it back to me.

I grabbed the ID card, making sure my movement wasn't rushed. As if I had all the time in the world. As if it wouldn't turn back into a blank piece of cardboard any second now. Slowly, I put it back in my pocket, and let the illusion vanish once it was out of sight.

The officer looked back at me.

""Are you aware of the terms and conditions of the Human Quarantine Act of 2027?""

""Yes, I am.""

""In the event of developing an extra-natural talent,"" he said, reading off the screen, ""you will immediately contact the relevant authorities, or the closest representative of the Human Paragon Guild, and put yourself in their custody until you can be safely transferred to your world of origin. You will not engage in unsupervised use of any extra-natural talents, at any time or place, under penalty of imprisonment. Is that clear?""

""Yes, it is.""

He nodded, and pointed the way forward. ""Welcome to Sanctuary Nova.""

I grabbed the handle of my trolley case again and walked past the kiosk. My motions were jerky, and my body felt ready to bolt, to jump, to run. Full of adrenaline. This had been too easy. I felt it had to be a ruse. My heart was beating faster now than during the brief interrogation.

As I walked pasted the corner, I almost expected to run straight into two or three Paragon heroes, waiting in ambush to arrest me.

But there was no one. I kept walking, and felt my heart calm again. I smiled. A natural, true smile this time. I got a few curious glances as I joined the crowd of aliens who waited to exit the building. The busy traffic of a Gateway Network Terminal building in a large city. My translator tried to keep pace with the myriad conversations and alien words that surrounded me, but it gave up fast, letting me hear the chirps, whistles, clicks and gurgles in their original forms.

I walked through the tall entrance of the building and out into the city itself. Ground vehicles were parked in front of the terminal, people getting in and out of them. A large skyshuttle waited nearby, its four engines rumbling, ready to engage and jump into the air. I gazed at the buildings across the wide avenue in front of the terminal. Tall buildings whose walls mixed sleek glass and steel panes and more traditional materials such as concrete and bricks. A strange blend. My eyes moved upwards, following the narrowing shape of the buildings.

And then I froze.

I had read about it, of course. ""Sanctuary Shock"". The irrational, almost religious burst of panic some newcomers experienced when arriving to the city. I had thought myself immune. I had lived in London and Shanghai, after all. I was no provincial girl. How different could this be?

I couldn't have been more wrong.

Saying Sanctuary Nova was just a city was like saying a planet was just a ball of dirt. Completely true, and yet utterly wrong. No, Sanctuary wasn't just a city. It was a tridimensional urban sprawl wrapped unto itself. A megalopolis of impossible angles. An aberration. Rows upon rows of buildings and skyscrapers filled my view, forming canyons of concrete, steel and glass, through which dozens of drones and skyshuttles zipped by at worrying speeds... Noisy, harsh, alien, bustling, moving, breathing...

Far in the distance, the ground curved upwards, the city itself rising and becoming vertical, then wrapping all the way up over my head. I was inside an immense cylinder, of monstrous proportions, set to rotate around its long axis to create a semblance of gravity. And the city filled every square inch of its inner surface.

I made the mistake of looking straight up, and a sense of vertigo invaded me. Where the sky should have been I could only see a square grid of distant city blocks, as if I was a bird flying over New York City, and had just looked down. I felt a distinct fear, one that I remembered from when I was a kid, laying on the ground and looking at the blue sky. The thought that I was just *clinging* to the ground and that, should I let go, I would plummet upwards and crash into that distant city.

I wrapped my arms around my body and closed my eyes. All I wanted was to grab the ground, crawl, make sure I wouldn't fall. Instead, I took a deep breath, and opened my eyes again, making sure not to look up.

People were gazing at me as they walked past. I couldn't blame them, I must have looked like the stereotypical tourist from a farming world. Wide eyes and open mouth, about to have a bad case of Sanctuary Shock.

Except they weren't looking at me with pity, amusement, or even annoyance. No, their gazes were furtive and cautious. And they were giving me a wide berth.

They were scared of me.

Them. The ones whose species had engineered this very place. Who had built the Gateway Network, linking hundreds of worlds. The ones who had conquered nature, space and relativity. Them. They were afraid of the short human girl.

I couldn't help it. It was so absurd I had to laugh.

My outburst gained me more stares and a wider berth. Now I wasn't just a dangerous human girl, I was a potentially deranged one too. I laughed harder.

Then, a second revelation hit me. They weren't really scared of *me*. No. It was the potential, the talents. They were scared of what I could potentially do. Of what humans could do. And with that, I remembered something I had read once, sometime ago. Something that sobered me up.

The leading cause of death among talented humans was... other talented humans.

I took a deep breath, clearing my head, focusing on the moment, the here and now. What my next steps were. I started walking again, carrying my trolley case and my backpack, and putting the hood of my jacket up. It wasn't a perfect concealment, sure, but my hair was the telltale sign that I was a human. At least this way I wouldn't stand out that much in the crowd.

I kept walking, getting deeper into the city.

All I can think of at this point is either trying to become independent here in my current city as a web developer or moving to another city and working professionally.

I'm doing it strictly for experience, but I'm beginning to feel like I don't want to wait it out. The way I see it, I can either:

1. Keep working here for 6 months to a year and leverage the experience later on when I try to get a better job in the city I want to move to. In the meantime, while continuing to work here I want to try to do freelance web development, make connections, build a strong resume, and see if it really is possible to be my own boss. However, I can't see myself doing this for a whole year, and I'm afraid if I leave before a year is up it'll be a huge red flag to potential employers.

2. Cut my losses with this company (I still haven't even graduated), never mention this job on my resume and only mention the internship, and keep applying to the city I want to move to. After getting an offer I'll quit my job and move over there. I feel like I can get a better job.

I'm young and I don't want to settle with something so dull when I feel like I have the opportunity to leave this current experience behind and do something a little more exciting. I'm very passionate about coding and tech and I feel like this job is for people who just want to settle with monotony. I want to be surrounded with people who feel like I do.

I should mention that the screening focuses on Java and C++ and I've coded in both but am really familiar in neither of them (but then again, it's an internship). That being said, I'm open and actually excited to learn new stuff.


Now one of the tasks involved finding a way to do a foreign function call from Java to C++. The FFI reference wasn't contained in the problem statement, but I know enough to figure I had to google ""Java C++ FFI"" and get an answer, and honestly I do that a lot and see nothing bad in it (being good, IMO, is knowing *what* to google and how to filter / assimilate that information).


My dillema is that I think it wasn't really OK to just google a way to solve the task, but then again, I'd be doing myself a disservice if I wouldn't point out that I'm good at googling stuff and finding information and generally carrying my own weight even though I'm a junior, which I consider an important skill to have.


So, should I just say that I had to google it but provide the answer (what I think is the right thing to do; just stating reality), not saying I googled it (since it's an online screening anyway; but then again, I feel that that would break fairness), or passing on the question entirely (which I don't want to do, because I know *some* of the answer in a way)?


What about if I had to google more than one thing(again, starting from stuff I know, but I feel random googling would also count, as long as it solves the problem) ? "

I've also been teaching myself how to play the piano for the last 5 years. I can quite simply say that I'm a better pianist than a programmer and recorded many pieces that I'm proud of, and are quite popular on Youtube.

There are a few things I notice about my piano playing abilities. 

To compose a piece, I have a very ""standard"" formula - break the song into sections. Lay down the backbone scales, chords and arpeggios for each section. Fine tune each section, then ""stitch"" them together and record the piece. 

So whenever I want to play a piece, I just ""apply"" this formula, and it simply works every single time. Some sections are tricky, so they take longer, but I practice with patience without getting frustrated. Sometimes, I learn the sections in the order of middle first, then beginning, and finally ending (since Chopin's pieces usually end quietly and the ending's are somewhat simple).

Try as I might, I simple don't have a working ""formula"" for programming. When I'm tasked to write a program, I suffer from huge anxiety and sometimes depression. I don't know where to begin or end. I can't concentrate hard enough, so I browse the web and waste time. I get frustrated, and I have no confidence in my programming ability. This summer, I wanted to take some time off to learn how to program systematically in much the same way as how to compose piano music systematically, but peer pressure made me apply for internships instead. 

Can someone help me get out of this miserable state ? How do I make programming enjoyable and fun ? How do I systematically approach programming in much the same way that I approach music ? I tried looking at ""Design patterns"", but they're mainly for OOP programs, whereas I want a general approach, especially one that helps me quickly prototype research software irrespective of programming language (I work in AI, and this summer, I'll work at an AI research lab).

I hate the principle behind it (predatory pay day loans); hate the hours 9 am--7 pm Mon--Fri + 2 hrs daily bus commute; hate the fact that I have to log *all* my work times for supposed ""raise purposes"" yet have heard nothing of raises; hate that they lied about 6-month reviews for pay raises (there haven't been any yet and it's been 10 months); hate how much they overwork us; hate all the guilt-tripping (I have refused to be guilt-tripped); hate the shitty pay; I hate my lawful (read: shitty) benefits and holidays; I only like my non-asskissing coworkers.

I have money saved up, just enough to keep me going and until I begin an *extremely* competitive STEM PhD program at a top school in the UK. I already even have an internship (during my PhD) and job offer at a world-reknowned company whose products are found in universities world-wide, but due to visa requirements I need an advanced degree because I'm self-taught in that area. However, funding is an open question because my stupid government cannot make a damn website worth for shit, and I have yet to recieve a paper from my host university despite already having met all their academic requirements (physical copy of my diploma and transcript). They've been unresposive to emails so I'll call them via skype tomorrow to resolve the issue. And as far as government funding is concerned I'll visit their local offices and apply in person or ask them to help me apply right there on their own PCs so they can see how much their website sucks.

I was planning on leaving the company when I hit a year in less than two months but I'm so fucking incredibly fed up of this shit. At this point, even if funding falls through which is unlikely---but possible---seeing as how the program has only two spots, I could apply to US universities and get a better job meanwhile. I don't know what to do, it feels like I'm rotting here and I should have nothing to complain about, but damnit this sucks. Objectively I know I'm being a fool, and this is likely caused by the stress caused of my funding situation.

I need advice. "

 I love mechanics and physics of how things work in general. I always was fascinated by aircraft as a kid, and the physics of flight and motion. But math is kicking my tail. I don't naturally get along with it. Its a combo of just not ""getting it"" and being lazy in my studies when it comes to algebra due to the lack of motivation and difficulty.

how do I know that this is right for me? My schools engineering counselor says I should give up engineering if i'm not a natural at algebra! fuck that guy?? or is this true?

and how have you guys chosen your paths? I always say I want to be an aerospace Engineer and specialize in propulsion!, but I am put off by the math involved in a engineering degree. 

Something I am however a natural at, is computers. I'm working on getting my comp TIA A+ and Security+ so I can earn good money while finishing school. I get the feeling that I should shift my focus into computer engineering instead. but I have no idea what that involves and if I would even like it. 

you all know the ""do what you love and you will never work a day"" saying. I feel like aviation is my calling, and computers are a backup, but I have no internship or work experience with either, so I don't know what is the better fit for me, or where I can find resources to differentiate the different engineering fields.

Can any of you A.E.'s, C.E.'s or M.E.'s pitch in?
were any of you math-tards, that turned out ok?
where can i find an in depth overview or video of the different disciplines?"

Interned senior year of college at big company as a digital marketing/product content intern, got exposed to the corporate world. I did not learn as much as I have at my current start up job. After college, I had a tough time looking for a position (as most of them want experience of 2+ years plus). So, I just decided to take a leap of faith and just work at this small marketing company specializing in taking over clients Amazon presence. 

I am wondering will this help with future career paths? I'm worried that this position can limit my opportunities because I surely want to get a higher salary and benefits. What I do on a daily basis is:
 
*Work with shipping inventory from clients warehouse to Amazon

*Create attractive listings, constantly update clients listings

*Communicate with clients and Amazon customers by phone and in person meetings (for clients)

*Email marketing targeted towards Amazon customers (post purchases) to get reviews

*Keyword and Promotional Campaigns

*Consistently work on search terms on Amazon listings

*Weekly conference calls with clients

*Salesforce usage on a daily basis

*Export data and create useful pivot tables to provide to clients of sales, conversion rates, etc.. 


The company is rapidly growing, gaining lot of attention from large firms. I learn a ton, ton more than if I took a corporate job and being limited to the exposure of the business as a whole. Communicating with clients is not something I'd expect right out of college, but its great experience and I am getting more comfortable talking with older businessmen. Also, I get so many responsibilities and multi-tasking and jumping from one to-do to the next definitely is good as well. Im just wondering if I am on the right path in terms of the digital marketing landscape/industry.

4ffysh,2,2016-04-19,"Advice on getting consistent effects from medication, adding medications for anxiety/depression without messing with ADHD symptoms, and general advice too (post is kinda long)",crashbandicool,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4ffysh/advice_on_getting_consistent_effects_from/,"Hey guys. Long story short, I managed my way into one of the best engineering schools in the country by staying up every day in high school until 5am through some mixture of willpower and extreme anxiety. I thought those days would be over after graduating, but unfortunately not. I realized I had a problem after not being able to study for any classes, sleeping 15 hours a day, having no friends, and gaining 40 pounds. So I went to the doctor, etc... and decided to take time off to see what I could do so that I'd have a triumphant return. Spent these past few months trying out ADHD medications and seeing what worked and have been using Vyvanse (70mg split up throughout the day) and sometimes it works perfectly, other times average, and other times barely. As school and internship stuff approaches, my anxiety in general shoots through the roof and on top of that I need a consistently working medication. 

I've tried all the amphetamine drugs and my doctor usually is not too prescription happy, so I haven't really asked to try any of the methylphenidate drugs. I feel like the same cycle will occur anyway, that they'll work amazing at first, then just weaken in strength. I can focus fine with the medication, but mental clarity/removing brain fog is what I really need help with. The clarity I get on the first few weeks of Vyvanse or Dexedrine while studying is great and I feel helpless without the clarity of thought. I am already two years into the intense program and I won't be able to graduate if some days I can understand things and the next day my notes don't make sense and that occurs for a few days until the medication randomly starts working. 

I have a job coming up in a month in a different state so I won't have access to the doctor for like 3 months. And school begins again in August. I have no idea if I should even go to the internship. The testing periods for these medications are so long for me and I'd rather miss out on this internship than go back to school without a working medication. But the internship is something I worked hard for and it's a seemingly good opportunity. Right now I have no actual deadlines and my anxiety and depression have gotten much better, but it's getting worse as I know it's crunch time and I need to make tough decisions that will play a huge part in deciding my success as a student. 

I went to the doctor about getting an anti anxiety drug or anti depressant and he suggested SSRIs, but I have taken one before and know from others that they make you feel more sluggish and like a zombie. I can't have anything making me even more slow and foggy so I know the alternatives would be wellbutrin and intuniv. I asked my doctor about wellbutrin and he said it's mainly for depression and that it may worsen my anxiety so he dismissed that. I told him that my symptoms aren't so bad right now but that I know it'll get worse as school approaches and he didn't think that was reason enough to think about any additional medications. I didn't ask about intuniv since I don't know enough about it and that is my 'last shot' at getting something that can help my anxiety and not worsen my ADHD symptoms. 

This is all long winded and rambling, but my main questions are does anyone know what's up with the inconsistent medication and any advice on addressing this? Adding in something else for mental clarity would be perfect since the vyvanse works well for focus but there's literally nothing online that is convincing about sluggish cognitive tempo or anything of the sort (like the front page post about brain fog clearly depicts). I have no idea whether going to the internship is the right decision, because missing out on it would suck, but going back to school without a working medication would be even worse. I’d have 4 more months to try stuff out instead of just one month, if I don’t go to the internship. Going back to school is going to suck in general because I have no friends and no one to relate to. I somehow slipped into this amazing school where everyone else is really smart, went to private school, etc.. and literally none of the kids I talked to while at school noticed I left. I need to go back and try to make the best of it, but the medication is frustrating and I know I’m going to be anxious and depressed again if I don’t have all these mental health issues under wraps. If anyone has any advice on this stuff that’d be great to hear. The only option I can think of is it to get the intuniv which would help anxiety without messing with the ADHD symptoms too much, since I’d rather be anxious and focused, than calm and failing out of school. Sorry this is so long, but I have no one else to tell. Thanks again guys.


Tl;dr: Somehow got into a good school, realized my anxiety, ADHD, and depression were too big of an obstacle to overcome while also trying to tackle coursework, took a year off, tried multiple medications, none of which work consistently, but so far Vyvanse has been the best. Vyvanse helps me focus pretty consistently, but is on and off for mental clarity. I really to have a clear mind while at school and especially with my anxiety and depression which is worsening as school approaches, I need to have this all figured out by August. I am thinking of adding intuniv to the vyvanse to help with mental clarity and anxiety, but my doctor isn’t really all for adding medications for symptoms that aren’t super intense yet. I also have an internship coming up (far far from home) but have no idea if I should go or stay home and figure out the medication stuff. Everything seems to be a struggle for me and I am almost at wit’s end. Pls advise.

I think I am doing everything right, however I have doubts with my degree. 

* I want to work at a larger tech company, how can I get my foot in the door without a degree in computer science? 

* What level position should I look for and how do I move up? I have never worked at a tech company, however I started one. Does this make me look overqualified on a resume?

* Where should I look into internships? Both physically and online, my city has a high concentration of .NET developers (Yuck) and I am beginning to think relocation is required to work on the forefront.

tldr; I don't have any work experience, I start masters in finance in Sept from a top ten business school in EU. I need a course of action because getting a job in EU or the US but it seems virtually impossible.

Here's my story-

I graduated from one of the top business schools in India in 2014 with specialization in finance. I didn't take up employment after college because I wanted to travel. And since then I've been on a ""break"" travelling around the country. 

I took up a small three month course on IB Ops (given the large sector of IB Ops in India) in early 2015 but that didn't interest me. I want to be in the front office. I didn't do any internship during my college because I was a dumb kid and ""internships are worth nothing"". 

I decided to further my education and registered myself to Masters in Finance course from one of the top business schools in EU (Spain specifically). I'll have to look for employment during my course as Spain does not allow visa extension for job search.  I don't have my hopes high, though, because getting a job in EU is very difficult given the language, visa and unemployment issues. North America is also out of reach because why would an American company hire an Indian guy from an EU university. I can't stay in India because I want to travel the world and see as much as I can.

I can't see myself doing anything but finance. I learned quite a lot about finance in my college and I'm good at it. And sincerely, it is the only field I have interest in.


On top of that my parents are very happy that I'm going to EU to study. I've told them part reality. But I on a personal level feel pretty fucked up inside about the decisions I have made.

I feel like I have made all the wrong decisions, and I won't reach anywhere I want. I feel like even after spending all that money and time in such a good college, I'll be exactly where I am now, that is nowhere. 

I want advice on how I can make this work. All feedback is appreciated.

Thanks.

I was planning to permanently move here this summer after I graduated, and start my career, but... well... turns out I'm not going to graduate. 

This semester has been a little bit of a shitshow for me and I've been missing assignments left and right. Somehow I've managed to make it through doing ok in all of my classes except one. I reached out to my teacher about this and she gave me until today to make up my missing work. As you can probably guess, I did not make this deadline. My grade in this class would be so low that it's not even worth it for me to do the final project, so I am just giving up on that and turning my attention to my other finals (due at the end of this week!)

But failing this class means I won't be able to graduate in May. And now I'm faced with two choices: 
A). Finish the rest of my classes, enroll in a summer program at my school and finish over the summer (I still might get to walk at graduation in May) Then move to LA in the late summer. 
B). Say ""fuck it"" and just give up on school, and carry on with my plan to move out here, and start the rest of my life. 

Now I realize option A seems the most prudent, but let me make my case for B:
I hate school. I've hated school since I was in the second grade. In high school I really started to burn out, so when I graduated I took a year off (this was also so that I could save money for college). 
My first year in college was really successful, I made a lot of friends, I more or less liked my classes, and I got good grades. Sophomore year started out amazing (first semester was one of the best of my life), but things changed and by second semester I was depressed. From there it's all been downhill. Even though I liked a lot of my classes, I struggled to bring in homework assignments on time (even creative ones) and generally my academic performance plummeted. That being said I managed to make through junior year with pretty good grades (I even made dean's list, don't ask me how), and so I decided I was going to stick it out till senior year. Senior year was even more of a mess. while my mental health was generally better than last year, and I was happier and doing more interesting stuff, I was struggling even more with my coursework. I only completed two of my four classed last semester. One class I dropped, and the other I still have unfinished work I need to get in before the end of the semester. I've ended every semester since sophomore year feeling like I barely escaped with my life (and to be honest with certain semesters, I think I did) and It's just getting to a point where I'm so exhausted that I just don't care anymore. I'm so used to showing up to class not having finished last week's assignment that it doesn't even faze me anymore. I've had so many earnest ""I'm just having a really bad semester"" conversations with teachers, that I feel like I'm speaking from a telepromter when I meet with them. And now I've finally *officially* failed my first class. 

And I don't know where to go from here. I don't even feel that upset, I just kind of feel relieved. That's a whole bunch of work I don't have to worry about right? 

So this brings me back to my choice: to take summer classes, or to drop out? 

I honestly feel like I've gotten everything I need from this school. I've learned lots of stuff, I've made friends and networked, I've gotten internships and used the school's (and my own) resources to make a decent short film. And I just don't know what more I can gain from getting my diploma? I feel like it's not worth the extra time (not to mention the extra thousands of dollars I don't have). The film industry is way less focused on your education credentials than it is on who you know and what you've done, and I feel that I have all I'm going to get in those two categories. 

Any advice is really appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I'm a law student. I'm just finishing up my first year. I have an entire summer ahead of reading and writing hundreds of pages of crap. Another two years of this, and finally, I'll be free to work more doing something I hate. My family wants me to do this and strongly discourages me dropping out. I've sunken so much money into it...what else can I do?

I've been watching TV and doing shit-all instead of studying, and I am extremely behind my classmates.

When I drive, I see people on their bikes and walking. I see people working in coffee shops and construction sites and hospitals. I wonder what their lives are like, if they're happy. If they get up in the morning and they're happy. If they see their friends, if they have parties and cookouts, if they have spouses and babies and many people who love them very much. Some of them must. I can't understand it. I want so much to be them, but I don't think I can.

Other people manage to live without law degrees, with just college degrees. Of course, my English degree is useless. I have a dream where I just get up, pack my things, and move. I have an apartment. Maybe it's near water. I have big windows and I have tomato plants and a cat and a bunch of friends who love me and want to spend time with me. Maybe we make meals together. I go to work, maybe something small but that wouldn't matter, I don't go to school. But I don't have that. I don't think I can ever have that. My life is big and complicated. I alienate everyone I meet and I will never have friends. 

I just want to escape. Every day is just one more day of this, every year is just one more year of this. I have a plan to kill myself on May 21st, when my finals are over, though I'm thinking of pushing it forward. Why even try to finish my finals? Why try to avoid Mother's day, birthdays, holidays? I'm tired. I'm so tired and I want to rest. I think, with my disorder, death is really the only way to do that. "

I've been applying left and right for internships for summer 2016 but I only got 1 interview and that didn't go so well. It's so disheartening especially after having worked at an amazing tech company in SF last summer. 

Another thing that I hate to admit is that I almost don't even want to apply to smaller companies after getting a taste of the amazing pay from last summer and the perks of free food, awesome intern events, etc.

Has anyone been in the same boat, and can't get an internship/job even with experience? ): Also any advice would be appreciated."
4fizld,13,2016-04-19,"Landed a great IT Intern position with little experience. Time to go for certs, even while attending college?",CWA_IT,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4fizld/landed_a_great_it_intern_position_with_little/," I am currently a sophomore in college (20 y/o) majoring in Computer Information Systems.I have not taken any major classes yet, but this upcoming semester I will be (think about also specializing in Programming classes). I am fairly new to the IT field and am very interested and eager to learn more, but do not have anything specific I want to go in to yet. I've done some very basic Beta Testing and Desktop Hardware Support.

 
 I recently landed an awesome IT Intern opportunity at a nice office because their other intern left to pursue other interests. I am basically the ""main IT guy"" here at the office now and it's a bit overwhelming but I am using this experience to learn a lot and grow in the field. They told me they wanted to hire someone to learn and grow with the company rather than hiring a more experienced person. The company is also serviced by a good IT company that overlooks all our servers/switches and what not, so all the pressure is not on me all the time and I can always ask them questions over the phone and they can remote in and show me. This opportunity is an excellent way to expose me to a variety of things because I am the only IT person at the office (such as admin, servers, general troubleshooting, server management, switches, hardware, etc.) It is basically like a Help Desk job, I do a lot of general troubleshooting but whe nit comes down to the technical stuff I can always call my support team and they can walk me through it.

 
 This experience so far has really driven me to start preparing for my career in the future and sort of ""jump start"" things. Although I don't know exactly what I want to do, or what specific field I want to go in to, I still want to strive for the best and get my degree is CIS. My question is, do you think it would be worth it to start studying for a certification in my free time, like the CompTia A+﻿? Or maybe another certification? In the future I have absolute no desire to fix computer hardware and do like your basic ""geek Squad"" job I guess you can say (no offense). Will this be beneficial for me going forward? I plan on staying with this company for awhile because it's a rapidly growing firm, the people are great, and I see so much potential as I grow with them. I really want to hear some opinions from people with more experience than me and what they would honestly do in my position. I am so new to this field and sort of ""lost in the dark"" and some tips, recommendations, help would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks!"

I'm a new developer who was lucky enough to get a summer job doing software development. I am mostly self taught so I've been continually asking for and completing projects before the internship starts to feel comfortable from day one. My boss tasked me with creating a Tetris game, and so far it's went great, I've followed this tutorial (linked below) and have made my own changes to make the game my own. The issue I am having is that the game is made to run in a 640x320 px canvas. for whatever reason on my screen this is bigger than you can fit in one window, so parts of the canvas element get cut off. I tried resizing everything to half size (background picture block picture etc) and changing the draw variables when I use ctx to draw blocks to my canvas but it doesn't work the way you would expect and ends up looking terrible and does not make the game playable. Just changing the canvas element does not work either. I am looking for a way to basically render out the canvas in 640x320 and then scale it.

My canvas draw elements are equivalent to those in the index.html file in this folder, the game logic is located in a script under the canvas (I actually want to change that but want to get everything right before I move it to a different file to clean up my html).

Thanks for the help!

EDIT: I am able to shrink the height of the canvas but any time I try to change the width things get wonky. It is okay the way it is now but I feel like this is a problem I should be able to fix regardless."

[ Andy, did you have any difficulty trying to trademark Shit Happens given it's such a common phase?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d2941ol?context=5)|Great question! As a matter of fact, until recently, the trademark office said ALL obscenities were off-limits.  But just a year ago, there was a case which loosened the boundaries a bit.  It's still pending, but I'm told I have a good chance and I'm hopeful.  Damn, I'd LOVE to trademark that phrase!  Speaking of Shit Happens, have you checked us out on Kickstarter yet?  We're kicking ass!
[Hello. When you spend so many years in the same field (since most of your work seem to be comedy\), do you find it hard not to ""recycle"" old jokes / situations and keep yourself from circling back to the same style? Thanks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294kz4?context=5)|You're right-- that's the challenge-- not to fall back on field-tested formulas-- but when you come up with something that you KNOW has never been done, there's no feeling like it.  I had that feeling when I first played Shit Happens, which is LIVE on Kickstarter now! What?  You wish there was a link?

[Your company seems to create a lot of games. Have you been a fan of games since you were a kid? What games were influential to you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d2944xi?context=5)|Yeah-  Games were a big part of my life, especially on vacations.  It's where I learned the joys of cheating. These days, creating and launching a new game is as satisfying for me as writing a film or TV episode.  I'd say ""Shit Happens""-- which is currently LIVE on Kickstarter- is my best game yet.
[Love the show, cannot believe that I got through. First time poster, long time listener. When are you and Ken ever going to get back out in the field for a live or taped show? Some of your best work was when you went out and stalked someone or played chess in the park or attended the 99% protest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d293u05?context=5)|Man I agree!  Those shows are my favorites, too.  The problem lately is Ken is so busy, he can't spare an afternoon to do it.  We have to wait for his current project to fail, so be patient, it won't take long--
 |By the way, the BEST remote we ever did was at a nursing home in Jersey City, but there was a glitch and the recording was unusable!  The show is like our legendary, long-lost ""Smile"" album!

Unless he hated it, in which case we'll be chatting about anything else!
[Hi Andy - You keep mentioning this Kickstarter but I can't find it for the life of me? What, pray tell, is the URL for this Kickstarter?

[What was your favorite SNL sketch?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294176?context=5)|The one where Eddie Murphy goes around in white face is the best known.. but the one I'm proudest of might be Japanese Game Show with Chris Farley.  Do you remember that one?  The degree of difficulty was very high, but it really came together.
[Favorite piece written/co-wrote?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d2956d7?context=5)|Thanks for asking.  I'm probably proudest of the pilot for Monk, because we HAD to get it exactly right, and we did.
 |I'm also proud of the game rules for Shit Happens.  Speaking of SHit Happens, it's LIVE on Kickstarter NOW!
[Do you think Dave Hill went too far in the bear costume, or not far enough?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d295960?context=5)|I'm going to answer this seriously. Ken and I DID get carried away, and regretted the tome of that show (especially since we were asking for $)-- And it made me re-think, and re-write- a couple of the more outrageous cards in Shit Happens. 
[Where did the idea for Rat Race come from ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294hso?context=5)|To be honest, Paramount wanted to do a big ensemble Mad Mad World style comedy.  A lot of writers pitched to them  I goyt the jpob by pitching three ideas for sequences-- NONE OF WHICH MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE!
[How did you break into comedy writing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294wx7?context=5)|I had to keep trying, and not give up.. because I have no other skill set whatsoever!

That was me.  I got the idea while watching other ""audience testimonial"" commercials.  If you look carefully, you can Lawrence O'donnell (now of MSNBC) as one of the extras!
[Did you have to take a different writing approach while working on a dramedy like *Monk*?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294981?context=5)|Yes.  It was a refreshing change of pace after 20 years writing straight-up comedy.  My favorite part of the process was ""breaking the stories"" with the other writers, figuring out the mystery/puzzles.
[If I contribute to your kickstarter, may I come to your sedar?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294lmk?context=5)|Hi Cousin Shana!  Miss you!  Because everyone is in Michigan (to be with Rachel), we're keeping the sedar small this year.  But don't let that stop you!  You'll love Shit Happens!
[Any shenanigans you've pulled on SSD (or elsewhere\) that you particularly regret?  That you're especially proud of?

[Hi Andy. Love the show, can't believe I got through.  What are the chances of you &amp; Ken spending a year living together in an Odd Couple-style arrangement, filmed for a reality tv show?  Same question re: Don McLean.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d293ljq?context=5)|Do you mean, like, locked in an apartment, where we can't leave?  The ratings would be HUGE on Week 6, because that's when I would kill him. It would be funny to do it for a weekend, though, and record the highlights for 7SD.
[Does the Feed a Puppy app actually feed a puppy, or is it all video trickery?  And was Letterman-era Chris Elliott more like the Harvard guys or more like the cool guys?

When I met Chris Elliot, he was an intern at Letterman-- he was booking pets for Stupid Pet Tricks-- but as soon as we used him in some sketches, it was obvious he was a star.

The positions are primarily IT based, it's application support, cloud engineering and network engineering. I've also been selected for a research assistant position at my school where I'd be doing research for the head of the department which would eventually lead into developing the application I'm researching. I don't plan on going to grad school unless my job pays for it. But I'm wondering as of right now, as a sophomore, what would look better for my internship search next year, IT internship or CS research. Also I'm being considered for web applications development for the school. So I'm a little conflicted on which I should choose. The research is part time and has a chance of continuing through the school year and probably the rest of my time in school. And because it's part time I would be doing this along with my current job as desktop support over the summer. I was thinking maybe research + web development. The IT internships are all strict 40 hours a week. "
4fk5o5,1,2016-04-19,I am learning to program on my own and I need help.,Slurpieee,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4fk5o5/i_am_learning_to_program_on_my_own_and_i_need_help/,"I have a BA in communication studies and have been out of school roughly two years. I didn't feel the passion in my career path and had the opportunity to return home. I wanted to figure out what it was I wanted to do in life before it was too late and I was pigeon holed into something I didn't want to do.

I have always had a knack for computers. I loved everything about computers, but I didn't pursue a computer science degree for various reasons.. all of which were excuses. I started learning more about software development and researched what options I had to advance my knowledge base. 

Formal schooling, code school, or self taught. The big three. Formal schooling was out of the question for me personally because I felt that I was already behind having gone to school and I didn't want to waste any more time (~2 years of formal school). 

Code school. I have interviewed at two of the code schools in my area (San Diego). I was not impressed at all by one and the other seemed worthwhile. However a 11-12k dollar price tag is nothing to sneeze at. This door isn't entirely closed for me.

Self taught. I recently bought a white board and started planning out my days. I paid for codecademy pro because I figured why not, especially if i'm facing a possible 11 thousand dollar commitment. I also discovered a site called bento which is information curated by developers. I have been watching and learning from the CS50 harvard course. I have a github and I know how important it is, but i'm still learning the basics.

I'm just not sure what to do. Should I attend a code school or should I learn on my own. Take in a few more factors that would be entered into the equation. I am unemployed, my job is to learn. The code school is 3 months of instruction and a 1 month internship, high job placement, the standard things advertised in most code schools. 

If I continue to be self taught, I want to mirror that timeline as best as possible by grinding out 8 hour days. Not sit around and maybe code an hour here or there. I have the time to put in that work and I'm ready for the commitment because this is truly something I am passionate about."
4fkf12,1,2016-04-19,I’ve accepted an offer for a state of FL park ranger position a week before an interview with another FL park which is in a location I have always dreamed about living in. I really NEED ranger advice (or anyone who works in a related field) on how to approach this situation.,Mydawgg,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4fkf12/ive_accepted_an_offer_for_a_state_of_fl_park/,"Hey Reddit, first time OP here so if this post isn’t as succinct and as clean as possible that’s my excuse. I am a 24 year old Floridian who lives in Palm Beach County. I graduated from the University of South Florida about a year ago with a BA in geography and history. I’ve done two internships that were directly involved with park/resource management, biology, wildlife surveys, invasive plant control, interpretation and the like. I’ve always loved nature and spending time in local parks so I figured that being a park ranger would be a great place to start since I’m still not sure what I want to do with the rest of my life. I started applying for park ranger positions on USAjobs about 6 months ago to no avail. About 2 months ago my mom wisely suggested that I start applying to state park ranger positions through the state of Florida’s official site, peoplefirst.myflorida.com. I started applying and heard back from one of the first parks I applied for about 3 or 4 weeks later. I interviewed at the first park and felt that I did very well, especially considering it was my first professional interview. I was told by a couple of the rangers in my first interview that I should not be discouraged if I don’t end up getting an offer because one of them had interviewed 13 times before he got his first offer and the other interviewed 7 times before he got his. I didn’t end up getting the first job, in particular because they were looking for someone who, among other things, had prescribed burning experience of which I had none. I was discouraged but of course I kept applying to ranger vacancies and heard back from another park in Southwest FL that wanted to interview me. I went to my second interview about 4 weeks ago and I think I did even better in this one because I ended up getting an offer for the job a few days ago. I was told by this park that I was the ideal candidate because of my skills and experience in invasive plant control and interpretation. I was also told that they would have restarted the hiring process if I had turned down the offer because I was the only candidate whose qualifications satisfied them. Several days before I received the job offer I was sent an automated message from peoplefirst.myflorida.com telling me that I did not receive the job. This message looked identical to the message I received after I was told that I wasn’t chosen by the first park I interviewed with so I thought I’d have to keep looking. It ended up being a clerical error that I was sent the second automated message but this fact was unbeknownst to me at the time. A day before I received my job offer I got a call from a park in the Keys that wants to interview near the end of this month. As an avid spearfisherman and free diver I would relish an opportunity to live in the Keys. It is my favorite place in the world. The park in Southwest FL is beautiful but it is also in an area in which I know virtually nobody. The cost of living anywhere near the park is exorbitantly expensive and even and hour or so away, the areas where I was told to look for a place to live, are quite pricey and I will only be making about 26,500 a year before taxes. I know that living in the Keys is also ridiculously expensive but I have at least one best friend that would move with me if I were to end up getting the Keys job so the financial burden would likely be equal or lesser than that of the alternative, depending on what kind of place we lived in. For those of you that don’t know it is very difficult to find a professional job in the Keys outside of the fishing industry. I am a man of my word and I won’t go back on my commitment to the park on the west coast but I booked a motel in the Keys a few days before I got my offer (remember I was sent the automated message telling me I was not selected) so I am going to interview at the Keys park regardless. As I’ve said I am 24 years old and it’s high time that I moved out of my pops place and started down the path of professional development so I really can’t afford to turn down a good job when another is not guaranteed. Although, I would hate to disqualify myself from potentially landing a dream job and I want to at least see if I will even be offered the position. I’ve also been unemployed for almost 6 months which most of you know is not a good look. I don’t know if I got very lucky by landing a ranger job at my age on my second interview because I had the particular skills they happened to be looking for but I believe that I have at least a decent shot of landing the Keys job. How should I approach this interview? Should I come out and tell them that I’ve accepted another offer but that their park is my ideal job? Should I only give them this information if they specifically ask about any offers I may have received from other parks? Should I tell them that if they want to hire me I need to hear back from them ASAP because of the situation I’m in? I know that they have to run paperwork through the capital and that Tallahassee makes the ultimate decision on who is hired so I don’t know if asking for a speedy response will even make a difference. Is there any chance I could eventually transfer from one park to another if I do end up getting the offer for the Keys job? I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place and I am honestly stumped as to how I should approach this situation. I don’t want to be unprofessional or hurt my future prospects for landing a ranger position in the Keys. Any insight or advice from a ranger would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR

I’ve accepted an offer for a state of Florida park ranger position from a good park, a week before an interview with a FL dream park. My start date is the first week of May and my interview for the dream position is the last week of this month. I know I won’t hear back from the dream park in time to accept without going back on my commitment but I don’t want to disqualify myself from at least seeing if I will be offered the dream job. How should I approach this situation? What are my options? Can I eventually transfer from one park to another?

I have an internship at JPL in the summer and 1 class in the Fall and I'm done. 

I am interested in going to grad school for AI/ML/Robotics,
but for one reason or another, I haven't been able to get on a research team as an undergrad. 

I do have a 3.82 and I think I can do well on the GREs, but I don't think this places me a competitive applicant for any decent schools. I am trying to come up with a plan until the 2018 (or perhaps 2019) Fall applications are due. 

I can hope to get a job at JPL, which has amazing benefits if you want to continue into higher education (you can even take classes at Caltech as an employee).

Otherwise though, I don't seem to have much options. Paying 60k for a MS seems unwise (maybe the 8k online Georgia tech program? But that doesn't help with getting involved in research and meeting professors).

I can try and do some kind of project on my own, but without any guidance that might not go anywhere. Moreover, it doesn't help me get letters of rec. I have been thinking about sending an email to my ML professor with some research ideas I had in mind though.

Just looking for any kind of advice. Thank you.

I'm in a co-op program which means I alternate learning things at school and taking internships in the workplace.  I met my boyfriend of just over a year at school, but he's older and has graduated and moved to California.  After 4 months of long distance I got an internship in California as well at a really well respected company.  My family wasn't so happy about it because they want me to stay much closer to them.  I haven't always had a great relationship with my family so I was pretty happy to get away, but also sad that it made things worse.  Now I'm going back to school for 4 months but I need to decide if I'm coming back for another internship at this company.
On one hand, its right by my boyfriend, and a great job for learning and for the resume.  There's the possibility of changing groups too so I'd get some new experiences.  On the other hand, it might make things harder with my family, but if I get my next internship in Canada it means I won't be with my boyfriend for any real period of time for at least a year.  There's also the issue of where I take internships really effects where I'll end up after graduation.  Most people accept full time offers from somewhere they interned so the more jobs I take in California the more likely I'll stay here permanently.  I know its kinda silly of me, but I just always imagined living in Canada eh?

Any advice?"

**Intended major(s):** Computer Science/Biomedical Engineering/Computer Engineering

**Academics:** Okay I think this the perfect spot to explain my situation. In 8th grade, I was given the opportunity to take 3 high school classes for credit (Algebra 1, Spanish 1, Living Environment) but I did terrible grade wise because I underwent a pretty major surgery that made me wheelchair bound for half a year. I was in constant pain and missed a lot of school; I couldn't focus and I honestly was not intrinsically motivated at all during that year. Thinking back, I probably would have quit school if I had the chance. These grades are being factored into my cumulative gpa, but they're not good grades... However, my grades are a huge upward trend.

**ACT: (composite; optional: by section)** Expecting a 32 on the June ACT

**SAT: (Total out of 2400; optional: by section)** Not taking

**SAT II: if available** Going to be taking the Biology and Math II subject test soon.

**Class rank: if available** 8/120~, going to be higher once I finish junior year

**UW/W GPA:** By the end of my junior year it'll be 3.75/4. If you do not count my 8th grade grades, it's 3.99/4. I'm going to try to retake Spanish 1 online to fix my grades, effectively changing my cumulative to a 3.8ish.

**Coursework:--APs taken and scores (or IB); any other relevant classes. Give an idea if you're mostly taking APs, honors, none, etc.** My school only offers one AP: APUSH. I'm expecting a 4 or 5 on it. However, I'm taking the most rigorous courses possible and I am going to be dual-enrolling at the local community college for my senior year. I'm going to be taking Calc (only me and another student were eligible to take this based on the Accuplacer test), some random computer science class that I don't remember the name of, Physics (they don't offer it at my school and I can only take it second semester), English. My school will be possibly offering AP CS next year, which I will be taking. I'm also going to be taking a college Spanish class at my high school next. I'm a year ahead of my entire class, so I'm taking classes that a senior would normally take at my school. I'm currently taking a college PreCalc class and Spanish 4.

**Awards:** Nothing major. 

1st at a local bridge building competition (11th, placed like 7th overall in 10th)

2nd Regional Mousetrap Car Competition (10th)

1st Regional Mousetrap Car Competition (11th), I'm going to be going to compete nationally and I'm expecting to win 1st or 2nd.

A lot of local chess competition awards (my school basically wins 1st overall in like all the competitions locally hosted, I usually get 3rd place in the individual awards though)

Maybe a Questbridge Prep Scholar?

Student of the Month (obsolete though, haha)

**Extracurriculars:
List club, community service, job, etc. Include leadership position if applicable. Also include summer activities here, if applicable.**

-Cofounder of the eSports club.

-Pres of the Chess Club

-Envirothon Team, we don't win anything but it's worth mentioning.

-Citizen U member, which is a cooperative extension program of Cornell.

-Founder and Pres of the Programming Club, we're going to be competing at a local hackathon-esque event soon, probably not gonna win lol.

-Cofounder and Pres of the STEM Club

-Competitor at a local model steamboat competition, didn't win again but it's worth mentioning lol (this is a recurring thing lol).

-Competitor at the Highschool Star League eSports competition.

-Cofounder and builder/documenter in our VEX Robotics Team

-Attending the Cornell Summer College program for 3-weeks in the Business World program this summer! Super ecstatic and I got a full scholarship to go there!

-Volunteer at my local church and at a homeless center.

-Helped raise $600 for Nepal's relief efforts last year with my teacher.

-I'm working on getting an internship at a local business in their IT department.

-Starting a website soon, it's going to be engineering related. I have everything planned out. I'm also going to be starting a youtube channel that will coincide with this website. The website + channel will probably also have like a dual purpose as a personal blog of my experience in the admissions process.

-Competiting in the Intel ISEF competition next year.

I spent about 19 months at my last internship (a national laboratory) over the course of 3 years or so, and I currently work at a fairly small (~150 employees) tech company in Knoxville, TN.  At my first internship I made $12.50 an hour untaxed (paid as a ""scholarship"" stipend), and I'm currently making $14/hour before taxes, and I can't help but feel like I'm getting underpaid.

Looking on Glassdoor and talking to my friends who work elsewhere, it sounds like the average is somewhere around $18-$20/hour.  What's the best way to go about asking for a raise?  I imagine the best way would be to apply to other jobs to try and leverage those potential offers against my current job, but my GPA is absolute garbage (~2.1, got my current job because of work experience and connections) so I doubt I'd even get an interview from most places.

I'm just not sure how I feel about working every single day in the summer. But I mean I don't have any friends anyway and all I do is cook, go to the gym, and work on my car all of which can be done after the internship or before/after shifts on the weekends. I would love to make a ton of money this summer for car parts and to have a little left over for extra expenses when I cut back hours when next year of college starts

I took the screening ~10 days ago, and I'm 100% sure that I tested positive for amphetamines due to Vyvanse and negative for everything else but I was really expecting a call or some form of notification about the results by now. Does anyone have any advice about how to make this go as smoothly as possible? I'm aware that this can't legally prevent my internship from happening, I would just like to avoid headache in a few weeks upon learning that I mishandled the situation.

I tried to inform the screening agency of my prescriptions through the collection agency but  they just told me that it was the actual testing agency that would ""reach out to me with any questions.""

So really my questions are:

- Should I reach out to the HR person at the company this testing is for? I have absolutely no problems discussing my medications or condition but I for some reason am getting the feeling that it would be inappropriate to discuss it with said HR person (it's nothing that shes done, it feels inappropriate to discuss it with any HR person, just due to legal constraints)
    + Would it be inappropriate to email an HR rep out of the blue about not receiving drug test results?
- I informed my MD about the test, he said he would be happy to send proof of the prescription if required. 
   + Could the agency reached out to him directly after the initial Amphetamine-positive results and this has already been fixed?
- Finally, I understand that secondary testing will absolutely make this take longer than the typical ""3 to 5 business days"". How long should that period of time be?

I have always turned to reddit for life's big questions and it has always brought me so much clarity, so I'm taking control and trying to figure out who I am and what I am destined for.

I am a 25 year old male living in Melbourne, Australia.

I used to want to be an actor but gave up the dream. I find pleasure in entertaining others and have a knack for impressions. I mention this because it is a very core part of who I am and who I would like to be.

I have been working in retail for almost 8 years now and I'm starting to get sick of the same thing over and over.
What I have managed to do is stick to retail roles that put me at the forefront of a product I love and the customers who buy them.

I have worked for Apple, Nike and various other smaller brands. I haver worked with Outerwear, I have worked bicycles and I have worked with red dot design-trinket-lifestyle products. I have picked up some keen insight into what makes a good customer experience and more importantly, what makes a good product.

Throughout all these roles, there is one apparent similarity. I have a huge passion for design.

I feel quite daunted by the idea of coming up with my own designs, but I have always admired excellent design and craftsmanship and have been particularly enamoured by products that streamline our lives and simplify what it means to be a 21st Century human.

With that in mind, my most recent obsession has been 'techwear' - clothing that has everyday performance with graceful aesthetic. I adore brands like Arc'teryx Veilance, Y-3, Outlier, Rapha and White Mountaineering.
I want to be able to understand what career will allow me to connect with people like my customers or 'audience' while allowing me to start really steering the creative direction of a product. Of course I could make something up and just chuck it on Kickstarter, but I want to future proof myself slightly and find out what skills I need to acquire to really have an impact. 

So far, people have told me marketing, product/industrial design, fashion (technical textiles) or to just move in to wholesale. I've also been looking at internships with the various companies I mentioned, but obviously need to be in a classroom first.

TL;DR I love sleek things and now I want to make sleek things

I plan to graduate from the Univeristy of Michigan with a Double Major in Data Science/ Computer Science and Minors in Business Analytics and Writing.

My dream is to work my way up to a consultant in my mid 20's to 30's  and then settle down in a management role at a large company after. Again my dream is also to earn a hefty salary, enough to support myself and family in any endeavor I take.

I have read almost every post on this subreddit and talked to many data scientists personally and I know this dream is farfetched. However I am determined.

So the question is, can any of you experienced Data Scientists give me specific advice that I can put towards making my dream a reality? It can be anything from what college classes to take to what internships and jobs to pursue. 

Thank you all so much! And I want to let u guys know that this subreddit is awesome! :)

4fp71z,1,2016-04-20,SharePoint Alternatives - Looking for Content/Document Management Solution,aleatoric,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4fp71z/sharepoint_alternatives_looking_for/,"I've been searching around for a tool that might help me and my company better organize our documents archive which also acts as a body of knowledge. However I'm not sure what I'm looking for is a Document Management solution per se because ideally the documents are supplemented with additional data (both narrative text and numerical values) describing the documents contained therein to help understand and explore all of the documents available. This makes me think of the term ""Knowledge Management"" but when I search for Knowledge Management tools, it's mainly IT Service Management tools for tracking trouble ticket histories and that's not what I'm looking for at all, although there are definitely some similarities. Perhaps what I'm looking for then is a Content Management product, but we're not managing a ton of assets (like graphics, videos, sounds, etc) so I'm not sure if that is overkill.

SharePoint is the tool we've pegged as the solution because it has the bottom of the line essential features. However, I really don't like SharePoint. I find its usability to be terrible. It's a great tool if you know what you're looking for, but it's a bad tool if you want to browse through a lot of information, such as a new employee learning and taking in information. 

I've stuck some background information I've written here in quotes. I thought about deleting it because it's lengthy but it might help understand the business need better:

&gt; I work for a small business that does Government contracting. Basically we're a teeny tiny version of something like Lockheed Martin or SAIC that specializes in biomedical research and professional services (staffing). 
&gt; 
&gt;  I work in the proposals department. We write proposals to win new business. It's a small team, but we each have our own niche. Mine is past performance: knowing what we've done in the past, and establishing it as proof to new prospective customers that we are capable of performing their requirements. 
&gt; 
&gt; This makes a historical knowledge of what our company has done in the past critically important. The only problem is that  a lot of the contextual knowledge that helps me make specific connections either resides in my brain, or in something we've written in the past. So right now, if I want to know if we have a specific kind of experience, if I don't know off the top of my head I usually do a search in Windows Explorer (I know, dreadful) of all the documents with those terms. If they're specific terms, it can be easy, but broad terms can require me to dig through hundreds of documents to find what I'm looking for, even after running a search. 
&gt; 
&gt; Others in my department have similar issues with their respective duties. As I previously mentioned, the current solution we are moving toward is SharePoint. It makes the most sense based on the products I know that are out there. Firstly, we already have the tool, so we don't have to purchase a new solution. We just have to set some server space aside for it and spend some time customizing the portal. I know SharePoint can generally do what we want it to do: create an archive of documents, tag them appropriately (army, clinical, etc) and boom, and then pull them up. Searching also works better in SharePoint than Explorer. It's certainly faster, although I don't find the interface to be that great nor the search mechanism to be as effective as something like Google's search algorithms (if we go with SharePoint I might recommend embedding a Google Search box if that is still a thing). 

In theory I think SharePoint can work OK. The main issue is that I (and a few others in my department) hate SharePoint. I think its usability is total garbage. It's not a very good tool for, say, someone who's new to the company. Perhaps they want to explore what our company has done in the past and understand it better. Think about something like Wikipedia: you can set up pages so that there is a flow of narrative and a lot of inter-linking. Instead of it being a cluttered list of documents, I'd prefer individual pages like ""Clinical Research"" which would describe what clinical research is, give a brief history of our work in clinical research, and then show what some of our past proposals (documents) are. Similarly you could navigate to a page for the U.S. Army, which could display some of our individual customers within the Army, some of our biggest contracts (and the important documents related), and the type of work we've done for them. 

The problem with a Wiki solution is that it's a bit more difficult to maintain. SharePoint you can just drop a file in there, tag it, and go on your way. When it comes to contract documents in particular, they can be modded at any time, and if we are going to have someone use this archive/portal/whatever it should be easy for them to go in and update this document. 

This is my impasse: I want something that's easy to maintain like SharePoint in terms of its document tagging, organizing, and searching. But I want to be able to have an interface that works as a friendlier interface for navigating and understanding this knowledge and its relationships. I don't mind some front-end effort establishing that interface as I imagine it will be a decent workload (I might hire an intern to help with this part). 

**TL;DR-**

* I'm looking for recommendations for a tool that combines document management (SharePoint) and web content management (like a Wiki). 

* Web-based is ideal but Windows apps might work as well.

* Free is ""nice to have"" but a paid tool is OK, especially if the product has a scalable pricing models because our need would not be as large as a big business.

* Should be easy to use and maintain for non-tech-savvy users. 

Any recommendations would be welcome. Thanks in advance!"

I also commute and am pretty shy so I don't have many friends that I can ask. Sorry in advance :(

So I'm a freshman currently taking 143 and I've been doing well so far. One thing I've been curious about for a while is how much you have to learn to actually be considered competent or qualified for a job / internship? Last week I overheard some classmates say things like the stuff you learn in 142/143 (writing for loops and traversing through arrays step by step) is actually really bad / slow in real-world situations. Those same guys also claimed that 373 is when you're barely qualified (if you're a nonmajor) to start interviewing for internships and stuff.

Anyways, I tried asking my TA what he thought but he said he wasn't really sure himself -- that I should ask the CSE students what their experiences were. Unfortunately, I'm kind of a loser so I don't know a lot of CS majors... I know there are a few CSE students on here so I guess I just wanted to ask what their experiences were. Do you guys think finishing the core classes (311/312+331/332+351) is when you're competent, or even later? Only when you have a degree? Just very curious and eager for some replies. Thank you so much to anyone who replies!"

I could also get a head start on the program and take a couple of the grad classes next semester while I finish my undergrad and could finish the program in 3 semesters after I finish undergrad (May 2018, 2 years from now). 

Question is, is it worth it? I do enjoy my classes and I think I would be better off down the line with a masters, but I'm not really sure. I have one internship under my belt and another one this summer, and if I do the masters I can get a 3rd (probably at the same company that I'll be going to this summer). 

What do you guys think? I've also thought about applying to top 10 departments if I am going to go for the masters, however relocating, as well as paying tuition and living expenses would be very, very expensive. "
4fpltj,5,2016-04-20,SharePoint Alternatives - Looking for Document/Content Management Solution Recommendations (X-Post to techsupport),aleatoric,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4fpltj/sharepoint_alternatives_looking_for/,"Someone over at techsupport recommended I post this question here instead since it's not exactly ""tech support"" and is more of a broad question regarding a business need that a sys admin might be able to assist with.

I've been searching around for a tool that might help me and my company better organize our documents archive which also acts as a body of knowledge. However I'm not sure what I'm looking for is a Document Management solution per se because ideally the documents are supplemented with additional data (both narrative text and numerical values) describing the documents contained therein to help understand and explore all of the documents available. This makes me think of the term ""Knowledge Management"" but when I search for Knowledge Management tools, it's mainly IT Service Management tools for tracking trouble ticket histories and that's not what I'm looking for at all, although there are definitely some similarities. Perhaps what I'm looking for then is a Content Management product, but we're not managing a ton of assets (like graphics, videos, sounds, etc) so I'm not sure if that is overkill.

SharePoint is the tool we've pegged as the solution because it has the bottom of the line essential features. However, I really don't like SharePoint. I find its usability to be terrible. It's a great tool if you know what you're looking for, but it's a bad tool if you want to browse through a lot of information, such as a new employee learning and taking in information. 

I've stuck some background information I've written here in quotes. I thought about deleting it because it's lengthy but it might help understand the business need better:

&gt; I work for a small business that does Government contracting. Basically we're a teeny tiny version of something like Lockheed Martin or SAIC that specializes in biomedical research and professional services (staffing). 
&gt; 
&gt;  I work in the proposals department. We write proposals to win new business. It's a small team, but we each have our own niche. Mine is past performance: knowing what we've done in the past, and establishing it as proof to new prospective customers that we are capable of performing their requirements. 
&gt; 
&gt; This makes a historical knowledge of what our company has done in the past critically important. The only problem is that  a lot of the contextual knowledge that helps me make specific connections either resides in my brain, or in something we've written in the past. So right now, if I want to know if we have a specific kind of experience, if I don't know off the top of my head I usually do a search in Windows Explorer (I know, dreadful) of all the documents with those terms. If they're specific terms, it can be easy, but broad terms can require me to dig through hundreds of documents to find what I'm looking for, even after running a search. 
&gt; 
&gt; Others in my department have similar issues with their respective duties. As I previously mentioned, the current solution we are moving toward is SharePoint. It makes the most sense based on the products I know that are out there. Firstly, we already have the tool, so we don't have to purchase a new solution. We just have to set some server space aside for it and spend some time customizing the portal. I know SharePoint can generally do what we want it to do: create an archive of documents, tag them appropriately (army, clinical, etc) and boom, and then pull them up. Searching also works better in SharePoint than Explorer. It's certainly faster, although I don't find the interface to be that great nor the search mechanism to be as effective as something like Google's search algorithms (if we go with SharePoint I might recommend embedding a Google Search box if that is still a thing). 

In theory I think SharePoint can work OK. The main issue is that I (and a few others in my department) hate SharePoint. I think its usability is total garbage. It's not a very good tool for, say, someone who's new to the company. Perhaps they want to explore what our company has done in the past and understand it better. Think about something like Wikipedia: you can set up pages so that there is a flow of narrative and a lot of inter-linking. Instead of it being a cluttered list of documents, I'd prefer individual pages like ""Clinical Research"" which would describe what clinical research is, give a brief history of our work in clinical research, and then show what some of our past proposals (documents) are. Similarly you could navigate to a page for the U.S. Army, which could display some of our individual customers within the Army, some of our biggest contracts (and the important documents related), and the type of work we've done for them. 

The problem with a Wiki solution is that it's a bit more difficult to maintain. SharePoint you can just drop a file in there, tag it, and go on your way. When it comes to contract documents in particular, they can be modded at any time, and if we are going to have someone use this archive/portal/whatever it should be easy for them to go in and update this document. 

This is my impasse: I want something that's easy to maintain like SharePoint in terms of its document tagging, organizing, and searching. But I want to be able to have an interface that works as a friendlier interface for navigating and understanding this knowledge and its relationships. I don't mind some front-end effort establishing that interface as I imagine it will be a decent workload (I might hire an intern to help with this part). 

**TL;DR-**

* I'm looking for recommendations for a tool that combines document management (SharePoint) and web content management (like a Wiki). 

* Web-based is ideal but Windows apps might work as well.

* Free is ""nice to have"" but a paid tool is OK, especially if the product has a scalable pricing models because our need would not be as large as a big business.

* Should be easy to use and maintain for non-tech-savvy users. 

Any recommendations would be welcome. Thanks in advance!"

I really just want someone to listen to me, and maybe talk about some of the things I'm dealing with. That would really help so much maybe even steer me in the right direction. 

* My battery and starting motor went out on my car today. The battery cost me $150 I didn't have so I had to run up my credit card even more ($400 balance, I only work like 10 hours a week at my part time job because they cut hours). My dad bought the starter motor and then I tried to install it and I couldn't. I hate not being able to do something on my car. Now I have to drop it off at the shop tomorrow and deal with being without a car for a day (sounds dumb but college + work + the little outside life I have require that, plus my car is literally the source of 90% of my happiness)

* This girl I'm really good friends with, basically my only real friend actually, has a boyfriend and it just keeps making me feel bad. Like I do like her but what can I do? Nothing. And it makes me feel horrible. Now even she randomly isn't texting me and I feel alone. 

* College is just getting worse and worse. I got a 39 on a homework last night and a 0 on a literature test. All my previous semesters have been great, especially considering how shit I was at high school, so I have deemed this semester a loss but it still fucking sucks getting those grades. 

* Overall it just sucks not having friends, and not being able to meet any. My community college is a social recluse with 0 clubs or anything to make friends but I can't afford to transfer yet. I do everything alone; movies, coffee, shopping, lunch. It's just me. Me and that girl do a lot but I think once summer comes and I'm working full time as an intern we wont hang out as much, and it's just going to be me again. 

I probably sound like an idiot, hell I'm not even depressed I just didn't know where else to get some help. I still have a lot going for me and I have no reason to be down but I am. I want to keep getting up and telling life to fuck off but it's just getting to me, talking about it with someone would help.

4fqirg,9,2016-04-20,Computer science major- having some trouble with technical interviews for internships,gek0srf,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4fqirg/computer_science_major_having_some_trouble_with/,"It's really easy for me to get past the initial stages of an interview as I love talking and all that wonderful ADHD stuff and my soft skills are usually pretty great, until after the technical portion of the interview that I know I've failed. 

When given a coding problem to solve in front of the interviewers, I just can't do it. I know how to solve the problem and a lot of the time I've actually seen the problem beforehand while doing my own practice sessions. I've even tried talking out loud while I'm practicing and I've gotten kind of better at it. 

But when I'm actually there in the interview, I completely freeze up. I'll start trying every single approach to a problem trying to trigger my memory and I have to voice this process out loud as I'm doing it because they want to hear your problem solving process. And then I get nervous that the interviewers must think I'm some sort of lunatic because my thoughts, naturally, are so jumbled and they tend to jump back and forth. I'm used to hiding my ADHD from others in a professional setting, so having to voice my thoughts feels like I'm ripping off my ADHD mask and showing just how weird my brain is. So the end result is that it comes off as me not knowing what I'm doing and that I can't code, so I don't get hired. 

I've even had to do a technical interview in a room on campus with thin walls where I could hear every word from another interview going on at the same time, so that was quite distracting and fun. But my experiences in quieter rooms have been just as bad and the only person distracting me was myself. 

I know I have test performance anxieties and I'm slower to process things, which isn't good for a career where they expect you to solve a coding problem as fast as possible. So I don't know what to do. 

I've talked to my disability advisor through my university and she said that there may be some sort of way to get interview accommodations. But then I'm also worried that seeking those would negatively impact me in actually getting a job. 

As a result of all of this, I haven't been able to land a summer internship at all, despite trying really hard and going on lots of interviews. And I'm graduating in December, so I won't have any internship experiences in software engineering before trying to find a full time job. So I'm then at a bigger disadvantage. 

The failure of this is really hard to come to terms with, but I'm just wondering if someone else has been in this situation before. And I'm wondering what those of you who have software engineering jobs have done to mitigate your ADHD during the technical portion of your job interviews. 

**TL;DR** I'm basically looking for any sort of advice that fellow ADHD computer scientists have for technical interviews. "

Recently, though, I heard back from another offer, which was a hands-on internship in my field of interest. Needless to say, the opportunity is something that I just can't afford to pass up, but with the summer drawing nearer, I don't want to leave the other offer 'hanging' as well.

Going to compress an incredibly long story into a merely long one to save room/melodrama, going to include things about how well I did in school—simply because it may relate to something I can put on my resume, apologies if it comes across as arrogant. 

==

-Got a psych degree from a good school, graduated with a 3.8 average. This took about five years due to a change in major early on. No job during this time because my parents suggested I focus solely on school and then take the summers off ( absolutely not blaming them—it was super sweet of them and completely my decision to go along with their suggestion, just pointing out why I was able to do this).

-Got sick—one year in a coma, one year recovering.

-Went to law school, finished first year in top 20%, got into Law review via the write on. Interned with a pair of judges at both the federal and state level over the summer (two internships is the norm). Got super sick again (same issue) and spent another two years sick in bed—no coma this time but still couldn’t do much. Had to drop out of law school. Never went back because 1.) My scholarship, understandably, got pulled and I couldn’t afford to go back and 2.) Came to the conclusion I wouldn’t enjoy being a lawyer very much. 

-My health issues weren’t as severe, so I went to a community college for an associates in an IT field while recovering. During this time, I also started a small resale business with just me as the sole proprietor where I flip stuff online since I had to be fairly sedentary; made enough to cover for school. I also took a trimester off to undertake a very risky surgery that worked out and, wallah!, just like that, health problems are resolved—only thing I have to worry about are yearly check-ups from now on and taking a ton of meds every morning. 

-Finishing my associates (Straight A’s except for one B) and getting my certs in about three months’ time. 

==

During this whole time I, like an idiot, focused on school instead of actual resume building. The result? Twenty seven, turning twenty-eight in a few weeks, and practically nil to put down when I’m about to enter the work force (excluding a few easy internships in an unrelated field) for the first time. 

What do I do in such a bizarre situation? Even if resolved, I don’t feel comfortable mentioning a serious illness and the gaps are massive. Functional resumes have fallen out of style. My small business is honestly pretty meager profit wise, so the instant I have to turn over any receipts / tax returns to prove I’m not making it up it will still look small time. Only bright side is my family ages extraordinary slowly (youngest person to die in my grandparent’s generation was 95. He was out riding his bike and got hit by a car—that’s how freakishly slow we age); so I look twentyish instead of twenty-seven; most peopled will assume I’m fresh out of college (which I am, but you know what I mean). But the dates on my resume will give away that I’m much older. 

If I can’t get a job, I’ll just start volunteering like mad to build up my resume. I don’t have to worry about rent atm since my parents are incredibly supportive and awesome, but this can’t go on forever either. I’m worried that I’m only getting older and the instant my age pops up I’ll be screwed… 

Any advice?  Is this as cataclysmic as I think it is? Should I plan to submit resumes across the whole country (US) and get ready for a move?

I've been stuck on this since yesterday, I've succesfully added a button by changing the cell renderer who then changes the inner html but then I have no way of adding an event to it (Or I haven't found one).

Here are the classes I use :
I've followed this example since I'm only trying a few things to get used to sencha (as well as gwt) http://examples.sencha.com/gxt/4.0.0/#ExamplePlace:basicsimplegrid%28uibinder%29 so I'm using ColumnModel, ColumnConfig and a custom button class which extends TextButton. 
I'm also doing AsyncCalls to a database to retrieve the data I want to print in the grid, which are succesful but that may be good to know.

I feel like the example I used isn't made for that, I should maybe find a more efficient way to make that grid.

So if you guys have any idea on how to do this with what I'm using or something totally different that'd a great help !
Feel free to ask code samples, though I have an ugly spaghettis code.

3. Would I be able to get a job by the time I graduate if I switched to computer science? I know that comp sci is currently a great field to be getting into, but I'm wondering if I'll be too behind everyone else in terms of technical skills to be employable. Basically, I'm just afraid of switching majors, not finding a job, and being weighed down by $40k worth of student loans.

(Internship Offer),Mordoc0881,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4fu3xp/what_else_can_i_do_internship_offer/,"Long story short I was offered an internship at a small company in a major city last week. I have previous engineering project experience and had a good internship last summer where I was paid $16/hr, which was about what I had expected (though I don't want to work there again for other reasons). 

However, this new company is offering me just $15/hr. Not bad, but much less than I expected. I sent the engineering manager an email asking for a small increase before I start this summer but he shut it down because they are a small company and he said they can't offer anything more. I made sure to make a strong case that I was more experienced and that I would work as hard as I needed to earn than higher rate.

I do believe I deserve closer to $18/hr because that's what friends with similar experience make nearby, because that's the average for the area, and it's a small boost over last summer. But to take this offer would be a pay CUT!

What else can I do? I do want to work for the company, but I almost feel insulted at the rate. I don't have any other options since it's so close to the summer already and I feel lucky that they offered anything at all, but I feel like this might be a red flag.

I want to major in Computer Engineering and definitely partake in some entrepreneurship opportunities while I am on campus

I got into NEU Honors and am living in MA so I figured that I wouldn't have to deal with too much of a cultural shift. The Co-op program seems very interesting and would help me gain lots of work experience. Plus, the cost would be around 36k per year with the grant money

UIUC is out in the midwest and I'm not sure how well I'd adapt but it's a top uni for CE. Along with that, the campus is a bit detached from everything else. I figured that if I go to UIUC or UMichigan, I would like to come back to the east coast during the summers but I don't know how that would fare in terms of the internship opportunities. The cost amounts to 51k per year

UMichigan is a similar argument to UIUC. Top uni but it has some city life. It costs about 53k per year but I could do a Ross BBA alongside my engineering degree. I don't know how much more I'd be worth though (as silly as that may sound) in terms of entry salary in case entrepreneurship doesn't work. The issue I have with the bigger schools is that I feel like I might get lost in the crowd of the other talented engineers (a bit irrational, but a concern I have nevertheless). I also am battling the idea of reputation vs the co-op work experience. Maybe I'm overthinking it or approaching it in the wrong way and would like some insight

My parents have been pushing me to go to the bigger schools and have been sending so many people to talk me into it and they have all been giving rather confusing opinions so I wanted to come here and get a sense of what you guys think"

So I am graduating in December. I send well over 250 applications for a summer internship, and I got an unpaid 6 week internship (not a scam, just a cheap start up) which I accepted as a back up, but still applied and searched every where else. 

So here is my dilemma. I have to take 5 courses in my final semester and meet the unit cap, so I can't take an elective I really really really want (FPGA design using VHDL. Probably my main career choice). However, I can take a summer class if I drop this internship, which will open my schedule up to take the FPGA course. However, I really want the experience for future job applications after graduation.

Should I drop it and take summer classes, and do a project over summer?

Should I take the unpaid 6 week internship (might be able to take a class second half of summer anyway)?

If I get offered a paid 10-12 week summer internship, should I 100% take it and sacrafice my FPGA elective? 

The professor already agreed to allow me to audit the lecture and lab.

I've done well academically and have enjoyed a good portion of my classes. Of course, there have been the ones that I didn't really like all that much. I really enjoyed circuits, signal processing, and computer architecture. 

I haven't really enjoyed my CS classes all that much, but I like programming for my own projects (when there is a goal created by me that needs to be accomplished.)

I have a 3.7/4.0 GPA, internship experience at JPL, Tesla, and Apple. I've worked in power electronics design, embedded systems, and more general analog design. 

This quarter I can't bring myself to be interested in anything I'm studying. I'm taking a feedback control class (normally this kind of stuff is interesting to me) but it's just not doing it for me. In fact, nothing about school at the moment is appealing. I can't concentrate on my schoolwork and I have no desire to do it. I sleep through my early classes and don't bother to attend my later ones. This is the first quarter that this is happening. I've never thought that I was ""above"" the system, but now it feels like I'm learning nothing useful. This is interesting because I have industry experience, so I know what it's all being taught for.

I'm upset because I want to leave the opportunity for grad school open (with my GPA my school will just let me do grad school as an extra year, no GRE or application) but I don't know if this (lack of drive in academics) is a temporary thing or not. A lot of engineers have told me it means that it's my time to get out of school and jump into industry. 

At the same time, I'm working on proof of concept for a personal software project (not a mobile app..lol) that is looking to be very promising...so much so that I've thought about dropping a couple of my classes to work on it since I don't want to wholly drop out of school. I actually think that my partners and I can turn this into a lucrative product. However, it's my first venture and I've never taken a risk like this. So my thoughts are oscillating between concentrating on enjoying school and some activities on the side, or doing OK in school, very few activities, and going all in for my startup. I've been trying to do everything but I realize for my venture to succeed I need to put in more quality work, which naturally means more time. I understand that probability of failure is extremely high so I'm prepared for that.

All I want to do is read books that sound interesting to me, go explore new places in nature, and travel. I'm just really bored with the school routine. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What should I do about my startup? 

I'm thinking that if I'm sick of school as a 3rd year, grad school is probably a dumb idea...but then in my head I tell myself ""it's only one more year..""

Any input appreciated!"

I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice.  I am doing an internship at a company in their IT department.  I have been tasked with fixing bugs in an online dashboard that they have developed for one of their clients. I have tried several different things and feel very confused at the moment. Anyhoo, here are the details:

It is a dashboard that is suppose to run 24/7 displaying progress reports for shifts,  on the dashboard there is a dropdownbox, where it displays the current shift and options for previous shifts that the user can choose from,  input is not required from the user (but is an option), the dashboard ""plays"" through different departments with appropriate reports.  One of the requirements is that this dropdownlist and accompanying data must switch over to the next shift, x amount of minutes before the next shift starts (depending on the department).  

I have looked through the code and tried to figure out as much as possible, and noticed that it generates a schedule from a webservice, however, this schedule only includes the latest shift and previous shifts, I am thinking that it needs to also supply details of the next shift, so there is something to compare the current time to in order to ""tell"" the site to switch over to the next shift.  Can anyone tell me if this sounds correct and if so, does anyone have an idea of how to implement this?

Thanks in advance!"

Low gpa with interesting research!,brianpark33,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4fzrjf/suggestions_of_what_path_to_go_low_gpa_with/,"Hey guys! Its my first time posting but a long time lurker! I hope you guys read this and give me any advice, or opinion about my situation! I am getting ready to finish my sophomore this year (ChemE Maj). I have done great freshmen year (gpa=3.57)! But with summer and first semester of sophomore year, I fell into a lazyness slump. Ended up getting around 1.5 the first semester which made my overall gpa 2.77. I have been trying to work harder second semester but thermo, fluid flow, and calc3 are not easy classes to get As.. I am definitely clawing my eyes and brains out for this mistake. But I am hopeful in other areas. I have been working on a research with a prof who has not gotten a tenure contract yet (he will be evaluated in two years when i graduate with bachelors!). I have not published any papers yet but i have a project that I am now going to work on and this project is contracted with an army. My prof said that this work will be so good since army is showing interest in it that i will be able to publish multiple papers and get into phd and finish it in two years if I work hard. My prof is really good at motivating students and I do not know if this work will really bring me that dream. I am hoping that he will get a tenure and he will pick me to work with him for my phd and have my life planned out but with my current gpa and situation, i don't know if this is good idea to have myself go to this path. I have thought about getting an internship in summer of junior year if this project doesn't bring much hope (i know it will be hard due to my gpa). Or just go travel and try start up business lol. I know I still have some time to bring my gpa up but i doubt that i can bring it up really high since ChemE major with Bio concentration is not easy.. Any advices or opinions about this proj with an army or prof or anything?? Thanks!!! "

I'm graduating with bach. degrees in Physics and Computer Science in upstate NY. I live around the capital district and have received an offer of 48K for the first year. Considering what's posted to glassdoor and indeed, this seems very low. The area I live in is economically all-American. Very average in terms of both median income and cost of living. I have been thinking that the indeed salaries are skewed higher because CS grads typically go towards big cities which also have higher costs of living.

Anyway, is 48K too little? I have an internship and 2 research projects under professors at my school in machine learning in cloud computing, databases, etc. I have interviews scheduled for late next week but they might demand a response earlier."

Not to sound conceited, but I go to a decent school, and am the top in nearly all my classes. I applied to over 150, got a few( like barely any) interviews and then all those turned into nothing. Ive been to so many career fairs, and those are barely any better than online applications now, because half of them just give you information on how to apply online. 

I understand that it can be my fault for a lot of it, and I have been working on improvement, but so many companies are looking for like experts for an intern. One of my interviews was entirely about Java when it wasn't even listed on my resume.

I'm fed up with the process, and how a basic internship requires expertise in areas.

4g1prs,31,2016-04-22,Motorhead,mikeking29,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4g1prs/motorhead/,"I was a senior in college and just about to graduate. My apartment was nice, but a little too spacious for me. My roommate was away for a couple months on an internship, so I was left with a two bedroom, two bath, two balcony apartment with a full kitchen, huge living room, and large dining area. 

It doesn't sound extremely extravagant, but when you're a college student eating baked beans and stale bread for 60% of your meals, it's a freaking palace. 

So I was alone in this place. I lost some bad habits, like binge drinking, which my neighbors gleefuly picked up, leaving me neighborless most nights as they would travel to the bars a mile away, to my delight. But I also picked up some bad ones of my own, like chain smoking cigarettes with the windows closed and chasing it down with a pot of morning blend coffee and amphetamines. The formula for figuring out what to do post-college.

I had stayed up for an unimpressive two days before I actually even tried to sleep. I don't remember what time it was, but it was dark. I woke up at 3:33am to my phone ringing. The caller i.d. says ""unknown."" I don't pick it up, turn the ringer to silent and go back to sleep, because nobody calls at that time unless they're playing a stupid prank.

The next morning, I see that I have 4 missed calls from ""unknown"" and one voicemail. So I check my inbox and all there is is a 20 second voicemail of static. Again, I assume it was a stupid prank or somebody trying to scare me.

The rest of that day was spent nursing the inevitable dopamine and serotonin hangover from the past couple of days. Every time I walked in my room that day, however, I got a really uneasy feeling like something bad was going to happen. Since my roommate left, I started sleeping wherever I felt like was a good spot. So that night I decided to sleep in the living room. 

My mood seemed better in that room anyways, and after a good hearty meal, I sat down on my couch, smoked a cigarette, then fell asleep.

Again, 3:33am my phone rings. I grab it from the end table and see that the unknown caller is dialing me again. Again, I silence it. But then I see that I have 8 missed calls. I check the log, and between when I fell asleep (around 11) and then, it was that same unknown number that called me. This time no messages.

Now I'm annoyed. Now I think that it's one of my stupid friends. How juvenile. How unoriginal. 
I decided to wait up this time and answer the phone so I could chew out the jerk off on the other end.
I really wish I hadn't picked up the phone, because when I did, my heart sank to the ground.
The static that I thought I'd heard on the voicemail was actually a man's voice, or something emanating from his throat. You know how if you scream into a receiver, it comes out distorted like a speaker being pushed too hard? That's what I heard and it was defeaning. It was louder than my phone can go, even on speaker. I couldn't understand what was being said, but I know that it was full of hate and anger. 

Now I thought it must be some creep with the wrong number trying to scare his ex girlfriend or some lame crap. So I hang up, startled, but mentally together. A minute later, it calls back and I pick up, defiantly yelling at it that it could either identify or severely screw itself. The person on the other end continued on over me. I said I was going to call the police. It stopped for a second, then it came back even angrier and louder than before. The best description of the voice is hysterically wrathful.
In all of my life, nobody has ever scared me over the phone, but at that moment, I was pale as a ghost. As it got impossibly louder, I firmly told it how immature it was acting, even though I was literally shaking. It was then that whatever it was began to enunciate a little more clearly and I could hear that he was saying the same thing over and over again, or some kind of variation. It wasn't intelligible, but purely belligerent cursing. There was a moment where all I heard was ""f*** you"" being yelled through clenched teeth, like when a dog barks with its jaw closed but its lips curled up. I didn't have to see it. I could feel it. 

I turned my phone off, lit a cigarette with my shaking hands, and waited desperately for the sun to rise.

I'm 20 and currently two years into a major in Information Systems and will be transferring to a different college back in my hometown with a degree in Management Information Systems which I intend to finish there. They're largely the same class wise and I'm moving back with my parents for financial and personal reasons. When I move back I'd like to find a job that is actually IT or computer related rather than food service like I've been doing since age 16. I've been steadily employed since I was 16 and also have a groundwork of self taught basic troubleshooting and repair skills. Namely having built 10-15 computers for various people and just basic troubleshooting experience over 5ish years. I also dabbled in some programming but it wasn't my strong suit. 


I have an unpaid internship under an IT director at a hospital already arranged. It is pretty relaxed it seems and as much as anything free labor for him and some experience for me. He said he would be happy to recommend me once my internship is up though and the amount of time involved seems largely up to me. The details aren't finalized yet but I at the very least have a start in something in the field. 


The problem is that I need money too, and want to find something that is preferably beneficial experience as well as paid. What should I be looking for? Help desk, computer repair shop, something else? I don't yet know what I want to do specifically in IT but I'm leaning more towards the technical hardware side with maybe something like networking. Part of me wanting to get experience is getting exposure to more than just fixing my friends computers for free. :)

I don't plan to start going into my master's immediately, but perhaps in Spring 2017 or even as late as Fall 2017.

I didn't have an amazing GPA (3.4) but mostly because I was involved in so many other things. I've had two internships at very well known companies (one of which occurred during the school year), I've done research with two professors, I was the president of my ACM student chapter, etc.

Anyway, I came across this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/3oglv2/whats_up_with_cse_masters_this_year/) and it sort of got my hopes down. Will getting into the Master's program be very difficult? A lot of the other threads I've been reading up on were on the CSE undergrad struggles.

2. What should I be wary of?

4g4vko,7,2016-04-23,"Four years of college, but no degree. Is mentioning my college record deceptive?",kira2120,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4g4vko/four_years_of_college_but_no_degree_is_mentioning/,"During my senior year of college pursuing a computer science degree, I ran out of money and decided to get an internship to enter the workforce. I applied to this position as a part time role, but after a few weeks, they demanded I work 45+ hours per week, meaning I had to drop out of school to focus on work.
    
  
  After that internship ended, I had a little money saved up, but not enough for college, so I got a great job doing full stack software engineering. I made sure that this company knew I was a dropout, but during their interviews I solved a few problems that stumped people with actual degrees, so they were completely fine with taking me on.
    
  
  That was 2 years ago. Now I just got a better job offer with a startup company, and I'm really excited about this position, because it's geared more towards solving computer science problems than it is just building web apps. But, my education years are listed on my resume, which may have implied that I finished school. Just yesterday, one of the employees asked where I went to school, and I immediately answered and then changed the conversation.
    
  
  Is this considered deceptive? My resume only lists the years I was at college, it doesn't mention a degree, and the ""education"" section of my resume is mostly geared toward education I took outside of school ( like agile courses, a web dev bootcamp, etc). I did answer quite a few difficult problems during the interview, and even optimized my answers, so skill is not an issue here. Did I deceive this company, and if so, what steps should I take to make it right?


  
EDIT: Thank you to the few commenters who actually answered the question. I understand many of you would rather encourage me to finish my diploma, but please note that I'm doing better salary wise than my all friends who did graduate (except for two who have rich parents). To any new viewers, please keep in mind this is a question of ethics, not ideas on how to finish my education."

These past few weeks have been super stressful. My friends (that frequently come to me for homework / project advice) all have internships or jobs going into summer, and I'm still struggling to find something. I already have prior experience (but that was just getting lucky through a family connection), and nobody at a career fair has even called me back until this month.

I've sent out maybe 50 applications this year, around 15 of them were from the last career fair, and I finally started getting calls and emails from employers over the past few weeks.

Whenever I do get an interview, I kill it. Absolutely kill it. This last one was 4 different interviewers across 6 hours, I answered around 9 technical questions, I got them all.

No job.

Like, how do I just not throw in the towel? There's that really dark voice inside my head that says my friends all got hired partially to meet those 'diversity' quotas, and that's why I get passed over so much (I'm an Asian male in computer science, we make up probably 80% of the field). I know I outperform them, just.. what is it? Is this just how the job hunt goes? Why would they spend time to interview me if I didn't have the skills they were looking for?

I have been with my current company since my senior year of high school. I won't go into specifics, but this company has slowly shifted from a friendly European company to a very capitalist and corporate atmosphere. In my location we do solely government work. We are contracted to be their on-site IT; networking, application support, server support, etc.

I have enjoyed working here, they brought me on as an intern and things took off from there. But, I am also a naïve teenager. I realized my value to my company recently. We host an annual event and I put in a lot of work towards it, but pretty much all I got was a thanks, and very little credit in the eyes of upper management. Anything that was prepared wrong happened to fall on my lap usually as something I ""overlooked"". There are also several individuals leaving and that have left, as the government contract is going to be renewed shortly, and their jobs could be cut-off or outsourced elsewhere to save money. 

In the past few months I've spoken with some individuals and talked to them about who I was, my age, my experience, etc. and it turned out they were recruiters and headhunters. I've gotten a few business cards and a lot of interest shown in me because of my youth and passion for the field, and their business card exchange is often followed by ""keep in contact with me"". I haven't really contacted any of them because I thought I had my college + several years after that figured out, but I'm starting to feel a bit worried if more people leave. The other issue that arises is paying for my school. I have a  decent salary for a 19 year old, but the company also offers paying back tuition expenses. I looked further into the fine print and they only offer a set amount per year, not semester. It would not cover a full year of school. On top of that I have to continue to work for them for 3 years after the payment is reimbursed, so if something happens to our contract and our company is forced out, I would be the one SOL and probably would be forced to relocate or reimburse them for the amount that was reimbursed to me. 

I guess I'm not sure what I should do. I'm at a crossroads and spoke to my parents about this, but they don't understand a degree is not 100% necessary in this field and that experience can get you a long way, with a degree being a compliment. I've thought so much about this, but am I wrong to reconsider my company position and moving elsewhere? We had a corporate guy come in a few months ago and he straight up said ""You should always be looking for better opportunity, we are a competitive company, but you need to do what is best for you"". But given my age I have no experience or no idea what I should when it comes to corporate politics. 

**TL-DR; Questioning if I should be contacting recruiters and looking for better options or stick out the contract process and hope everything works out. Feeling slightly used by corporate, and their constant decreasing of employee appreciation is making me question my employment. I am young and naïve, not sure what to do in my position.**"

Wall of text inbound, feel free to use the tl;dr.

So as the title mentions, I'm a 21 year old college student graduating in about 9 months and the whole ""real world"" talk and getting a job keeps me up at night.

As a preface, I'm a Junior at my state uni studying Economics with a minor in Computer Science. I'll be done with economics next semester so from here on out, it'll be Computer Science courses and electives.

I've very much enjoyed my time in college and think it's prepared me, but people always say ""Oh man, with that major and minor you'll have no problem getting a job!""....and I'd love to believe that.

I simply don't know what I would really do. I do computer science because I've built computers for a while and do some programming here and there, and for my Comp. Sci. electives. Also, I do economics because I took a keen interest in high school for it and do pretty well in my major. I just don't know what I would apply for, how to make a solid resume, how to make myself work-force presentable, etc.

My drive-home aspects on my resume would be that I took and passed Introduction to Econometrics with flying colors, which basically takes statistics, economics and calculus and uses it to run regressions and models with data. We used a software program called ""STATA"" which runs the regressions and whatnot, but that class was all about creating presentations and papers that brought the data down to an understandable level.

Along with STATA, I'm fluent in Microsoft Office, but isn't everyone? I feel like everyone and their mothers put that on their resume expecting companies to marvel at the fact.

My university allows us to count an internship as college credits if it's during our last semester before graduation, which I plan on doing with a consulting firm during my last semester. 

I guess I'm just worried about being financially stable, getting a job in such a hectic economy and applying the skills I've learned to a corporation who pays me to do so (given I'm hired by anyone).

Any advice from former econ majors or computer science majors, or people in any of the mentioned fields? Everyone always tells me that I'm going to make a ton of money and as much as I'd like to, I just don't know where to even start. I can supply any other info you might need. Thanks in advance!

Plenty of cons, but enough pros to where I would seriously consider this as a place to work after school. I'm currently almost guaranteed a full-time offer once I finish school.

However, I've made the decision to take a summer internship with another local company (company B), which means I will have to quit / give my two-weeks notice to company A before summer starts. I've spent a lot of time considering the two options, and feel that company B may be a better fit for me / more aligned with my interests. On top of that, the pay and benefits package for full time employees appears to be much better.

I'm on very good terms with company A and would hate for this situation of me ""trying out another company"" to ruin the relationship.  If for some reason I dislike company B / they don't give me an offer once I graduate, I really would like company A to still be an option. 

With that said, what's the best way to approach this situation? I will be graduating next March."

I had a few questions about the software industry. Firstly, I have heard two conflicting things: in order to be successful in the job hunt, it is necessary to have a B.S. and complete all the theory and intense classes (i.e. Operating Systems, Automata Theory, Compiler Design) but I also have heard a firm understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms is all that is necessary to be a successful software developer.

To the first point, many of my peers say that there is no point in getting a B.A., only the thorough B.S. Is worth it. However, isn't the most important thing in this field experience? If I were to obtain an internship and my peers who take on a heavy course load don't, wouldn't I be much better off? Especially if I get published twice, and they don't do anything except schoolwork. 

Would missing classes like Automata Theory, Compiler Design, and Operating Systems really hamper my success as a software developer that much?"

This may sound like a vast generalization, but almost all of my friends/acquaintances have better internships lined up for the summer, they are taking more difficult classes (and doing well in them), they have leadership positions in clubs/organizations on campus, and they have better social lives.

Meanwhile, I'm not involved in any organizations on campus (I got rejected from the ones I applied for), I'm barely getting by in the classes I'm taking, and I feel like I don't have many friends or people to hang out with.

this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I need help in my life and especially life advice from people who are more mature than i am. 

Little background: i am 21, from germany and currently studying hospitality management which i found pretty exciting at the beginning (first problem).

part of this course is that we have internships and study in at least one foreign country (the netherlands in my place). So I don't really have the chance to build up a social community and friends in a place that I am staying because I am only there for about 6 months before I move on to the next internship or university.

This has honestly become a huge problem for me in my life.. I feel pretty alone.. I am in a new place again for internship since last Sunday in a new city 600km away from my hometown. I have 6 or 7 really GOOD friends from my school days that come and visit me often even though i am like 600 km away from where they study and I really appreciate them and do not take their efforts for granted.

However I just feel lonely sitting here in yet another new big city with noone to talk to and no idea on what to do.. I do not like my studies anymore and realized that the service industry is just not my thing.. I do not want to smile at people when I do not feel like it and I do not want to spend my entire life working 12+ hours a day on new years eve and so on but I also do not want to quit my studies since I am only one year off of graduation and thought to myself that it was better to stick through it the last year and then have a bachelor's degree insted of having a ""gap"" in my CV which might lead a new boss to thinking i give up pretty fast. 

Now talking about my parents I have to say that I have the BEST parents I could imagine.. even though my dad is working an awful lot due to his position in upper management of a large german company, he always finds time for me and calls me every second day to check on me and ask how I am doing. He does all he can to fulfill my dreams, he makes high 6 figures per month and spends most of it to make my life enjoyable which i could not be more grateful for. He even cancelled his business trip last weekend to come and surprise me after I moved in because he thought I might feel lonely and I might need him to build up furniture etc. (he drove 600km from the south of germany up to the north just to see me for one day and cancelled all his business trips he would have had just to check on me).

Because my dad and also my mom are so lovely to me it is hard for me to tell them that I do not want to continue this course anymore because I am soooo afraid of disappointing them and because I wanted to show them that I am a strong person and that I pull through and graduate this course. I do not want to make my dad or mom question themselves and their decisions because they did the best they ever could. 

Now my dilemma on where I need advice is... should I finish my degree? (I highly think so because it is only one year left and then I have a bachelors degree)

Do you think I should pursue a career in hospitality even though I do not want to work in this field solely because I do not want these 3 years of study to go completely to waste?

After all I just realized that I am a person that absolutely needs social contacts which is just impossible in this field of hospitality industry where I have to move every year or even every 6 months. 

My biggest fear however is that my parents might feel disappointed in me because its a privat university which charges ~1k€ per month which results in ~36k€ in fees only for the university, living food etc excluded. Even though I know that money is no issue for my parents I kinda feel obligated to them to continue in this field and tell them that everything is alright because I want them to be proud of me sooo badly and am afraid of disappointing them by starting a new course after having finished this one. Even though I am pretty sure that they would never be disappointed in me because of how loving and caring they are and wanting me to suceed it is just such an inner fear and kinda pressure to make them proud of me and give back to them by sticking with career path I took, the hospitality industry which I personally dislike more and more each day.

I hope my English wasn't too bad and my sentences at least made a little bit of sense to you guys since it is not my first language.

I appreciate you and the time you took for reading my ""story"" a whole lot and would be more than thankful for advice ! :)

Best regards and have a beautiful sunday :)"
4g969u,15,2016-04-24,I am 22 years old. How do I get that point across to my overbearing parents?,Whinnie,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/4g969u/i_am_22_years_old_how_do_i_get_that_point_across/,"For context: I'm a Chinese female who moved about an hour and a half away from home at 18, with my parents' permission, to attend university (as well as to get away from them, but they don't know that). Since then, I've done the typical away-from-home student arrangement (live around school, come back for the odd weekends and holidays). With the exception of first year, I've managed to pay for all of my rent and over half of my tuition thanks to my school's internship program (you spend every other term working full-time); the remainder of the money comes from the RESP account my dad opened up for me when I was young, because if I don't use it for school then the money ""goes to waste"" (i.e., gets taxed). So for every withdrawal I end up giving my parents the majority of the money because I know from other people's experiences that money tends to be used as leverage for control in the future, and I don't want my parents -- who are more helicopter parents than the typical tiger parents -- to have any control in my life if I can help it. In short, I'd say I'm mostly independent and have the finances to be fully independent, which is a goal I'm hoping to achieve by the time I graduate from school next spring.

Now the problem is that I think my parents are starting to realize that I'm becoming independent, and yes, I'm sure it's scary realizing that your oldest child is growing up and becoming an adult, but the extent to which they've resisted the truth is ... kind of scary in itself. Our most recent fight (which is still ongoing) was about how I'm going to visit my new employer on Monday after work (doing two back-to-back internships) and my parents just couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that I don't want them to come with me. Their justification is that since they have a car it'll be easier to get around (except it won't, it only takes 15 minutes by public transportation, and they're going to have to drive for 45 minutes in traffic first) and then they can scope the area for apartments, and they don't mind going through the trouble and stuff, but I do. I can't remember the number of times I said ""no"" during that conversation ... MOM, WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORD NO?!

Please don't get me wrong. I do appreciate my parents' help when I need it (and they have definitely helped out during some dire times), but it's just like one other poster said here: my parents want what's ""best"" for me but they think they know what the ""best"" is better than I do. And I hate that. MORE CONTEXT:  Especially because growing up I've never been able to have a real conversation about anything with my parents because even to this day they've never listened to me and have always interrupted me when I try to speak up. I was never able to ask questions about religion because my mom would accuse me of being possessed by the devil (yeah, she's a real diehard Catholic). Nor was I ever able to ask any questions about sex or boys or relationships because ""they're just a distraction!!!"" and to this day I'm STILL not allowed to have a boyfriend (but yeah right, as if I'm going to obey that rule when my parents themselves have such an unhealthy relationship).

It all came to a head this morning when my mom walked into my room telling me to get up so we can go to church. I told her that they can just go without me because we've discussed this before, I hate when she drags me to Mass because then I'm not going to pray or go through the motions because I don't want to be there and she's only brooding my resentment for her and religion. (Not that I have anything against Catholicism personally.) I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back, because after that she started yelling about nonsense. Some good tidbits include:

* how I'm talking like I'm 32 or 42 (uh, what?) instead of 22 years old -- implying that people are just moving out of their parents' house when they're 32 or 42;
* how her and my dad can't believe how I'm acting as if I'm ""not a part of this family anymore"";
* how I surround myself with bad people and my friends are the most negative influence on my life (not like I haven't heard this one before);
* how if I'm acting like this now, what's going to happen to how I treat them when I ""become a doctor or a lawyer"" -- this one was super hilarious because my mom knows I've NEVER wanted to become a doctor (don't even have any prereqs for it) and that I certainly don't want to become a lawyer now that I know how bad the state of the legal sector is;
* how she and my dad should never have let me move away on my own for school (although I'm pretty sure that if I'd continued to live with them I would've killed myself already).

My mom also told me the other day, ""Until you and your sister get married, you guys are still MY KIDS and I will treat you as such."" So I laughed as if THAT'S ever going to happen (since she's never even let me date before and doesn't want me to date until I'M DONE AN MBA ...) and told her about the whole ""Asian parents don't let their kids date until after they get married"" and she actually ... thought ... that was a good thing.

So yeah. Any ideas? It seems like the more I try to break away and do things on my own, the more my parents try to swoop in and ""help"", but that only makes me want to get away even more ... And the more I try to prove my independence, the more my parents are convinced that I'm going to be one of ""those kids"" who totally forgets about their parents when they make it in the real world (not that their behaviour is acting like much of a deterrent for this). And although they hope that someday I'll be the ""CEO of a company"" with my OH-SO-IMPORTANT MBA, they're still treating me like a child, so I don't know how they think that's going to work?

I have hope that I can someday have a healthy, adult relationship with my parents like some of you guys here have managed to find. But right now I am filled with so much anger and resentment and I'm convinced that my only option for now is to go nuclear. Please help.

Last fall, at the age of 38, I graduated with my associate's degree from my local CC. In researching schools to transfer to, I became aware of a new program at a small state university at the other end of my home state.

It was an interdisciplinary major in social science, which was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike a lot of social science programs, this one allowed you to choose 2 tracks to concentrate in among the 6 social science disciplines offered. When I got in contact with the coordinator, we also discussed the new secondary education major that the school had launched. Turned out that with the planned curriculum changes, I was going be able to double major in social science and secondary education, and graduate within 3 years with certification to teach social studies and Spanish to grades 7-12.

In the past, those in the social science major who also wanted teaching certification were required to choose history as one of their 2 tracks, but lucky me, with the changes being implemented, that would no longer be the case - I was free to choose the disciplines that most interest me (in my case, political science and sociology or geography - a toss up).

YAY!!! I was going to get to study the things I am actually interested in, and then, when I was done with the degree, I would have an actual professional skill that would be very likely to quickly translate to a stable job with decent benefits - even if the pay is shitty for the work required. This was really important to me...I have lived basically hand-to-mouth my entire adult life, and I really wanted my college degree to insulate me from that a bit, especially since it has taken me so long to get here.

That was a year ago. I have since completed nearly all of the content courses required for the social science major, and have completed 2 of the education courses. A week ago, just prior to my advising appointment for next semester, I received an email from a professor in the education department I had never met informing me that I had been assigned to her as a new advisee.

Long story short...my advisor - the one who was making changes to the secondary education program - is terminally ill and has taken an indefinite leave of absence. In his absence, no further progress is being made on getting changes finalized to the new major, which means that the old rules still apply. Which means...that since history is NOT one of my 2 tracks, I am ineligible for teaching certification unless I essentially start half my concentration over again.

Fuck that noise. I have already dropped the teaching certification option from my program, and I wil now graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. in Social Science and double minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropolgy. So, as best I can tell, I have a few realistic options:

* federal/state government
* non-profit
* graduate school with an eye toward staying in academia

I'm OK with not using my degree to teach high school...I just want to be able to *use* it in some way. Before returning to school, I worked for state government for 8 years; I'd be happy to parlay that experience + my degree into something relevant. For example, I'd love to work in equal employment opportunity or fair practices, but no one can seem to give me any information about how to get a foot in the door with those jobs. I feel like there should be some kind of perfect internship opportunity here in my last year of school, but everyone I've talked to stares at me like a deer in headlights.

I'd also love to teach at the college level...I don't have so much ego that it needs to be a school with a recognizable name, but I don't want to be an adjunct indefinitely...because that's right back to the uncertainty and instablility that I've fought so hard to get away from. So should I go to grad school? Stop at the master's level and teach community college? Push through and get a PhD and hope against hope that I can find tenure track somewhere?

Other ideas appeal to me also...my pet issue is improving quality of life for GSM teens, so, as an off-the-top-of-my-head example, does the It Gets Better Project need a program assistant? Does that job pay enough for me to make rent? Again, I'm OK with not making a lot of money...it just needs to be enough to pay my rather modest expenses and leave a bit left over.

Any insight? Suggestions? Ideas I haven't thought of? I really appreciate any thoughts you might have to offer.

TL;DR: Was a double major in social science and secondary education. Recent events mean I can't get the teaching certification. What can I do with this degree that will make use of it and reliably keep a roof over my head?"

I mean, after all the crap they put you through Engineering school, would you just settle for ANY job? Know a few other horror stories from people who graduated with a degree in ME and were offered positions as draftsman making 12 bucks an hour!

I know one guy who graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering, no internships, below average GPA, he struggled a lot to find his first job(Don't know all the details) but now he works as an supervisor for a store that sells computers, similar to Best Buy.

Did I screw up the rest of my life?,HenemanRawl109,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4gay9q/im_fresh_out_of_college_without_any_internship/,"Hey there r/jobs. You probably see these posts a lot, but I was wondering if I could get some advice on what to do. I'm just really lost and scared about what to do now.

I'm 22. I graduated from a respectable public university in the US with a degree in chemistry. My entire life, I was a great student. I have great study habits, I spent hours at the library studying for tests and writing papers, and I have good grades.

My work experience is lackluster compared to my grades. Since the later half of 2014, I worked as a personal assistant to a facility manager. Even though I had this job, I didn't work very many hours and I barely did anything related to my studies. My job was primarily related to lab maintenance, rather than actually performing experiments and running tests using scientific instruments. I also have 2 years of volunteer experience at elementary schools and 3 months of retail experience. Even with all of this, I feel it's insufficient for finding a job right out of college.

I've tried to get an internship related to my degree since I was a sophomore. I've never even got an interview or a phone call. I've tried to get research experience under a professor or a grad student. No one has given me a chance.

I've been applying to jobs for the last 4 months. After submitting countless applications, I've only gotten 3 responses, all of which offered no prospects of a job. I've tried looking at internships as well, but all of the ones I've seen want me to be enrolled in school.

My lack of success has caused me to consider ditching a job related to my chemistry degree altogether. I've considered a career path in technology/IT, but I barely know anything about it. The fact that I feel demoralized by the job search and I now have no idea what I want to do with my life make me want curl up into a ball and cry. I feel like I wasted the last 4 years of my life.

What on earth am I supposed to do? I'm just so lost. How am I supposed to at the very least get by in life?"

I get than animation is hard and expensive. Yeah, but, that's why the channel was created! To give independent, hard working animators a platform to share their work! Not clickbait conspiracy theory bullshit facts that take less than a day to make and edit!

Tomorrow, I have to choose between going to Georgia Tech for its Masters in BioID (Biomedical Innovation and Development) program, or continue at my current State School for my MS in BME. In your experience, would it be better to get my MS, or take the plunge for the specialized Masters? For reference, I am interested in manufacturing / QA / regulatory affairs as it relates to biomedical engineering (BME). 

The pros and cons I have right now are as follows:

*GTech:*

**Pros:**

* Higher ranked school

* Better networking connections / career fairs

* Program has 100% job placement (it's only been around two years, however)

* No thesis

* Industry Focus

* 1 year


**Cons:**

* Very expensive (&gt;60k total)

* Requires full relocation (expensive)

* Not a true ""Master of Science"" degree

* May not be technical enough degree

* I do not have prior industry experience

* Program is VERY new

* Programs like these known to be used as revenue generators 



*State University*:

**Pros:**

* In-state tuition (&lt;30k for whole degree)

* Close to home, no relocation

* Traditional MS, courses build on technical hard science

* Can get PhD in future if necessary (job growth)

* No need to rebuild entire new network base, just build on existing

* Familiar, friends, girlfriend is here :)

Additionally, I am nearly guaranteed (knock on wood) an internship that pays right above $20/hr during the school year if I stay and do my MS at my current state University. 

**Cons**:

* Program not as high ranked (although still above average)

* Thesis-based, need to find advisor and conduct research (I do not enjoy academia)

* 2 years

* Research may not be relevant to industry

* Job not guaranteed

We have a server room with a Windows SBS, Barracuda Backup and Archiver, ASA Firewall, and some other switches and what not. My role is pretty simple... I am the ""in house"" IT guy.

The people here are beyond nice and don't expect much out of me, so helping people is very rewarding when I succeed. It's a great atmosphere to work in and everyone is friendly and helpful.

The thing is we use an external IT management group that oversees our server and basically ALL of our equipment/computers/switches at the office. If anything goes wrong, one email or call to them they will be able to get a technician to remote in or fix the problem. Although this is very helpful to me, it does somewhat take away from my role here. They are like my lifeline.. I learn a lot from them but at the same time they are the real ""IT guy's"" while I am kind of just the office helper, if you get what I am saying.

Some days though, with the office being small and some people work from home, it gets a little slow and I find myself almost looking for stuff to do.

My question is... has anyone been in this same situation as me and can help me out? I want to stand out and prove to them I can make a change. The managers\assistants are super nice and basically let me control my own destiny. I can propose projects, ideas, basically anything and they will listen... they want me to adapt and grow with their company.

That said, I thoroughly enjoy programming and have made quite a few applications and have worked on several large-scale software apps for internships before. I can understand and use design patterns and most OO principles. I just never had to use anything beyond an array(list), (hash) map, or the occasional queue or linked list in my projects, and I definitely didn't have to analyze its efficiency.

So when it comes to technical interviews, where I'm being tested on DS and algos, I end up struggling a lot. If the solution calls for a recursive algorithm, I know I can do it... but it would take me 45 minutes instead of 15.

**TL;DR**: 

1. How do I make myself strong enough in DS/algorithms to ace interviews?
2. How do I make myself *enjoy* studying DS and algorithms?
3. Are there any resources (books, online courses) you feel is the *best* resource for brushing up on these topics?"

Currently I'm in city college working on getting an associates degree in computer science, many people I know have told me, and I feel like an associates degree with computer science would be just fine. As long as you work hard and know what you're doing. 

My goal is to get that associates degree, and then take an ORACLE course that will give me a certificate for more experience on my resume, and hopefully land an internship after, and so on. 

Do you guys think it would be totally normal to get an associates degree instead of a bachelors for computer science, there is so much information online, that I feel like going to a university for an extra 2 years would be a waste of time.

As any astute redditors will find, this is a ghost account, and I've changed names that would link the two. I'm aiming to have this told in 4-6 parts, so bear with me.

**The Intro**

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT. 

Details have been altered for readability, names have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty, and any similarities found to real events are *completely* unintentional. 

Our cast of characters:

* Myself: fresh college grad and PFY

* Susan: HR and classmate from college

* Dave: Owner of Orangered IT

* Jack: Senior support tech

* Arnold: Support tech manager, ex-Army Drill Sergeant (unconfirmed)

* Randy: Developer

* Jim: Security specialist

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part I**

I'd interned with a security group in Orangered for two weeks while I was finishing college, and got along great with the team and was quite happy when they said to apply for an opening in another team when I finished my degree. 

I was a naive, poor college graduate, finally getting out of retail and excited to get to work with something I enjoy. I put in my 2-week notice to my previous employer and had some paperwork to sign once I was on site for my first day. The phone interview went well, and I was ecstatic that I would be getting a living wage finally! I was a little worried I might not like my new team, but the wage increase and the work was too much of an improvement to my situation not to leap towards.

A frigid February Monday morning found me sitting in the HR office with the company owner (Dave) and our HR gal (Susan). I'd been referred to this company by Susan, as she had been taking some general Ed classes at the same school as me and we'd worked on a few group projects. This was the first I'd met Dave, and he came across strongly. 

We reviewed workloads, after-hour support, expected schedules and tasks. Finally, I was given the official offer letter to sign. I saw the rate, which was SIGNIFICANTLY lower than what was said over the phone interview. I inquired about it, and Dave smugly said it was the standard rate given for a 3-month period for new employees. After the first three months, I would get a raise (which would put me over the stated rate on the phone, not at). Things didn't seem to add up to me, but I'd already left my previous job, I didn't have it in writing, and if nothing else this gives me some experience in my field. I reluctantly agreed. 

&gt; Hey dummie, you didn't get *that* in writing either. 

Susan walks me over to my desk, and mentions Dave can be 'tough to the new guys'. I've still had the excitement stolen from me, literally and figuratively. Here I meet my new 'team': Jack, our senior support guy in his mid-40s whose been with the company for its entire 7ish-year life. He's munching on crackers as he tries to say 'Hello' and waves.

Susan says that, though Dave is the owner, I would be working with Jack daily and I'd report weekly to Arnold, the support manager, but he was out due to car troubles but would arrive soon. I figured, after I got into the group and showed promise things would get better.

Jack had gotten a tower setup with my domain account and an IP phone on my desk that was dark. Cracker crumbs are all over. He had a post-it not with my password on the monitor, and I logged in. 

&gt; Wait, this wasn't set to *have* to be changed at first login? And they're giving me domain admin rights on my main account instead of a separate one?

Next, I find the real issue: no Internet. I ask Jack if the network is down, and he says it's fine. I take a closer look at my new desk and find the network jack -&gt; IP phone -&gt; tower, but there is a rollover cable being used instead of a straight-through. A quick swap and I'm online. 

&gt; Is he *testing* me?

Afterwards, Jack decided he'd show me the building, have me meet the other workers: there was our support team of just us, two security teams and a single developer for an internal software tool, with a few extras for managerial positions like HR, Accounting, and a dedicated Training Coordinator. At this point, it was about lunchtime and Jack treated me to a local restaurant I'd not been to. 

As we returned, I saw a guy ride into the lot on a motorcycle. Remember, this was a freezing day in February, snow still on the ground. This guy came in, black leather jacket and bald head with no helmet, goatee. Typical pissed-off look. Due to the weather, his whole head was purple. Jack waved, ""Hey Arnold!""

Though he looked really intimidating, Arnold was really respectful and said his car had broken down on the way here. He only had his motorcycle, and there was aISP changeover happening today he had to be here for. 

&gt; Well, I'm still not confident Jack knows his stuff or is messing with me. Probably best to do it yourself.

It is clear he's the real network administrator here, and was the one who set up the organization's infrastructure. He showed me the unlocked server room, where we had a few dedicated servers and four other dedicated client servers onsite across a couple of racks. A battery backup for the client servers is connected, but laying on the floor instead of mounted in a rack with everything else, even though there's plenty of room.

&gt; This room was unlocked. THIS ROOM WAS UNLOCKED!?!?!

He tells me I'll mostly be doing remote support for Healthcare client, among a few other clients, and there's a lot of legal material to read through. I'm to spend the rest of today and tomorrow reading through that, and then I can help with the ISP changeover midweek.

*Flash forward*

I've finished reading through HIPAA, and am asked to work my first ticket. A nurse lost a file. Simple enough, I just need to know where this file was located, or a file name, and I can do a restore, right?

* Client network is on a separate network, which I do not have credentials for.

* Nurse needed it yesterday, client is in office waiting for it. 

I call, and try to get some background on it. Nurse was on her work PC, opened an excel sheet from Outlook and was working in it. She kept hitting Save, and closed it. She went back to the email when the client arrived, tried to open it and found none of her work saved. 

&gt; Thank the Dark Lord their server is offsite. 

Since I'd just been given the account and wasn't familiar with this client's network, more creative measures were needed: I found the temporary storage Outlook uses, and there was a temp file of the spreadsheet she had been working on. I was able to copy it to her network drive, renamed, and worked fine. Ticket closed, client is happy.

End of day, I receive an email from Dave: 

'This file was not backed up per our standard procedure. Investigate root cause and test backups.'

I am a high school student who is about to graduate high school. I love toying with electronics so I'm fairly sure some sort of Electrical/Computer Engineering is what I want to do. As of now I've narrowed it down to two colleges: The University of Arkansas Fayetteville, and Hendrix College, but I'm unsure of which I should go to.

At Hendrix I would be playing a sport and enrolled in the 3-2 program because they don't offer engineering; I would have to choose to go between Vanderbilt, Wash U in St. Louis, or Columbia University for my last two years. From what I've heard they have had a student (from Hendrix) get accepted for internships with Google and Amazon. 

At the University of Arkansas, I wouldn't be playing a sport, however I would get my engineering degree in 4 years because they offer engineering. I'd be rooming with classmates from school who will be going into different fields.U of A hosts an annual job fair for freshman through senior that include a large variety of employers (apparently even Google as been attending from what the UofA rep said).  

I love my sport and I would put all my time and energy (when I am not studying) playing for Hendrix, but at the same time I understand that I probably wont be going any farther than college, so I can live with my senior year as my last year to play. 

I just want to be put in the best situation to succeed as an engineer, but between these two schools, I'm not sure which one would be best for me."

So I applied and interviewed for an internship for a large agency a while back. Three weeks ago, they emailed me saying that they'd narrowed down their selection of interns and that the background check would be the final step in the selection process, which would be conducted by HR. So, I sent the completed background check form to my main interviewer on April 6th. I thought the check would take around a week, and then we could finalize the dates and salary for the internship. Well, it's been nearly three weeks and I still have no confirmation about the background check. I did follow up last Wednesday at the 2-week mark asking about the progress, and I got a response a few minutes later that he'd check with HR (still haven't heard back about that yet).
I was just wondering what my course of action should be at this point. I'm interning in NYC starting in late May (hopefully) so I need to secure the dates so that I can finalize housing. I'd like to be able to discuss the details of the internship with my supervisor soon just so I can get my plans ironed out. And my records are clean, so I'm almost certain they won't find anything that'll elicit a rejection. Is there a way I could ask my supervisor to at least finalize dates with me? Or should I try contacting HR directly? Or just wait it out? Any advice would be be appreciated!"

4gh6s8,14,2016-04-26,he can keep his money - Part I,deathloser,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4gh6s8/he_can_keep_his_money_part_i/,"I've been a gynecologist for 15 years and I have never seen a case like this before.

In fact, ever since this happened, I have been reconsidering my line of profession. I know what you're all thinking; ""What fucked up vagina did she see to make her quit like that?"" As professionals, doctors don't respond to crude party jokes like that. I have no idea really why I'm telling this story, but I can't stop thinking about it. I'm hoping somehow things can be worked out in my head if I write them down.

That day, some of my interns were helping me out in the office. I had a private practice at that point, and one of my guys was filing some documents behind the counter. At this point in my career, we were extremely busy. We had patients coming in and out, and I'm guilty enough to say that might not have been the best medical technique. Anyway, Abdul hands me a folder.

""I referred a friend of mine to you. I'm not sure if that how you do it here, but she really needs your help... She heard I was working here and begged me to get her an appointment ASAP."" He blurted all this out, very sincerely. He just started working there a few weeks prior, so he must have been nervous to ask for a favor. However, Abdul was a great worker who I looked forward to working with.

The way he said ""she really needs your help"" immediately struck me... But I couldn't find a reason not to see her. To be honest, I was also just ready to satisfy my curiosity.

""Oh, really? Do you know what her concern is? Is it extremely urgent?"" I opened the folder and examined her paperwork. 

""She should just tell you herself."" Abdul shut the drawer and started towards the waiting area. 

I was in the examination room when a couple entered; a tall young man and a young woman with him. They were both extremely good-looking. Like a perfect pair. They were smiling and offering handshakes.

""I'm Rob, thanks so much for seeing us,"" the handsome man gripped my hand.

""Katie. We are so lucky to see you."" The young woman gave a tight-lipped smile. I offered them seats as I clicked my pen above my clipboard. Since the two of them came in together, I kind of expected what this would be about.

""We're trying to get pregnant,"" Katie said, becoming tearful. ""We haven't had any luck, and we've been trying..."" She started to lose her composure, so Rob took over.

""We were wondering if you could let us know of any other options."" He started to rub her back to comfort her. 

This lady seemed so desperate to have a baby RIGHT NOW. Katie started weeping quietly as I started going over the basics of assisted reproductive technology. Of course, we would have to figure out which method was best after examining the both of them. 

""There could be a million different causes,"" I started. ""From low sperm count to blocked fallopian tubes. We could start with some non-invasive tests to figure out the issues.""

Then Katie got up. Rob seemed a bit surprised, but stood up too as she said, ""Okay, thank you so much for your time... We will keep all that in mind."" This all was in less than ten minutes as this girl was booking it out of there. 

""Hold on, we can start with some examinations right now,"" I tried to catch up with her, but I felt too dismissed to take it any further. They paid the co-pay and got out.

Abdul brought it up later. ""Thanks for helping me, doctor.""

I wanted to say that I didn't do a single thing, but I was over the whole thing. I took on the next stream of patients.

I forgot about the whole thing until about two months later, I got a personal letter mailed to the office. It was strange, because I never get things like that. Inside was a note from that couple, announcing to me that they were pregnant. They wrote that they were so thankful for my help, and that they'd name their first-born after me.

This was all really fucked up. First of all, I wasn't even a fertility specialist. Secondly, I literally did NOTHING to help them. I wouldn't have even remembered them if it wasn't for how abruptly and rudely they left. Abdul found the letter before I threw that shit out, saying ""Doctors really do make a difference..."" wistfully. 

The next day, he comes into my office and hands me the phone. I don't really take phone calls like that - making appointments goes through the secretary. If he was giving it to me, it must have been important.

""Doctor ---- speaking,"" I tucked the phone between my cheek and shoulder as I sifted through paperwork.

""Hi doctor, it's me, Robert ----. Do you remember me from a few months back?"" His voice was much less optimistic than I last heard.

I put my pen and papers down and took the phone into my hand. I just felt really exasperated for some reason.

""Of course! What can I do for you?"" 

""Well, I was wondering if you got our letter...""

""Yes, I did. Congratulations, Mr. ---, I wish the best for your new family.""

""Right. So, Katie took a pregnancy test and it came out positive. Her belly has gotten a bit bigger, but the thing is, there's no way I can be the father."" He sighed into the phone, hard.

This is what he wanted a personal phone call about? 

""There are several options for paternity testing--""

""No, no, I don't mean like that. I mean like, we've never had sex."" 

He paused to let that sink in, but I didn't really get at what he was saying at all. I was just a doctor - just look at people's bodies and talk to them about that. They never had sex? 

""I don't really understand--"" 

""Look, I don't really want to be a part of this anymore. Good luck."" Click. I tried to ask him what the fuck he was talking about but he hung up. 

I sat there staring at the wall, looking like an idiot until Abdul came back in and took the phone. He said solemnly, 

""Katie is here for the ultrasound.""

I didn't even KNOW I was scheduled to give this lady one. But here we are in the ultrasound room of the downstairs radiology clinic, she's on the gurney, waiting for me. Abdul observes quietly in the corner of the dark room as the technician, Abby, kindly informs her of what's gonna go down. Katie looks giddy at her first experience. I wondered if she knew about the call Rob just gave me. Things were getting more and more strange. 

Abby, the sweet lady she is, asks Katie a whole bunch of questions about what she wants to name the baby, and all that shit as she gels her belly.

She explains how ultrasound is completely noninvasive, and how it's not that hard to become a technician. Katie bullshits back at her, saying that she came from Providence and moved up here to be with Rob and her ailing parents. She says Rob is the best man she's ever been with and is so happy that he is her baby's father. Abby smiles in passive listening, sliding the wand over her abdomen.

I can't see the sonogram at this angle, but I can see Abby's smile fall faster and faster. She adjusts the wand and the ultrasound over and over, squinting her eyes at the screen. My chest starts to tighten because I've never seen this happen before.

She finally set the wand down, and asked in a forced-composure voice, ""Doctor, can I speak with you outside for a moment?"" Abby looked up at me gravely. She got up and waited for me in the hall before I could even answer.

""What's going on?"" I asked in hushed urgency.

""Laura, that's not a baby.""

""Of course it's not a baby - it's not even three months yet.""

""No, I'm telling you. You KNOW what I mean. Act normally, and look at the sonogram again.""

We went back in, and there was Abdul, listening to Katie's useless cheerful baby banter. She chatted insistently at him as he closed his eyes, arms crossed. Abby turned my attention to the screen and pointed, as she shifted the wand.

There was no mistake of it. I had seen this kind of image when my dog was sick. Rocco would get into the garden and swallow anything that would fit in his mouth. I looked over and over again. I was 100 percent, completely certain of it. This woman's stomach was bulging, full of rocks. 

I didn't understand it at all. I tried not to panic, and realized this woman must be completely insane. I rushed took her upstairs again to have a pelvic examination. Was she forcing them up inside herself? 

Katie was starting to sense my urgency. She also grew a little concerned. Was she fucking faking it? 

""Is my baby okay?"" She put her ankles up on the stirrups. There was no baby. There was never a baby. I was playing back Rob's phone call in my head: 'Good luck', he said. He doesn't want to be a part of this anymore?

Then, I was fucking shocked. I looked between her legs with the light shining on her, and I shit you not, I almost fucking fell over. This Katie had a fully formed, anatomically normal penis attached to her pelvis, right over her testicles. She was absolutely in no way a hermaphrodite or Intersex either, as I mustered the composure to investigate further. 

I'm in no way biased against anyone who is transgender, cross-dressing, or anything of that sort. As a doctor, I hold myself to a non-discriminatory standard. But to not have a vagina or uterus, and pass as pregnant with a stomach full of stones? I was beside myself. She should have been in extreme pain, and in the emergency room. Katie just kept pleading for me to let her know what was going on. I rushed out and snatched the phone.

He picked up on one ring. ""I should have told you freaks to stop calling me.""

""What kind of sick joke is this?"" I was so angry. They were wasting my time and killing themselves over it. ""Are you in on this? Did you set her up to do this to herself?"" We are not allowed to talk to people about our patients, but this woman seemed mentally ill - it could turn criminal, and I was so angry.

""Listen, I told you before, I'm out. Oh, and tell that Indian weirdo he can keep his money.""

I am a computer engineering student in Europe, and throughout my studies (5 years) I need to perform three internships. My first one was in a 3D and VR apps startup in my local area, I've been there for 3 months. Now I need to perform a 6 months internship and I need to make a choice. 
My dream career is to be a software engineer in the US, and I think what big companies will look at first in my resume is my experience.
I have found two internships yet: 
Web developer in Seoul.
Software Dev in my local area. 

I really want to go to Seoul because I have friends there and I want to experience the life there. Also, as my dream job is abroad, it could be a nice experience in my resume to have worked in Asia. 
On the other hand, it's web development. It is not very technical, and I won't learn a lot. I have learned about web Dev on my free time when I was younger and already have used the tools I need to use for this internship. I'm over qualified for this internship.
The software dev one will teach me a lot of things and I'll write in my resume that I used the languages I'm currently learning, etc. 
The salary of the internship doesn't really matter.


So here's my question (tl;dr):
What would you chose between: 
- A challenging internship near your home when you want to leave your country 
- A not very challenging internship in South Korea, but a country you really want to go live in for a couple of months and shows on your resume you're ready to work anywhere?

Thanks for your advices, and your stories (if you have any) of how your internship changed your career!"

**WHO THE HELL?**
My name is Moath Lowahi, I am a 18 years old game developer(-wannabe) and a hobbyist game designer from Morocco. I started programming at the age of 12. I have a big passion for video games, AI and computer graphics. Since I'm from a traditional Moroccan family, my parents didn't supported me to go further in this field, so I had to teach myself making games relying only on the free content available on the Internet, mainly: tutorials, devlogs and opensource game projects. Trial and error played an important role in the learning process.
I do game engine programming, graphic programming (OpenGL), AI programming and general programming. I use mainly c/c++ (My favorite programming language) and python. Additionally, I know javascript, lua and a bit of java. I use Visual Studio to make games and software. I prefer data driven architecture over object oriented paradigm (Something I learned the hard way). I made a video game entirely in c++ using OpenGL (link: https://moathmakesgames.itch.io/retroarcadeshooter) (some may consider this a shameless advertisement, so I would like to apologize in advance). Arabic is my native language, I speak both English and French (and a bit of German...).

**WHY THE HELL?**
As there is no university or institutes here, in Morocco, that provides an advanced formation for young gamedevs(again: -wannabes), (or there is?) studying abroad (in Europe) seems to be the only valid option if I want to continue in this domain. However, I will not be able to do such thing without any fund/income source, such as a part-time job, internship or a scholarship.

**WHAT THE HELL?**
I submitted this thread seeking both your advice and any helpful information you (dear reddit-er) can provide me with in term of scholarships, universities/colleges where working and studying is a an option for someone with my (very) humble skills... or anything that works! seriously..

**THE CONCLUSION.**
Finally, this thread should be useful not only for me, but for many student out there who are in the same situation. And, of course, Thank you for your attention and your time.

With love,
*Moath*"

I have already graduated college with a B.S. and plan to get a PhD. I have already enrolled in a PhD program starting in the Fall of '16.

My company does random drug tests. The company is a decent size and my stay is only 6 or 7 months so I rolled the dice and smoked weed anyways. I got called for a random piss test yesterday (yep Monday after 4/20, who knew) and surely I failed (did not get results back yet).

I am particularly good with numbers and have proved myself to be extremely valuable. I am seen as a well above average employee. I solved an issue in 4 months that has been going on for over a year. I am worth WAY more than I am paid and I'm aware of this. I went to my boss and told him I failed a piss test and will most likely be fired.

My boss went to the head of the department (who has seen my work and respects me) to see if theres anything that can be done. Even though a failed piss test is automatic termination, the head of the department said he would try and convince others that I should be excused as I am simply a college kid crunching numbers on a computer all day (and I was planning on leaving in july anyways) - rather than a factory worker who could potentially injure someone.

I am unsure what will happen as I'm waiting for the higher ups to discuss. I'm ok with losing my job as I will just move to graduate school - I'm financially fine. The company actually needs me more than I need it.

If I do get fired - can I request to be allowed to resign on my own? That way I don't have to tell future employers I was fired in the past or have to cover it up. Should I just quit now to save myself from being fired? Is it possible to quit seconds before you are fired? This is a small company that I will never require a reference from, however, its the only company I ever worked for. The company does not do work in the area of research I will pursue in graduate school.

Interestingly, I am presenting my project to the company in two weeks - so it will be very damaging if I am let go before then. I think this makes them a little hesitant to fire me as well.

I'm in a weird place mentally, any advice or words would be very appreciated. I know smoking weed when I'm under a random drug test scenario is stupid but hey, I'm just living my life ya know?"

I have both a tech background and a liberal arts background. I moved into the Denver area when I went to grad school. Now I'm done with school, with a master's degree in public administration, and a GIS certificate. I took a GIS class to keep my tech chops up, and liked the field enough that I went and got the certificate. Maps are cool, and geospatial analysis is even cooler!

I already have a little GIS job experience, in the form of a research assistantship, an internship with the Sierra Club and a capstone with the City and County of Denver, where I've used my GIS skills.

On top of that, I have about five years in IT, working at places like Hewlett Packard, doing things from helpdesk &amp; tech support work to software development. I specialized in Linux programming, so I have a lot of experience with Linux (I've worked with Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Suse), as well as C, C++, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash and other Unix shells, and PHP. I've also been working on my database mojo, having worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL mostly, though I've had the chance to tinker with Oracle. What's really fun is putting GIS extensions into these databases to give them map mojo (PostgreSQL + PostGIS...) I've worked freelance here and there putting together WordPress/LAMP stack web sites, mostly for little state and local election campaigns and nonprofits.

Part of what drove me back to school was because before, when I just had the computer science degree, I ended up in software testing/QA work, and got a resume full of testing/QA work, which got really tedious and burned me out. Let's just say I want to do my coding on other types of work.

Here's the thing. I've been in school for the past few years, instead of being a full-time coder, but now that I'm out, with some new letters after my name, I'm looking to get back in the business. So, If you need a GIS, WordPress, or Linux developer, shoot me a PM and I can send you a resume.

In the meantime, take a look at my portfolio website at http://dougholland.com/. It's an example of the kinds of WordPress sites I've put together for clients, and it has my master's capstone project and some examples of my GIS work."

Thank you for sending your CV to _____. She forwarded it to me and a look at it revealed that you have very interesting experience.

&gt;With your permission, I would like to keep your CV for future reference. Also, please feel free to send me updates of your CV, should you gain additional work experience in C++ and Python.


  Some background for myself: I'm a sophomore studying computer science and sent a letter applying for an internship for this summer. I am studying C++ in school in Data Structures and a couple other courses. I already have an internship at a corporate type company but would most definitely prefer to intern here.

I would really like to convey that I want to intern here and that I am willing to prepare as much as necessary. I originally submitted this to someone who forwarded it. Should I be getting here feedback? Do you think I should respond as in trying harder to get the internship or should I accept the rejection gracefully?

4gkmcv,1,2016-04-26,"1 year experience, no degree. Can I move across the country?",pancakesimone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4gkmcv/1_year_experience_no_degree_can_i_move_across_the/,"So this is going to be a pretty big hypothetical question, and I don't really expect concrete answers. 

I'm 19, I've been programming for around 6 years now. I didn't go to college, but I did land an internship at a local company that turned into a full time position. I don't make a lot of money, but I attribute that to my lack of professional experience and no degree. But, recently I've been having some hardships and I'd like to get a fresh start with new friends in a different area. Ideally I'd like to work for some ""hip"" company with younger employees so I can make more friends, my company right now is generally mid-twenties and up. I get along with most of them, but I just don't feel like we are in the same stage of life. 

My issue is my lack of professional experience, and I know that. But would it be feasible to move to a new area and land a job in say SV or Seattle? I *do* know my stuff (and the stuff I don't know I can certainly study up on), but are these companies looking for people that don't have much experience like me? I have a nice job at my company right now where I could stay for a couple years and get more experience, so I'm worried if I leave I might be screwed because companies might not want me. My boss really likes me and says he has no doubt I can learn all the technologies I might be exposed to here, so I guess that means I'm not a bad developer. I've worked as a full stack developer for about a year now. I have experience with Java, C#, ASP.NET (and MVC), JS (and tons of little libraries, although that doesn't really matter), SQL and probably some other obscure languages. I've never been *stuck* on a problem to the point where I can't finish a project, and I've had some decent projects already thrown at me in my time working here.

Any thoughts?"
4gkt7l,2,2016-04-26,Is my attitude at work healthy?,BOTgeneral,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4gkt7l/is_my_attitude_at_work_healthy/,"I've been working in a big half-IT company for more than one and a half year now. I didn't have a lot of past experience, had a part time job for almost a year and a paid internship, both in IT. In total my current work experience is over 2 years.

The place I work at now is really really good and comfortable. Aside from being paid well there are also benefits like expensive insurance and in general for my age (24) the money I get and the work I do is pretty high level (I fully support myself and live alone). Upon start of the work I had no intention to change it, my plan was to make a career here.

However regardless of my current comfortable and career-wise happy life I'm planning to relocate abroad after not longer than 2 years. Reason: I always wanted to live in that other country, been there many times, am fluent in the language since age 16. Only last year I realized that actually nothing major stops me from doing it. I also have a SO there.

So the more serious I am about relocating, the more things in my head changed regarding my career. For example, I picked cheaper trainings because if I quit before a year from them passes I'll have to pay their price myself. So in case I move earlier I don't want to get a big debt. Also there are some problems between me and some coworkers (nothing major) and instead of feeling too bad about it I just think ""nvm, this will be gone when I move"". During not busy hours at work I try to learn myself something new for the sake of being able to add more things in my resume which I'll send to places I apply in the new country and not for the sake of being a better employee here. I also quite often (at home) browse jobs there (in the same field as my own) and try to be active at work here so when I go to interviews there I can tell about what I achieved, etc. I also think to not move before I have a full 2 year experience here because on the resume it looks better than say 1.85 year.

Tl;dr, I am fixated on the idea to relocate and consequently find a new job in a new country. My thought process shifted from being a good employee who can make a career in the current place to my current employment being an ""investment"" towards a new job which is not even set up yet.

Is this healthy/normal or am I just bothering myself and should work as if I have no plans since they are quite long term?"

I have always been more interested in databases and software development. In your professional opinions is it worth losing the money for someone who might pay me but the work will better align with my career goals or should I take the IT one because at the end of the day it's just an internship.

In fact, tomorrow the director will be calling me for our first interview (I already talked to HR last week). As I understand it, his interview will be the last in the process but I am unsure if he will be giving me an answer tomorrow or not.

What should I say to the first company? It seems like they want me to respond right away, as they didn't give me a deadline to accept.

I want the internship with the company I'm talking to tomorrow more because they have a more defined program and when I spoke with the first company on the phone, the director I""d be under seemed skeptical about my school program requiring me to be there 25 hours a week. He has never had his own interns in his department before so he knew nothing about the typical hours they have at his company but he seemed like I would not have enough to do for 25 hours a week. He also said he would check and see if I could assist with certain duties in other departments, but his email mentioned nothing about my responsibilities and tasks and what I would be learning/doing at all. 

I need *something* to graduate, so I will take what I can get, but maybe you understand why I want to wait until tomorrow's interview. I also do not want to accept anything yet because I have no intention of backing out- I stick with my commitments.


Also, the internship I'm still interviewing for offers parking and pays, while the other doesn't pay, doesn't offer parking, and I don't live in that city so I'd have to ride the metro in or park at a parking garage everyday. (I don't live in either city but the first internship offers parking).

What should I say to the company that has offered me something so that I have time to make a decision about both and don't risk losing all opportunities? And can I ask the second company if they will be deciding this week about me, and say that I have an offer elsewhere but they are my top choice?

Thanks for your help."
4gl1h7,1,2016-04-26,"[20m] Smart, directionless and probably unhappy",prospectivesplitter,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4gl1h7/20m_smart_directionless_and_probably_unhappy/,"I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I'm very smart (2300 SAT, ~145 IQ, 174 mean practice LSAT score), but lately I've been feeling as though that's the only good thing about me. Everything that I've ever accomplished in my life has been the product of raw intellect, cleverness and a willingness to bend rules, or the support of my parents and their network. 

My first problem is that I don't have very much grit or mental toughness. I don't know how to fix this, or even if indeed it is fixable. It seems so intrinsic. But then again, I've never really seen people in general as having much agency at all- like everyone else, I am mostly, if not entirely, the product of my genetics and upbringing. If I grow tired too easily, break down too easily, am too averse to pain and discomfort- this to me seems no more intentionally changeable than one's intelligence or beliefs. 

My second problem is that everything seems so stupid.
 
Our politicians debate abortion without the slightest reference to bioethics, they discuss fiscal policy with little regard for empirical evidence or even the rules of arithmetic, and when it comes to immigration and foreign policy they don't even pretend to try to come to any sort of agreement. They just bash contradictory axioms into one another as though they are competing to see who can talk loudest.

Every internship I've held seems to be an exercise in jumping through hoops. I had a stint at an investment bank where I learned that my boss didn't understand probability and that success is often about getting lucky and/or getting people to like you. I had another internship at a manufacturing plant where I spent my time filling out forms and doing what essentially amounted to arts and crafts. 

The vast majority of my high school friendships and relationships took an enormous amount of energy and no small degree of pretending to sustain. I have four or five good friends from high school in my life, and I'm grateful for that, but the ease with which I drifted away from the rest made me realize what a pointless waste of time it is to try and be a part of a predefined group for its own sake. 

I don't seem to be able to sustain romantic relationships because I tend to end up feeling smarter than and superior to my partner. This doesn't always happen (I've dated at least one girl who was definitely smarter than I was, which was also probably my best relationship) but it happens in the vast majority of cases. And besides needing a smart partner, I also need someone who is relatively attractive and doesn't want much in the way of traditional emotional reciprocity- I'm a somewhat cold person and I don't expect that to change. It seems there is a good chance I'm just not cut out for a serious, lasting relationship. 

So the way politics are structured seems stupid, the way the professional world works seems stupid, and the vast majority of interpersonal relationships seem stupid. What am I supposed to do? 

I want to be important. I know that I have the intelligence, and there is so much about the world that I want to change, but I really don't think I have any of the other qualities associated with success (grit, optimism, fondness for people in general, a healthy sense of self) and I don't think these are things I (or anyone) can really consciously change. 

For what it's worth, I'm aware that there's a chance I'm a cerebral narcissist. That might fit, since I haven't always felt this way as strongly as I do now, and I am at the age where the disorder tends to manifest. But if that is the case, there isn't really anything that can be done to fix it. 

I know this rambled a bit and I apologize for that. I think that the long and short of it is that I want things that I probably won't be able to get, and might not even exist. I want people to listen to me, I want to make the world more logical, I want to be the decider-of-things, I want people to treat me as though I have some sort of special insight. I'm not in a bad life situation right now at all (good college, decent GPA, on track for decent-to-very-good postgrad prospects, reasonable social life) but I just don't know what I should do, how to get the things I want, or  how I should live with myself when I probably fail and am forced to settle.

I guess part of the reason I feel this way is because I attempted to get an internship last summer through a local programme but didn't even get shortlisted for any jobs so I feel like I have absolutely nothing to offer anyone. 

I'm wondering if there's anyone reading this who's felt the same way I have, if there's anything I can do to make programming fun again and what  I can do to make myself employable once this year is out."

I met somebody this semester that I really like, and they happen to be an exchange student.  I have the opportunity to go back to their country with them, which is a place that I could see myself enjoying.  My other option is an internship.  It's not particularly exciting, and it's not something I really want to do, but I would need it to graduate.  

I'm really struggling with this decision, because it would determine the direction of my life.  Do I stay here, graduate college, etc. and all that boring stuff, or do I move somewhere completely different with someone that I want to be with?  To a place that I've never been but believe I would enjoy?  I'm getting kind tired of it here, and do not particularly enjoy it, but I don't know if this would realistically be a good idea.  The only thing really keeping me here would be school and fear of making the wrong choice.  If I stayed there long term i could possibly go to school there, and money wouldn't really be a problem.  It seems like a huge decision and I really don't want to make the wrong one.  I don't think my parents would like it either, but they can't force me to do anything.  So is moving somewhere completely new, over staying at college where I am not overly happy, realistically a good idea?  What should I do?"

I'm 22 years old.  I go to a top 50 college in the US and I messed up a great opportunity.

I came into this school with the intention to major in computer science, but I quickly failed out of my opportunity for that because you cannot fail a class twice and be in the program so I was forced to change my major, which I did to stats.  In my 4 years of college I have probably failed 10 classes.  My current GPA is a 2.2 and I have no experience or internships in my field and am currently waiting tables for money.  I will probably fail one more class this semester.  I'm going to be a 5th year senior, but I will still be able to graduate by next spring if I can pass the rest of my classes fine, but I will also be graduating with about $65k in debt.  I messed up, I know I messed up and I beat myself up about it constantly.

And its not like I even enjoyed my time in college and messed up.  I was just lazy.  I'm surprised I even got this far without flunking out.  I did just enough to be able to continue to go to school.  I don't even have a passion for stats, I just decided that it was a good choice.  I have no idea whats wrong with me.

What can I do now to help myself get a job after I graduate.  My dreams of grad school are gone, so I'm stuck.  What do I do?  Please help, I am honestly just scared of my future."

***


**Demographics:** Pittsburgh, White male, private school, upper middle class. Both parents went to college and I have an older sister at Harvard.

**Intended major(s):** Electrical Engineering. (comp E is my top choice, but it's usually offered as a subset of EE)

**Academics:**

* **SAT:** superscore: 2310 (710R, 800M, 800W)

* **SAT II:**
 * Math II - 800
 * Physics: (taking June)
 * Latin: (taking June)

* **GPA:** about 4.0, might drop to 3.9 this year though. (My school has a weird ranking system. A is 4.00, but A+ is 4.3. Sorry, I don't know what that is standardized.)

* **Coursework:** Current (Junior) year: BC calc part 2, physics calc, AP CS, US history, Latin 4a, Symphonic Band (I play the trombone and I'm low brass section leader), various english classes.
 * my school doesn't offer many AP courses, but I'm taking all of the ones offered I think. (besides other languages, art, etc) I'm taking the most rigorous schedule I can, which of course hurts my GPA (and sanity sometimes haha), but I like the classes themselves for the most part.
 * **AP scores:** (none taken yet.) 

 * BC Calc: 5 expected. (*easy* 5 on the mock exam my school offered, almost everyone in the class gets a 5.
 * I will also take physics C mech/E&amp;M, and Comp Sci.

* **Awards:** 
 * 4 or 5 top ten national Science Olympiad placements
 * Some latin contest awards
 * this is probably a big week spot for me, as I don't do too many outside of school competitions. (I'm building an ROV though that I want to enter into PRSEF, my region's ISEF feeder.)


**Extracurriculars:**

 * Robotics Club Captain - I'm in charge of my school's small robotics team which competes in FTC. We have 1 faculty member who isn't really that involved, so I'm the go-to and I put a huge amount of my time into this. (Every day from 3-6 for end of fall and winter. 3-9 for the two weeks leading up to competition.) We won our region this year, but we're not that good. However, we get almost zero school funding and when I got involved as a freshman they had gotten last place at states the year before, so I feel like I've made a good impact on the club. I set up the lab myself with a friend in the basement of the admissions office last summer and got IT to put a computer in and built a field myself with a friend.

 * I used to do Science Olympiad (as in SOINC) up until this year. I wuit last year when I became weary of a few team members and the head coach (everyone lied to each other and competed with each other a fuck load and the coach got kicked off the team for forgetting to sign them up this year, so I think I dodged a bullet by dropping it.)

**Summers:**

 * I teach [Andrew's Leap,](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./leap/) which is a 7 week CS and robotics course at CMU for high school students. It's about 40 kids and it's fairly competitive to get into. I took it two summers ago, and now I teach the robotics track. I help them build and program robots culminating in a final project. [Here are some from last year.](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/leap/) I will be teaching again this summer but only part time. (I still get to teach the students but I won't monitor the lectures and stuff)

 * This summer I will be doing an internship at [Astrobotic](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/research/projectEntry.php?id=LunarXPrize), the CMU team for the Lunar X Prize. I will be working on finishing the design of the camera board, an [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) which streams the live low res video as well as stores the HD video. I will be working mostly alone, as the *one* guy who works on that part of the rover before I got involved went out of town last week and won't be coming back until after summer, and won't be accessible all summer. I asked him who to ask if I ran into trouble and he said the internet lol. I will be working independently om this system, but I will still be involved with the rest of the team and hopefully can get a good rec letter at the end. This is a strong part of my application IMO.

**Portfolio/Hobbies**

This is a weird thing to add, but I think a large aspect of my life is my passion for engineering, which isn't really represented by my GPA or test scores. MIT has a portfolio section so I thought my personal projects might be relevant.

* My physics class has a term project each trimester that we have to do, and most students do something half-assed for the grade, but I try to do something ambitious if I can. Fall and this Spring I've been working on an ROV (robotic submarine), and I've put almost every sunday for the last month and most of fall as well as countless hours researching at home working on it with 2 of my friends. It's super cool, but doesn't work yet :P Hopefully I will get it working within the next 3 weeks. I also made a coil gun but that wasn't as cool. They are detailed [here](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/nautilus-2/) and [here](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/coilgun/). I'm getting a rec letter from my physics teacher hopefully, and I think these two projects will influence the letter a lot.

* Outside of school I also do a lot of projects, but idk how I can get any of that stuff noticed by colleges but also sound genuine. Engineering is 100% my favorite thing to do, but idk how I can convey that without sounding fake. Bonus project plug: I'm trying to build a mechanical bird for fun. It's super cool but nowhere near complete. I want to enter it into a contest but it's really more for fun. Details [here](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/avidrone/) if you care about that stuff.

**Schools:**

I will apply for all EA, unless it is binding or restrictive

* MIT (big reach)
* CMU (I'm local and my dad is faculty there so that helps)
* U Penn
* Princeton
* Cornell
* Harvey Mudd
* Cal tech
* I'm open to suggestions. I haven't looked into this enough.

**Hooks?**

* not sure what to really put here. I have really severe [Cholinergic Urticaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic_urticaria) that has thus far been untreatable, which makes sports and things really really hard for me and makes interviews and other 1 on 1 situations difficult. Basically if I sweat or get nervous I break out almost instantly in severe hives. I've had it for a few years and it hasn't gotten better even with meds. My doctor doesn't really know what to do at this point but I guess I'll deal. :I I saw somewhat else put a disease in their hook so I guess I'll do the same.

**Questions**

I do a lot of personal projects that I think illustrate the amount of commitment I have towards engineering and making shit, but other than specific schools like MIT which have a portfolio option, I don't know how to incorporate that into my app without coming off as fake. Thanks everyone in advance!

Unfortunately our instructor wasn't the greatest and I feel as though I did not learn as much as I could or should have. In combination with that, our 2nd Java based class isn't until spring of 2017, so we will have a large gap in time where we likely won't be coding much for school purposes. 

What I am looking for is some suggestions on what I can do to satiate my knowledge with regards to Java to not only keep it fresh but also keep adding to my skillset. I want to start really pushing to become proficient with Java so that I am better prepared when the time comes next Spring, as well as giving me a better chance of landing my degree-required internship by having a nice array(no pun intended) of projects. I know there are resources in the FAQ section, but most of what I have found is geared towards people just starting out. I spent 1 semester doing C# and now I am focusing on Java. So I have a decent background already and am trying to find that happy medium. 

I am willing to take free online courses, &lt; $40 online courses, coding challenges, etc. I am not overwhelmed with ideas or grand theories on how to reinvent the wheel with regards to programming. I don't have the desire to go create the next big app or program, I much prefer begin given a specific task and working to accomplish it. 

I have done some basic Googling for this stuff, but there is so much saturation with coding these days that it's hard to identify quality over quantity. 

Any help in regards to above is appreciated. Hopefully this is an acceptable post, as I've had some bad experiences on places like StackOverflow asking any form of questions. If my post is considered answered by the FAQ or anything, please feel free to delete it Mods. I am just trying to pursue all available avenues to better prepare myself for the future.

I got accepted into the UCD graduate program in ECE (Fall 2016). I have also applied to San Jose State and will most likely get in. I would like some help in deciding between the two programs.
These are the pros of the two schools that I can think of.

Pros of SJSU

I live near San Jose hence SJSU's location is convenient.
Also SJSU is in the middle of Silicon Valley and hence finding part time and summer internships might be easier. Also it'll be convenient to commute during part time internships assuming the companies are located in the bay area

Pros of UCD

It's ranked higher.
The research prospects and lab experience would be much better.
I like the town and love the campus!
Also, I have no problem in relocating to Davis.

Now, I would like some insight on the cons of both the programs and general advice from people who have attended these schools or know of someone who did.

UK if that matters (from speaking with Americans, you guys seem to have more of a meritocracy, whereas the UK is a lot more bureaucratic for hiring, as well as having a much weaker tech jobs market). 

I worked in a shitty, go-nowhere field, then (having studied some CS and programming in my free time, and with zero success getting into other work directly) jumped on the data science hype train and did a 1 year masters in that. This seems like a mistake, but what's done is done.

I like programming and working with databases, but without a CS degree it seems like that's a no-go field for me, and I've had zero luck so far even getting into internships. I've also had zero success getting into higher level data science stuff, and the only lower level data analyst positions I've found seem to pay terribly (less than call centers) and have no real career development.

As I see it, I have two options:

1. Take some part time job that pays well but has zero career relevance. Spend the rest of the time further building my skills and portfolio so I have some great projects to show off, which might counter my lack of CS degree. Hope to then get an internship after that.

2. Get whatever crappy little data analyst position I can. Work on skills and portfolio in whatever spare time I have left after that, although this will probably take longer than option 1. Option 2 basically banks on the shitty position having at least some career relevance, which I'm not sure it does.

Recommendations on my next move? I'd also like to get the hell out of the UK ASAP, but without decent experience behind me, I don't think that's likely for a long time."

I am in a bit of a predicament regarding getting 2 speeding citations in the past month (my only 2 citations I have ever gotten for speeding, and anything regarding the law in general). A little background before I ask questions: 
I am an 18 year old college student located in North Carolina.  In late February, I got a a speeding citation for going 60mph on a 45 in Henderson county. The citation states that I was radar detected. A month later, unfortunately I got a second citation for going 84 on a 65 (19 over the speed limit). The police officer slammed me with a Class 2 Misdemeanor. All he told me was that I had to appear in court for a mandatory court date. For this citation, I was speed trapped by a laser gun in Cleveland County. I own a late 80s Nissan with pop up headlights. I contacted an attorney for the first citation, and he mentioned that he will most likely be able to get my first citation reduced to improper equipment.

1)Will the second citation impact the outcome of the sentencing for the first speeding citation even if the trial for the second citation would not have occurred yet?

2)If I get an attorney for the second citation which is a Class 2 Misdemeanor, what are my chances of getting the criminal charge dropped?

3)If my first citation sentencing results in an improper equipment scenario, can this positively impact my misdemeanor trial for the second citation?

4)I am a college student looking to get into internships soon as well as graduate programs in the future. If I do get convicted of a Class Misdemeanor, how much will it impact my future?

5)Based on similar situations in North Carolina, what is most likely to happen in this particular situation? Do I have a good shot at getting of the criminal Misdemeanor charge and avoid license suspension if I get an attorney?"

It's just her, a few developers who work from home and an unpaid intern a few hours every week.

Then there's me. I basically hold down the fort in the office. I pick up clients phone calls, I meet with them about their questions, and they're always happy to work with me. I also manage all of their business's social media and enjoy doing it. I have a college degree in producing media so I'm experienced at this.

When the clients work with her, they're always angry because she misses deadlines and is extremely unorganized. She also never gives them the designs that they want and just does whatever she wants. Then she complains to me about them complaining to her... ugh.
Some days she has nothing for me to do so I sit at the desk all day and try to make work for myself (post on our client's social media pages, research new social media marketing techniques) but eventually it feels like the day is 200 hours long. Then, other days, she dumps SO much work on me that I'm buried in it and don't have enough time to finish it all. Also, the pay is $11 which is what I made lifeguarding in high school lol -- not good.

When the girl who had my job before me left, she introduced me to the job duties by saying, ""here are the things you need to in know in order to deal with having this job"" -- I should have seen that as a warning sign right off the bat.

The problem, however, is that I've already signed a contract with her saying I'd work here for 3 months and she'd pay me on a bi-weekly basis.

She's been paying me on time (or a day late) until this week...

My fiance and I took $1,500 out of my bank account in cash to cover the deposit on a new apartment, which left me with only a few hundred in my account. It's due May 1.

Last night I got an alert that said my bank account was overdrawn by $200. I called the bank and they said that there was a ""return item chargeback"" on the check, which means that her bank denied my bank the money, causing me to lose all of that money in my bank account and then some. So basically, she bounced my check.

I made it to the bank last night and deposited some of the cash for the new apartment so my account wasn't overdrawn anymore. (I'll make enough money by May 1 at my other job to be able to take that money back out.)

I'm really not sure how to approach her about this. I REALLY want to quit because I have another job that I love that wants me full-time ASAP. They're just waiting for me to be out of this contract.

It seems like she nulled the contract by not paying me on a bi-weekly basis and part of me feels like I have a right to give my two-weeks but I also don't want to get into legal trouble. I doubt she'd ever take any legal action, though.

Any advice? :/"

Previous boss pushed me, in a good way, to make python script for dept to use to interact w/devices over SSH.  I LOVE the challenge I get from Python stuff, but maybe that's just the newness of it. We recently hired a Director of IT, previously local ~IT~ reported to mgr of Engineering.  I chose to work for IT guy simply b/c that's where my background is.  We hired a friend of mine ~6 months~ ago to handle day to day.  I mostly focus on projects with some support....but I'm torn.  I think Python feels the most rewarding right now, but I worry that you need to be a mgr to make money and progress in your career.


***

###Backstory

*brace yourselves....wall of text is coming!*

I'm 30 and have been working in IT type jobs for a little over 8 years now.  About a year into things I decided to go to a *mediocre private* college.  I got my Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems, so that has helped me get my foot in the door w/my current employer.  I've typically hopped jobs about every 2 years.

I started off thinking I wanted to be a web designer and got an internship to do web stuff...turns out I was pretty crappy at it and it wasn't that fun either.  The lady I interned under def was amazing and I'll always be in her debt for her awesome guidance, understanding and overall awesomeness.  I submitted her to ThinkGeek Sysadmin Queen in 2011 and she [WON!](http://www.thinkgeek.com/blog/2011/07/)

After that I got random jobs for a while until I landed one doing IT support for mobile users at a power company.  This got me some exposure but eventually I needed benefits and that wasn't happening.  I went back to the company I intern'd at, unfortunately diff sysadmin though :(.  

At this company I got pushed pretty hard since I'd never supported Macs or had to do a lot of the server side stuff.  Mostly involved linux based things creating users and setting up permissions for an FTP.  I still don't use *nix too much and have long forget all of it.  Started going to school while here so I could get a better job.  I liked the environment but couldn't stand the guy who was above me.  He was literally the main reason I left, always a negative spin on anything that was not to his preference.  Quite often felt like an idiot or belittled.

Went back to the power company b/c they  needed someone specifically to support Netmotion for lower region of the state.  I was thankful for the opportunity but eventually got bored.  I write some scripts and one guy I worked with the first time around was now doing SCCM stuff.  He threw me a few bones to help me out and eventually I was on the brink of getting a job with a dept that packaged apps and deployed them.  The mgr of that dept was pretty old school and pretty much said the only way I could do the job was if I drove to HQ 1.5 hours away **EVERYDAY**, this obvs wasn't going to fly.  I ended up leaving the company once I got the picture that all the good jobs were at HQ.  Had some other gripes, but that single one is why I left.


Accepted offer from my current employer, whom found me on some website.  I walked in and knew I had a lot to change or improve upon.  They were in the middle of a win7 deployment and I was more or less the only **local** IT guy.  I reported to the person who was handling IT before, but he was and still is extremely busy.

I'm extremely torn and if nothing else it will make me feel better just to discuss it more.  Will post question and then backstory

###Questions
 * Do people use Python outside of SDE realm? I'm nervous about focussing on that and ""starting over"" in my career
 * I'm in the mindset that in just about any career path, management is where the money is at...is this wrong?


###Question Info..
     I'm 30 with bachelors degree, been working in IT type jobs for 8 years.  I'm very structurally minded instead of object oriented minded.  Previous boss pushed me, in a good way, to make python script for dept to use to interact w/devices over SSH.  I LOVE the challenge I get from Python stuff, but maybe that's just the newness of it. We recently hired a Director of IT, previously local ~IT~ reported to mgr of Engineering.  I chose to work for IT guy simply b/c that's where my background is.  We hired a friend of mine ~6 months~ ago to handle day to day.  I mostly focus on projects with some support....but I'm torn.  I think Python feels the most rewarding right now, but I worry that you need to be a mgr to make money and progress in your career.

###Backstory

*brace yourselves....wall of text is coming!*

I'm 30 and have been working in IT type jobs for a little over 8 years now.  About a year into things I decided to go to a *mediocre private* college.  I got my Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems, so that has helped me get my foot in the door w/my current employer.  I've typically hopped jobs about every 2 years.

I started off thinking I wanted to be a web designer and got an internship to do web stuff...turns out I was pretty crappy at it and it wasn't that fun either.  The lady I interned under def was amazing and I'll always be in her debt for her awesome guidance, understanding and overall awesomeness.  I submitted her to ThinkGeek Sysadmin Queen in 2011 and she [WON!](http://www.thinkgeek.com/blog/2011/07/)

After that I got random jobs for a while until I landed one doing IT support for mobile users at a power company.  This got me some exposure but eventually I needed benefits and that wasn't happening.  I went back to the company I intern'd at, unfortunately diff sysadmin though :(.  

At this company I got pushed pretty hard since I'd never supported Macs or had to do a lot of the server side stuff.  Mostly involved linux based things creating users and setting up permissions for an FTP.  I still don't use *nix too much and have long forget all of it.  Started going to school while here so I could get a better job.  I liked the environment but couldn't stand the guy who was above me.  He was literally the main reason I left, always a negative spin on anything that was not to his preference.  Quite often felt like an idiot or belittled.

Went back to the power company b/c they  needed someone specifically to support Netmotion for lower region of the state.  I was thankful for the opportunity but eventually got bored.  I write some scripts and one guy I worked with the first time around was now doing SCCM stuff.  He threw me a few bones to help me out and eventually I was on the brink of getting a job with a dept that packaged apps and deployed them.  The mgr of that dept was pretty old school and pretty much said the only way I could do the job was if I drove to HQ 1.5 hours away **EVERYDAY**, this obvs wasn't going to fly.  I ended up leaving the company once I got the picture that all the good jobs were at HQ.  Had some other gripes, but that single one is why I left.


Accepted offer from my current employer, whom found me on some website.  I walked in and knew I had a lot to change or improve upon.  They were in the middle of a win7 deployment and I was more or less the only **local** IT guy.  I reported to the person who was handling IT before, but he was and still is extremely busy.  I started using SCCM, corp already had this setup...just weren't using locally.  I also wrote a fair amount of scripts which went over quite well with the company.

I almost left b/c previous SCCM guy worked for a hospital and his dept was hiring.  He was senior engineer on managed desktop team (SCCM, packaging apps, etc).

4gp8k4,143,2016-04-27,Our Alaskan Tribe,Victor_King,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4gp8k4/our_alaskan_tribe/,"When it comes to the war of Man versus Nature, Nature may have taken few knocks over the years but she is far from done fighting. That's the best way to describe the area of Alaska I'm from. It's a semi island deep in the the wilderness that's only accessible by boat or sea plane for a few months out of the year. We have one shop above our boat docks and our best entertainment is going there to shoot the shit. Most of us who live out here are either running from something or just plain don't like other people. We have all types though. From former criminals to your hardcore Libertarians. Past life, race, religion, social standing, gender. It's all bullshit that goes right out the window when the first snow comes in. All you have to do up here is survive a winter and you have joined one of the most exclusive clubs on Earth. A club were the secret handshake is weathered skin and a knowing grin across a counter whenever some new J.Crew hipsters roll into town. The grin that says, “They won't make it a month. But we will. See you in a bit friend”. 

I hate to admit it, but I misread Jamie Munsen the first time I saw her. I was sitting on the docks by the shop next to Jodie and Markus when she came off the barge with the other wide eyed would be settlers. Markus was full of the tough talk and John Wayne swagger that comes with having your first winter under your belt. Jodie and I were welcoming him into the tribe with back slaps and inside jokes when we heard the three horns of an incoming boat. We leaned back in our chairs and waited for the games to begin. 

There was the usual that came off the barge. A couple who didn't realize salt would turn their jackets gray and tattered in a few days who stopped to take a selfie by the boat before wandering off. The tacticool survivalist who didn't realize that vest he was wearing would over heat him in a hour of hard work. The hardcore vegan who put more thought into his dreadlocks than his footwear (Waterproof boots will save your feet out here. Sandals are a death sentence). Then there was Jamie. She hopped off the boat green as kelp wearing brand new flannel and jeans. She looked at the ground and practically ran off the gangway with her head down. She made it to the top of the dock before adding her lunch to the salt water. 

Wouldn't last a month we thought. 

Hipster couple were out in four days. Tacticool was done by that night. Vegan did three weeks before breaking down. But not Jamie. Sure enough, a year rolled by and she had the seat right next to Markus. Flannel was torn, jeans were worn and just looking at that barge turned her pale, but she was in. Damn we misread that woman.

Years went by and she became a permanent tribal member. Actually, she was damn near invaluable. Back in her old life she was some kind of genius doctor. She always lent a helping hand when it came to getting our gardens chemically balanced or with what I guess you could call advanced first aid. She's the good type. The kind of neighbor you hope for. 

Then Dr. Jacob Weeks showed up. 

It was the same as it had always been. All of us sitting out on those docks on an early Spring day watching as the waves brought in the next boat/turnip cart of fresh meat for the Alaskan Wilderness. A dweeby little guy stepped off in steel toe boots and cargo shorts. Jamie tensed up and her brow lowered. The thick air she produced smothered our laughter The dweeby man took four steps forward before looking up at her. His jaw practically *thunked* against the dock before he muttered, “Ja-.....Jamie”. Jamie nodded at him and her teeth clenched. “Jacob”. The dweeb ran up the stairs and into the store at the top. Jamie leaned back in her seat and stayed silent the rest of the evening.

The 2AM gunshot told us what happened to Jacob. 

You see, out here we have our own laws. Killing a tribe member is unforgivable. Killing an initiate has to be explained. Take Jodie for example. She has this pitbull that guarded her land named, Rocky. Few years back a different tacticool guy shot Rocky because he was scared of him. Jodie responded by putting four in the guys chest, chopping him into bits and dumping them off the coast. She told us the whole story over beers and we understood. Rocky made a full recovery thank god. Tacticool man wasn't all that missed but then again, who would miss the kind of man who shoots a dog?

And so it was with Jamie. All of us gathered around the bar in the shop at the top of those docks. Court was in session and Jamie had been there long enough to know it. Three quarters of a bottle of bourbon between us and she gave her side of the story.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The business of healing is always just that. A business. From the moment you don your first pair of clean scrubs to having your name plastered on the side of your own private practice, everything revolves around the almighty dollar. When the skies are clear and the numbers are black there is no shortage of Gatsby styled parties where older men brag about the new model (car or intern) they recently slipped inside of. But, when the numbers are red and the bar is stocked with Gold Label instead of Blue, heads need to roll. 

Jamie found herself on the wrong end of the political guillotine. She had finished her internship when a wealthy patron checked himself in with failing kidneys. He was being made comfortable while the hospital awaited an acceptable transplant. Unfortunately for the man, money can't buy everything. Especially when a idealist stands in the way. You see, the kidneys came in and the man was probably planning which scotch to use as a test run when he got out of the hospital. The same time he was debating the Glenfidditch or Macallan, Jamie stole the kidneys and gave them to her patient. 

Well, not really. Her patient was 12 year old boy who was placed higher on the priority list than the 78 year old tycoon. She didn't so much steal as follow procedure. But, that's not how the man's family saw it. Needless to say, Jamie's career was over after that. What dignified hospital could ever hire a doctor who showed a rich someone that death isn't just for us peasants? 

Jamie was young, brilliant, and completely unemployable. 

At least in this country. 

Funny thing about the American health care system. We can give you the best treatment money can ask for. Yet in some countries, as much as I hate to admit it, they've out capitalized the United States. That my friends, takes a special type of brutality. The type that doesn't care where those little Styrofoam coolers come from; as long as they show up on time and in good working order. This country in particular, was Brazil. 

Jamie was working under a guy who was half as smart and payed twice as much named, you guessed it, Dr. Jacob Weeks. 

That was her career for the longest time. She assisted a half wit during surgery as some second cousin of the Rockefellers tried to cheat death for a fifth time. Monday through pay day Friday. Rinse and repeat. It may not have been what she had imagined when she went into medical school but when you get kicked to the curb for doing the right thing, doing the wrong can feel very right. The brand new BMW in her driveway didn't hurt either. 

For the most part people assumed the organs came from slum kids or Chinese workers who dropped dead during production. People generally no one gives a shit about. Then one day they were doing an eye transplant. Some young trophy wife decided she wanted blue eyes and her husband was more than happy to foot the bill. Surgery went well and Jamie was looking over the charts when she saw the name of the donator. Thomas Munsen.

When she left the U.S., Jamie left behind her parents, an older sister, and a little brother. That little brother was riding his bike down a hill one day when he jumped a curb and went into a tree/coma. You can probably guess what happened when the young trophy wife started shopping around for a new pair of blue eyes. The plug was pulled and a Styrofoam cooler made an overnight trip to Brazil. 

Jamie, unknowingly put her brother's eye into the skull of a trophy wife. Jacob, on the other hand did know. In fact he was the one who placed the order. He didn't come into work the next day to avoid his obviously pissed off coworker. What he didn't expect or maybe he did was for Jamie to grab a scalpel and reclaim her brother's baby blues from the sockets of the sedated trophy wife. She hopped on the next boat and joined our little Alaskan family while two unseeing eyes rotted on a table next to a screaming blind blonde. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personally, I think she was justified to shoot Jacob. We all did, actually. Seriously. There was a vote and we decided to sink the doctor out in the bay. Shame. Jamie's good and all but you could always use a second doctor. But, you know what they say. Family is family. Hopefully next year will be more fun. "

Pretty much as soon as i accepted it, a bunch of people who i trusted and who i believed to be on very good terms with, all came out of the woodwork with their best gossip about me. The person who was in charge of promoting me started to hear more and more weird things that he disliked and i ended up getting the position taken away from me. Im usually pretty trusting of people and in general i try to get along with everyone as best as i can, which is why i was so surprised that these people actively sabotaged my job, even though they had no reason to do it (They are people from another ""department"" who can not apply for the position, and i would not have power over them). So basically a bunch of people fucked me for what seems shits and giggles. Now im just feeling like i cant trust anyone, i shouldn't try to have good workplace relations because I'll just get fucked anyways. I would like to think that people are good in general, but now im pissed off at the world and im not sure i can go back to being a fun person at work, which is extra shitty for me because having a good time at my job is what helps me get through the day.

On top of all this, we are all college students, and its not an internship, so i simply cant believe how cutthroat everyone is being to me when i have offered nothing but trust and friendliness to them. I dont want to become one of those cynical people who just screws over everyone else and thinks ""survival of the fittest!"" but it looks like i have no other option, and that makes my life a little more depressing.

I am currently learning python, I have moved past basics and am trying to get my first site up and running (maybe even my dad's eCommerce constructing website) with Django, in order to host my python based projects, one that acts a sort of reading list builder app based on user statistics like previously read books and my diabetic analytic app that uses my blood sugar reading and food journal (that will eventually be able to take a picture and give relative carb count) to help me manage my diabetes better. I have a relative plan for both projects but am no where near a public build I can post on github. I am currently serving, after dropping out of the engineering program at my local college due to my 2.01 GPA. I have no certifications or provable relative experience because I have been serving since I was 19 [23M] and have never worked and internship. On the other hand I do have some project based experience with networking systems. Due to my frustration with the AT&amp;T standard router, I made a linux based router with a lighter server os and better slightly used parts, and its still holding strong with 25mb/s down and 5mb/s up, not great but it was something I am proud of cause I stuck to it even with the software set up issues. Hardware, I have been building my own computers with the acceptation of my most recent laptop, since I was 15 with the most complex system is a 80TB NAS server for my friends home, for backups to their devices and for storing torrent downloads. With a few days of work and hours of googling I managed to have all hard drives connected and running. Is there any internship/job shadowing opprotunities you think I am capable of applying for (even unpaid) in the Houston or Texas area? Or if not is there any career plan or resource you can suggest that can get me ready in &lt;6 months? Ideally before the fall semester starts. I am particularlly interested in becoming a full stack python developer for apps/ websites/ web apps or a job in data science. Is there any career plan you can suggest I follow without the need for a college education that I can put on a resume (projects are fine, I know wording will matter on a resume)? And is there a way I can get an internship or any insight to what these jobs actually entail? Thank you in advance!"

4gpwgx,5,2016-04-27,Graduate with Honors or with a stacked portfolio?,afropuffdaddy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4gpwgx/graduate_with_honors_or_with_a_stacked_portfolio/,"Hello everyone,

I am at the end of my junior year in college with a CS major and math minor. I'm looking at my resume and applying for some internships for this summer, but am beginning to think about my plans for senior year and how to make myself look the best for a potential employer after college.

I go to a state university with an alright computer science department. My GPA is at a 3.43 right now. Some of the teachers aren't so great, but they do teach us and I feel that when I graduate I will be pretty well prepared to work. I have been a member of the honors program at my school since I entered as a freshman, and honestly it hasn't really required much out of me other than keeping a solid GPA and taking some Honors level classes. It's senior year when the honors program has it's members begin writing their thesis in order to graduate with honors. 

The question I have is this: is it worth my time to complete the thesis and graduate with honors, or would I be better served to drop the honors program and work on projects/apps to fill my portfolio? I understand that the thesis consists of mainly a lengthy paper with tons of research, as well as a ""coding journal"" to support it(almost like sources in a History paper or something). I feel like I will be spending a year doing tedious research and writing on a topic that may or may not have nothing to do with the field that I actually end up working in after college.

I want to know what really matters to an employer. If they see that you graduated with honors will they put your resume above the rest, or would they prefer to see a portfolio with loads of great work?

To me, that time seems better served with me working hard to learn more programming languages, work on large out-of-class projects(besides in class projects I really have no portfolio of work to show employers), and trying to beef up my resume with more experience in certain fields of computer science(ex: I have done some programming with C++, but am by no means an expert and can use this time to learn and apply new skills in C++). 

Also, I would attempt to do both but I know my limitations and think that senior year I will be occupied by this thesis if I go through with it and won't be able to bring myself to devote lots of time to learning new CS skills. 

A friend of mine raised the point that graduating with honors will make me stick out in a stack of applications, but I think it won't matter if I only have rudimentary or ""in class CS skills"".

TL:DR : Should I spend my senior year writing an honors thesis to graduate with honors or put my time into side projects and learning CS skills to beef up resume?"
4gq8ku,1,2016-04-27,"Just asked my boss for more hours, HR says I can't. Graduating next Spring.. what's the best plan for me?",poor_intern1234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4gq8ku/just_asked_my_boss_for_more_hours_hr_says_i_cant/,"Hi All, 
I posted this in /r/personalfinance, but I realize it might make sense to post here as well...

I currently intern at a corporate company as a software intern. I took this opportunity in August 2015 and the plan was for me to shadow an existing employee. 2 weeks in, he resigned and I quickly picked up the pace to learn his responsibilities and workload.

In November, my boss wanted to hire another intern to cover the days I'm not in the office since I'm still finishing school. We hired someone in January but my coworker just put in his 2 weeks because he got offered an internship at Microsoft.

My boss was thinking of hiring another intern, but since I think I'm pretty qualified for this job and am interested in working here, I expressed my interest to my boss but he had to check with HR to see if I could get approved for more hours. Currently, interns cannot exceed 20 hours/week.

I met up with my boss last week and gave him some numbers about how the company would save money approving me of 30 hours a week this summer and in the fall. It would cost nearly another 10k to hire someone new than to just approve me of 30 hours which is around 4k more.

Although my boss is very willing to go this route, our plan was shot down because of HR/corporate reasons and how they must stick to the budget of 20 hours a week and not allowing interns to work more than 1000 hours a year (roughly 20 hours a week 1000 hours/ 52 weeks).

So here I am now, asking for some advice. I have 100% availability this summer and I can put in 30 hours next fall. Next spring I'll have 1 class so I'll be even more available... then come May, I graduate.

The way I see it, I have two options.

1. Stay at the current company until graduation and apply to entry level places along the way until graduation. Take a job with my current company if they offer or work somewhere else by then.

 **Pros:** I'll get a lot of experience and can say I've had 1.5 years of experience at one place on my resume.

 **Cons:** I'm limited to the hours and want to work more. I want to learn more and earn more. I'm pretty much limited to a take home pay of $1000 a month.
2. Apply for other opportunities now.

 **Pros:** I might find some place better with higher pay.

I have begun studying for the GMAT, and I'm looking into completing some prerequisites during summer at a junior college. I am a transfer student who is attending UCLA this fall, but I plan on spending 3 years on my degree because I skipped a year of college at my community college (long story). Is it possible for me to get accepted into a good program without a lot of work experience? I'm not super worried about the GMAT because I can typically learn out of textbooks pretty easily, but I'm concerned I won't have a good resume if I don't do some kind of business internship or something like that. 

**My main questions are:**

* I really like math so I was planning on pursuing some kind of research during the next couple years, but should I be focusing on getting some kind of business experience so that I am a more competitive candidate when I apply? 

* Is there a chance I get accepted into a good program directly after undergraduate?

* Should I pursue an eMBA or an MBA if my goal is to get into management?


I appreciate any and all responses. Be harsh if my goals are unrealistic.

That's a another story for another day. I had an internship with a small startup doing Android development last Fall, and I've gotten an offer from them to work this summer for likely an internship-like (hourly) wage. It will be a Mon-Fri, 40 hours/week job.

I'm going to be living in my current city until my lease runs out at the end of July. I'm mostly going to be looking at other cities for jobs, of which only one will be within reasonable driving distance if I were to get an offer from there before I can move. This means there is a chance I won't be able to work until post-July anyway.

Here is the dilemma: I'm concerned if I take the job, it will get in the way of finding a full-time job. However, if I don't take it, I'm worried I'll be missing out on an opportunity to get more experience and make myself more marketable. By the way, the internship mentioned above is my only job experience right now.

**tl,dr:** Should I take an internship for the summer for experience/money, or turn it down in favor of focusing my efforts toward finding a full-time job?

Edit: A couple of extra details: No chance at this becoming a full-time job. The startup in question is tiny and not stable enough to hire anyone long-term. Also, I don't want to quit mid-summer. If I'm going to commit to it, I'm going to commit to the entire summer.

Basically, I am stuck choosing between Pepperdine, ASU and Hofstra (mostly down to the former two). 

ASU's program seems strong, but the college is huge, and to be totally honest I want to spend the next four years in Malibu if attending either school will allow me to be successful in the field (I am confident that I will work hard and excel in college).

So, will a B.S. in Pepperdine's ""Computer Science and Mathematics"" program make it tough for me to succeed in comp sci, or will either school suffice (after all, Pepperdine is in a good are for internships, there is always the option to transfer to somewhere like USC, I know kids have gotten hired by by Google and Twitter after completing the program, and I could always attend graduate school and get a master's)?

TL;DR: I want to do CompSci. Prefer Pepperdine over ASU but have heard the program there is limited. Not really sure what that actually means, have reason to believe both schools would allow to me succeed but would like more advice. Thanks for any input. "
4gri8h,1,2016-04-27,Admin Assistant Who Wants to Move On,salad_day,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4gri8h/admin_assistant_who_wants_to_move_on/,"I’m currently an administrative assistant looking to move on, but I need ideas for possible future jobs/career paths. I've got a few scattershot interests and some experience, which are all below. I know this is long, but I want you to have all the needed information. Maybe someone here can make something out of it. Apologies in advance for the length. (For the record, I’ve read What Color is Your Parachute but it hasn’t really helped me. I’m also in therapy.)

So, several things about me:

-I’m in my late twenties, with a BA in English from a small, prestigious liberal arts college. I graduated with an okay GPA (3.3). I always had weak math skills, and was much better at writing/reading. I sometimes feel this disparity kind of boxed me in in my early years in that teachers, etc. didn’t bother to foster any sort of interest in math/science because I never showed any proficiency in it. 

-I also have Asperger’s. My social skills do need work, but they’re not nonexistent. Sometimes I have trouble controlling my emotions, and I’ve had a few social fuckups at work which are unlikely to recur (more on that below), but aside from that I’m managing okay. I do have some concentration issues, but they come and go. I definitely have trouble reading people/situations and making eye contact, though I try my best. Interviewing has been a struggle at times, but most of the feedback I’ve gotten in the past has been good. There have been times, though-- particularly at work-- where sometimes it will take me a while to form an answer, or I’ll be caught staring off into space, or whatever, and people will subsequently think I’m less bright than I actually am. At least, I think I give off that impression. I’m not extremely exceptional in the way some people on the spectrum are, but I am intelligent, and I have a degree, and one of the things I want to do in life is prove that to people. 

-I’m currently an administrative assistant at a state agency that investigates complaints against judges. I’ve been here about five years. I do a lot of scanning, checking documents, some reception, and some correspondence. I don’t schedule events or make travel arrangements-- no one at my agency really travels, and honestly, our budget is small enough that we try to avoid it. Basically, my duties are more “administrative assistant” than “executive assistant.”

-There is no chance of me advancing or learning anything advanced at this job. None. Full stop, end of story. The people above me are pretty entrenched-- in order for me to get promoted they’d have to either retire or die. They’re also very possessive of their jobs-- whenever I’ve asked to see what they do so I can learn I’ve gotten rebuffed. They even say I’m “too eager.” I’ve mentioned this to my boss and he has been no help. The only other people in my office are attorneys, and I have no interest in going to law school.

-Over the past year or so, I’ve been doing some freelance writing on the side, mostly autobiographical essays with some book criticism every now and then. I haven’t gotten paid a lot, but I’ve gotten some exposure, and the position of writer is on my resume and LinkedIn. I have a WordPress that I originally intended to be a portfolio of sorts, but I’ve been bad at updating it. The biggest thing I’ve written has been an article I wrote on having Asperger’s-- it is the first thing that comes up when you Google my name, actually. I’ve kind of stopped writing for the moment, for several reasons, one of which being that I’m not sure how much I want/like it. I’d be open to writing again, just not at this point in time. 

-My work knows I have Asperger’s. I don’t want to get into it, but I disclosed it after there were a couple of incidents at work. They gave me my own office-- none of the other admins have one-- and decided that it would be best if I disclose it in a mass email. I thought it was a good idea at the time, and I wanted to keep my job so I went along with it.  I’m not sure if anyone else remembers it, given that it happened almost five years ago. But I still feel kind of embarrassed, and since the disclosure I have had various duties taken away from me. None of my current duties are what I was initially hired to do. I feel like I’m not really given a chance to prove myself, and I think some of my co-workers think I’m stupid. I’m kind of just the outcast in the office.

-Before this job, I was a customer service representative at an inbound call center. I was there for several months before I was laid off. I fielded calls and answered questions about a skincare product that you’ve heard of. I mostly enjoyed it, though it was my first real job out of college and I had no frame of reference. Later on I got frustrated by the lack of advancement opportunities and constantly having to talk to people, and at the time I was laid off, was starting to apply for admin assistant jobs, thinking they would be better. 

Interests/skills:
-I have a bunch of scattershot interests. A major one of late has been economics/finance. I didn’t take any econ courses in college or any math after pre-calc; anything related to finance or numbers was Greek to me and I never made any effort to prove to myself otherwise. I made the recent discovery, though, that I really enjoyed writing articles for this one money/budget related blog (about my own finance/money experiences, though-- nothing journalistic), and I also loved talking to people about what kind of credit card to get and credit scores. So, I decided to explore that further. I read an econ textbook recently and found it mildly interesting, and I’m an avid listener of Marketplace. I read Barbarians at the Gate recently and found it slightly confusing but really interesting, and it got me looking up various mergers on Wikipedia. I recently got a corporate finance textbook that I plan to read.

-I also plan to take an intro to corporate finance MOOC over the summer. The course is part of a business fundamentals series that I plan to get a certification for, and once I get it I’ll put it on my resume. I think this would not only convey an interest/knowledge of finance/business, but would also stand as proof that I could start and follow through with something. This would be out of pocket-- my work doesn’t have the money to pay for further education, and in my case they probably wouldn’t want to anyway.

-I’ve loosely been considering getting an MBA at some point, but I’m not sure what I’d want to do with it. I haven’t taken the GRE or GMAT. We are talking kind of pipe dream with this one-- it may not even happen.

-Other interests I have that might be salable: the city of Los Angeles, the American West/South/Texas (I’ve never been to any of those areas, but they fascinate me for some reason), entertainment industry news (I read Variety and Deadline for fun), television (I watch quite a bit of it), makeup/fashion, literature (not interested in publishing, but I do like to read). I like going down Wikipedia rabbit holes and just going wherever the wind takes me.

-I’m also bizarrely interested in American Express and have been since childhood. I even wrote an overly enthusiastic essay about it about it that some said sounded like an ad. I’m a cardholder, and when giving my opinion on CCs I recommend them whenever I can. Yes, this is an extremely bizarre interest. Yes, I’ve applied for jobs there (admin jobs, since that’s the only thing I’m qualified for right now). No, nothing has panned out.

-For other skills: I do have a really good attention to detail. I love analyzing things-- I had a lot of experience analyzing literature in college, but since then I’ve been fascinated with figuring out the whys and hows of something. I’m also persistent, and can be a really quick learner if I’m interested in the subject matter. I can type about 60 wpm. I’m really good at Internet research. I know some French and Italian, but I’m much better at reading/writing than I am at speaking. I plan to learn Spanish at some point but I don’t know when. I know my way around Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat, but not much else, though, again, I’m a quick learner. 

What I’m looking for in a job:
-I’m in NYC and I’d like to stay there for now. I want to move to LA sometime in the future--I love it there--but I don’t have a set date or anything like that. 

-I’d like to move out of the public/non-profit sector. If there’s a position that’s really, really, really good I might be able to make an exception, but generally I want out. 

-I’m an introvert, so while I have customer service/reception experience, I’m not overly big on non-stop interaction with people. That said, I’d seriously consider returning to a customer service role if the pay was right and there were definite advancement opportunities.

-I’d like to be somewhere where I can advance in my career, or at least learn something. It’s a huge issue at my current position, and I feel like if I had at least the opportunity to advance here I might not be so frustrated. I want to be promoted, and maybe even have my own assistant one day. Business cards wouldn’t be so bad either. I guess I’m trying to say that I want to feel valued.

-This may sound weird, but I really envy my friends who have to travel for work. I’ll be lucky if I ever make it up to Albany during my time here. I actually like traveling-- I don’t even mind dealing with the minutiae, like schedules. I wouldn’t say no to a job that required travel.

-The ability to work from home would be nice, too, but it’s not required or anything. It’s something I’d only do if I had to, and I wouldn’t make a habit of it. 

-I’m not currently in a position where I can take something super low-paying. I also need something with health insurance-- I had skull base/brain surgery last month, and while I’m back at work, I’m not technically fully healed and won’t be for the next several months. I have periodic doctor’s appointments scheduled for at least that long. Needless to say, quitting and taking an unpaid internship someplace is not an option. Neither is moving back home.

-I guess above all else, what I want is a job that won’t treat me as a less-than or attack me because of my Asperger’s, if such a thing even exists. I’m not valued at my current job and because of that I often feel like I have nothing to offer anyone, anywhere. I want to believe that this isn’t true. I want to know that there are workplaces out there that won’t mind my quirkiness and jobs that I can do well. I want to know how to find out if a potential workplace would be like that.

I’d appreciate literally any advice you all could give. Thank you so much in advance!

Long version:
Hello, I am 24 and about to graduate from a regular 4-year undergrad program in Computer Science, from a university in my city. I will preface right now by saying I run into a lot of issues in life by not planning ahead and doing things wayyy too late (Choosing post-secondary education, the right program, self-learning). I managed a 3~ GPA, pretty low because I bombed my first year courses (skipping too many classes!) but I turned it around in second year; by now I would not say programming is my ""passion"" but it is ""something I can do"".  I'm feeling pretty concerned because I feel I didn't actually develop any real skills in university; looking through a lot of job postings on the usual job sites, I honestly cannot imagine myself qualified for any of the positions, even with search emphasis on ""junior"" or ""entry level"" type postings. 

A few examples:

- Job postings usually include many languages that I honestly have no experience with. My only realistic experience is in C and Java; these were the only langauges that were used for any assignments, excluding ""introductory"" assignments for other languages such as Haskell or C++ which were really short. The introductory assignments were a joke; usually it was all filled in code and we just added a few variables or used one or two functions to demonstrate something. 

- The actual assignments we did in depth are not what I'd really call useful or applicable; I can't bring myself to put them to a portfolio even though I have nothing on there yet. Even ""term projects"" did not seem difficult or impressive now that I look back on it; the longest project I can recall was a very basic user chatroom for a networking course that was just two ""clients"" opening sockets to a ""host"" and exchanging messages. I had very few group projects, only one of which was a real group effort. The others either involved me doing all the work, or my minor contributions getting replaced by another guy doing everything himself instead.

- Regarding theory learning, I can't recall in particular any fancy algorithms or details about concepts that I suspect are really common knowledge-type in this field. I know what big-o notation is for but I'd have to read it again to use it in any meaningful way; same with things like trees or the many search algorithms. If I was given the topic I would probably recall doing it at some point but I'd really have to read up on it. I feel like when I was in grade school and studied XYZ topic for a test, only to forget it over the next 2 weeks after the test.


I feel like after 4ish years of post-secondary study I only learned to crunch away at a given problem, with a fair amount of googling related topics until I created a solution. What's worse (to me) is that I know a lot of material we learned is freely available online, if one has the patience to go through it.
I realize that I contributed to my own problems by not doing enough on my own initiative; I have no ""personal projects"" that I feel are worth putting on a portfolio. A week after I finished my last exam I tried to make a sort of easy image viewer to see what the top images on a subreddit are: It came out ""okay"" but is honestly what I think a person just learning Java could make: the GUI code (made with a GUI designer plugin) is longer than the actual back end stuff. I also know I didn't take time to learn or explore new languages. My biggest regret so far,  I didn't apply for a co-op program that could have given some internship experience although with hindsight I would have been disqualified from co-op because of low GPA in first year. 


Going forward from here, I'm planning to do some online research and self-teaching on languages that seem popular like python, ruby, or html/css (for front end), or perhaps one related to mobile developement (probably android because I don't have an iphone). I will obviously try to make some personal projects to put together a portfolio (Sidenote: Any suggestions for cool portfolio projects or relevant languages to learn would be welcome. ) However again I am thinking, if I have to do all this  self-teaching, what did I even learn in university? Even worse, is it even worth pursuing at this point or are these ""obvious"" signs that programming is not the future for me?


I am really looking for an answer to: How can I make my degree work for me after all this? Did I waste my time by not at least getting internship experience?

So I work as an intern at a company.  I am paid hourly, and thus I clock in and out into a computer scheduling system every day.  I don't want to give much more away about my company, so I will just say my hours are flexible.  I became suspicious of my fellow intern coworker clocking hours that he definitely did not work.  I ""not so accidentally"" checked his schedule and he logs in at home (anywhere from 7:00 am - 9:30 am) then commutes into work!  By the way, there is definitely no working going on, because he doesn't sign on to Lync or other forms to be reached.  So essentially, he's stealing money from my company, AND not putting in the work.  I want to bring this up somehow, but the way I found out also lacks much integrity.  My suspicions were proven correct, however.  What should I do?  I don't want to sound like a taddle tale, or have bad karma if you believe in it.

As a junior in a highly ranked school with a great GPA, shouldn't I be more or less swarmed by popular tech companies in the area? If not, I should be receiving moderate attention from names across the country.

1) I've only taken 250 and 131 and 132 currently here. Reinhardt said hell be a reference for me for the cs scholarships but nelson can't cause has too many people asking. So that leaves me with only 1 cmns reference instead of 2. Do you guys have any ideas on what I should do cause I do need to apply to these scholarships. Should I just literally go ask a random cmns professor and see what happens lol? I mean I'm kind of desperate here. Any Ideas would be helpful.

2) this is actually also very important but when do companies start opening up applications for fall co op positions? I would like to intern at a software dev company this fall and want to get a leg up by applying early. I know of course every company opens their applications at different times but is generally now a good time to start researching companies or do they tend to open their fall co op positions in the summer for people to apply to? Any insight would be appreciated, especially if you yourself had a software dev internship in the fall and spring?

I am a junior in EE, and trying to identify a career path that suits my interests. I have taken a lot electives in EE (double what I need) because I am very interested in a lot of areas. The problem is I can not find jobs that incorporate my interests. I am trying to identify possible career paths for when I graduate next May.

My favorite topics so far have been board level circuit design, PCB design, firmware development (embedded C and Assembly), and DSP.

It seems when I find firmware jobs they expect an in depth education in software of C++, java, cloud stuff.... that isn't too interesting to me. Most EE jobs I find seem to be pure board level design with PCB design, but no firmware. 

Are there jobs out there that let you do board level circuits, PCB design, AND firmware (embedded C and Assembly) or are these really two separate jobs? If this is possible what are the titles called, and what companies should I look at?

For some background I have had one internship doing PCB layout, and board redesign. I have another internship this summer involving digital design with FPGAs, DSP, and firmware in C. I have taken 300 and 400 levels in Embedded Systems (assembly and C firmware), circuit design (analog and digital), and DSP (signals and systems, control systems, and filter design). I have an okay GPA of 3.15.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

* Junior Software Engineering major at a smaller state school in the Northeast

* Experience: Internship last summer and winter using .NET and web development stuff


I'm currently working at a smaller company with less than 50 employees (been around for 25 years or so, but is really taking off now with their website and stuff). Their service is a webapp that helps buyers and sellers manage orders and bids on jobs. 

In the interview, they said I would be working on refactoring this webapp. What I didn't know, is that by refactoring they mean re-writing. This beast of a webapp (I'm talking over 1mil lines of code) they want re-written from the ground up. Apparently their development team used to be around 10 people, but right now it's just one guy maintaining it. 

I'm being paid **$12/hr**.

4gvyg4,9,2016-04-28,Should I sue my employer for pregnancy discrimination,Thepinkflamingo328,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4gvyg4/should_i_sue_my_employer_for_pregnancy/,"TLDR: Fired for foul language even though EVERYONE uses it in my workplace, including my boss. Blamed it on my pregnancy saying that the hormones have affected me in a way that he cannot control and cannot have me in the restaurant. I was suspended without pay until after the baby was born (6 weeks prior to due date), and then later terminated (3 weeks prior to due date). Should I sue for discrimination?

So I am 38 weeks pregnant. But when this all started, I was 33 weeks pregnant. Lets start there. 

I had an argument with an employee, not in my department, that stated he was refusing to follow an order I had just given him. I gave him the instructions at his work station then returned to my office. I was training the girl who would be replacing me while I was out on maternity leave. After giving the instructions, the employee came to my office about an hour or so later stating he was not going to follow what I told him to do. I should have written him up, but as he was in my office, uninvited, telling me what he was going to do and not do, I just felt myself snap. I told him he was being childish and immature. I raised my voice to him while arguing back and forth over the policy. He immediately went and told my boss about the situation. I called my boss later on that evening. He asked that we both write up incident reports about the situation. I continued to work my normal work week. 

The week following the argument, my boss suspended me without pay. Below is what he said to me while issuing the suspension. 

1. My supervisor said he told the employee that I argued with, “You can’t control what is going through Nicole with the pregnancy.”

2. I was told, by my supervisor that, “Your pregnancy has affected you. It’s affected you to the point that I can’t have you around my people. I can’t trust you in the state you’re in.”
 

3. My supervisor said, “Here is the decision we have made. You have two choices. I don’t want you coming back to work until after the baby is born. You can be suspended until after the baby is born or you can be suspended for a week and then your doctor puts you on medical leave. I can’t afford right now to take a chance… there is something going through your body, I can’t control this.” What authority does my employer have to make assumptions about my pregnancy health? I am not on bed rest. I am physically able to still be working.. 

I have voice-recorded evidence of all of these statements. If that is not proof enough that discrimination has taken place, there is also another incident, similar to mine that took place just two days prior. 

4. A male employee called a female employee a “fucking hooker.” The female employee reported it to my boss, and he addressed the incident with the male employee. No further disciplinary action was taken. He worked his normal scheduled work hours that week. Two days later is when my incident occurred for which I am being suspended.  How can I be suspended for using foul language for 6 weeks, when in the same time frame, another incident occurs and no more than a verbal warning is given. It seems that my employer took advantage of this argument and had used it as a convenient way to dismiss me. 

My supervisor claims that I am held to a higher standard, as an officer of the company, and that is why my punishment for foul language was so severe.  I disagree, as our policy book that I signed does not differentiate between employee rank in the company. Also, I have a voice recording between my supervisor and I where he berates me. I am not treated as an officer of the company by my direct superior, and therefore do not feel I am held to a higher standard. 

Further more, when first notifying of my employer of my pregnancy, around 6 weeks gestation, he asked “Is it ""bobs"" or ""sams""?” ""Sam"" was a summer intern who left 3 weeks prior to my pregnancy, and ""Bob"" is a student intern who returned to work 2 weeks prior to my pregnancy. On July 4th, my boss told an entry level employee that he was not paying for me to flirt with ""Sam"". The rumor spread through the restaurant and came back to me as “I’m not paying for her to have an affair.” No clarification of this rumor ever came to light. My Boss says he said “flirt” The employee he spoke to said he used the word affair. 

I have since been terminated from my job. During termination, my boss pulled out 6 write ups for various offences that I had NEVER seen before, dating back over a year prior. He asked me to sign them and I refused as I did not agree with him on most of the write ups, and believe that he wrote them up during the time he suspended me and fired me. 

Should I sue for pregnancy discrimination or should I let it go.

My major GPA is probably less. My planned specialisation is computer architecture. I got a C- in my Computer Architecture and Organisation class. I have 0 research experience. I have 0 publications. [My university](https://www.aus.edu) is ranked ~400 worldwide. (I'm American so I'm thinking about applying to US universities for masters)

I'm starting to toy with the idea doing a masters now. Universities like MIT or UT Austin are out of the question. I *could* ask professors if I could assist them with research (if their doing any) over the summer and into the fall although I don't think there's time to publish anything with my name.

Industry likes internships and projects. Academia likes research and publications. I'd have to decline the internship offer that I'll receive soon (I have a verbal offer already) to do research. I have to decide soon. So...

What are the chances of me getting into one of the less selective computer engineering grad schools (e.g. University of Virginia) assuming I get a little research under my belt? Is it worth attempting with my lack of qualifications? Should I just stick with my internship forget about grad school?

Oh and letters of recommendation probably aren't an issue. Most of my professors think I'm smart because I go to programming contests and hackathons and stuff.

_______________________________________

As for why I'm suddenly considering grad school.

This spring semester I've done really well especially in the course that computer architecture was a prerequisite for(advanced digital system design [mainly verilog]). I'm actually kind of enjoying assignments and I'm expecting mostly As. I've also been reading a lot about computer architecture both at a high level and lower technical level (if that makes sense). I think I've plugged a lot of the gaps in my knowledge. So I'd like to work in something related to designing chips but apparently its a [really hard](https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-become-a-computer-architect/answer/Dan-Zhang-1?srid=7myq) field to get into without a masters. Intel has 3.0 cutoff too anyway.

So basically as I started to work harder on my coursework I grew more interested in computer architecture."

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT. 

Details have been altered for readability, names have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty, and any similarities found to real events are *completely* unintentional. 

Our cast of characters:

* Myself: fresh college grad and PFY

* Susan: HR and classmate from college

* Dave: Owner of Orangered IT

* Jack: Senior support tech

* Arnold: Support tech manager, ex-Army Drill Sergeant (unconfirmed)

* Randy: Developer

* Jim: Security specialist

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part IV**

A new prospective client has been chatting with Jack on the phone. They were a small legal office whose IT guy quit with no notice a month ago, and now were looking at replacing some of the old equipment in their network closet. After some discussion about contract support and client needs, I'm given an email stating this will be a client under my wing if they sign on. In the meantime, they do need a new switch installed and want to meet someone from the company in-person. I should dress to impress, and the switch Jack sold them is in stock and paid for, install fee included. 

&gt; Please, please, just be an easy win. I don't want another grade-school scolding from Dave.

I arrive onsite about 10 minutes early, turquoise switch in-hand and a naive smile on my face to meet their Front Desk Lady (Emily, as not to confuse with SalesClient's FrontDeskLady). This is a law office, but it hosts two lawyers that have to have their own privacy between cases. Due to being cheap, they use the same office area, printers, networking equipment and secretaries. They are the legal experts, though, so I'm going to comply with what they say they need.

Emily: ""Lawyer1 and 2 are out today, but they said Orangered was sending someone to look at our computers and meet us.""

The lay of the land was fairly simple: two Lawyers, two office workers and Emily as the joint-secretary of the office. After some pleasantries, she explains that the two lawyers have to store things separately and that security is a concern now that they're working more sensitive cases. 

Also, their old IT guy was a cousin of Lawyer2 and he upset one of the office lasses and had to be escorted off site. And badge-in doors were suddenly installed. 

Emily downplayed the ordeal, and said Lawyer1 wanted to revisit some of the network to make sure it was secure, because the wires 'looked messy'. 

&gt; Sometimes, I feel like the Jaws tension music is our theme song. And we're the ignorant swimmer.

Once the network closet is open, I'm actually rather surprised. There's four little 4/5-port Linksys switches connected with a web of Cat5, with a modem and a small *labeled* patch panel for Cat5 lines running out to the office. All of it is quite clean, mounted to the wall and the wires are bundled with plastic zip-ties.

&gt; Well, I was expecting much worse. 

Some more discussion with Emily, and I find that her PC is used as file storage for Lawyer1, and she has another tower tucked under her desk used for storage for Lawyer2. They are on separate domains, separate monitors and keyboards, and no trusts have been created so they're effectively separate. Not my preferred setup, but it does meet their needs and was cheap.

After my review, I can't help but wonder why we sold them a switch. From my walkthrough, a KMC switch would be nice for the FrontDeskLady and a thorough review of access logs to verify Cousin was not trying anything funny should be all they need. Emily says that Lawyer1 doesn't trust Lawyer2's cousin's setup and wants a professional doing it. 

&gt; Fair enough, it's not that expensive of a switch anyway. Peace of mind for the cost seems legit.

I go back to the networking closet and it dawns on me: these Linksys routers from WorstPurchase are effectively all daisy-chained, right? None of these things support any fancy technologies, like VLANing or-

&gt; This switch doesn't support VLANs either. And these two MUST have separate networks.

A quick call over to Jack verifies I have the right switch he sold, but I recommended we use a switch supporting VLANs due to client needs. 

Jack: ""Just install VLANs or whatever on it. It's a turquoise switch, it'll basically do everything.""

ಠ_ಠ

Most_Humble: ""What's the price difference between the two switches? Can we just write off the difference as goodwill for a prospective client?""

Jack: ""You'll have to ask Dave.""

Most_Humble: ""Let me conference him in real quick.""

*Click*. Sounds like Jack is just as excited as I am about this.

Dave: ""Are you at LawClient yet?""

Most_Humble: ""I'm here, I've evaluated the site. The switch Jack sold doesn't support VLANs, which this client needs.""

Dave: ""Why didn't you sell them the VLAN switch?""

Most_Humble: ""Jack was the one who sold it, and the client site was en route for me so I fielded it.""

Dave: ""I'll send Arnold over to help you.""

*Click*. 

Emily seemed curious, so I went out and explained that I was recommending a better switch instead of the one that was sold, since Lawyer1 and 2 needed separate networks. I tried to keep the tech-speak to a minimum, and she seemed content. 

It didn't take long for Arnold to arrive. He was an interesting sight: slacks and button-up with tattoos clearly visible on his wrists and neck, shaved head and earring with a goatee. Almost cartoonishly villain-esque, as if he were about to explain his world domination plans. No switch was in sight, though.

*A quick breakdown of the client setup later.*

Arnold: ""Dave said you didn't know how to do this. Sounds like Jack just sold the wrong switch.""

Most_Humble: ""I told Jack and Dave that, but no luck. I don't suppose you brought a VLAN switch with you?""

Arnold: ""Well, I have an assortment in the back of the company van I brought. I'm sure we can figure something out.""

He takes me out to the parking deck, where I get my first glimpse of the company van: a big windowless iron bucket of technology on wheels. At least a dozen different boxed switches and routers sat in the back, tools scrambled all over the floorboards. I pick out another turquoise switch that is just a hint of a step up from Jack's with VLANs, headed back and had Arnold hover over the rest of my installation. I got a rather interesting chuckle from him with the enthusiasm I took to velcro-ing the cables in an organized pattern. 

Arnold: ""Next time, I'll just text you. If I followed Dave's orders, this wouldn't have been done today. I'll write off the expense of the switch. All things considered, I'll consider this a win.""

I thought I'd finally shown some prowess here, but I did not escape the malevolent email from Dave:

'Client was undercharged for services. Failure to adequately evaluate client needs and sold wrong hardware. You need to pay attention to detail next time, we don't have sufficient budget to send another tech to hand-hold you through a simple install.'

We are a couple (39m/37f).  We are so furiously angry but we will try to stick to the facts.  Names of everyone have been changed (obviously)

2009:  We are living in New York City, I (Aaron) am in grad school and working part time, my wife (Betty) is working in a non profit.  We decide to get an apartment in the city so we do not keep wasting money on rent.  This is difficult to do because NYC apartments (even in not great areas) are not cheap.  

Betty's father (Chuck) DECIDES--INDEPENDENTLY-- that he will help us with the down payment.  NYC real estate is a great investment.  So we let him give us a LOAN to help us out.  Let me be clear--this was a LOAN, and we had everything notarized.  We were FULLY planning on paying him back.  

Since Chuck is going to retire soon, the only way he could help us is by taking a second mortgage on his house.  But again--he WANTED to help us.  He winds up paying about 130k in a downpayment.  WHICH HE WANTS TO DO.   

Betty's OLDER sister (I'll just call her Horriblina (f/38), she's about 31 at this time) hears about this and throws a fit.  We BOTH think that Horriblina is jealous of us and that's why she's throwing the fit.  Chuck can't afford to help out Horriblina.  But Horrible has a job in the private  sector (so she's making much more than Betty) and also, she does not live in an area that is as great an INVESTMENT as NYC.  

2012: Through a series of things that cannot be avoided (we had a child, Aaron had some health issues, etc) we are not able to keep up with the mortgage payments.  It should be emphasized that we tried EVERYTHING.  Literally.  Working 20 hours a day, on weekends, begging money from EVERYONE we knew.  But ultimately, we just couldn't do it.  The strain drove us almost to mental collapse.  And we made the terrible, heart wrenching decision to go through with a short sale of the apartment.  

This was not an easy choice.  At ALL.  It strained everything: our marriage, relationships that both of us have had for DECADES, etc.  So then, we decided to move back with Aaron's family In Texas 

Chuck, seeing what strain we were under, generously decided (again--INDEPENDENTLY) to forgive the loan.  For which we were extremely grateful.  

2015: Chuck is diagnosed with cancer.  Horriblina is the closest of Chucks' three children geographically, plus her job (she's a lawyer) allows her to work basically within the bounds of CA.  So she is at his apartment.  

We think (we have no solid proof) that Horriblina was able to go through his papers (Chuck was also a lawyer, and kept EVERYTHING beautifully organized--taxes, bank statements, etc).  We think that she was able to a) find the original loan docs; b) find the corresponding bank statements and mortgage statements and c) find evidence (in emails) that the loan was forgiven.  We didn't SEE her pawing through his stuff, but she definitely has all the relevant docs NOW.   

Chuck ultimately passes on in May of 2015. 

Present:  Now, here's the tricky part:  Chuck's will states that his estate will be divided three ways: between Betty, Horriblina, and Eric (son from a different marriage).  It ALSO states that if one contests the will in probate, that the contester gives up the rights to the estate.  

When the Will was read, Horrblina (and her lawyer) threw a fit because we didn't pay back the loan.  But they were stuck, because of the no-contest clause.  I think they tried to say that was invalid but I don't know.  

NOW, we got a letter from the IRS, saying (basically) that Chuck's loan forgiveness was considered part of our income (!!!!).  Chuck NEVER intended that.  Chuck's money was an INVESTMENT, and sometimes, you lose on investments.  Chuck understood ALL of this when he invested with us.  Betty called her mom in a panic, trying to figure out what happened.  Her mom called Horriblina, and Horriblina just straight out admitted that she reported us to the IRS.  

So now, our questions are: 
1) What do we do about the IRS demanding money???

2) Can we sue Horriblina because she contested the will?  

3) Can we sue her for reporting us???  

Other facts that may be relevant: 

-At the time of the loan being made, Aaron hoped to be a computer programmer, and had lots of prestigious jobs and internships.  So this wasn't taking advantage of Chuck AT ALL.  

-We have two children, Horriblina has one, and Eric has one.  

Please let us know if more info is needed!

ETA:  We consulted already with Betty's Friend's Father, who is a lawyer in their hometown and who works with the IRS frequently.  He only told us to pay the IRS what it wants; which, obviously, we don't want to do.  However, he works mostly with big corporations, and he DID say that we could get a second opinion with a personal tax lawyer.  Before we spend the money, we want to know if it is worth it.  "

Those of you that have done this before, how did you source packing foam? Should it be antistatic? Am I overlooking anything? Any good horror stories of moves gone bad? The move is mid-May and we're near Toronto.

**Reflection:**
**Essays, Essays, Essays!** I didn't realize how important they were and because of it I delayed my essays a ton. I applied to Georgia Tech because they had a super early deadline to force myself to finish up my Common App Essay. I actually wrote 2 essays, gave them to my guidance counselor to read and then used the one he said was more powerful. I think applying to an early school to force you is a good idea and everybody should apply to at least one early school, if not for scholarships, but to set a deadline for yourself. Pour your heart out into essays my friends. I truly think they are the most important part of your application. I wasn't anything special to UChicago but I was given(in the words of my regional counselor) the largest merit scholarship that's not Stamps in our super competitive region. 
What's interesting too is that if you asked me where I would get in after I wrote my essays I'd be pretty spot on. I was very confident in my essays at UChicago and I got in. I was very genuine and I was happy with my essays for Stanford and I got waitlisted RD. (which is top 7% of applicants I think) For Princeton and Yale I wasn't too confident in my essay. 

Also, interviews suck. I never could get used to them and I think I did bad interviews at everywhere I applied to.
**INTEREST IS IMPORTANT**. Check if the college weighs interest or not and then be sure to show interest if they do. An example of this is UChicago. I showed a shitload of interest in them. I went on a diversity fly-in program and then wrote, what I and every teacher I've shown it to have said, the best essay I've written in my life about the college. At Cornell I showed no interest but was still admitted. In fact, I showed anti-interest. I cancelled a visit I was going to go on with the alumni committee because I was ""sick"".(I just really didn't feel like going)

Don't waste your early. Many schools only give scholarships to applicants who apply early and others give huge boosts in acceptance rates. An example of this is UChicago, which had a 10% EA acceptance rate this year, 2% EA-&gt;Defer-&gt;RD acceptance and 4% RD. They deferred a lot so the real ea acceptance rate was ~ 11-12%, almost 3x as much as RD. 

In retrospect, I'm not bitter that I didn't get into Yale,Princeton and Duke. I wouldn't have been able to attend even if they did accept me. My net price calculator put them ~30k above what my family can afford. My only real regret is not applying to USC. I fell in love with them after their scholarship deadline :(

Also, **do what makes you happy and what you want do and you'll do well in the college admissions process. Just be sure to do something. At worst, you'll have spent your high school years doing what you like to do.** Take courses because you want to, not because you have to. Every course I took was because I wanted to and I craved the knowledge. I figured: I'm going to be in school anyway, might as well make the most of it and learn the most possible. All my ECs were me and were because I wanted to do them. 


After much deliberation between Maryland and Chicago, I'll be attending UChicago."

I'm currently working as an intern at a small company where I have to do an assignment for my study. Although me and my boss have some different views and I'm very curious what the input of you guys on the project is.

Goal: create a compact system that can hold and transport small balls (d=2.8mm) non stop. The reserve consists of a few thousand balls. The system shouldn't be able to get jammed easily and if so it should be easy to fix it (it's purpose is to be part of a mass production line in China).

The biggest challenge are:
-The balls have to move against gravity.
-The balls get jammed easily at the end of a funnel etc.
-There should always be a ball input so it's easy to make the input&gt;output, however this can lead to extra pressure/friction on parts.

My favorites:
-Transport with an Archimedes screw. The same screw can be used to keep the balls in reserve moving so they don't get jammed.
-Air pressure. This is a simple method with little chance of failures. However I haven't fount an appropriate manner of stopping the balls from getting jammed.

I'm a senior computer science and math major with two semesters left for my undergrad. I finish out my CS courses this semester and then work on finishing out the math courses. I'm working on deciding what the next step in my career should be, either working in industry or pursuing my graduate degree.

I attend a medium sized state school with a relatively small CS department. I currently have a 4.0 cumulative GPA, and after this summer will have completed my third internship.

I'm positive that I want to eventually get my graduate degree and Phd, because I know I want to teach at the university level after working for a while. Would I be better off working and then getting my graduate degree, or applying for grad school during my last couple of semesters while all of my knowledge is still fresh?

I've also been looking into programs like CyberCorps, which is a government sponsored program that pays for grad school in cyber security. Are these programs worth considering, or is it better to find a way to pay for grad school myself?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!"

I started working here as an intern making 21.50 an hour. It was a program through my school where you work for 6 months then go to school for 6 months. This pay was negotiated in May of 2014 and implemented in September of 2014, when my final co-op started. 

My frustration begins as I was VERY transparent with them. I received an offer for $23 an hour, however, it was a bit farther. I created a sheet with the current travel expenses and the travel expenses had I switched jobs and said ""This company is offering me $23 an hour but is a further commute. In order for me to have the same take home pay here, I would need to be making 21.50 an hour. Is this something we can agree to? If not, I will be taking the other position."" They immediately agreed that it's fair to pay me the 21.50 and have me stay. 

I completed my last co-op at the company and was working part time while going back to school. In June of 2015, still making 21.50 an hour, I approached them to see if they were interested in hiring me as a full time salaried employee upon my graduation in December of 2015. I only asked because if they did not plan on hiring me, I needed to look for another job. They said they were planning on offering me a position before September to come on full time in December. Gave me the rundown of vacation/benefits and told me we would discuss pay in January of 2016, when everyone's annual review was.

This past January, my review came around... I got all great reviews from all 3 partners and was given two more responsibilities that were added to my job title because they wanted these titles to be recognized by the firm and our clients since ""you would be the first one we'd hire had you just walked off the street and applied."" At the very end of the review, there was a small sentence ""Oh, we'll talk about your salary after tax season(were an accounting firm)"" and then I was rushed out of the room.

I was obviously a little confused as I had been told back in June that my salary would be discussed during my review. I approached one of the partners and told them my situation. I said ""My rate was negotiated when I was an intern back in May of 2014 and I've had the same rate since September of 2014. I am now a college graduate with two more positions meaning much more responsibilities... I feel those should be reflected in my salary."" I was asking for 50,000, which I thought was incredibly reasonable.

The partner skirted around the whole ""Well a salary means you need to work until the work is done. Everyone is getting more responsibility with new clients and everyone only got a 2-3% raise. You're asking for a 13% raise."" I rebuttled with ""I share in that 'new client responsibility' as well as managing our new client portal and being the technical coordinator. You don't think I should get 3%, as everyone else, plus 5% for each of my new roles? That would get us to the 13%.. And pretty fairly in my opinion""

He once again skirted around the argument and said he would talk to the other partners and get back to me. Which he never did.

Now, since tax season is over, I'd like to bring it up again. However, my research is suggesting that I should be asking for more. I am not entirely sure how to go about finding out an actual figure. 

A Staff Accountant at a small accounting firm in our area makes about 50k. Technical coordinators make about 47k and client service managers make about 42k. If I added those together, I would get 139k, which seems very absurd to me.

My main role is the accountant so my starting point is 50k, I'm just wondering how much(%) of the other two salaries I should take to add to that 50k to get an actual number to ask for. 

I'm going to pose it as ""I had time to do research from my rejected offer until now and it turns out I should be making more than I initially asked. This is the number I came up with and how I came up with it. If that can not be met, I will be looking for employment elsewhere.""

Help! Feel free to ask any questions as I realize it may seem a little complicated.

I asked to have until wednesday to decide, but they sounded in a rush so I am supposed to tell them by Monday. I have never been there but they are from what I have read everywhere a good major company to work for and in an industry that I am interested in. They are 45 minutes away from my house.

I'm finishing up my first year at college. I took one computer class so far, which is ""Intro to CS"", where I learned C++. I want to learn Swift in the next couple of months, by myself, so that I can get an internship in the future, knowing more languages. I am a really good learner, but my problem that I'm lazy and I often lose motivation, but if I apply myself to my studies, I can get pretty good grades.. There is nothing else I'm really good at but computers. 

Now my questions:

1-) I stutter. My stutter is from moderate, to severe. Throughout the year my stutter becomes light, but is not that often nor it last for a long period of time. As a Software Engineer, how much talking do you have to do? How is this going to affect my interviews?

2-) I really have no connections to no one. I'm solo on this. Am I going to possibly get far like that? 

3-) How do keep yourself motivated? How do you practice coding at home?

4-) What are the languages I MUST learn in the next 3 years?

As cheap as possible, usa.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
With my budget whatever I can get, prefer single laptop though.
* **How important is weight to you?**
 Anything under 8 pounds would be spectacular.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 I've used all 3 so doesn't really matter. Although premier runs a lot smoother on osx and windows.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Once again with my budget whatever I can get.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
I am going to be using photoshop and premier on almost a daily basis for college work and interning at a small business. The only games I would play on it would be League of Legends, dota 2, and blizzard games. 

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
I know I'm being very vague and I apologize for that, I understand that I won't be able to play any of the titles listed above on great settings, although no stuttering would be ideal.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 A somewhat decent build quality as I will be travelling with it in my briefcase every day.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
Once again I would like to apologize for being so vague. I am nearing the end of my schooling and start interning middle of May. This laptop would primarily be an inbetweener if I had to put a name on it. I'm pretty broke right now so it only has to last me until I finish my internship and get hired in my field. After that I will be making enough money to afford something better. Thanks.


Edit: The price I'd be willing to pay is literally just as cheap as possible. I technically could go up to 500 but if you think I can get by with 200 or something that would be sweet."

4h1mal,1,2016-04-29,Recent Graduate Troubles,microcosm12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h1mal/recent_graduate_troubles/,"Hello people of cscareerquestions. I haven't been on Reddit in a long time, but I am writing today because I am looking for some perspective, advice, and hope. I guess I'll start with my background. Please skip the rest of this paragraph if you are in a hurry. Ever since I was a little kid I fell in love with computers. They were incredibly fascinating to me even though the closest thing to a computer I had in my house was my dad's (my mom still used a typewriter) work laptop, which I was only rarely allowed to use, and my PlayStation, which completely blew my mind when I first got it. Towards the end of middle school my older brother, who was in high school at the time, bought a computer and started taking a Visual Basic programming class that the high school taught. He taught me a little of it and I was addicted. I started learning as much about programming as I possibly could. When I got to high school I took the Visual Basic class myself along with all of AP Computer Science classes that were offered. In fact I took almost any class that had anything to do with computers: graphic imaging, auto cad, IT, etc. I joined the two technology related clubs that were offered: tech club and the robotics team. I also got my CompTIA A+ certification. I was so obsessed with computers and programming in high school that I slacked off in my other classes to program instead of doing homework when I got home, and I took multiple study halls my senior year so I could spend more time learning about programming on my own. I graduated high school with okay grades and decided to go to the local satellite campus of a reputable university. I did this not just because my grades weren't the best in high school and their entry standards were lower, but because it was affordable.

&amp;nbsp;

I went through five years of college going a minimum of 12 credit hours a semester and working 30-40+ hours a week depending on the semester. While I was in college I worked as a delivery driver for a pizza place in between school and home. In 2014 I found an internship for a local startup software company. I worked there for about 8 months. It started off as part time during the spring semester (yes I worked two jobs and went to school full time during this semester. It sucked.), but became full time during the summer (I took the summer off from the pizza place). I hated it. The place was poorly run. The owner had a habit of micromanaging and setting insane deadlines even though he had no software or technical experience of any kind. He also reminded me of my troubled, abusive home life as a child with constant screaming and fighting, either with the investors, interns or with the project manager. By the end of high school most of my family problems were starting to resolve and go away, and it felt like working for him was sucking me back into it. I was miserable. The project manager was overworked and rarely knew what was going on with the interns. About half of the interns could barely program FizzBuzz or speak and understand English. The good news is the other half (maybe closer to a third) of the interns were great. I really loved working with them and we accomplished a lot. The internship ended in August and I had no plans on returning. Unfortunately, because I am/was poor I couldn't afford to move away, and the only industry in my area is/was fast food and retail. As a result this was my only internship. During my last semester of college I started applying to jobs, and I went to the large career fair the main campus had. The only nibble I got was with Facebook. Most others either ignored my applications or told me to apply once I graduated. I managed to get an in-person technical interview with Facebook. Boy was I excited! The interview went badly though, (my mind tends to go blank when under severe pressure) and I didn't get the job or another interview. It sucks but life goes on, so I spent the rest of the semester focusing on school and trying to be positive. In December 2015 I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science (minor in Math) and a 3.0 GPA. Since then I have been applying to many jobs only to get rejection emails or to be ignored.

&amp;nbsp;

After I graduated I maintained my shitty pizza delivery job until last week. The delivery job really sucked. Management was extremely unprofessional and lots of the other employees had criminal records and came to work drunk and/or stoned. The job was very dangerous (we had a driver get robbed at gunpoint) and the wages were bad (I didn't get even a 10 cent raise in over five years and a shocking number of people don't understand the concept of tipping). I had thought about quitting many times over the years, but didn't because it was so flexible with my school schedule. I had finally had enough when a manager shouted and berated me for not answering her unimportant phone call when I was on the phone with a customer. I quit on the spot. It felt good at the time, but I have bills to pay and now no income. Since I haven't had much luck with programming jobs (just Facebook and one other place that tried to catfish me into doing data entry) I started applying to low wage jobs. A couple days after I quit I got an interview with a nearby grocery store as a stocker. Today I received a phone call with a job offer. The job only pays $7.50 an hour but I took it because I am desperate. I am starting to lose hope and becoming frustrated. Why the hell did I suffer and struggle working and going to school for the past five years to get good degree with a decent GPA only to be working with a bunch of high school kids for a quarter over minimum wage in my state. I went to school for computer science because I wanted to do programming work. I am very passionate about programming and have been programming every day since middle school. As happy as I am for their success, it is very demoralizing seeing people I graduated with who had poor programming skills, no passion, little motivation, and no experience get good jobs with high wages while I am stuck with crappy minimum wage jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

I have started to expand the companies I apply for. I have been applying recently for IT positions, even low level and low paying ones. One I applied to required a minimum of a high school diploma and an optimal candidate was to have an associates degree in a computer related field preferably computer science. I applied to this job and got a rejection email a few days later. WTF I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE! I HAVE AN A+ CERTIFICATION! Why on Earth did I not at least get a phone screening? I am sorry if this sounds like a long-winded rant from a depressing person, but I am normally not like this. My situation is making me sad and depressed.

&amp;nbsp;

I am telling my story because I want to hear your stories and if anybody can relate to my situation. I am looking for hope and advice. What did you guys do to get your first job after graduating? Thanks for listening."
4h1oam,1,2016-04-29,Current web development intern being offered a (low) salaried position,wakerider47,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h1oam/current_web_development_intern_being_offered_a/,"I am a web development intern for a small company in the Bay Area in California. A little background:

 - I am paid 20/hr (which calculates to roughly 41k/yr)
 - I have been here about 6 months and have demonstrated that I do quality work
 - The only other person on my team left about 2 months ago, so I am the sole caretaker of my particular portion of the system
 - I left a higher paid Tech Support job somewhere else to take this internship as I wanted to use my degree

I was recently given a salaried offer of 55k, significantly lower than average entry level web devs in the area make. I knew a couple of things going into this though that would play in my favor.

 - They would be up shit creek if I left (literally no one else here knows the system I work on) and it would be very difficult to jump in and figure it out (the developer before me had very poor practices and sloppy style)
 - We are at a very important/busy stage of production

So I told him that the salary was way too low (I wasn't specific on how much I wanted) and he said he would go talk to the CEO, but that there was a good chance he would say no. In the meantime, I am going to start looking at job listings in the area, but I really do want to stay with this company as the location and culture is a perfect fit for me. So here is my question:

If the offer stays the same... is there any reason I should not just accept it (which is still a raise), find a better job at my leisure, and ditch (and screw) the company I'm at? I can't help feeling like I have the upper hand here and that they would be pretty stupid to not offer me a fair salary. Am I missing something?"

4h1w62,6,2016-04-29,Need advice - Employer changed terms of offer day before I'm scheduled to start,howzlife,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4h1w62/need_advice_employer_changed_terms_of_offer_day/,"This is with regard to a job offer I got from a major tech company. I'm in Ottawa Canada, the position is in Toronto. 

I interned at this company last summer in Toronto, and was offered a full-time position at the end of my internship, once I had finished my studies. My start date is May 2nd 2016 (i.e. monday). At the time I accepted the offer (last september), the terms outlined were: 

95k salary, 27k signing bonus, 20k bonus second year, and 53k in stock vested over four years. I should note that the email that contained the offer letter did say that the terms could change depending on where you are placed, however the offer letter I signed had those terms clearly outlined. 

I accepted, and was informed that I was placed back in Toronto sometime last November. I didn't hear anything that had to do with my salary changing between the time I got my offer (September) and today (April 29th). With the salary I was offered, I relied on it to get an apartment in Toronto, moving truck, etc. I was also given relocation expenses. 

So I'm scheduled to start monday, and I'm all set to move this weekend from Ottawa. They sent me a link yesterday with some documents to sign digitally - read them all, no problem. Then they sent me ANOTHER link today at 3pm (Friday, April 29th - 3 days before my start), with a new offer letter for me to sign, with different, significantly lower terms. The terms are: 

$80k starting salary (down from 95), 15k signing bonus (down from 27), and 10k second year bonus (down from 20). I emailed them asking about the discrepancy, and they simply told me that, since I was in Toronto, the terms were different than had I been placed where their head office is in the US.  

My issue is that this is literally the last business day before I start, and I relied on the previous offer for things like finding an apartment, car, relocating, etc. I also haven't applied to any other companies in the last 8 months, so its not like I have competing offers. 

What should I do? It's pretty douchey of them to bring this up to me on the last business day before I start, and its a big deal - it amounts to over 80k over 4 years, which is 20k per year lower. So its not like its a small amount. Also, it obviously gives me no chance to negotiate. 

I haven't signed the new letter, and I plan on going in monday. But should I talk to HR? Just sign the offer? Take the offer but start looking elsewhere? Ask for what I was promised? 

Any help is welcome "

In my GIS classes, I've learned a lot about GIS and Geography basics...enough to be dangerous basic concepts like projections, rasters, vectors, various tools within ArcMap, basic buzzwords and lingo etc. 

My idea was to just use Google Maps API, store all the data in GeoJSON files for each marker and import them to the map or try and use a database with SQL...but maybe is there a better route to do something like this?     

I do know the basics of web development. Not too concerned with knowing what languages to learn...just like what frameworks or tools to use to do something like this.

None of these procedures were recorded anywhere at the time.  I feel like she makes up the some of our policies as she goes sometimes.  So I am forced to ask her for information that isn't recorded anywhere that she may be pulling out of her ass.  She then treats me as if I am one of the 60 year old users that we support and not the trained professional that I am.  She treats me the same as our intern.  I have told my boss how I feel about this and he has had the same conversation with people in my position a few times over the past twelve years that she has worked there.

4h3h4k,9,2016-04-30,"Struggling with my internship, was told I'm not technical. How do I better advocate for myself?",noobintern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h3h4k/struggling_with_my_internship_was_told_im_not/,"Two months ago I started my internship at a well-established software company. I came from a boot camp type training program for cyber security (learned a bit about penetration testing/web application security etc.) which “partners” of the program use as a pipeline. An internship is pretty much guaranteed after completion and placement is dependent on if the team is deemed a cultural fit. In my case however, my program saw an opportunity for a new partner and sent me and another student to interview for security analyst spots for said company. We did extremely well during the interview and the team immediately took us on a campus tour and meet and greet with the team.

I’ve always been a shy person and hate being in the spot light so at first I was excited to be going into the internship with let’s call the person “S”. Through the program we attended together, I observed S as being a “people person”. He isn’t shy when approaching people, isn’t awkward about networking, and is very good at connecting with people. Me, I don’t mind networking since I know it’s a key factor to my success long term, but I dislike making connections just for the sake of networking. I tend to be more reserved and take longer to open up or work myself up to approaching someone. That’s why I was glad to be partnered with S. During the interview, he would lead on personality type questions while I would answer all of the technical ones to which he would echo what I said in his own words. I mentioned during the interview that gaming is a hobby of mine, and the manager shared that I’d fit in just fine since the team talks about gaming constantly.

Fast forward to the start of my internship, the first week went extremely well. They had a well-documented training program to get new hires up to speed. It laid out what each week would look like and what we should familiarize ourselves with. I got through all the reading my first week there and was eager to start shadowing and eventually handling incidents on my own. However, we were then told to shadow current analysts and to work on a training document for the remainder of our internship. At first I wasn’t too worried as I thought maybe the ramp up time is just a bit on the longer side… Np, I’m patient. Another couple of weeks pass with no progress and still the only project assigned to us was to work on said training document. Although we weren’t assigned work I made sure to keep myself busy and contribute in any way possible. I started taking notes during scrum meetings since I observed members of the team asking questions/having difficulties with things covered during the meetings. I received good feedback and am now the designated note taker (yay?). While shadowing I brought an email that was initially overlooked to the attention of one of the analysts that ended up being reopened and escalated for investigation. I think this helped me gain some trust as the next day one of the analysts walked me through using a template to respond to a user. I sent the email thinking YAY things are changing as I’ve earned myself more hands on. Sadly, I received an email from my supervisor later that day saying that I should get approval before reaching out on behalf of the security team. I had to explain to him that I did it under the watch and instruction of an analyst and that it wasn’t something I did to try to show that I’m taking initiative. I was well aware of the procedures set in place and explained to him that it wasn’t my intention to deviate. 
This was extremely demotivational since I worked hard in the program (top of my class) to do penetration testing/web application security type of work and now can’t be trusted to send an email using a template with supervision. Still, I figured slow ramp up time… I understand.

The interns (S and I) would meet weekly with the manager and sr. manager to discuss our progress and give feedback to the team. Each time they would say that we’re doing great and that we’re exactly the type of people they look for in new hires except there were cuts in their department and that they’re already over by 1 hire. Although the likely hood of us being converted into full-time employees post internship is very low, members of them team (mangers included) were looking for opportunities for us to stay within the company until a position opens up etc. Great news... 
A week later our supervisor came to us and shared that he has plans for the both of us. They were looking into sending S into a DevOps or penetration testing role while I was being sent to compliance. DevOps/penetration testing was exactly my thing and what I was interested in. S is not a very technical person so I couldn’t understand why he would be referred for a more technical role while I was to do more documentation work (which I hate). Through the program, I often had to help him with websites, servers, tutor him on how to do various tasks, and frantically troubleshoot why his scripts weren’t working before class when they were due (copy/paste while not being aware of smart quotes).

I was actually very disappointed but an opportunity is an opportunity so I thought to myself they probably trust me to give me work in compliance pertaining to our security team. After about a couple days I started to feel better about my opportunity with compliance but then we had another interns meeting. During that meeting S asked for feedback from the managers and they basically said the same thing as always. You’re both doing great work, keep it up… Then added that this is a more “technical” learn for me and that I should work on being more technical. Sure, great advice except they couldn’t give me any specific examples or reasoning as to why they thought I was struggling technically?
Since the start of my internship S and I have not had the opportunity to show what we can do technically. The only project that we were able to work on was a training document. One that was assigned to both of us. One that he refused to work on so I had to complete myself (he also received credit). 

Another thing is that there is a tool we use that I found a free online certification for which I shared with S and we both signed up for. It was a WebEx class so I showed up to work at 5 AM to prep for it since it started at 6. S was a no show and didn’t come in until 9 to which he was hours behind already and I had to help catch him up to speed. After completing labs, I took the exam and passed to receive my certification. S begged me to take it for him. I told him that he should at least attempt and if he’s still struggling I would help him. He never passed the exam but tells the managers that he is certified.

I'm mostly upset because I receive feedback saying that the internship is a more technical learn for me while S is doing just fine and should do work more challenging than an analyst.

Basically, my question is how do I better advocate for myself technically? And how do I deal with a partner who lies about his qualifications?

The job is provided as a partnership between my Uni and the company. They are offering visa fees paid for. 3K$ upon arrival to help with accommodation. And 18-25$ a hour. I will be based in either Seattle or Boston. The amount they are paying sounds like a lot to me as in the UK a similar position would only be netting me around 10-15$ an hour. But I know these cities are expensive. If this was on either the lower end or the higher end of what they are offering me would I be able to live comfortably and have a good time over there? I'm leaning towards the Boston area if I get to choose as the flights back to the UK are pretty cheap. What are your thoughts? 

I really want to get out to America after I graduate so this may be the best option I have.

My focus at my internship is in SSRS coming up soon, so if there are specific tutorials on building reports and using the software for reports/dashboards that would be great!"

Everyone is fairly tight knit, and many of the employees have worked together in some capacity for years.

When I started, I was excited to finally get some exposure as a developer. I was told I'd be working in languages and frameworks I was keen to gain experience with, and would have a mentor to answer my questions and take some ownership of my learning. 


Unfortunately, after starting with the company it quickly became obvious that my team lead's attendance record was poor. There have been roughly 160 work days since I started in August, and in that time he's taken 58 sick days and 15 vacation days. 72 days off since the end of August, you read that right.


At this point, it's basically become ""flip a coin, maybe Mike comes in today"". The most frustrating thing to me is how nobody on my team discusses it. Nobody mentioned to me, ""Hey the person who's supposed to be giving you some direction and feedback is going to be out of the office nearly half the time you're here"". They act like it's some unusual event when we're holding another status meeting and our team's head is missing - honestly the other senior developers are the leaders of the team in all but name.


My confidence in my ability to write code has absolutely cratered. Mike missed nearly 3 weeks of my first month when needs for onboarding and guidance were at their highest. I was told that another developer would help me get ramped up, but this new guy's explanations were so poor and contradictory at times that I got nowhere. Imagine taking the time to work through a tough task for the better part of two weeks, getting guidance from the more junior developers on my team and people outside of it. I'm feeling pretty good about what I've written, tests are passing. Mike comes in after a lengthly absence, reads through my code and tears it apart. He doesn't like that I used a design pattern his team typically avoids, he's confused as to why I didn't make use of some obscure classes that our platform team created three years ago (and that I've never seen until he mentioned it). All of these comments are delivered in a terse and condescending way, then poof - he's gone for an indeterminate amount of time because ""Dang, I started feeling sick again"".


Mike is a nice enough guy outside of work. He's clearly smart and when he's around he often has some very helpful advice to give. What's frustrating is that he's never explained WHY he is absent so often. I completely sympathize with his situation if he's struggling with physical or mental health issues, however I think it's irresponsible on his (and more importantly, our company's) part to maintain his position. 


I'm a highly driven individual. I want to be good at what I do and I want to make the most of this opportunity. It really bothers me to watch the company's other interns make an impact on their respective teams while receiving consistent feedback and guidance. I kept telling myself it would get better, that I could learn what I needed without having my supervisor present. I didn't bring up my frustrations because I didn't want to rock the boat. Requests to move to other teams on a different pretence were rejected.


I'm wrapping up this internship in May before starting a new one with a different employer in June. I'm honestly feeling absolutely defeated, like I'm a crappy developer incapable of learning. I really enjoy working with software, but now I'm going in to the next job with no confidence. The silver lining is that I've met my new team and have been really impressed by how well they communicate and function together.


Anyways, that's my rant. I'd appreciate people sharing advice.

4h5p46,2,2016-04-30,Econ student looking for advice on landing first finance internship or entree level position.,anxstudent101,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4h5p46/econ_student_looking_for_advice_on_landing_first/,"
Looking for some career advice and guidance. Background - I’m early 20s F and started a liberal arts education at a really good school. Stopped and started working in media business development for about 2 years. Realized the culture wasn’t for me, I wanted something more analytical and fast paced and enrolled in a cheaper state school where I live and am finishing my degree in Econ. Right now, I’m focusing on getting a bulk of my gen ed requirements out of the way and I haven’t taken any Econ courses yet. I read a lot, follow courses online, write about business and talk to the coupe of friends I have in finance and that’s the extent of my ‘technical’ finance/econ credentials. I also live in a very popular city for finance. 

Once I was back in school I started reading a lot about pursing a career in finance and the path people take and have become very insecure and lacking confidence because everything I read tells me to have rich parents, come from an Ivy, be a member of every club and sports team available to you and have something stellar and singular to put on your resume that sets you apart from the thousands of other applicants. I have a really strong resume that shows I have stable work experience and have excellent grades, pretty good SAT scores and qualifications. But, I don’t have any ‘finance’ criteria necessarily. Which makes me feel like that is something I need to focusing on this year to put on my resume. I can graduate by late 2017 or early 2018, depending on my course load. Part of me feels like I should relax for the rest of this year and complete the bulk of my credits, but another part of me is afraid that if I don’t start building a more finance targeted resume that I will be fucked. Is this normal? Am I being irrational/jumping the gun or practical and smart? I don’t understand how so many 20 year olds who have no work experience can somehow get internships on the trading floor of major BBs while someone a couple years older with years of bizdev experience (me lol) feels massively under qualified and scared to even apply. (not a rhetorical statement, I really don't understand! What do they talk about in interviews? Course work and how taking a class on financial modeling and reading The Intelligent Investor inspired them to work in finance? Real question). 

I understand networking is very important, but like I said I don’t come from a super finance heavy community - does that really matter? Most of the people I know who have stable careers in finance (young and old) just applied online and took it one step at a time. Is the internet making me more insecure with these “10 steps to a career in finance” overgeneralization of the market? Has anyone else felt this way? I would love to start interning for something related to finance/accounting by the fall semester that would be 2-3 days a  week so I could continue with taking 18 credits, is this realistic? Both my schools job/career nets are decent (even though my previous school is a major feeder into wall st), what are other good places to look online? Should I be reaching out to recruiters or people via linkedin? If so, how do I do that? What do I say? I appreciate any and all feedback, but please be specific! I’ve been reading every other post on every forum I can find and everyone’s feedback and advice is very general and vague. 

Does anyone really know what part of finance they want to pursue while they’re in college? Maybe this is a poor perspective on the outside but how can anyone really explain to an interviewer why they want to be an investment banker when they’re 20 and have never had a job? Do recruiters/interviewers believe these answers lol? What are they looking for?

If its too soon for finance, what are some other options that seem more realistic that would be impressive to financial recruiters? Or maybe looking into smaller boutique firms? 

People in finance - how did you get your first job/internship? School career fair? School job/career site postings? Did you stress as much as I'm stressing haha? Did you applying through company website? Recruiter? Connection? Any specific feedback of the process, what you put on your coverletter, things to add to resume, important extra curricular or other work you think made a significant impact on your application. Should I be panicking... 

A very helpful question to answer - what exactly do you do as an entree level intern in finance or accounting? Specifically. I would like to become more familiar with these skills so I can add to resume and cover letters and feel more prepared for interviews. 


Thank you! "

I am a potential incoming freshman (70% sure), and I was wondering what the Rutgers subreddit thought I should major in.  If anyone would be kind enough to link me some sort of CS curriculum so I can get a better feel for what the program focuses on that would be awesome (I saw the ECE curriculum).  I got accepted as a CpE major, but I am still considering CS.  I know the basics of java, and I really enjoy OOP.  The ECE curriculum (w/ Computer Concentration) seems reasonable, but would that be enough to land a job / internship as a software engineer (or equivalent title)?  With CpE, I was hoping for a mostly software concentration (with a novice to medium understanding of hardware) incorporating engineering principles along with it.

Thanks in advance"

4h6egk,2,2016-04-30,Burned out and a bit confused on how to proceed,tyrael71,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h6egk/burned_out_and_a_bit_confused_on_how_to_proceed/,"**Background**
I graduated from a CS+Econ bachelors last summer, decided to take a year off anything related to academia and did some freelance work + a product management internship until now. During college I worked full-time. I have approx. 2 years of experience as an engineer (web+mobile) + 1 product management internship + some projects. I am 22.

**Current situation**
I have been job/internship searching for a few months, my mistake was that I started applying late and most intern slots are taken. Currently I am discussing full-time opportunities with a few startups (but none of the Big 4/big ones). I have also been accepted to a few MSc's in London and Amsterdam (I am from Europe).

Currently it seems my options are either doing a masters (I've been accepted to a few programs in the UK) or going for a full-time opportunity.

**Problem**
I am somewhat burned out because of the very disappointing culture of the teams I have previously worked with. Although I feel I've learned a lot technically, the environment hasn't been oriented towards growth and some of the work was what I would call meaningless. As such, I've developed what you would call 'trust issues' with regards to the next company I work for. I don't feel attracted to the companies I am currently discussing with but don't have anything else lined up either.

I am not sure if this is the right attitude to have as there much more developers than there are companies and I haven't been working for a lot of time in the field, however right now it feels like 80% of the companies out there are doing completely pointless things. I love programming, however I would like to contribute to a product/company that is actually doing something meaningful.

I decided to learn some new things and have been learning golang and doing a machine learning course and am really enjoying learning on my own and doing my own small projects. These past months of learning on my own have been much more enjoyable and fulfilling than what I've previously done. *If I would not accept a job for a while and continue to learn on my own, how much of a hit would my career take?*

Another issue right now is confidence. I feel like I am not good enough for the companies I would want to work for. *For a person just out of school with some experience what would it be strange to wait until I do a masters and apply for an internship this fall?* I've done ~200 problems on leetcode/hackerrank/lintcode and all the problems in CTCI (I enjoy problem solving), however after applying for their full-time positions I haven't heard anything back.

I am sorry if this is not very coherent, I am still trying to understand exactly what the issue is, however having just recently finished school there is somewhat of a pressure to get into work again."

I'm a 21 yo student studying CS, currently in my second year. I only started programming in my first year of university so I had no prior experience with it before that.      
I have been taking it very seriously, because I want to be in a very good position financially by the time I'm 25.      
Everyone I know from the field, says I need to dedicate a lot of my time to study , practice programming , work on personal projects, and this will put me ahead of most people when I'll be looking for jobs.        
I enjoy programming but I can't say I enjoy doing it in my free time. I have other hobbies that I would like to develop. I also want to have a normal life outside. Rest on weekends, go hiking, travel, clubs too.     
But everytime I'm doing something different than programming , I feel kinda guilty, because I'm not working towards my main goal.        
But at the same time I'm seeing other people that seem to be enjoying their early 20's ,and they don't care nearly as much as me. They spend a lot of time outside, carefree.      I kinda envy them, that they have the luxury to do what they like all the time.        One really sad moment I had : It was a beautiful evening , very nice sunset, some friends invited me to play football, but I said no because I have to work. I was seeing them from my window playing and enjoying themselves, and I just felt miserable.           
So I'm just torn between two things. I have to practice, but at the same time I want to enjoy life.        
I did an internship the previous summer, and it was really depressing and unusual for me to see the sun for 15 minutes in the morning, work from 10-6, see the sun another 15 minutes in the evening while I'm going to the gym, and by the time I'd get out of the gym , it would be dark. And then I think that someday I'll get  hired and I'll have to do the same shit all day.            
                   

                 
                         
So successful people , in their mid twenties who have made it. Older guys. It this shit worth it? How did you do it? How did you balance your work-life? Do you ever feel miserable because of your type of job? Do you ever felt like missing out on life?        
Sorry if everything I wrote confuses you....I'm confused myself"
4h6sdy,37,2016-04-30,Art,BaronVonRuthless91,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4h6sdy/art/,"Old photographs and paintings have always seemed a little bit creepy.  As it turns out there is often a good reason for this.  The old black and white photographs required that the subject of the photo stay perfectly still for a very long period of time.  This was obviously very difficult to do and as a result a very peculiar thing began to occur.  The photographs were taken only after their subjects were dead.  After all, dead men do not move.  Well, usually they don’t anyhow.  This gives those old photos of the children all dressed up in their Sunday best, a more sinister side now that we know that a lot of times Junior was a rapidly rotting corpse when he posed for that photo.  Maybe it is because of this that we are slightly unnerved whenever we are around paintings or statues.  Anyone who has ever seen an old Scooby-Doo mystery knows that if there is a painting in the room its eyes are almost certain to move the minute everyone’s back is turned.  I always brushed these stories of cursed paintings and the like aside as nonsense.  As I grew older, however, I encountered a few things in my life that made me reevaluate my earlier skepticism.  Some of these stories, such as my run in with a pissed of Aztec idol while I was away at college and a near miss with what might have been a Wendigo when I was working at a Boy Scout camp, I have already related on this very subreddit.  This is another such story.


When I graduated college I was in a bit of a tight spot when it came to money.  As it turns out not many schools are looking to hire teachers who have just graduated and have little classroom experience outside of student teaching.  Most of the people I talked to made some mention of me “putting in my time” in the profession.  This meant substitute teaching.  Unfortunately there was very little demand for substitute teachers in my hometown over the summer vacation and I was forced to seek alternate employment in order to get ahead of my student loan payments.  There was also the fact that I was beginning to seriously think about proposing to my girlfriend, Emily, and I was quietly setting aside money in order to buy a proper ring.  This was how I ended up working for our local historical society as a seasonal employee.  Usually they had interns from a nearby college to help out but, seeing as it was summer vacation, they were shorthanded and were willing to take on anyone who handed in a resume.  My job for the summer was to help out with cataloging and moving around any new acquisitions that the society came into possession of.  That was the summer that the historical society finally got its hands on the Cole Mansion.  


The Cole family had been lived in the area for pretty much as long as anyone could remember and the last member of the family had just died.  Let me revise that.  What I meant to say was that the last surviving member of the family, Ezra Cole, had just been declared dead.  He had disappeared seven years previously and in Pennsylvania that is how long you have to be missing before you are declared dead.  The mansion had fallen into disrepair over the last few years as the caretaker of the estate, a highly unpleasant man by the name of Charles Lee, had been in legal trouble for suspected tax evasion and it was suspected that he may have behaved inappropriately with children.  As a result, he only had a little time to look after the property.  Anyhow, the estate was now the property of the historical society, much to Lee’s displeasure, and I went along to take inventory of what exactly the society had gotten its hands on.  It quickly emerged that the late Ezra Cole had fancied himself a bit of an artist.  The interior of the house was full of paintings, statues, and old photographs that were doubtless of immense historical significance.  


The first sign of the trouble to come was when we entered the library.  The paintings in this room were different.  There were far less of them, only four in fact, and they were all turned around so that they were facing the wall.  For some reason Cole had not wanted to look at these paintings.  I turned the paintings around with the help of my friend Robin, who was also working for the society for that summer.  (The job market for theology majors was even smaller than that for English teachers as it turned out.)  When we turned around the first painting Robin let out a small squeak of fright and practically dropped the damn thing.  My grumbles of annoyance were quickly silenced as I saw what the painting depicted.  The painting was…disturbing.  It depicted a witch burning by a band of puritans only this witch burning had not gone exactly as expected.  The witch was tied to the stake, to be sure, but she was laughing and her face was contorted into a look of maniacal glee.  Instead of her being burned, it was the villagers surrounding her who were being devoured by the flame.  As the men, women, and children of the village (I believe there were twelve of them depicted) screamed in pain, the witch continued to laugh and laugh and laugh.  I shuddered and set the painting down.  


Of the other three paintings, two of them were almost as disturbing.  The first showed a medieval torture chamber where a man lay stretched out on a rack.  The door to the dungeon was only open a crack, but it showed a long torch lit hallway and, at the far end, a figure approaching.  The face of the man in the rack showed one of the most realistic looks of fear I have ever seen depicted as he looked toward the partially open doorway.  The next painting was far more modern.  It showed a scuba diver exploring the wreck of a sunken ship.  The unsettling thing about this painting was the faint shadow of a shark which was reflected onto the wall behind the unsuspecting diver.  The man was being hunted and he had no idea.  The final painting was far less disturbing, or so I thought at the time, as it only depicted a forest clearing which was dyed a shade of red by the setting sun.  I wondered why this painting had been turned in the same way as the others.  There didn’t seem to be any violent subject matter being depicted here.


Both Robin and I were feeling a little bit spooked at this point.  The bright light of the afternoon had faded into twilight and neither of us wanted to be in the house after dark.  We locked up and got into Robin’s car to head back to the society and drop some paperwork off.  As we pulled out of the gate to the estate we heard the unmistakable sound of crackling flames, and something very large and glowing hurtled past the car and crashed into the road in front of us.  Robin swerved to miss the object and we quickly pulled over.  I half expected the comet, or fire demon, of whatever it was, to have vanished by the time we got out of the car to examine it, but it was still there crackling away.  It was it this point that we realized that the thing in the road was a human body.  It was at this point that Robin was violently sick.  It was also at this point that I decided to call the police for the first, but not the last, time.  The police arrived very promptly as the town was very small and boring and the most action the police ever saw was when the local college students got overly drunk on St. Patrick’s day.  As a result the police seemed to have a sort of morbid excitement at having an actual corpse to deal with.  Robin and I gave our statements but I don’t think the police thought we were very reliable witnesses.  After all, we did claim that the burning body had come hurtling past our car like a wrathful dragon.  They tested both of us for alcohol and drugs before finally deciding to let us go.  As I left I glanced back towards the mansion one last time.  For a brief moment, so brief that to this day I cannot swear that my eyes were not playing tricks on me, I saw a brief flash of movement in the library window.  I stared at the window for a few minutes more but then the cops started giving me weird looks again and I decided to leave.


The next week or two were very frustrating for the historical society.  The front entrance to the Cole Mansion was now technically a crime scene and the police were in no hurry to speed up the process.  The body was too badly burned to identify so they sent it off for DNA testing which would take a couple of weeks.  The body had been projected from within the grounds of the mansion and so the cops were taking advantage of this fact to poke around the grounds looking for evidence for the upcoming trial against Charles Lee while they had the excuse that they were investigating the burning corpse.  After two weeks of the property being in limbo, the police finally wrapped up the crime scene tape and let us back on the property.  A side effect of this was that Charles Lee now refused to leave us alone whenever we were in the house.  He was technically still the caretaker of the estate, and he was convinced that he would be arrested if he set foot off the property so he now had nothing to do but harass Robin and me while we were working in the house.  Robin and I had barely set foot in the library when Robin cast a nervous glance at the paintings.  His face went pale and he tore out of the room with a wail.  Lee burst out into laughter at this.  I found Robin in the front entrance of the house sitting at the bottom of the staircase rocking back and forth.


“All right,” I asked.  “What happened this time?  You saw those creepy paintings before and you were able to handle them.”


“Think really hard about the painting of the witch burning,” he replied after a minute of silence.  “How many villagers did you see getting burned in the painting?”


I thought about it for a minute.  “Twelve, I think.  I can’t swear to an exact number.”


Robin shuddered.  “I was afraid of that.  I counted twelve of them last time to.  There are only eleven now.”


“We must have counted wrong.”  I reassured him.  As I said this I felt a shiver run up my spine that I quickly banished from my mind.  The last thing we needed was for both of us to have a nervous breakdown.


I went back to the room and carefully examined the paintings.  Sure enough, there were eleven villagers being burned alive by the witch.  I could not be sure but I thought that one of the men was missing from the picture.  I decided to take a look at the other paintings.  The first one I checked was the one of the clearing in the woods at sunset.  There were no apparent changes.  I could not swear to the same with the other two paintings.  I looked at the picture of the medieval torture chamber and the door seemed to be open a couple more inches than it had the last time I was in the house.  At the same time the figure at the end of the corridor looked like it had come closer.  In the painting of the scuba diver the shadow of the shark had disappeared entirely.  I went into the middle of the room, well away from the paintings, and considered the matter.  If there were changes to the pictures they were slight.  I had no solid proof of anything and it was entirely possible that I had let my imagination run away with me.  Maybe there was no shadow of a shark.  Maybe the door had always been open that much.  Maybe there had always been only eleven people being burned.  At the same time, there was the unmistakable fact that a burning corpse had been hurled in front of Robin’s car the last time we left the house.  THAT was not in my imagination.  I took out my cell phone and snapped multiple photos of the paintings.  If anything else happened I would hopefully have proof this time.
That night, after Robin and I had left, I went to our local library and placed an anonymous call to the police station.  I told them that I had seen a suspicious figure snooping around the Cole Mansion and trying to break in.  I quickly hung up before they could trace the call.  Hopefully there would now be someone else keeping an eye on the place in case there were any shenanigans.


  The next day Robin tried to persuade our boss, a stuttering history professor named Dr. Whitmore, that our services could best be used elsewhere.  Unfortunately the Cole Mansion was vast and the higher ups in the historical society wanted the place evaluated as soon as possible.  If we wanted to keep our jobs we would have to continue working in the mansion.  Robin almost quit at that point.  The only reason that he did not was because I was staying on.  Robin did not like the idea of being under the same roof as those paintings but he liked the idea of leaving me there with no one, other than creepy old Charles Lee, to help if things went pear shaped.  Why did I stay?  Honestly I needed the money.  I suspected that something was going on and I was by no means a skeptic due to previous experiences.  At the same time, I thought of the wedding ring that I would propose to Emily with once I had enough money.


There was one good thing that came out of our meetings with Dr. Whitmore.  I managed to convince him that the mansion was too big for us to handle by ourselves and it was in the best interest of the society if the work got done as quickly as possible.  As a result Robin and I were no longer the only people working in the house.  There were always at least half a dozen coeds at various places in the house.  This had the added benefit of not only reassuring Robin, but also keeping Charles Lee occupied.  He was more concerned with hitting on the coeds who were sorting the clothes upstairs than with creeping out the two guys in their early twenties who were sorting the books in the library.  We also never stayed in the house for to long after the sun went down.  The cops had taken my anonymous tip more seriously than I had expected and had a squad car drive past the house every half hour or so.  The burning body had not been identified and the cops were unsettled by the whole situation.  It got to the point where the one of the cops, Officer Slemp, would stop by the house once or twice a day to check on how we were doing.  I think the fact that I made sure he always had coffee when he arrived helped with this.  Officer Slemp would stay and chat with us until Charles Lee would realize that he was on the premises.  He would then wander into the room and make vague comments about suing the department for violating his fourth amendment rights or something, at which point Officer Slemp would roll his eyes and leave.


I tried to ignore the paintings as much as possible.  Robin pretended that they did not exist but every once and a while my curiosity would get the better of me and I would check to see if there were any changes.  The more often I checked the paintings, the more I became convinced there was a problem.  The changes were slight but they were there.  In the painting of the dungeon for instance the figure in the corridor seemed to move a few steps closer every day.  There were even one or two times I thought I heard the echo of distant footsteps when I was working on the other side of the room.  There was also the day I caught the man on the rack turn his head to look at me.  I only saw the movement out of the corner of my eye but the head was definitely now facing me when it had not been before.  The flames on the burning villagers also seemed to dance and there was one occasion where I thought I heard the crackling of flames and distant screams, which were suddenly silenced and then followed by a low cackle.  Robin had to go outside and take a drink to calm down when that happened.  I gritted my teeth, turned my back to the painting, and thought of my wedding night.  The scuba diver and the forest clearing did not provide as much trouble.  The diver would sometimes be in a slightly different position then he was the day before, and the light in the forest clearing seemed to grow a little bit darker as time went by, but nothing to scary happened with them.  I made sure to take photos of the paintings at the end of each day.  Every night at my apartment I would look over the photos.  Strangely enough the photos never seemed to change.  If the man on the rack moved his head and I photographed it, the picture would show him in the same position as he was on that first day that I took the picture.  This did not help my paranoia or my doubts about my own sanity.


The only thing that kept me from panicking was the fact that all the paintings seemed to be able to do was make small movements and occasionally project soft sounds into the library.  If that was the worst that could happen then I could live with it.  The burning man in the roadway was the only exception to this rule, if in fact he had anything to do with the paintings at all.  I was not sure there had been twelve people in the painting that first day and I had no way of proving it one way or the other.  Maybe the burning man was just some sort of elaborate suicide.  Whatever the case was he did not seem to fit in with the other occurrences.  If the paintings could project themselves from their frames like that then why had they not done so again over the weeks that followed?  No, the burning corpse must have been something else.


Then one of the coeds disappeared.  She just didn’t show up for work one day.  Dr. Whitmore was confused but not unduly worried.  I am afraid that his career as a college professor had given him a rather cynical view about the sense of responsibility of men and women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two.  The girl’s parents were worried of course.  In fact they were downright furious when they found out that their daughter had been working in the same house as a man who was being investigated for sex crimes.  Apparently Dr. Whitmore had neglected to mention this fact to the coeds when he asked them to help us out in the house.  After that they all refused to set foot in the same house as Charles Lee, and Dr. Whitmore himself had to come to the mansion and help Robin and me finish up the job.  Thankfully we were almost done with cataloging the contents of the house.  It had been almost a month since we had started working on the house.  In fact the night that we had first gone into the house had been the night of the full moon.  It was now almost the full moon again.  If we had recognized this fact maybe we would have been more careful and the horror that ensued could have been averted. 


The paintings had become bolder.  They now made small movements when I was staring right at them.  The figure had almost reached the end of the hallway now and he was close enough now for me to realize that he was dressed up as a medieval plague doctor.  If you have never heard of Plague Doctors before believe me when I say that they look like something out of your worst nightmares.  The man was dressed in a black robe with a wide brimmed hat and an apparatus on his face that resembled a giant crow’s beak.  The apparatus was apparently meant to protect him from catching a fatal disease but it also served to make him look incredibly creepy.  The diver had now vanished from the underwater painting.  I once saw a torn flipper float past and I had a pretty good idea what had happened to him.  The crackling of flames had become an almost constant background sound in the library although it frustratingly stopped whenever Dr. Whitmore or Charles Lee came into the room.  


Then one night, just as the sun was setting and we were packing up to go, the painting of the forest clearing became completely dark.  The sun in the painting had finally set and a mist had rolled into the scene.  At the far side of the clearing a figure that resembled a naked, very pale man appeared , shrouded in the mist.  Judging by the trees on either side of it the figure had to be around seven feet tall.  The figure in the clearing stood there motionless for a long time.  I had stopped working the minute I saw it and was currently staring at it.  I can only imagine that this is how a bird must feel when it is transfixed by the gaze of a snake.  


The figure then let out a shriek so loud that Dr Whitmore heard it in the attic and stopped working.  The creature then opened its mouth far wider than any normal creature should have been able to, giving me a good look at the rows of sharp teeth in its mouth and let out another shriek before racing towards the front of the picture.  The creature hit the edge of the frame and fell back.  I let out a breath that I did not realize that I had been holding.  The creature could not get out of the painting.  The creature ran back to the other side of the clearing before racing toward the front again.  It slammed into the front of the painting with even greater force than the last time. 


The painting rocked on the wall.


The paintings could affect things outside of their canvas.


There was dead silence in the library.  The creature looked at the edges of the painting and let out a predatory grim, making sure that I saw every one of its many teeth.  It then began to tear at the sides of the painting in an unmistakable attempt to get out.  I decided that the time had come for me to get the hell out of dodge.  I turned to get Robin and found him staring at the creature which was now shrieking in the forest clearing.  In order to do this he had to turn his back to the underwater scene.  I saw many impossible things that night but this was without a doubt one of the most impossible of all.  The painting of the submerged shipwreck seemed to…reach out.  There is no other way of describing it.  The painting swallowed up Robin before my eyes and the next thing I knew Robin was inside of the painting.  Unlike the diver Robin did not have a scuba tank.  Robin frantically banged on the inside of the painting and tried to scream for help only to remember to late that he was underwater.  His mouth filled with water and his scream turned into a helpless gurgle.


Dr. Whitmore and Charles Lee burst into the library.  When the creature in the clearing saw them it ducked behind the frame and out of our vision.  The plague doctor did the exact opposite.  The door to the dungeon scene blew open with a thunderous crash.  A long sharp blade had appeared in the plague doctor’s hand.  The blade slashed right through the canvas and the plague doctor stepped into the library.  Charles Lee turned to run.  He didn’t run fast enough.  The knife flew through the air and imbedded itself in Lee’s back and he fell to the floor.  The medieval nightmare then turned to the rest of us in the room.  Me standing stunned in the middle of the room.  Dr. Whitmore leaning against the doorway to shocked to scream.  Robin in the painting unable to breathe.  The plague doctor took in the entire scene and gave me a brief nod before sweeping out the door into the hallway past the stunned Dr. Whitmore.


The creature in the clearing reappeared.  It was holding something in its hand.  It was the head of the missing coed.  Dr. Whitmore let out a final sob and whatever sanity the man still had broke completely.  He began to laugh.  The witch began to laugh.  The creature in the clearing began to tear at the side of the frame again.  I turned to do what I could for Robin and I saw the shadow of the shark reappear behind him.  My best friend was going to die because of my recklessness.  We were all going to die.


Unless.


The Knife.


My gaze fell on the lifeless body of Charles Lee and I rushed over to do what I had to do.  If I was going to die then I would die trying to save my friend.  There were worse ways to go.  I pulled the knife from the corpse and turned to help Robin.  Behind me I heard a tearing sound as the creature in the clearing finally tore through whatever barrier there was between its world and this one.  I braced myself for the claws of the creature to pierce my back.  They never came.  I heard the creature let out another shriek that was drowned out by the scream of Dr. Whitmore.  The creature had chosen the easier victim first just like any predator.  I tried my hardest to ignore the wet crunching sounds from behind me and drove the knife into the underwater scene just as the shark loomed behind Robin.  The knife pierced the canvas.  I remember Robin, a very large shark, and an immeasurably vast amount of water exploding out of the painting and then everything went black.


The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital with Emily sleeping in the chair next to my bed.  I let out a low groan and she woke up.  After she was done hugging and kissing me for being alive she explained more or less what had happened.  As it turns out my habit of giving Officer Slemp coffee had saved me and Robin that fateful night.  Officer Slemp had been driving by the house and saw the lights on at the mansion.  He decided to stop by and say hi.  As he was pulling up the driveway he heard the uproar from the house and a large wave of water  blasted out of the library window.  Officer Slemp had rushed onto the scene and found me and Robin in the wreckage of the house.  As it turns out Robin was in better shape than I was and had managed to pull me away from the chaos and had hidden me behind a fallen bookshelf until help had arrived.  Officer Slemp’s official report said that Charles Lee and Dr. Whitmore had been killed in a freak flash flood which was the official explanation for the whole business.  What exactly Officer Slemp had seen when he arrived on the scene and what exactly Robin had felt the need to hide me from neither of them ever said.  I remembered the creature in the clearing and did not press the matter.  

The next week the police identified the body of the burned man.  It was Ezra Cole.  If I had to guess I would theorize that the paintings were only really dangerous during the full moon, like the night we arrived at the house and the night we visited it for the last time, and Ezra Cole must have run afoul of the witch on one of the full moons several years previously.  The police file on his death, and the disappearance of the coed, remain open although no one is really investigating them.  I suspect that Officer Slemp had a quiet word with his superiors and the matter was swept under the rug with minimal fuss.  The fact that what was left of all four of the paintings were locked up in police evidence gives further credence to this theory.  I saw the paintings once more.  They looked exactly the same as they did the first time I saw them, with one difference.  There was no figure at the end of the hall in the dungeon scene.  There are nights where I imagine that I see a hooded figure with a crow like apparatus on its face watching me from the shadows.  There are nights where I think I hear the cry of the creature from the clearing in the depths of the forest hunting it prey.  Then again, maybe this is all in my head.  But I do not think it is.
