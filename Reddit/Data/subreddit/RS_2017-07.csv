The first interview was a phone interview for 30 minutes and it went very well. They decided to have me onsite and I interviewed with 4 managers for 30 minutes each. I struggled with anxiety the day of the interview and was not my best. First interview went okay and she mentioned that this interview should be easy. My voice sounded weird and the 2nd interviewer even brought a box of tissues because I mentioned I had a stuffy nose so I could blow my nose half way through the interview. I also wasnt clear with a couple answers. The interview with the 3rd person ended about 5 minutes early and she mentioned that its good that Im getting experience interviewing with other companies I did not get a good vibe from her. The last interviewer mentioned the benefits of working at the company but did not mention the next steps in the process. He did say a couple times ""if you get the job"". I mentioned to him that I had personal issues the night before and he said he only wants to see if I have the skills for the position and hinted that he doesnt care if my voice is weird today. They did really like my resume and cover letter and hinted that I was more experienced than the average intern. Do you think I can still get the job after not being my best for the 2nd interview?"

The thing is: I have zero work experience. I recently have felt pressured into getting a job (since most people have work experience by 20 yrs of age) so I accepted a completely unrelated job offer at Starbucks. I don't know that this was a very good decision. Did I set my standards too low? My parents asked ""are there no jobs in math/science?"" and I told them most of the deadlines past which is partially true. More so it's that I feel unqualified because of my nonexistent work history and nothing-special-skills. They seem disappointed, like they're wasting money on my college education.

6kku8d,1,2017-06-30,Job Advice - Servers vs Cybersecurity?,Yellorium,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6kku8d/job_advice_servers_vs_cybersecurity/,"
I'm about a year from graduating college and part of my program includes a 6-month internship that is typically followed by full-time employment. I just heard back from two companies, one in Big Pharma and one in Aerospace. They are both big companies that are offering jobs relevant to my field of work but the specifics are quite different. 

The Big Pharma job is a Cyber Security Analyst position which consists of researching security threats, developing information security education materials and participating in education sessions.

The Aerospace job is a Network and Servers Technician positions where I will be working with a Server Administrator on building and configuring servers and working with Network Engineer on the initial config of replacement firewalls.

I am pursuing a degree in IT with a minor in Business Administration and plan to attend night school later on for my MBA (Haven’t Chosen). I am currently working part-time for an energy company in their front end analytics department and have been for the past year. 

In the next 5 years I would love to travel globally and if possible I would like to travel to different parts of the global data model to fix specific issues in each market “a quasi-strike team, if you will”[Honestly not sure if this exists]. 

My thought is that Cybersecurity would be good for securing data and it's ""where the money is"" but the Networking job helps me with the backend of data and the employer hinted at some training in Mainframe knowledge (something not offered in class).

The job I choose will likely be the one I work for when I leave college and so I was wondering if there were any IT veterans out there that had any advice, even the smallest comment helps.

Thanks,

- Yellow

P.S.: Does anybody have any info on my data quasi-strike team, would consulting be a better term?"

I graduated a year go with a BS of Management Information Systems and I have some classroom experience (classwork, homework, exams) with .NET, VBA, and SQL. But, my work experience has landed me a job on the IT end and unfortunately not what I want to do for my career. I've been reading Big Nerd Ranch's Swift and iOS books so far and the books are good. Plus, on and off coding at freecodecamp.com to see which language I would be more interested in pursuing for a career. However, I feel like it's impossible for me to ever change my career path. There's SO much information and I feel like I will never be qualified to walk into an interview knowing I will actually be knowledgable for the job. Most of the internships, I've been glancing at they are requiring knowledge of multiple languages (example: Swift, Objective-C or JavaScript, Angular.js, node.js).

6kmiyi,1,2017-07-01,Targeted by Abusive Principal,tiredteacha,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/6kmiyi/targeted_by_abusive_principal/,"I'm at a loss and was hoping that I could get some advice. I'm sorry that this is so long but felt that I needed to give some context to the situation.

I teach at a very large high school in the Midwest, about 4500 students.

I have been teaching for 7 years, all at the same school.

I teach a specialty subject, that is not tested.


I feel that I have been the target of my principal's abuse for several years. I am a good teacher in the eyes of my students, their parents, my colleagues and the larger community. I have won numerous awards and accolades relating to my teaching. I make community connections that benefit my department and my campus. These connections yield internships, donations, expertise and more.


In addition to my specialty subject, I also run a very unique practicum program. It's the only one we have in our district. It is successful in that it is financially self-sustaining and then some. It has also had great success in capturing students that have otherwise fallen off the map. It has even been used as leverage to get students to do their work in their academic classes. The mix of students in the program is very interesting from some of the highest AP academic performers to students who are barely making it through school. But it works because the practicum has formed a safe and restorative space where there is often discrimination on our campus.


I seek to be a team player at every level and work to support my department and campus in any way I can. My first few years I noticed that there was a VERY negative culture on our campus. This was apparent from the way our students felt and talked about our campus and in the morale of our staff. My students engaged in a curricular assignment, with the permission of our principal, to assess school culture and to create positive solutions. This worked and as a result, my students created a campus organization that has increased buy-in of students and staff alike. Their grassroots organization has even garnered tremendous support from our larger community. I could not have predicted the success of this organization and it just keeps growing.


My principal is brilliant but her people skills are incredibly lacking. She is condescending and her immediate assumption is that teachers and students alike are always doing something wrong. She goes into classes and yells at teachers in front of their students. She humiliates students and talks down to them in front of other students. She is very manipulative. It's important to closely document conversations with her because she will frequently change her mind about things she has granted permission for on a whim. She is fragile and cannot handle feedback. Our administrative staff put out a survey about our very blasé and ineffective PD. Teachers responded honestly and she yelled at us for our responses and said that she wasn't accepting negativity, only positivity. She treats the administrative staff terribly and curses and yells at them. She puts them down in front of others. However, they are scared of her and like any other long-term abusive relationship, seek her approval. She is inconsistent. She ranges from syrupy sweet (but it is very disingenuous) ti psychotic. 

People are afraid to speak up. The general consensus is that there is a major problem but no one wants to risk their job to address it.

She seems grateful for the benefits of the work that I do to make our campus a better place but has treated me poorly on many occasions. After several encounters with this lady over the years I decided that it would be best for me to avoid her as much as humanly possible. I really made this decision after she physically intimidated me and yelled at me, close enough for spit to fly in my face and for me to feel the heat of her body and then acted like nothing had happened an hour later and like I was crazy for being upset. She'd yelled at me for something incredibly trivial and when I approached her and asked what I had done wrong she acted shocked and told me that I hadn't done anything and that I had misinterpreted her actions towards me.


What feels like the last straw for me occurred very recently. We received our teaching and room assignments for next year before we ended this year. My room assignment was finally near the area where my practicum is run which is wonderful because the practicum takes a lot of focus. The job doesn't end when the students are gone. It requires at least 3 additional hours a day for planning and maintenance. In the past I have had an additional planning period for the practicum to offset some of the hours that I work outside of the school day. I would be teaching at least one other course in addition to the practicum but it was one of the 7 courses I had experience teaching. Plus we'd ended the school year with curriculum planning for the following year based upon our scheduled courses.

Less than a week into our summer, our principal decided to switch our APs around because she felt that our original AP was overwhelmed by our vast department and was too nice to us. Our new AP had already been on our campus, just with another department.

This new AP reached out to me and told me that he was switching around my teaching and room assignments. That he was taking away my practicum planning period and was adding a 3rd Prep to my schedule, which is a year long introductory prep. I pointed out that I had never taught this course before and he said that he added it to my schedule because he felt that I could teach it with my eyes closed and that I could help make it more robust for the other teachers who taught the course. I pointed out that this was problematic as it takes away from the rapidly growing practicum and that it was also not my job to make a curriculum more robust for other capable teachers, especially not when I was already doing much more than my fair share anyway. This also isn't a staffing concern as I am certified to teach in 3 different content areas and one of them is over staffed to the point that they are splitting classes to create enough for everyone to teach.

He basically told me to suck it up. Since that time he has made it known that they (he and my principal) don't think that I accomplish any work during the additional practicum planning period. And that they don't think the practicum students are productive. Despite the fact that there is tangible evidence of their hard work all over our campus and throughout our community and the fact that the students have made an incredible amount of money. None of these concerns have been addressed with me directly before. He's also expressed concern about the flexible seating in our practicum lab. He says that this makes our students unproductive, which is funny because he's never even been in our lab or seen our students in action. We have so much work that the teacher who I collaborate with for the practicum and I work for a few hours a week in the summer. Last week when I stepped out of the room he told her that he just thinks I take on too much. She told him that he doesn't know me and must not understand everything that we do and how we do it. If this is the case, why is he adding more to my plate? He doesn't even know me and should not be discussing me with someone else.


I know that this is coming from my principal. The new AP made it clear that he is getting his information from her. I feel that she is trying to make my job difficult intentionally. I had originally scheduled a meeting with both of them but then canceled because I did not feel that I was in a good place mentally. I know that there is some level of crazymaking involved in every meeting with my principal and I'm just not ready to handle it.


I know that I can go and find another job. I really don't want to though. I feel invested where I am, in spite of my principal. We keep hearing that they are building a case against her at the district level and I have been hanging on thinking that I could just outlast her. I know she is looking for other jobs and has been but has not been hired, likely due to her reputation.

I get the sense that this won't be he last of their scrutiny and while it's unfair, I feel that there is little that I can do about it, beyond leaving.

I would not have a problem getting a job elsewhere but feel committed to growing the practicum that we've built. I was also called in by our superintendent at the end of the year to address a concern on our campus that is also a concern for our district. She has made a way for me to do some work on this concern districtwide and I don't want to walk away from that opportunity. I also think that this partnership could be cause for my principal's targeting of me.

I would so appreciate any guidance!"

I am going to joining a master's program in computer science starting Fall 2017. I have left my current job, so that I can invest sometime preparing myself for interviews and going to college again.

I have done my undergrad in Computer Science couple of years back, and have been working since then. I don't remember much stuff taught in my undergrad like Data Structures, OS concepts, etc. 

Coming to the question, as I am stepping back into academia, I will have to search for internships for Summer 2018. And according my knowledge, internship positions open as early as September for several of the companies. So, I would like to know what things should I focus on so that I can give interviews/get calls for internships as soon as I apply for them in September/October. I assume, I won't get much  time to study for interviews once the college starts, as the coursework might be pretty heavy.

Currently, while I was working, I started doing leetcode and solved around 20-25 questions mostly easy, and consisting of 1-2 mediums. 

What should I study so I can use limited time most efficiently? 



**tl:dr :** Have one month of dedicated time to prepare for interviews, how should I spend it so as to get most out of it?"

I am in the US for an internship and rented a room from a family house. I  am living together with my landlords. 

They are going for a holiday at the end of this month and want to give a key to their neighbors. I feel uncomfortable, because I will be alone in the house and a stranger will have key, is it legal?

Also,

1. Landlords say that the reason they do that is that they want their neighbor to feed their cat. The cat is not allowed in the house, she is always in the garden, so does the food container. Basically, neighbor does not need a key to house to do that.

2. There are surveillance cameras in the common rooms of the house, they established them 1 month after I arrived in the house.

3. The landlord didnt give a lease and not willing to give one at this point.

So, I am afraid, if the neighbor does something to me when landlords are not at home, I have no legal basis to proof that I am living in the house; except some emails and SMS messages that I exchanged with the landlord."

I graduated a few years ago with a B.A. in Economics from a small liberal arts school no one around here has heard of. I had some programming experience going into college and ended up doing a minor and then some in C.S. as well (~30 credit hours in CS). I did a technical internship, worked for a year doing entry level programming at another company, and then got a job where I had done the internship. It’s at a large company with a I.T. department that is mostly functional, but I’m on a technical team (mostly work with CS majors or engineers). I’ve now worked here for over two years with no promotion in title or pay, but have gotten more responsibilities. 
 
I feel like I’ve become a jack of all trades at my new job. I manage a team of contractors, I’m a resident goto person for Linux and AWS, I own several legacy systems, and I do some programming. However, I feel like my skills haven’t really gotten any deeper than they were when I started in any given area – just broader. I work with programmers I manage, developing specifications for implementations and helping with code reviews and debugging, but I don’t have my hands on keyboard nearly as much as feel like I’ve gotten out of practice.
 
I keep my LinkedIn updated, and I regularly get recruiters contacting me for $15-25k more than I am making now. I have basically gotten the same pay since I started, $60k, which was up from my $40k I was making at the last company (doing .NET). 
 
However, I feel like I wouldn’t be good to jump into a role right away somewhere else. I wouldn’t be ready to go as a system administer, a developer, architect, or any other specific title, though I do some of these every day. I feel like I’m not really beyond a junior level in a lot of ways, though the work I do is more senior. In meetings with my peers for managing groups of contractors at work I’m by far the youngest (mid twenties, others in their forties). 
 
In general, my issue is that my company doesn’t seem to reward technical people with promotions, and I’m tired of being saddled to a lot of legacy systems that are a pain to support. Other people in other areas with less responsibilities have gotten multiple responsibilities who started fresh out of college with no work experience. My work has basically become 50% managing legacy systems that I’m not able to push off to other people (with some light scripting in obsolete technologies occasionally to support them) and 50% managing developers. I don’t mind doing some management, but I want to get back into development. Will I need to start at the bottom somewhere else? Am I actually going to qualified and useful for a job that pays a good bit more? Will having an economics degree be a hindrance, or should I get a master’s degree?
 
Any advice would be helpful. I feel stuck. "

I'm pretty good with .NET technologies, and have built some basic Unity games, and well as some apps using Xamarin for iOS and Android, including one that I'm finishing up development on and going to put on the app store and Google play. I'm also pretty well versed in some web technologies (CSS, HTML, Javascript and Typescript) and have built a couple websites with jquery and bootstrap. I also am currently doing an internship where I'm using .net technologies and using Angular 2, which I feel pretty comfortable with. Oh I also know a bit of C++ and Java (including JavaFX). I feel really comfortable at this internship I'm doing too. Like I know exactly what I need to do to build the software we are making (A web app using Angular and .NET). 

I've talked to a programmer friend I have (who is a senior software engineer at a rather large retail chain) and he was telling me that considering what I've made and what I know I should be able to get a full time junior software engineering position. However I feel still feel skeptical. I've only finished one year of my degree so far."
6ksikm,14,2017-07-02,I am a loser in life.,sakuredu,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/6ksikm/i_am_a_loser_in_life/,"I'm 29 years male, virgin and a shut in for 2 years+ now.

I used to be a bright kid, but an introverted one.

I had a crush, she like me back but I can't love her back because of my self-deprecation. I'm also lived in a muslim nation so there were strict laws about couple. But most students dont give a fuck and had relationship anyway. But I had no self confidence. I had no one to talk to about my problems. I hated my father for choking me to near faint during my childhood. I hated my family for being so strict, so religious. I blamed her for being so nice to me. I blamed my classmates. I blamed my teachers. I BLAMED GOD for all this.. (I wish I was dead)

So I run away from her. Running away from my problems. Spend my time studying while shutting my emotions everytime I see her talking to her boy admirers. I live throught that, but my emotion development really takes a beat. I cry a lot, but I forgotten how to smile. (I started had suicidal thoughts around this time.)

I ran away from my family by applying to college. I thought I can escape from all my problems. But college was not fun for me. 

Half of it. I'm stuck with some of the classmates are ruthless and racists. They asked me to join their group because I'm smart. Only to discard me, talk behind me. 

The other half of it - I found friends while playing games. Met them in real life. Its funny because they stick with me up till now.  They are losers like me. And we found comfort in each others friendship. I still can't rant to them my inner problems though. But I'm sure they can always hear me out. I like them a lot.

I had depression for a year during college. therefore my college result were shit. I even had problems seeking internship. Looking for a job is worse. I was lucky though because I had a scholarship in the past so I was debt free. Maybe. I dont know if its true. I had crippling anxiety that they'll come someday to collect their debts. (I'm scared.)

I dont know how but I found a job. Quality assurance. It's a good job. Good boss. Lower than average wage but its good enough to live through. But - my motivations are because I found my crush prior to the job. She still beautiful but she had a boyfriend now, i think. I don't know. I'm was too of a coward to ask her. (Still am now) But she told me to get a job. So I did. But 3-4 years later I heard she was married. I was crushed. I cried a lot before, but at that time - its fucking hurts. I screamed in silent thinking of it. There were no more tears. Only the silent night. ( Looking to my life like a tunnel with no light. ) I quit my job because I can't do anything while working. Thus for two years+ I shut myself. 

I failed myself. I'm still hurt. But I coping with it. I dont smoke, dont do drug, but my coping mechanism are worse that that. I played a lot of games. I masturbated a lot. I watched people play games if I was not playing anything.

NOW. I'm trying to fucking change. Looking back at the things I write - I didn't failed completely. I studied enough not to be ridden by debt. My college is shit, but I graduated. I made long time friends, who probably will okay with my perverted self, if I tell them. I had a job. I held it for 2 years. And the most important part of it - I just made peace with my parents.  I told them about my crippling anxiety. They tell me to get with people in the mosque. But they love me for who I am, even if I were a failure.

I'M FUCKING TRYING RIGHT NOW. 

- No more awaking at night , sleeping at day.

- I'm cutting off myself of games. I'm still like to read manga and fapping. Thats need to be work on.

- I will get a job. 

- I will apply to a local gym. Even if its a treadmill, I will exercise as much as I can. My aim is 150 minutes per week.

- I will improve my selfconfidence. I will find myself worth back.

- I will try to confide in my friends more. The good and the bad.

- I will trample on my self anxiety, especially talking with girls. I'm so fucking bad at it right. But I'm fucking trying.

- I will find a hobby to work on. Perhaps singing because I liked to sing. I love my voice, and I still love it now.

- I will improve on my image. My aim is to post a selfie of myself to reddit. I need to improve for that I need feedbacks.

- Someday I will be friends with my crush back. Even if she's already married. It's hurts but the best thing I can do is to wish her happiness through her life.

- I really really wish that I someday will experience love again. I had a tough exterior but in truth, I'm easily fall in love with someone. I do not want that... because I know how much it hurts. When you lost love.

Dear god. I was lost. I'm still lost. I know how time cannot be rewinded. What is done is done. But it least..I'll try to make amends to you. Truth be told I'm thinking of hiring a prostitute to have sex.. But I didn't had the heart to. Some of it because of religion.. some of it because I was a coward.. but almost half of it because I believe that sex should only be between lovers. Perhaps I'm naive. I'll admit - I'm too damn naive. I believe in love before. I was hurt by myself. My lack of strength. I didn't believe in myself, that I can be with her before. But it is too late to? Maybe so. I'll try to be positive. maybe someday I'll find someone for myself. BUT I NEED TO PREPARE MYSELF. SO IM WORTHY OF HER LOVE. TO TAKE CARE OF HER LIFE. TO BE THE FATHER OF HER CHILD. **TO BE THE MAN THAT MY FAMILY BE PROUD OF.** 

On this day. I beg you god. Do not let me forget my reason to improve. My light at the end of the dark tunnel I'm walking now. MY WILL TO LIVE.

That's the last time which I remember seriously considering taking my life. Back then, I was still growing as a high school student who was socially awkward and couldn't connect with friends. Struggled to meet the lofty expectations of my parents, nothing would go right.

I pulled myself out then. It was a slow path out, but I made it and learned how to appreciate what I had. By the time I reached college, I had found confidence in myself. I was still socially awkward, but I still found great friends. Classes were difficult, but I excelled further than my wildest dreams. I found someone who I honestly thought would be my future wife. 

2 years of recovery, 4 years of improving myself and my life and all it's taken is one year for it to all fucking fall apart again.

Despite my grades, I failed to my graduate applications. 4 years of studying and hard work to be turned down without knowing why. My scores were good enough. I should have had enough experience. Yet, none of that was good enough. It just feels like I'm constantly doomed to failure. 

I probably could have handled that failure if there was nothing else.

But no, I hesitated when the application went south and became desperate. I found an internship not related to what I wanted to do, and now a year later it's starting to be a possibility that I just wasted a year doing something worthless. Not to mention I hate having to remain committed to it and can't stand going in to work just to be unpaid and unappreciated. 

I made a mistake because I was panicking, fine. I could've dealt with that.

But on top of it all, the one person I thought I could count on leaves me tonight. Turns out that they've found someone else who they have feelings for. I tried my best not to be a controlling SO. Someone who wouldn't be prying or jealous. You told me that you knew your limits and wouldn't let it happen. You're a fucking liar. 3 years together and you're tossing it away for a 2 months of knowing someone else.

My life just feels like it's in fucking shambles. I have twice the amount of opiods I would need for an overdose. I can't help but think how it would just be so much easier to end it now. I fought so hard for 6 years and all it took was 1 year to lose it all. I don't even know why I want to keep breaking through depression when just a few things can slip you back so easily. Fuck, I'm scared I won't be strong enough this time.

6kuruh,12,2017-07-02,Worried about the choices I have made for my career path and salary,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6kuruh/worried_about_the_choices_i_have_made_for_my/,"Some background about my situation: I'm 24 with a computer science degree from a mid-sized locally known university in southern Louisiana grad. Dec of 2015, have ~3 years industry experience and work for a small company in Baton Rouge, LA.


I started my career working part time as a full stack developer for a small 5-6 man company while still in school back in 2013. I was 1099 making $10/hr. After about a year the company went under due to disputes between the owners(apparently going into business with your friends isn't the best idea). When the company closed my old boss helped me get acclimated to doing independent freelance web work, he taught me how to draw up a good contract and how to conduct myself as a freelancer/ the things you should look for in clients, how to bid for contracts, that kind of thing. I would charge between $20-25/hr and while I was not swimming in contracts and clients(worked 10hrs a week on a good week) I made enough to cover my expenses and live comfortably while I finished my degree. I was more focused on finishing my degree and enjoying my last year in college so I didn't peruse new clients to hard.

I took a job with IBM in Baton Rouge right after graduation and they started me at $40000/year(full benefits, 401K match to 3%) doing Java Spring/Hybris development for one of their clients in Chicago. I knew at the time that 40K was REALLY low and that the IBM center had an extremely high turnover rate due in part to the low pay and shitty working environment. I had planned to use IBM as a career move, bust my ass now and get a nice name on the resume then move up from there. I worked 45hrs a week no more no less, hard stop. The work wasn't bad but their corporate environment(constant bureaucracy, paper work and red tape) combined with how little they care about their employees(Low pay with very little room for advancement, doing the bare minimum when helping us with anything literally just gave us a laptop and a cubical, the only coffee available you had to pay for) made working there miserable. After only 6 months I started looking for other work, I interviewed for a few months and was eventually made an offer by GE in New Orleans. They would bring me on for 67.5K/year + benifits as a mid level Java developer. I was concerned about just jumping from being a number at IBM to being a number at GE but the pay was much better and they seemed like they valued their employees more(nicer office in a more relaxed working environment from what I could tall + free fruit and coffee in the breakroom) so I figured it was a much needed change. I put in and fulfilled my 2 weeks with IBM. My manager didn't want me to go, he even said I was one of the best he had worked with and even offered to have what GE offered matched by IBM but I declined. He might have just been blowing smoke up my ass but whatever it gave me some validation about being worth more than they were paying. Unfortunately things with GE didn't work out. 3 days before I was supposed to start I get a call that there was a discrepancy in my background check and they could no longer offer me the position. I had gotten a misdemeanor for leaving the scene of an accident back in 2011, I went before the judge and paid it off and for some reason I just thought of it as a traffic ticket since then. I had been checking that I 'Had no felonies/Misdemeanors' for years honestly thinking that I didn't have any and none of my other employers had ever bothered to actually run my background report. No-one at GE, not even my recruiter, would respond to my emails or return my calls. So I was unemployed living off my savings. I though about going back to IBM but ultimately decided against it for various reasons and decided to roll the dice starting from scratch looking for another job. 

(am going to go into a bit of detail here about my current jobs salary negotiation as I feel it is important to to get a good understanding of my situation)

I spend a month and a half unemployed. From day one I interviewed with a number of companies and was getting far in the interview process with 1 or two of them but its a slow process. One company was a small local business in Baton Rouge who I had been put into contact with through an old college network connection. A small .NET shop with about 7 employees total, I had 3 interviews total with the last not even being an interview(the boss asked me to come in for what I assumed was an interview but after talking to him for a few minutes he told me they already liked me and he just wanted to talk to me face to face before making an offer, then he took me + the whole office to a nice lunch so I could meet everyone) A week later I got an offer from them for 40K + full benefits for 3 months raising to 50K as long as everything is working out after 3 months. I was a bit underwhelmed with the salary but I really liked the people and it seemed like a great company so I told him I need to look at a few things and think it over. I had one last interview with the project lead for another company on the next monday so I was planning on going to that, seeing how I felt and then making my choice to take the offer or not. However I get a call the next day from the owner of the company that made me the offer, he wants to meet for coffee and go over any concerns I had about accepting the offer. It seemed very forward but we meet and start talking about things. I am honest and let him know that I was concerned about the salary amount and that 40K for 3 months wasn't where I wanted to be, so he says no problem I can start at 50K and he assured me that it was just a starting salary and will raise as I am with the company. He had no hesitation and caught me very off guard with it, I honestly didn't even realize we were negotiating anything. I am an honest guy so I also bring up my career concerns. I want to move up in the industry and I was concerned about how working as an mid-level developer at a very small company was going to look for me in the long run and how little upward mobility small companies offer. He stopped me there and said the position he was looking to fill with me wasn't just a dev role on a team, they pull their devs right out of college or as interns, he wanted me to take on the role as project lead for one of their projects. He said he had talked to my references and all had described me as not only a strong developer but as very take charge and someone who gets the job done. I was not expecting that and didn't really have any response. I told him I would think it over again and we both left.]

I decided although it was a smaller company and the pay wasn't super high I wanted the leadership experience and that it ultimately would be a good career move. Things started moving fast after that. Within a month I had assumed the role of project lead for the project my boss and I had discussed, I worked directly with the client and was managing a small team in india + an intern on it. Not long after we landed another contract with a different client and my boss put me on that project as Lead as well, this one with another team inindia for me to manage and another in house intern working on it. The company started to grow and we opened our own office in India so we have more control over the India teams, instead of being contracted out they work for the company directly. Today we have ~27 employees total with 12 in the states and 15 oversees. We ended up buying the that first project I was on(its real estate tax software) from the client and have since expanded it to another 2 parishes with more than 6x the data in the system and are looking to expand to one more before the end of the year. My teams have grown with the project as well, I now manage 8 employees over 3 teams on both of the projects I lead(I also still develop for both projects). True to his word my boss did also give a raise for 5K after I was with the company for 6 months(I did not ask for it he just called me into his office and gave me the raise one morning) bringing my salary to 55K and on our last trip to a convention to show our product he hinted he will probably give me another raise at the 1 year mark. He has also said multiple times that he sees me and one of my co-workers(who has been with the company 2.5 years) as leadership in the company and as we grow he wants us to be more involved in the executive side of things in the company in addition to Leading projects. 

I like my work and I am happy where I am. I like leading projects, making the big decisions on how the client's needs are going to be implemented, how long it will take and setting tasks and deadlines for my teams then reviewing their things to make sure it it is up to the client's and companies standards, in addition to the things I develop. Plus I have my own office, which I didn't realize how much I wanted that until I had it. It can be stressful and I routinely work 12+ hour days but it's fulfilling and the work environment is easily the best I've ever been in.(the boss booked the entire office a trip to Destin for a long weekend as thanks for our hard work, just to give you an idea of how the culture of the office is). 

I still have this nagging voice in the back of my head though, with my experience and skill I can easily make more than 55K (hell I know some of the companies start at 55K right out of college here) but at the same time I still see this as a great career move, even though it is a small company thats only been around ~7 years I do have a strong leadership role, with a growing product under me. 

So I wanted to get you all's take on this. At 24, with my degree and experience + my wanting to move up in the industry, is this the best things for me? I see alot of articles and people talking about how much most software devs make and it gets a but disconcerting when I think of my salary. Cost of living in Baton Rouge is low and I make more than enough to live comfortably + pay my loans back + invest my money but sometimes I just want more. I plan to work at least for 2 years with my company, and am at about 8 months now, and then at that point re-evaluating my career and what I want. So what do you all think, is forgoing a large salary now for leadership and experience good? Especially when the work is fulfilling and in a great environment?"
6kv9bb,25,2017-07-02,"About to enter senior year, just now realizing I chose the wrong major...",fenderbrpwo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6kv9bb/about_to_enter_senior_year_just_now_realizing_i/,"When I first applied to my school, I applied as a computer science and engineering major. I’ve always loved computers, building computers, and playing with software so I thought this was a good idea.  After being accepted I started having second thoughts because I didn't think I would be smart enough for it. My high school didn't offer any coding classes so I was never exposed to programming. In addition, I didn't have too much guidance or insight into the engineering fields so I ended up changing my major to mechanical engineering before my first day (since I heard that it was the broadest discipline).  All I knew at the time was ""Hey, computers and software are cool, but I don't think I'm smart enough to actually program this stuff""

During my first semester as ME, all engineers took an intro to computing class where we learned MATLAB. For the first 85% of that class, I struggled immensely. Most people around me had some sort of coding experience, so I felt so behind. My initial suspicions of ""Me and computer science"" were confirmed: I am bad at this.

Towards the end of the semester, everyone was split into groups for a difficult final project and I got paired with people who were at the same level as me. They all hated the class and didn't put too much time into the project because they knew this would be the last time they took a computer science class. I needed a good grade on the project to bring up my average, so I ended up completing the entire thing by myself. I put so much time and effort into it and I was amazed to have even completed it. The code worked perfectly and I got a 100 on the project.  I was so happy and felt really good.

The next summer I had an internship at a small engineering company and they had me do a number of different things.  I worked with Solidworks modifying assemblies and designing parts (which I thought was pretty boring) and I also worked in MATLAB designing a graphical user interface for a testing program (which I loved).

The following summer I interned at another company doing mechanical design, modeling, and prototyping.  I enjoyed the job but that was only because the people I was working alongside were wonderful.  In general, I hated the work because I felt that too many things are out of your control in mechanical design (lead times for making parts, relying on manufacturing teams, etc.).  Since you are making physical parts, the process of creating things is very slow, requires extensive planning, and is less flexible.

This summer I was somehow lucky enough to score an internship at a company doing software development and programming.  I’m rewriting Python scripts to run regression testing on different devices, working with the Linux command line, and doing a lot of programming.  And I’m absolutely loving the work because if you want to make changes to the code if something doesn’t work too well, it doesn’t cost any money to “prototype” a new design.  You simply write the new code, test it, and deploy it.  Since the employees there are all either have electrical or computer science backgrounds, they all look at me like I have four heads for majoring in mechanical engineering.

I refused this whole time to change my major because i didn't feel comfortable changing to a major I didn't know too much about. I understand now that people choose a major because they are interested in that topic, not because they already know a lot about it. I feel like a complete idiot typing that out.

I assumed that since I was a mechanical engineering major, I could pretty much adapt myself to any engineering industry and be successful if I put the time and effort in.  I never took a second to realize that I hated the subject material of nearly all my classes (even though I’ve done quite well)

I’m now at a point where I know I’m very interested in pursuing a career in coding/computer science (and not traditional Mechanical Engineering industries), but I am so close to graduating with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  I don’t know if I should finish that degree, or pull a 180 right now and switch programs to computer science.

Another alternative would be to finish the degree and teach myself more coding and make some projects on my own.  Then I could try applying for a software engineering job.

I'm curious if anyone else has been in this situation. If so, what did you end up doing?"

Well like the title says, I am a recent Chemical Engineering grad working full time for an Advanced Process Control Vendor (APC Company), I work in process control, automation, simulation and instrumentation. Currently I am a data systems engineer. I graduated in May and accepted this job since I did not want to work as a ChemE, I did an internship as a ChemE and I hated it, but by the time I really knew what ChemE really was, it was too late, and I had to graduate else I would have wasted the past few years of my life, I also had the pressure of my parents, so I went through with it. 

This last year I have really taken on an interest in programming and computer science, I really just want to work a desk/office job, not a plant job and live in a fun vibrant city not in the middle no where like most ChemE jobs. I want to eventually move to the west coast and break into the tech industry, so I guess my question is. How likely is that to happen given that I studied ChemE as an undergrad?

Also, do I need to go back to school to get a degree in computer science or software engineering or could I just try to acquire those skills and apply for jobs given that I already have an engineering degree from a good school, btw I graduated with a 3.7 so going back to school should not be hard. Long term I would like a job with location independence, I am interested of course in a great salary, but that is not the main focus, I make good money at my current job, but I really want to do something I enjoy and have control to move around easily if I ever wanted. 

I could easily do a computer science degree online while working full time and complete it in about 1-2 years, also my company could pay for it. Also I have been looking online for free resources and I have found Udacity.com, would companies accept skills from Udacity? 

Thanks for your help!"

I mostly hear that people get Masters' (a) because they are interested in the subject, and (b) because it makes it easier to get interviews.

I'm curious if there's still much of an effect of (b) if the individual in question is coming from a top CS school (i.e. UC Berkeley). After all, I'd imagine that students from these schools would have similar opportunities to those with a Masters'?

A few things to note:

* **I'm not sure I can get a Masters in a good school** as I'll be ending my time in Berkeley with a **3.1 GPA** (performed very poorly the first two years and quite well in upper division classes my last two years). Thoughts? Am I underestimating myself?

* My parents' jobs' benefits almost entirely covered my education at Berkeley - **I'll likely be on my own for a Masters.**

* I find myself interested in AI, and I would likely pursue a Masters in AI if I did decide to get one.

* I am **finding traditional software engineering quite boring** (interning on a cloud platform for my internship and, while it has its moments, is quite unexciting). It feels too ""grindy"". Does this get better at time?

Is it possible to work in specialized fields like AI without a Masters? "

The company is huge with getting people to come back full time after the internship, so they tend to extend offers within 2 weeks after you leave...and the deadlines are quick. They clearly don't want us to try and apply other places, so I was thinking of the possibility of accepting and reneging if anything better comes up.

My question for you guys is in all honestly, how bad is it to do that? I don't want to hurt the company, but at the same time, they're a huge company that is going to clearly move on with or without me.

Thanks for the help!"

But thing is, what do they do for you? I never talk about my problems to anybody but I think I need to get help soon or it will be too late. 

Let me start off saying that I do have problems that impact my school work. The biggest thing that rules my life is intrusive thoughts. I think that I have OCD but I have always been scared to go talk to someone about it. I try my best to hide it but you can only hold it down for so long. Second is my family. I'm living with them through university and I love my parents very much. However, I have a sibling who constantly makes me stressed. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't help this person. I know what they do isn't entirely their fault but they still cause a lot of problems. But this is not to say that my parents don't cause stress either. My family has always been tight with money and my mom's goto phrase would be ""I don't have any money"" (she would even say it when we did). Every time she says this, I would get stressed out and get this sick feeling in my stomach along with a headache. It has made me really hate spending money, and I've spent &lt;$300 in the past 2 years (other than school fees). Third is my social awkwardness. My parents never taught me how to speak to people properly and it's been hard trying to learn how to do so. I always stutter, have awkward pauses, and I would not be able to look people in the eye. It could be the fact that I'm introverted, but either way I know I'm bad at talking. I want to get some internships to be financially stable, take less courses to feel less stressed, and move out and get my life together. But after all of this, I just feel burnt out. I have now realized that waking up exhausted is not normal. I know I have to fix these issues but I don't know where to start."

I have an internship under my belt, but it is not in a product development field.

Going into my last semester I have to choose between taking a computer aided design class or working as a teaching assistant for a CAPSTONE senior design course (which I have already taken) under a professor who has worked various product development jobs throughout their career. I have worked with SolidWorks in a decent amount of my classes and am pretty competent when it comes to CAD. I am wondering which of these two options would be more beneficial in regards to getting a product development job once I graduate.

Computer Aided Design Class:
  Pros:
    -Gain a more in depth understanding of CAD and its applications
    -Improve my CAD skills and potentially learn more valuable skills that employers will be impressed with
    -CAD skills seem to be a requirement for all positions I am interested in, and while I have experience working with CAD, I have no experience devoted to CAD

Teaching Assistant:
  Pros:
    -Work with a teacher who has experience in the field I would like to get a job in (Networking and references)
    -Class specifically focuses on students creating a product for companies
    -Might look good on my resume
    -Paid Position
    -Have some interactions with engineers from host companies that students will work with to create products

Any help would be appreciated! If there's anything else I can tell you that would be useful feel free to ask. "

I'm a junior in university and although I'm not the most talented developer, I work hard. Anyhow, I was hired to work on some existing programs previously developed by the company. The developers who created them were on contract and are no longer there. The programs are thousands of lines of code. I was asked to implement a simple method into one of the programs, and I made a separate project and made it easily but when in comes to integrating it into the program the company uses I'm struggling mightily because the file is so huge, it is poorly documented and there are no other developers on site (i am the only person that can code in the office). As a result, I'm struggling and sometimes feel overwhelmed and am anxious that my boss will deem me as inadequate if he fails to see progress soon. I mean he is very nice and understanding, but at the end of the day they are paying me to get things done. I'm worried about future assignments that may be much more difficult, especially as I am struggling with an easy one. Any advice?

6kxudk,17,2017-07-03,Why isn't mentoring more of a prominent idea in this field?,ryuhphino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6kxudk/why_isnt_mentoring_more_of_a_prominent_idea_in/,"I feel like my view on this might be a little skewed, as I spent a long time in college within the realm of music. We met with our private instructors and they gave us something to prepare, or even better, told us to go find something to prepare. We spent time on our own figuring out what we were supposed to do and how to do it. Then we would meet up again with our instructor to show the fruits of our labor. Often times though that instructor brought you guidance as you slowly found your way as you found what you enjoyed most. Why isn't this idea adapted in this program?

Computer Science is such a growing realm, why is it up to the individual to find it on their own? When I went through college, I'll be honest, I was terrible at programming. I felt lost most times as I came from a terrible program, however most of my reading shows there aren't many great programs out there. I just believe some sort of mentoring would be amazing at that level. With so many fields, and growing, such as IOS, Android, Game Development, Web Development, Databases, ect. and even more languages to choose from, shouldn't mentoring be something that would help us all find our interest sooner rather than later?

I'm currently in my 2nd internship and during both i've become a much better programmer. I believe it to be because of the hands on work i'm doing with others especially in the form of mentoring. If I would of had some of the guidance in school as I had here, I would easily be twice as successful as I am now. However, the environment I was in at school made it very difficult to find the information I desired on my own, or heaven forbid I stalk my professors office for hours on end (which i never had time for).

I'm not trying to rant if it comes out this way, I genuinely just wanted an open discussion as to why this field doesn't seem to approach the matter this way. You practice music to get better and get critiqued by your instructor for how you perform. This sounds exactly like how programming works, as it is much an art as it is a science. Not to mention this kind of mentoring could give students exposure to things like version control or many different softwares that are used in agile development (Teamcity builds, JIRA agile development, ect.).

So why isn't this more of a standard? What are the reasons that it is more of a ""go find it yourself"" kind of field? I understand having to learn problem solving on your own and earn that mindset required to do the job, but wouldn't some consistent help go a long way?

tl;dr: Why does mentoring in this field appear to be so absent on a collegiate level?"

I think I've developed a solid college list, but I want to see what you guys think of it. So here's a little background: 

GPA: 3.6 UW 4.2 W (started off bad in freshman year, straight A's 10th and 11th grade)
ACT: 27 C, taking september and aiming for a 31 C
Class rank: I think somewhere around top 10% (school isn't the best, but a very reputable district in Maryland)
Extracurriculars: VP of NHS, President of Rho kappa, member of science NHS, tutor high school students and 5th grades (mostly immigrants who struggle with math and reading), hospital intern, relay for life volunteer (cancer fundraiser), and a few others
Race + gender: Asian male. 

My ideal school:

Location: urban, not too far out, but also I wouldn't mind being in more of a suburban area. 
Region: I'm from central MD, and I prefer to stay somewhat close by, but I wouldn't mind going far out either
Possible majors: Biology (Neurobiology if possible), or Engineering
Looking for a school with a a great academic program, but also a great social program (not just parties), which is leading me towards a big college with a diverse student body (25,000 students or somewhere around there). 

Side note- I've visited UMD before and I absolutely fell inlove with the campus. I'm interested in lots of schools that are like UMD, in case I don't get into UMD. 

Schools I'm currently looking at
UMD (top choice, in-state, legacy)
UMBC
VTech
Syracuse
UF
Penn State
UPitt

Despite my ACT, which I plan to improve for sure, are these schools a right ""match"" for me? Also, if anyone has any other college suggestions, I'd be glad to hear them! Thanks in advance. "

After graduation, I spent 9 months working on a startup with another CS guy. I was full-time and he wasn't (he had student loans, I didn't). My role was full-stack web dev, along with biz and marketing roles; co-founder did native Android. 

We had small success with a few customers but couldn't find the right product/market fit to scale. I'm tired of this struggle+solitude and he's tired from working 2 dev jobs, so we're at the end of the road.

I want a role at a Series C or later tech company. However, my skills are all over the place and I've only been at small startups. I have no idea how to transit to a larger company. 

On the engineering side, I did dev work in Javascript/[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)/[Blaze](http://blazejs.org/)/Mongo (bad ecosystem sigh), designed a scalable/resilient architecture with Docker/AWS, managed our 2 weeks sprints. 

On the biz/marketing side, I did our pitch decks for customers, built relationships in the industry that we were serving, generated leads and converted them, met with customers to observe/talk for feedback, did our landing page and tried to get a email list going. 

In my previous internships, I was in SE/product roles and did work with Rails and Django.


1. What roles are suitable for my skill set in a larger company?
1. What can I do to prepare myself to interview for those roles?
1. Any suggestions on good tech companies? I'm fine with SF/NYC, EU, Asia.

Please share any thoughts or advice that you have. 

If anyone's curious, I can share my take on the Meteor ecosystem :)"

**Major(s): Physics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics**

Minor(s): 

**GPA: 3.35 (AMS GPA is 3.6)** bad grades mostly in sophomore year.

Type of Student: International, Male, South Asian

GRE General Test: Will be taking soon. Anticipating &gt; 90% V scores but around 90% Q score.

GRE Subject Test in Mathematics:
How important is it that I take this? I don't really have time to study for another test on top of the GRE and my demanding final year schedule.

**Programs Applying: Masters in Statistics/Masters in Data Science**

Ideally I want to apply for Phd programs but given my crappy undergrad record, I've decided to apply for masters and see if I can get into the Phd programs later on.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Deans List, Physics Honor Society. 

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Irrelevant on-campus job for 3 years and currently doing a data analyst internship at a very small marketing agency.
 
**Letters of Recommendation:** The School is HUGE and all my classes are &gt;100. Its very hard to get to know professors and this is likely the weakest aspect of my application. I will get recommendations from professors I've taken courses with and gotten As but that's about it. I don't even expect them to remember me or know who I am and I just don't see any way around this. I can try to cultivate some relationships till application time in December but I don't really know how to or how successful I will be. 
 
**Course Work:** 

**Math and Stat Courses:** Survey of Probability and Stats (A), Probability Theory (A-), Combinatorics (A-), Data Analysis (A), Deterministic Models (A), Statistical Lab (Basically a course on R programming and SAS), Calculus 1,2,3,4(Taken in Sophomore year so grades are mostly Bs and a C in multivariate), Linear Algebra(A-). Probability and Statistics for Data Science (In Progress)
 
**Physics Courses that may be relevant: **Quantum Mechanics (Some probability and lots of Linear Algebra)(B-), Statistical Mechanics (Lots of probability)(B-)
 
**Computer Science courses:** Object Oriented Programming (A), Data Structures (A-), Analysis of Algorithms (In Progress), Probability and Statistics for Data Science (In Progress), Computational Geometry (combined course by Computer Science and Applied Math department also in progress).

**Where should I apply?**
 Ideally I want to go to a Data Science program but these are limited so any good statistics program. What school match my profile? Where would I have a good change to get in and succeed?

How can I improve my application? Is there anything here I can leverage? How can I build enough rapport with a prof to get a good recommendation letter in 1 semester? Do you have any other advice or suggestions? Any other programs you think I should consider? Any other Specific courses I should take?"
6l0yus,1,2017-07-03,Is it worth it to pass up a potentially good internship opportunity to avoid living at home?,EatStrawberryRice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6l0yus/is_it_worth_it_to_pass_up_a_potentially_good/,"Apparently my neighbor actually runs the internship program at a very large company headquartered near my home. Not sure how we missed that one last season lol. It's not a tech company, but they have a healthy tech division, at least as far as I've been able to tell. They recruit pretty heavily from my school and I'd have absolutely no problem if I got a job and worked there. Pay is slightly below average for interns but still pretty damn good, especially considering the low cost of living around here.  
  
So, as I mentioned, I would have no problem working for them, except for one little issue. Between living in a dorm at college and living in an apartment on my own this summer for another internship, I've kinda developed a taste for independant living. I just don't want to live under my parent's roof anymore. No particularly good reason for it, I just prefer kinda being my own person, I imagine a lot of you guys get what I mean. They still just kind of treat me like I'm still in high school when I'm home, and I'm not sure I want to deal with that for an entire summer. And since this company is only about 20 - 30 minutes from my house, I would pretty much have to live at home.  
  
Somewhat of a side note, but my university has a program that will give me $2000 to use on an educational opportunity next summer. That money could be used to pay for rent, but it's very unlikely I could get approval to use it for anything while living at home. Basically what I'm saying is, I wouldn't actually be saving much money here.  
  
Another issue is that this company tends to recruit straight from my school's fair career fair, which is in like September. I was kind of hoping to try my hand at some of the bigger dogs this year, as I already have one internship under my belt. Not sure if I like the idea of having to accept or reject an offer in October (especially if it's one my parents would be pressuring me to accept).  
  
Should probably mention that I'm not presuming I'm actually guaranteed to get a job there or anything, but I think it's a very real possibility.
  
Thoughts? As I mentioned before, I would be totally satisfied working there and I think it's a very realistic scenario that I don't end up with any offers better than what they could give me (I'm only a sophomore after all). But I also feel like I'd be wasting a summer in a way (and would definitely be wasting that $2000)."

I have a career question pertaining to if I should get the Security+.  I will try make this quick. I am looking for any advice anyone is willing to give. tldr at bottom.

I am a graduate student studying computer science with a undergrad in economics. I am graduating (if the thesis pans out, fingers crossed!) this December 2017, currently have a 3.89/4.0 GPA if that makes a difference. I have two classed left, and my thesis. I started as a second bachelors in CS but decided for the MS, so essentially I have a undergrad in CS minus a few GE classes and a senior project. I fell in love with security early on when I started the CS degree and got involved heavily in a cyber security club. I had a job lined up at a large company in their Cyber, Risk, Engineering, and Architecture department. The full time was offered to me after the summer internship ended. Due to budget/financial issues, or so they said, they rescinded the offer. Found out later they had done the same thing to one of my co-interns that also received an offer. I have been scrambling to find something else, but it was too late for internships, and I can't seem to get past any of the online job applications. I can only assume it is because I don't have 2 - 3 years, but it could also very well be I am not qualified enough. It was difficult to find any jobs that specifically stated entry level. I have tons of self taught knowledge, computer security class, security club, go to Issa meetings, and have gone to many conferences (Defcon, BSides LayerOne, etc). I am not quite sure how to get the experience or what to do to get considered for a entry level position.

Recently I decided maybe I should get the Security+ cert so maybe I can get passed some filters that require it. I have taken all of the practice quizzes that CompTIA offers and score between 75% - 85% on them. I feel like I know the material, just missing questions that rely on specific acronyms or some specifics about ports and services running on them.  Which can easily be remedied with more studying.  Should I get the cert? Will it get my foot in the door? I am very confident of my ability to learn/perform, just looking for the chance to do so.

If you read the full wall of text thank you :), I appreciate you taking the time. I hope I can join you all as a security professional soon.
Cheers


tldr: Tips to getting entry level/experience for a graduate student in CS?

I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in a couple weeks and am starting my fourth and final year of my degree this September. I've been a music journalist for the last two years of my life, struggling to figure out how to start a career on my own with little help from my college faculty. It was a difficult ride, but I think I've gotten into the swing of things at this point. Kind of.

I've lived a troubled life, had an adrenal tumour at 11, watched my father abuse me, my mom and my brother physically and mentally for years until my mom gave up on his sorry ass. Everything started to seem good once I was leaving for college. I stopped having suicidal thoughts, I quit abusing drugs and alcohol so hard and I started making real friendships for what felt like the first time.

Fast forward to my second year of college. I hadn't spoken to my dad in 5 or 6 years when he reached out because my great grandma died. All he did was leave a message with his phone number and tell me I'm horrible for not speaking to that side of the family in so long. I didn't stop talking to them though, they shamed me and stopped talking to me. So I called, and I kept calling until he would pick up. But he never did. I tried for weeks and it devastated me because after a while, he just called my mom instead and told her to tell me to stop calling.

I moved on after a while, I tried killing myself 6 times between October 2015 and May 2016, but pills apparently didn't work well and my friends brought me out of it. That led to last summer, where I finally felt myself again. I was going on dates, meeting new people, going to concerts and having a blast. Until September came.

On the last day of summer, my family and I went to a carnival to get some time in together. They live hours away so it was fantastic to spend a whole day with them. But, my life seems to do this funny thing where everything is blissful just the moment before the plug is pulled. I got a phone call from my estranged aunt who told me my father died of a heart attack. I had a mental breakdown in front of thousands of people. I don't know why, I gave up on him. 

In the weeks that followed, I had to speak to people who hated me, get questioned about ""why I abandoned the family"", etc. I developed a drinking problem. I would down a 26 of vodka every day for months. Didn't matter what time of day it was, I was slamming back shots or mixing in my classes. The professors and students had to have known, I was on camera slurring my words but somehow pulling off better work than ever before. I tried to kill myself again a few times by taking mdma while shitfaced or downing bottles of sleeping pills, but I always threw them up or my friends made me. In October, my uncle died of a heart attack too. This just made things worse. I stopped going out, stopped dating, stopped hanging out with friends, stopped everything really. 

One day around the end of March this year, I stopped abusing myself. I knew it would hold me back from my career eventually so I didn't want to do that anymore. I finished my third year, landed an awesome internship and everything should be good. But it's not.

Ever since that fateful day last summer, I haven't truly felt happy. I'm not suicidal, but I don't enjoy life. I'm not worried about hurting myself, but I'm worried I'll never truly feel happy again. When I used to finish an article and see it go online, there was a spark of happiness. Now when I finish a story, it just feels empty. 

I've never done better with writing than I am right now, but it's not the same anymore. I just feel like I'm doing this so people think I'm happy and have moved on. I feel like an empty shell of what I've worked for the last three years, like I'm not actually alive anymore. 

How do I get my happiness back? I feel lonely every single day, even though I have fantastic friends who are there for me. It's almost like my friends know that I'm working through things and just want me to do what I need to do, but I wish sometimes that someone would just ask if I'm ok and actually be able to say no. On the outside I'm doing great and appear to be better than I've ever been (at least I think so) but on the inside I just feel done. There are obviously people out there who have gone through worse than I, but the things I've dealt with have stripped me of most emotions.

Sorry for the rant, just feeling a little more lost than usual today. I'm not giving a tldr because I'm not going to reduce my story to one sentence, but if anyone reads all of this, thank you. "

I just finished part of the helsinki mooc and just started doing codewars challenges and it noticed that it takes me sooooo long to figure out how to solve assignments/ challenges. This is mostly because I tend to over complicate instructions and misinterprete them. For example I completed a task in code wars that has us create a digital root solver (for those of you who don't know you just take the sum of the individual digits are keep finding their sum until you're left with a single digit). After like 2 hours of thinking and trying different approaches (using the Integer class that I'd never used before) I finished what I thought was the first part of a 2 part assignment. I got my method to find the digital root for numbers that sum to 1 digit. But I could NOT get my method to keep going until it fully summed the initial and subsequent sums. I attempted ""part 2"" for another hour or so. That is until I tried just calling my method in a while loop from the main method. I then went back to codewsrs to submit the solution and turns out I wasted an hour because the solution I already had was the correct one they were looking for. 


My reason for writting this post is because I'm a sophmore cs student and I feel like my slow problm solving skills are goin to cause me to lose out on internship opportunities when I apply in january (I hear many people describing how quickly you have to find solutions for you to get picked during internship interviews). Do you guys have any advice on how I can learn to solve problems faster and more efficiently. I am open to any form of advice be it blog, book, or video. Thanks in advance."

I just finished my junior year in college majoring in Computer Science and Game development. I know life for recent grads in the industry is super tough, but I am very passionate about what I do, and believe that I'm pretty good as well. My goal at this point is to maximize my chances of getting into entry level jobs (which I know are very, very limited). I have a few projects I've worked on and I am currently participating in a competitive summer internship at the end of which I will have a published game. 

My problem begins with networking. I have not done as much networking as I could have in my first three years due to an enormous amount of time I spent on school and work. I am also terrible at small talk, so I've avoided networking events like the plague (which I know is terrible). I am very lucky that I got into the internship I did since it introduced me to several industry people in my area which I am insanely thankful for.

From discussion with my boss, I understood that networking is probably 80-90% of the hiring process in the industry (as long as you can do the job of course). He recommends my own website and printing business cards, which seems reasonable, but I'm also not sure where to start. I know I can put my projects on the website, but as far as I know, code portfolios are not very common. I can link my github account  of course, but having a website with a single link seems odd. What am I supposed to put on my website if I can't put code? Do I really need business cards? How does any of this work? Any help would be appreciated."

6l48jd,10,2017-07-03,Choices and Expectations,outwardsbound,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6l48jd/choices_and_expectations/,"I am a rising senior at a well-funded public high school in the heart of the Silicon Valley. I am a very academically inclined person, so my university prospects are very important to me, both for the sake of being able to continue a high quality education and for the sake of being able to do so in a community of similarly inclined people. This is a throwaway in order to keep my normal reddit account hidden from those that might be able to identify me based on this post.

I am more than likely going to be listing computer science as my intended major on my college applications as I have been a digital tinker for pretty much as long as I remember. That said, I also have a very strong interest in physics and chemistry - hard sciences - and in their useful applications towards solving concrete problems - engineering. I know that with all of this interest, I won't be able to achieve the level of understanding that I want in four years, so I am very much planning on attending graduate school, likely for more than just two years of a master's.

Given this profile of myself, I have been looking keenly towards some of the standards: MIT, CalTech, ""Stanford,"" and in-state Berkeley are all at the top of my list. I've also quite liked UCSD, Harvey Mudd, Carnegie Mellon, and Princeton in the course of my research and visits, but I am aware that I most likely need a longer list.

As for numbers things:
 
* New SAT: 1590 (790 on English) with a 7/7/7 essay from January 2017
* Unweighted GPA: 4.0
* Weighted GPA: 4.67 or 4.77 (including/not including freshman year)
* UC GPA (10-11 with hard cap on bonus points): 4.33
* SAT II Math: 800 from June 2016
* Sat II Chemistry: 780 from June 2016 (retook alongside US History in June 2017)
* 5 on AP CompSci, AP Lang/Comp, AP European History, AP Calc BC
* Anticipating 5's on AP Statistics and AP Mechanics, 4-5 on AP Chemistry and AP US History
* My school doesn't provide us with class rank, but I believe I am within the top ~3 of my class of ~450 as determined by wGPA

My course load has been what is likely fairly standard for competitive students, with an exception being my not taking Spanish IV (to take both AP Chemistry and Mechanics junior year) and my heavy involvement in music.

That brings us to what is essentially my area of ""concern:"" my involvement in music as much of my EC. I was in my school's marching band for all three years of high school, and I am only not participating this upcoming senior year for the sake of my health (waking up early does not agree with me, to understate it). I am also in my school's highest auditioned choir, which travels internationally and performs in dozens of community concerts throughout the year. I also played keyboard in the pit orchestras for school musicals during 10th and 11th grade and plan on doing so again this upcoming year if the opportunity presents itself. Especially in the case of choir, I have found both a huge amount of personal development and a fantastic exposure to my community in music. That said, though, I worry that my load of EC's appears fairly non-academic compared to many other competitive students to colleges. I absolutely plan on writing about music and my relationship with it in my essays, but I find it hard to easy my stress in this regard.

Some of my other EC's/cool things I can potentially list on an application include:

* Hackathon participation and organization, a few programming competitions
* Tinkering on my own time (I have built some cool things, mostly electrical or software. I plan to show some of these off during interviews)
* Peer tutoring (~3-4 hours/week, more often than not doubles as time to do my own work)
* VP/President of a very small strategy games club (~45 min/week where we meet to play Civ V, but democratized)
* Volunteering at the library (2 hours/week freshman year, doing demos and such with the 3D printer before it broke)
* CIT at a sleepaway summer camp I've attended since childhood (rusing junior summer)
* Intern with an independent IT consultant (rising junior summer)
* Intern at a company that does machine learning work in the pharmacy industry (current, doing programming)
* Some online courses in machine learning and electrical engineering at Coursera and EdX/MitX respectively
* Four intended community college courses during senior year (two for fulfilling graduation requirements to free up a slot with which to TA, two are math for my own personal interest)
* Other self-study stuff: I self-studied my way through pre-calc and ended up not having to take the course (Algebra II straight to Calc BC on my transcript). I didn't do any studying, but knew Java well enough to get a 5 on the AP CompSci test during freshman year despite not having taken the class. I've spent a lot of time learning lots of assorted programming things over the years.

So, given this post, my questions to you are as follows:

* What colleges should I be looking into adding to my list, given that my interests are fairly interdisciplinary but especially demand a strong program in computer science in addition to the other sciences?
* Will a body of EC's that is largely musical and personal (with little hard evidence or award history to show for it) weaken my applications, and how should I best articulate and frame these things in order to most strengthen my application?
* I have done essentially no real leadership - should I be drawing examples of minor leadership from other activities (e.g. playing piano during choir sectionals), or should I not attempt to draw any out whatsoever?
* I have the option of TA'ing for my APUSH teacher (for APUSH) this upcoming year, which I am currently planning on doing. My qualm is whether I should sub out that slot to AP Biology instead, which along with AP E&amp;M would have allowed me to take two years each of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Will picking one route over the other have a substantial impact on my college admissions?
* I don't have any science fiction left in my list of to-read books, but have a hankering to read some, so what are some good science fiction books you've read recently?

Thank you all for your feedback and insight. Please feel free to add your own feedback and advice even if it's not in direct response to any of my questions!"

For the time being, I want to ask you people for your advice.

I'm interested in:

- Any sort of internship 
- Future traveling place to place
- Studying abroad
- Technology/Computer related things
- I don't mind repetitive type jobs (something like data entry?)
- Working in offices in front of computers are fine
- Working alone
- Anything with high financial payout 

Weaknesses:

- Speaking with other people (severe social anxiety)
- Mathematics
- Bad memory, so hard for me to learn languages
- Anything related to the medical field

So far, my placeholder of a major will be Computer Science since it seems quite flexible, but is there any other major I should consider?

Background: Suffer from social anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Considered going to the military since it fit most of the things I wanted, but parents immediately shut me down on it since it ""puts me in danger"". Considered engineering as well, but don't have much information about day to day life of an engineer. I know they're different types of branches of engineering and choosing one is difficult. I like the ""idea"" of engineering, but I feel if I invest myself in it, I would come out with the short end of the stick. Extra Info: Live in TX and going to a community college temporarily before moving to a university."

However the company that I am currently interning at will offer me a return internship with a due date around mid august. So ideally I want to find out if I can work at the other more sought after company before then. 

How should I go about reaching out to these people? They also work with other people in my company (including my bosses boss) so I don't want to step on anyone's toes. But these people are so high up I don't think they care to much about an intern wanting to move around.

The common problem is that you may be straight out of college with a degree, or you're working full-time in a simple job and you've just earned a new qualification from part-time learning.

Now you have a much better understanding of coding and making programs and you wish to apply for jobs.......but they require you to have experience.

However, you can't get experience........but you don't have a job.


So what would you say is the best solution?

Make your own portfolio with sample work?

Make your own websites or websites and other applications for charity and non-profit organizations?

Apply for internships?"

I can't decide which IT/networking designation to go with. I'm moderately proficient in Oracle SQL and decent at Python. I'm thinking CISA, CCNA, and I'm not sure what, if anything, else.


I don't exactly expect to be a CCIE CTO, but pretty much every banker needs to know code. With Fintech looming, the more one knows, the better. My dream is to get a good feel of what a banker does and write a program that automates many of a banker's tasks and start up my own Fintech venture.


Obviously, there are plenty of players in this space but an optimized program that is user-friendly will always be in demand. Any other guidance would be appreciated. Sorry for any typos, I'm half-asleep while writing this. Thanks."

6l6zma,2,2017-07-04,I just fucked up my masterstudy and have no idea what to do next,Candytorro,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6l6zma/i_just_fucked_up_my_masterstudy_and_have_no_idea/,"Hey, I will try to keep it as short as possible, but here are several things coming together, so it might take a while. I am from Germany and studied psychology in the Netherlands, at first with the idea to become a therapist sometime. I started my study in 2009 and finished my bachelor degree in 2013. I wasn't an A-grade student or something, but it went ok overall. Then I did my masterstudy and first I failed at some subject. I had to repeat them and did it, but then I failed at my first attempt for my masterthesis. I then started an internship as a part of my study which went horribly wrong. They basicly told me after a few weeks that I have no business in this field. They saw me personality-wise as someone who can't deal with people. I was crushed. The internship was finished shortly after and with that I completely lost my confidence. My relationship failed one week after that. That was in 2015. Since then I started another masterthesis and failed with deadlines regarding that, as well. I think I was scared of failure like I failed with my internship. After that went bad, I fell into a hole. Last year in June, I got diagnosed with cancer in my balls. Of course it was a shock at first. But it's weird. Dealing with cancer was easier for me than dealing with my study, my future and the question what I am good at. I followed the plan, had an operation and chemotherapy. It all worked out. I figured if I can beat cancer like that I can also get my fucking masterdegree, right? Well, wrong. Active selfdiscipline and planning are different issues than passively following a treatment other people are responsible for. I started my new and last attempt for a thesis in March, fucked up again. They gave me a last chance with that topic if I would follow a strict plan. At first it seemed to finally work. Somehow I managed to get the first two deadlines done.
However, I didn't manage to get my shit done for this new deadline, so here I am now: all subjects done for years, money wasted and nothing to show for it. Looking back, all my failures came down to a lack of discipline and selfdoubts since my internship. There were times that I didn't know why I would do my study since my boss at my internship told me I am not capable of working with people in that way. For some reason I believed that person and let her shatter my confidence instead of asking myself if this one judgement of this one person is really true.
Well, my go-to strategy for these kind of situations would be hiding and denying that things are bad and waiting things out until they get better themselves. Since this hasn't worked out over the last 4 years, I thought I would try a different approach this time. I want to ask for help and get myself engaged with my situation by talking about it and doing something about it. However, I am afraid. I don't feel like an independent person who knows a lot about life and how to manage myself. And I would like to learn something about that. I want to be active and proud and independent about what I do with my life. But in the last years, I feel like I was all talk and no act.
I am feeling empty right know, I got kicked out an hour ago, so I am sorry if things aren't formulated in a coherent way."

I am 32 years old,and i havent ever done anything romantic whatsoever.I have never,NEVER done anything of such sort-never asked a girl out,never even tried to communicate any sort of such interest.The reason?Addiction to videogames/nerdy stuff.I am mature enough to admit it now-for 31 out of my 32 years of life i was too fucking hopped on dopamine from playing-console jrpg's at first,the yugioh trading card game afterwards,MMORPG's after that,and anime sprinkled all in between.I didnt honestly care-i clearly remember that at some point,an attractive girl i was talking to during university suggested we go out for coffee together,and i didnt really pay attention-i had other things to think about.

However,as with all addictions,at some point during last year,i started being more alone.Most of my friends finding work as well,i started not being able to go out as easily as before-and to top it off,my addictions started to not fulfill me anymore.Sure,i could watch some anime or play some progression-driven games,but the thrill got over fast.REALLY fast.And i started,like a normal human being,needing a romantic partner.

So,we have an intern at work,which i work closely with.Much younger than me-10 years younger,although people say i look younger than i am as well,so i thought that it wasnt so ill-fitting.Cute.Extremely social and cheerful.I start noticing her and crushing on her.

And then reality hits me hard.This girl has had 3-4 relationships already,being a normal girl her age.She's a heavy user of social media-instagram,facebook,the whole shebang.Often participating in nightlife,where she's probably showered with attention-little social recluse-no experience me doesnt have a chance in hell.

Still,i couldnt help approaching her.I start talking to her,making jokes with her,trying to get her to talk to me.She starts responding-she constantly sits next to me,even though there isnt any work to do.She doesnt really initiate talking to me,but she's responsive when i do,although our senses of humour and tastes in music don't match.At some point,she shows me pictures of her ex-boyfriend-one of these neohipster bearded tattooed types,really good looking,barman.

Although i realize she's single and i could theoretically make my move,my feelings of inferiority,and more importantly,the crushing fear of the awkwardness that would ensue for the months left until her internship ends stop me from doing such a thing.Despite the obvious signs that she was interested in me-she kept sitting next to me,whenever all this situation crashed into my head too hard and i was crushed by depression she was hellbent on trying to cheer me up,her subtly asking if she could join me on my way to work when i had some paperwork to deliver at some point.3 weeks ago,when work was slow and we were sitting together,she puts a rnb sensual song with the lyrics on video,right in front of me-when i saw it,i was immediately stricken by a maelstrom of negative thoughts about the situation,and she asked me""what are you thinking""?And i obviously dodged the question instead of doing anything.

So a couple of weeks ago,she suddenly stopped really interacting with me.Just the minimal interactions needed for work-not even saying hello,or goodbye-constantly on her phone.After a while i hear her calling a man she met on facebook and giving him her number-the ship sailed.

And then that's when the revelation of the whole situation hit me hard.This girl was charmed by me for a couple weeks-she was certainly not going to make any sort of direct move herself,but she was piling on the signs.I just did nothing about it,paralyzed by shame,feelings of inferiority and dreading the awkwardness that would follow a possible rejection.Felt like an awfully painful punch in the kidneys-it still feels like there's a razor grinding away at my stomach.

However,just like Pandora's box,i think there's a positive thing left inside.
I had managed to charm this girl.For 2-3 weeks only,but i had done it.Little old nerdy me,managing to charm a beautiful girl,showered with attention from everywhere.This means that im not as hopeless as i constantly think i am-i can be an attractive,charming person to the opposite sex.

I hope i can get some sleep tonight,because my head feels like a volcano right now.

Should I lie and say I am earning a bachelor's in computer science when I am actually earning a master's?

I am a clinical laboratory scientist/microbiologist that returned to school to earn a master's in computer science.

I am having a difficult time finding jobs and internships. I believe the 1 year of coursework I have completed so far is insufficient for a full time or part time position since I cannot get interviews through the school career site or through indeed and glassdoor. I also lack any serious personal projects in my github. To get some experience, I have tried turning to internships. 

To find internships, I have gone to a couple career fairs. Every company I have talked, like Cerner and DST Systems, look over my resume and appreciate the 3.86 GPA but say they are only accepting students pursuing an associate's or a bachelor's. Internships I have applied online to (~12) has rejected me as well.

I went to my school's career center for advice and they said to keep the master's on the resume as they said it looks better. Other people I have talked with said the same thing. I just feel like changing the one word will make all the difference. What would be the possible consequences of doing this?

TLDR: Graduate student looking for jobs/internships but cannot get any. Should I change the ""*Master's of Science - Computer Science*"" to ""*Bachelor's of Science - Computer Science*""?

I'm also applying to a few masters' programs this fall and expect to hear back next spring.

My questions are:

* Since I hear back next spring, I'd likely start my masters in the fall. Has anyone had a situation similar in which a company has agreed to an internship for just spring and summer, until they start their masters? A lot of companies I've talked to seem to only want interns if they are still **in** school, not if they're **between** schools.

* If I were to just join full-time, what is the minimum time most companies seem to make you stay for? I am considering working full-time for a year instead of sitting on my butt at home for a year until I start my masters. This probably depends on the company but I'm just looking for an estimate."

**I have enough background to understand and study for ""Cracking the Coding Interview""**, but I don't know what the companies, companies that pay a lot and hence competitive, expect of a freshly minted software engineer. I have no technical knowledge in compilers, networks, OS synchronization, concurrent and parallel programming, and the list goes on.

 I'm a rising senior but I'm confused over how to pick safeties- particularly since I'm an international student who does IB so I don't have a GPA- which is what most tools use to calculate safeties. 

A bit about me: 
Living in Asia, doing the IB. Want to double major in Economics &amp; Computer Science. 

**Subjects**: HL Physics, Economics &amp; Maths, SL CS, English Lit &amp; French 

 **ACT**: 35

**Awards**: 
These are all like awards given within the school- I go to a school of over 5000 people, ~300 in my grade. 

- Economics Award 2016. Only person in grade. 

- Economics Award 2017. One of 3 people in the grade. 

-Computer Science Award 2017.One of 2 people in the grade. 

- Service Award. 

don't know if these count for much...

**ECs**: 
- Internship at a tech startup, worked on furthering STEM education in the country I live in.
 
- Founded and led a STEM focussed weekly student run educational after-school activity for girls. 

- Member of the school debate team: couple of national tournaments, some collegiate level debate tournaments. 

- dunno if this counts but like an online 5-course Python specialisation that lasted 32 weeks from U Mich. 

- Elected Chair of a student-run group that raised over $6k for street children. 

- Actively MUN, over 6 conferences. 

- Year round service working with under-privileged children in Freshman and Junior year. 

- Physics and Economics Society. 

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!! 

Mainly looking for private schools, definitely urban or suburban campus. Preferably medium to large sized. For context, some of the schools I really love (but wouldn't be safeties) are Brown, Carnegie Mellon &amp; Stanford (lol).

I have some experience with Java, Python, and C.   
The project manager gave me a quick run-down of what they do here. He covered some stuff that I should learn in the next couple weeks (it's a 2.5 month internship). I don't really know where to start learning. Here's the general picture:  
- They are a advertising group that is divided into 3 sectors, Front-End Development, Server-Side Development, and Data Analysis. I'll be in the Data Analysis group.  
- He covered the following program/languages/packages that they commonly use. Flume, Kafka, HDFS, Yarn, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, HBase, NoSQL.   
- Since I'm one of their very first interns (it's a small company started a couple years ago) they don't really have too much experience in mentorship, that's why I'm asking online as well.  
- From what I've seen in the past 2 days, they mostly use Python/Java/Scala to write their code.  
Honestly I'm just a bit overloaded as it's a ton to take in, I'd appreciate if I could get maybe a walkthrough to help learn everything I need. Preferably free resources.  
I'm just hoping by the end of the summer I can work on a couple projects, maybe some individual projects, build portfolio, and overall learn how to be a data analyst.  
After the summer I'll be entering my 2nd year in college as a Computer Science major with Applied Math, Stats, and Economics minors. However, given the amount of credits I have, I'll be graduating within 3 years so I'd like to get as much work experience as possible. Thanks!"

6lb9cd,2,2017-07-04,Stuck choosing between 2 very different fields: Software engineer or Dentist?,seve_rage,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6lb9cd/stuck_choosing_between_2_very_different_fields/,"Happy freedom day /r/Advice ! I'm slightly drunk, so apologies in advance if any of this seems incoherent/silly/dramatic etc. I've talked about this to a lot of people already, but some third-party feedback could be nice. Also, this may be long, cause I'd like to include all of my line of thinking.

So, I'm a rising senior computer science major at my university. Always been a computer science major. It always seemed like a perfect fit, as I excelled in math in high school, was always in that nerdy/geeky clique, always was on my computer in my free time.... you know the drill.

And in many ways, it is a perfect fit. I've excelled in the curriculum and enjoyed it. Completed departmental honors. Had a perfect GPA until I made an A- last semester. But I started having doubts if it was a career path I wanted to go down last summer, a year ago. At this time, I was working as a research assistant for one of my professors. I had been doing that the semester beforehand, but only 10 hrs/week; over the summer it was 20 hrs/week.

Even though it wasn't a typical software development job, I was writing an application in Python for his research. And I certainly didn't hate it....but I started having doubts. I had chosen computer science as my major without a hint of doubt because I thought it fit me so well.

See, in high school I was this socially anxious kid who never did any extra-curricular activities, never did any physical-fitness related activities, did well-enough academically but spent most of my free time playing video games. Though it took some time, independence in college did a lot of good for me. I became more confident, more fit, and more socially adept. And I realized I wasn't quite as introverted as I thought I was (though I still definitely think I'm an introvert); a lot of that was social anxiety and self-doubt, some of which I still struggle with.

But software development, at least in this environment, started to get aggravating. Rather than applying a lot of the knowledge I had learned in my courses, like big-O efficiency, appropriate algorithms, etc, it felt more like I was constantly just trying to get x library to work with my program; install this package manager to install this library to hopefully maybe get this thing working. In other words, less constant coding and more getting things working together. Just getting things set-up correctly was the largest hurdle.

But more than that, I was feeling unfulfilled. It was a job with a lot of slack, and even though I did a solid job at it overall, I didn't feel passionate about it overall. It was different in many ways from a typical software engineering job, but has some similarities as I'd later see. And...sitting in front of a computer 8 hours a day as a career seemed like it wouldn't be so fun. I thought I might like a more dynamic environment.

So I talked to my adviser about it. Her son had gotten his undergrad degree in CS and went on to law school, so she was familiar with unusual CS-grad paths. I talked to her about my issues, my concerns. She helped me out a lot and told me of options.

I researched a lot of grad school programs where degree doesn't matter (I wasn't going to change majors, as I had already gone too far in the CS curriculum to want to change, I enjoyed the curriculum, and it's a very valuable degree to have). All of them had some issue, such as uninteresting subject matter, long hours, lower pay, etc etc. Except dental school. Dentistry seems great in so many areas, without any killer flaw; great work-life balance, high potential for autonomy, dynamic work environment where you work with your hands (I loved drawing in my younger days), genuinely helping people.

I talked to my advisor about it. She and I developed a tentative schedule to fit in all pre-dent courses. It meant I would take an extra year to graduate.

That was a year ago. In that time, I've taken chem 1 &amp; 2, bio 1, physics 1. Taking physics 2 and organic chem 1 next semester, then bio 2 and orgo 2 semester after that. I should be ready to take the DAT then, next summer. I've also shadowed my personal dentist and a pediatric dentist for a fair number of hours, and I think I'd enjoy the work. But I'm nervous.

This summer I've been doing an internship as a software engineer at a pretty nice company. Pay is great, people are great, very lax regarding clock-in clock-out time. Work is somewhat interesting, but my concerns remain (I don't know if I could find this as a fulfilling career). If I didn't do this pre-dentistry thing, I could graduate in 3 semesters (rather than 4). And I think it would be the better option financially... I could get a starting salary of around 70k in this area without any debt from college, and by the end of my career, I'd probably be making six figures. With dentistry? That'd be an extra 4 years of no work, AND massive debt, probably around 200k in interest-gaining debt. Sure, when I graduate I'll be making 130k+ most likely in a corporate environment, hopefully more if I eventually start a private practice, but it would take quite some time to catch up to the money made as a software engineer.

And the biggest worry? If I did make it into dental school, what if I sucked at it? I'm solid at CS and software development according to my professors and managers. But there's nothing, other than a talent for drawing and a strong memory, indicating that I'd be good at dentistry. What if I got stuck with 100k in debt and decided it wasn't for me? Dental school is notoriously tough. From what I've shadowed, I'd enjoy it. But I have doubts. Software engineer would be the easier, likely better-financially path, but I don't know if I'd enjoy that nearly as much as a career. I've already somewhat committed to this pre-dent coursework, and with my grades I think I have a solid chance of getting into dental school...But I don't know. I really don't know.
So I wrote a truckload, and haven't re-read it, so likely some continuation errors or weirdness in there. Again, slightly drunk. I've talked to my advisers, my parents, my friends, but I'd like a third-party opinion on this. Any advice reddit?

tldr; majored in CS cause it seemed like a perfect fit, excelled in curriculum, but having doubts about a career in the field. Dentistry seems like it'd be fun and fulfilling, but have doubts regarding financial situation of that option and my skills in that field."

Help

CROSS POST- originally posted in personal finance, and someone suggested I post here.. 

Ok, so I'm on mobile, apologies in advance for any weird formatting or written mistakes. 

As the title says, I need out of my current work situation. I work third shift, 11pm to 8am at a major casino. It's a native casino, so I deal with smoke, drinking late into the night, plus the loud noises, gambling addiction, and weird laws/rules placed by the native government. My bosses constantly fight, one is absent all the time, and the rotation of CEOs every year or so because the new counsel doesn't like them causes constant major changes to the work environment. Essentially, 80% of the time, it's a shit show. I'm a manager, and have 8 supervisors on my shift, plus 16 line level employees. They complain daily about random things we can not change due to random nonsense laws, and frankly, I'm too exhausted to deal with it at this point. I can feel myself slowing losing my grip. I'm required to work 42.5 hours a week, on salary. I usually end up there for about 46-50 hours just dealing with the chaos, and attending meetings. My employees have access to my personal number (which is required in my position) so they can reach me whenever they have questions. I feel as if I never, ever leave work. 

All that aside, the hours themselves are killing me. I'm tired all the time. I was so deficient in certain vitamins, my doctor placed me on monthly injections, and I'm currently going to counseling for my stress and anxiety. 

I hate my job. I hate my life. Worse, I'm starting to hate myself. 

The problem I'm running into is finding anything that pays close to what I'm currently making. I'm at 43,000 a year take home. It's a fair amount for my area. I'm applying to other jobs weekly, and looking for anything that will give me close to 20$ an hour. 

I have a degree in psychology with a minor in gerontology. I'm constantly on the lookout for anything in the field (even if it's not degree required) just to get my foot in the door. I've applied to government jobs, hospitals, nursing homes, and counseling services. I've applied for jobs that have nothing to do with my field but hoping my experience with the casino would help: banking, treasury, welfare payments, etc. I'm not finding any luck. 

I was going to go to graduate school originally, however, my husband's dad got cancer, we had to pay their bills, and I ended up having the opportunity to move up and make more money. So, I took this position and now feel horrible trapped.

I know I could live off 16$ an hour, and it would be a struggle, but I could do it.  (About $2000 in monthly expenses including food/gas but could cut out the car payment and eat lots of Mac and cheese) I've gone over my budget 4 or 5 times now, and that's the lowest I can go without depleting my savings. My husband just returned from deployment, and we are unsure about his income as his previous job only has to give him his wage, not his position or hours back. So I'm not even factoring that in.

I've looked at getting into a program with my University for an MA in counseling. (Close to what I wanted to do to begin with.) A friend of mine has recently gone through it, and left the school  with a job. The program offers clinical hours, hands on training, an internship, and is a degree instead of a certification, so it would travel better. Counselors are scarce in my area, and after a time, I could tailor my counseling services to older adults, which is my target group of people  to work with. 

My biggest issue is determining if I can handle work and school with this job. I worked full-time before while going to school, but I wasn't so damn stressed and angry, and my job wasn't in my face at home as much. I could leave it at work. 

So my biggest questions are: Does anyone here have any advise or experiences with leaving a job for lower paying income? And:  Should I just bite the bullet, hold out the three years and grab up the degree with the high income, essentially paying my schooling as I go? 

I'm feeling incredibly at a loss for what to do here. Looking for guidance.

I am a clinical laboratory scientist/microbiologist that returned to school to earn a master's in computer science.

I am having a difficult time finding jobs and internships. I believe the 1 year of coursework I have completed so far is insufficient for a full time or part time position since I cannot get interviews through the school career site or through indeed and glassdoor. I also lack any serious personal projects in my github. To get some experience, I have tried turning to internships. 

To find internships, I have gone to a couple career fairs. Every company I have talked, like Cerner and DST Systems, look over my resume and appreciate the 3.86 GPA but say they are only accepting students pursuing an associate's or a bachelor's. Internships I have applied online to (~12) has rejected me as well.

I went to my school's career center for advice and they said to keep the master's on the resume as they said it looks better. Other people I have talked with said the same thing. I just feel like changing the one word will make all the difference. What would be the possible consequences of doing this?

TLDR: Graduate student looking for jobs/internships but cannot get any. Should I change the ""*Master's of Science - Computer Science*"" to ""*Bachelor's of Science - Computer Science*""?

I got a full time job in march of 2015 and started as a junior at a local software company that builds web applications using their proprietary platform. The core product is in java but for the first year of my job I only wrote JavaScript and used the built in GUI part of our platform to build out applications. This was ok when I started and although I had occasional bumps and walls that were very frustrating I got past them, after doing a lot of ""side work"" my first year I finally deployed an entire application to a client during year 2. By this time I had been promoted twice and now finally had the title I'd wanted from day one, Software Developer. Queue in life. My BF moved across the country and I had been visiting him long distance for a year. I decided enough is enough and told my boss I was moving, I did not have a job lined up and I didn't care I had enough savings to last me a few months. Well the company offered me the ability to continue working remotely full time, this sounded awesome so I took the opportunity and have been doing it ever since (11 months now).

Working remote is killing me, I don't exercise like I used too, I have a very hard time getting up in the morning and am not motivated at all to do work in my own house. I have very little interest in the new ""projects"" I've been given. My back and neck are in bad condition, I went to physical therapy but couldn't keep up doing the excercised daily, I'm not fat 180 6"" but my body hurts. It's effected my relationship and I'm constantly stressed out about being let go because I feel my relationships with co workers have diminished greatly. I don't know if I can continue doing software development, it's all I ever wanted to do. And now find myself fantasizing about being outside and doing new things, a new job that doesnt require me to sit for 8+ hours a day and stare at a screen. My passion for building software slowly dies as I become more aware of how ingrained terrible legacy code is in our clients code base, putting out fires that were created by people decades older than me. It doesn't feel like the software development I envisioned, I love to create and build and now I feel like I just bandaid and help people panicking with fires. "
6lel4b,1,2017-07-05,Did I do well with this job transition?,exogreek,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6lel4b/did_i_do_well_with_this_job_transition/,"Alrighty, I will try to keep this as descript as I can.  
  
A little bit of background about me,  
I am 23, I have no certs, and 3.5 years of IT experience. 1 year as a repair tech at a Geek Squad, 2.5 at a mid range MSP. I have not finished my 2 year associates due to being thrust into the work force through my schools co-op course and me being hired by my current company, but I am 90% through my degree with some menial gen-eds and finishing courses.  

About two months ago I began the job search after I had some unfortunate interactions with my teams manager. This had been going on for a while, disagreements and unfortunate encounters with my companies inconsistency and a growing feeling of a toxic work environment when it came to my manager. The current position I am leaving is with a managed service firm located on the outskirts of a major population center in my area. I was a field engineer tasked from anything from desktop builds to emergency onsite network troubleshooting and the like. I have worked here for a little less than 3 years and overall it was a great position as far as experience goes.  
  
I sent out a ton of resumes and applications and got several replies, had some interviews, but only one seemed interesting to me. I had three total interviews with them and ultimately accepted the position to join their internal help desk team. From my interviews it seems like the network director needs some help with server things and wanted to bring on a jack of all trades into the help desk to assist on projects, but also be able to perform in an internal help desk setting. Being that I drive 50mins just to the office at my current job and travel 2000 miles a month on average, this place was very desirable as it is only 15 miles from my home, and a very comfortable commute traditionally. The 3 man team I will be joining also seems pretty good and the company has a youthful essence to it.  
  
So, I will go over the differences between the jobs and I just want to see what others feel about my approach to the whole situation.  
  
To start off, I was hired at MSP after a 4 month internship for 35K salaried, with a promise of a review in 6 months to re-evaluate things, as they did not allow me to negotiate initially. 9 months goes by and I was able to negotiate 38.5K, when asking for 42. A plan was put in place regarding the 42k however if I met certain billable measureables for a quarter or specific time period. After I year I finally met those measureables and negotiated for 42k. This process took 6 months to approve and I was denied retroactive pay for the grace period. Benefits are good, 160 hours of PTO after 2 years. Free dental and free vision, OK healthcare plan, about 45$ per pay period. (im single, no kids). I also received expense reimbursements for miles traveled and cost of parking/etc. 
  
The new job, I was able to negotiate 51,000 salaried. They offer 3 weeks vacation starting with a benefits package I have yet to fully see, but more expensive premiums and no free dental/vision. They offer tuition reimbursement up to 6K/year and I can expense any certifications I get. They also offer a *very* casual work environment and flex schedules with varying outs. IE - 4on/3off.  I should also note that at my position, Im strictly internal, I have no measureables or quotas to meet.

I have already accepted the position and gave my notice last week. My last official day is this Friday, and I am taking a week in between the jobs to refresh and start the new one on the 17th.

TL:DR - 1 Year PC Repair experience, 2.5 Managed Service - Got 9K raise in a job transition with potentially much less stress in an environment in which I can relax and have the opportunity to work on projects my previous company promised but never actually assigned or trained me on.

I did well in high school; I was an A and B student, and participated in plenty of extracurriculars. However, I always waited till last second to do my assignments, I was always disorganized, and I was always running late. I had an amazing internship in my local government and would constantly miss work or be late for reasons I was unable to explain or understand.

In college things got way worse. I had trouble attending my courses, I kept forgetting to submit assignments or when they were due, and my GPA continued to drop. I even lost jobs from my inability to attend or show up on time. I am distracted constantly, and in fact I am distracting to those around me.

When I finally decided to try to get tested, I kept getting told it wasn't ADHD because I had previously performed so well or that I was just seeking aderall. Well, after 2 long years, and my GPA falling from 3.6 to 2.1, I have finally been diagnosed right before starting Law school (I signed up for my LSAT last second, didn't study for it, and even showed up late but luckily did well on the test). 

* **I just wanted to ask you what you did after you received your initial diagnosis?** I received mine from a neuropsychologist who preformed extensive testing and history reporting. 

* **I have a medication consultation scheduled so I was wondering how that went for you?** How do I prepare for it and what should I expect?

* **Also, how much improvement have you seen since you began medication?** I am still fearful of how I will preform in Law School and am hoping on informing myself as much as possible.

I'm in an unexpected scenario and need some advice. Last fall I applied for a technical internship at a large company and accepted the position. However, I discovered the first day of work that I would be working with an architecture management team. I'm trying to learn as much as I can from my internship, but overall it has been extraordinarily frustrating. I'm about halfway through my internship and feel like I have learned very little about Computer Science. That being said, I want to learn as much as I can from this experience and find a way to list the positive attributes on my resume. Any advice for getting more out of this internship? I've talked to my adviser about getting a different assignment and he gave me a new project, but it seems like it's still going to be more business oriented. I've also been participating in every extra activity on the planet, but I feel like I'm learning next to nothing about Computer Science."

1.) Avoid Alfaro for all classes.  I took her CS 141 class and it was a total disaster.  100% of our grade was based on tests and the class was super disorganized.  

2.) Get involved in organizations.  Use the involvement fair at the beginning of the quarter to find clubs to join.  I was a member of greek life and would highly recommend at least checking it out.  I never had the intentions of joining but after checking it out it totally changed my viewpoint on it and don't regret it at all.  Plus you can get free dinner pretty much the entire first 2 weeks of school lol. If that isn't your thing that is fine, UCI is a big commuter school so clubs are the best way to meet people and have a social life here.

3.) Talk to people in your classes.  You most likely will be going through tons of classes with people you meet in your first couple classes and building those relationships and connections help a lot in school and out of school.

4.)  Participate in hackathons.  Most my initial projects on my resume I used to land my first internship were hackathon projects.  Hackathons are amazing for networking but also getting some practical application of concepts you learn in school.

5.)  Find a stress relieving activity.  School and programming can be stressful and finding something to do for an hour or 2 to just clear your head helps so much.  For me it was surfing but for some people it is going to the gym, playing video games, or evening going to the pub on campus(highly recommend when you are of age).  

6.) Don't procrastinate.  The quarter system is so fast and it is really easy to get behind early.  It is easy to say because I've been there pulling all nighters on projects and I'm sure you all will be there too at some point but do your best to avoid situations like that.

7.)  Have fun.  College is a really unique time in your life so don't be afraid to put the books down for a night here and there and go have some fun.

I'm a Junior studying Computer Engineering at a really good US school. I was fortunate and got a summer internship at a very large machine manufacturing company as a software developer / testing engineer.


After orientation, I was given specific tasks to work on which were open-ended and challenging, while also being fun and easy to test. I busted out a lot of work in the first three weeks - I was working hard, learning a lot (learned Python for the first time!), and feeling great about my first taste of an engineering career.


Since then, things have gone downhill. I was blocked for about a week because I had to wait for my team lead to finish something before we could merge everything together for a test build, then I was given a vague task which sounds straightforward...but no one in the U.S. section of our company knows how to answer any of my questions about it.


My team lead was on vacation for the holiday - I mentioned some of this to him and he's working on helping me start doing productive work again.


I'm posting this because I'm looking to get some opinions about my situation - I've tried to be the ""ideal intern"", as I've focused on my work, asked for more, etc., but lately I've been told by my team lead that there's nothing I can do until work is done by other people. I've expressed my feelings of uselessness, but for the most part I've been told that that's just how the company / the engineering field is sometimes.


I enjoy facing challenges and working hard. Not having anything to do has sucked because being bored kills me - plus I want to get as much as I can out of this. My coworkers and managers are thrilled with what I've gotten done so far so I'm certain I'll be wanted back next summer, but it still feels bad.


On the plus side, I've loved the experience overall. I'm treated like an actual engineer, the people are respectful, and so on. I mentioned coming from a good school because I really feel like my school prepared me well for career situations. However, the level of boredom I've experienced over the past few weeks has made me concerned that this is what engineering life is always gonna be like.


tl;dr: got an internship at a good company, had work to do for a while, haven't since, feels unfulfilling man"

The problem is I've essentially become this other guy's boss just because he understands so little of what we're doing. I'm okay with being asked questions, but it's to the point where I'm getting an average of 40+ questions a day from this other intern, and it's really starting to get on my nerves(also because he hasn't been able to do a like any of the tasks I've assigned to him). Is this an understandable reaction or is this kind of skill gap par for the course in the CS industry?

I'm a summer EE intern. I am designing several PCBs for a MEMS project.

&amp;nbsp;

The setup:

Input signal (0 - 5v) amplified via high-voltage amplifier.

Output of amplifier is ~200V command signal. 
      
Command signal is delivered to MEMS load. The load consists of movable paddles that are electrostatically coupled.
    
When load receives command, the distance between the paddles change, hence changing the capacitance of the paddles, slightly changing the node voltage.
    
The change in node voltage is sensed and filtered using a lock-in amplifier (synchronous demodulation).       

This change in capacitance (and voltage) is used to determine the current position of the paddle.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem: 

I have a decent idea of whats going on, but I'm struggling to simulate the board before designing it. Namely, I do not know how to model the change in capacitance of the paddles. I am using LTSpice. I have played around using the B voltage source (in an attempt to create a voltage controlled capacitor) but to no avail. 

&amp;nbsp;

The question: 

Is there a way to model a component with variable capacitance using LTSpice? Is my best bet to keep working with the B sources?

Long story short, I had an internship set for this summer with a small startup, at the time the startup had shared they may be in the process of being acquired by a much larger company (this is a 12 person startup), but in the case it went through, I would be apart of their team. They ended up being acquired, and I kind of got excited as I thought I'd essentially become an intern for the company that just acquired the startup (it was an acquisition of talent more than anything). It turns out, I won't be moving with the team because I was only an intern, and not an employee based on the acquiring companies HR policy (one of the marketing and four developers also won't be joining either). I am bummed as I was supposed to start last week, but I am now just applying left and right to any internship, but haven't been hearing back. I don't know what to do. I have previous internship experiences at the Big 4, and couple of medium sized companies, but I had put my entire search to a halt once I signed my offer from this startup, as the team I would have joined seemed like one of the best, in terms of technology understanding, and in general of becoming a better person because of the way how these people work and live (I was truly inspired by who would've been my manager on his background), furthermore the pay would've been enough to help my family out and take care of myself to eat and put a roof over my head during the period of the summer. 

I am not sure what to do at this point, I am technically in my fourth year of college, but will be graduating two years from now as I took some gap quarters due to family stuff. I started exploring freelance opportunities as I do need money to eat and live (I am the first generation college student, so I am paying for all my expenses), and usually, my summer internships (which I just save up), along with scholarships pay for school, housing, and food. But with no money coming in, I don't know what I can do, I was exploring freelance opportunities but don't know where to start. I am 22, and it's embarrassing to say I have no idea what's next for me. I don't have a strong programming background, as the role was heavy of a ""Business Intelligence"" role, as I would've worked with databases and scripting in Python and PHP grabbing and analyzing data. I know this is the perfect opportunity to explore more of the Data Science realm, but I have no idea how to fill this gap of my Summer. I basically am humbled right now, as the only thing that worries me is the lack of income, and ultimately, how do I explain the situation of this summer so far when applying for future jobs. Does it make sense to just sit down and cold call bunch of companies around my area for offering an intern? I would appreciate if anyone has any guidance or advice on this kind of situation, I know I sound more nervous and close-minded right now, it's just the pressure of feeling embarrassed of the situation that is freaking me out."

It all began Junior Year of High School. It began well but then plunged into disaster as I kept cutting my classes. But then I met a girl who then I had a crush on till early senior year and to impress her I started doing well in school. Senior year of high school was alright but I kept moving from on crush to the next without being a reciprocated. I didn't really care about which college I got into until I almost got mugged outside of the college I got into(Brooklyn College CUNY) and then switched going to St. John's University. Towards the end of senior year I picked up the nasty habit of watching porn and fapping which persists till this day as an addiction. Then I graduated from my high school, went to my parent's country for vacation and then went to college. Freshman year for college in the fall semester went horrible as I made no friends, fell into depression my GPA was only 2.3 and then in the spring semester things got better, I focused on myself and got my Cumulative GPA to a 3.1. Through a mutual friend I finally get a girlfriend although it lasts only a month and this affects my self-esteem. This drags me into depression once again in which in the Fall Semester of Sophmore Year I basically do a repeat of the fall semester of freshman year. I almost lost my scholarship until the following semester I bring it back up again. However it's not quite up there in order for me to apply to internships. So I wait a semester more until Spring Semester of Junior year to apply and got nothing back. I tried getting a job in the summer but it interfered with my plans to study for the GMAT so I quit it. In addition to all this my best friend from high school ditched during my freshman year in high school. Now I am here heartbroken after attempts to find a companion, tired of trying to find an internship or a job, and quite frankly im just tired of this repeating cycle of rising and then burning to the ground. I feel as if I am going towards the path of self destruction. Currently, I'm doing the following to correct my life: get off social media for a while so I can pick up the pieces while being fully concentrated and focus on myself, do nofap to kick my addiction, and now I'm trying to apply to as many internships as I can. Am I going about this the right way or what should I do instead? How do I find a path?"

There's ~50 interns at the company I'm at and I noticed we're a lot less close than at my previous internships. E.g. people rarely hang out with other interns after work, usually they do stuff alone, hang out with their friends at other companies, or hang out with their roommates. At my previous internships, people would host parties, gaming nights, karaoke outings, etc and invite all the other interns. We'd hang out usually 2-4 times a week.

I thought I just got bad luck with the intern class, but I recently realized that this may be because during summer internships, we're from different universities. At my off-season internships, it would be 80% Waterloo. At my current internship, it's 5%.

Problem is that my internships are ages old, and I'm old. I have 15 years in IT work, but I appear to be going backwards from Systems Administrator to Technical Support, though it's a high level of support. I want to move to either Data Analyst or Java Programmer, or I would consider operations if it lead to Dev Ops.  

I have resumes and cover letters out currently, but no hits and no suggestions. I have a personal project that I think could lead to a publishable paper, but it requires more work and doing more study of machine learning. I have past websites I built and one piece of unimpressive software that is being used still by a non-for-profit that I did voluntarily. 

I currently work full-time and have the house to deal with and normal life stuff, but this makes for limited time. The downside is I stayed at my current job for 11 years, so despite lots of prior movement, I look like I just stopped improving, when really I was trying to get my masters. My job does have an end point, but I have not been informed of what that endpoint is.  I suspect it's no more than 1 year.

I see my options as

1) Focus only on my project and hope I get 100% finished and can job hunt prior to my job going away. 

2) Do smaller, but well written coding snippets to put on Github. Maybe show a couple algorithms, or make a video on setting up Hadoop, and then do a few blog posts.

3) Just apply everywhere I can to get to that next job, and then I can work on items 1 and 2 after getting a new job. 

By this point, I've went through so much schooling with no return on it, I am not sure I can bear to do more class work. I'm also disappointed that my stuff I did before just doesn't count.  Yes, so I can claim I helped people with the stuff I wrote, but some of the reasoning behind it even was so that I'd be attractive to employers. That failed. 

Something that will make me unattractive to potential employers is that I just can't do swing shifts any more, and I get seriously depressed if I have to work more than 50 hours per week long term. 

I get it that I'm likely to be competing with people half my age, but I've kept learning.  I also know by this point my boss will always be younger than me, but it's just the way things worked out. I'm ok with that.

With this information, could anyone recommend which might be my first order of business in going for a new job?  "

Hi, all. I've been feeling really frustrated with my internship lately for several reasons, but the one big thing that I can't stand is that I'm not performing at my best, and I feel like it's not my fault! I wanted to turn to Reddit for some advice in how I can either accept responsibility/shift my mentality or gain some confirmation from people coming from an objective point of view.

So I'm doing research for a health company this summer. The first month and a half have been fine; the work is tedious but it's not terrible. I have a month left of this internship, and the other intern and I have blazed through the project (which was supposed to last all summer). Thus, we're sort of stuck with nothing to do, and our supervisor is out for a week.

Well, some other folks have noticed and have asked us to do some projects for them. Cool. The thing is, my laptop is old. Seriously, it's old. It's one of those bulky, slow Dell laptops from early 2000s. It's running Windows XP, and I can't upgrade it.

For many of these projects, we are required to download some software or run programs. Lo and behold, my computer simply doesn't support these programs. AKA I can't do anything! I'm literally stuck. The other intern's laptop is a little newer so she is able to do all of it. I think part of my resentment comes from the fact that I look like I'm slacking off by not doing the projects (although, it's because I literally can't) while the other intern is thriving and doing it all.

I've spoken to several higher ups about getting a newer laptop or upgrading my system, but they all directed me to IT. IT said ""no can do."" There are apparently no laptops for me, it'd be a waste of time to upgrade mine.

Some person got hired for about 3 months, and she's starting next week. Well, IT whipped out a newer laptop for her that's ""been in storage."" What?! How frustrating. So there's been a laptop just lying around that I could have been using?

I feel bitter because I have really tried to put myself in a position that would allow me to help with these projects, but I'm getting no support from others. I asked the other intern to let me help her on projects by doing the less technologically advanced work; she said no. I talked to the project manager about getting different types of projects; he said there are none.  My supervisor is out. IT/exec are not being helpful.

What do I do?! I feel like I look bad since I'm forced to just twiddle my thumbs, but at the same time, I'm literally unable to be productive. I've done more than they've asked for with the previous projects, so I can't just continue working on that. I've maxed out there.

How do I go about this issue? Is this a mentality issue, or am I right for feeling as though all odds are just against me? I'm growing more and more frustrated at this company with each day that passes...We only have 3 more weeks here, and I'd like to finish strong. Any advice? Thanks in advance!"
6ln4qw,1,2017-07-06,Recently graduated and currently doing an internship. Internship Company expressed interest in hiring full time although I've accepted a separate job offer before knowing this. How do I handle a situation like this?,omsa_hmm,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6ln4qw/recently_graduated_and_currently_doing_an/,"I checked the FAQ and searched the sub and found some advice but would greatly appreciate all the help I can get. Thank you all. 


I recently graduated with a degree in MIS (cross between IT/Business) and am an intern at a mid-sized company (500 employees) doing somewhat specialized work (data analytics/science). Previously I had accepted a job offer from a massive company (250,000 employees) for an entry level job that deals with ERP software and pays well for entry level. Let's call them company Big Corp, and due to their massive size I don't feel too bad like I'm hanging them out to dry by backing out of the job with late notice.

My internship is in the field I want to do long term (data science) and is a good opportunity for experience in this field. The company also claims to have good benefits (they used to be state run and so have some nice benefit packages carried over when they went private). I'm also enrolled in an online grad school and Internship Company will reimburse some education while Big Corp does not.

My manager and his boss recently sat me down and expressed interest in hiring me full time upon completion of the internship. I said I would be interested and in the next few weeks HR will sit down with me to figure out more details.

Here's the info from current job offer from **Big Corp**:

**Salary:** $60,000

**Bonus:** $5,000 signing; $5,000 retention bonus every 12 months for the first two years.

**Benefits/Other:** 10 days vacation, decent health care, 401k matching up to 3% and discount company stock after 6 months employment, no education stipend

**Intership Company**

**Salary:** ?

**Benefits/Other:** Supposedly very good benefits. Gym reimbursement, public transit reimbursement, Education reimbursement/stipend.

**What I would ideally like:**

**Salary:** Would like to at least match the compensation of Big Corp ($60,000 + $15,000 in bonuses in the next two years)

**Benefits/Other:** Would like some time off before I start as I immediately jumped into the internship after graduating and also need to fully move from my hometown and find a permanent residence. It would be nice to have a title like ""junior data scientist"" as the field is somewhat new and having experience as a ""data scientist"" could be helpful down the line in getting a new job or raise. 


**TL;DR:**

I want to keep working with my internship company but have an offer from another company. How can I navigate this to stay at my internship company but not give up salary?

Sorry for the wall of text, but this will affect my life and future quiet a bit. Thanks everybody."

 Here are my stats: 

3.64/3.96 GPA, ~3.62/3.88 with freshman year. 
34 ACT, 1500 SAT 

ECs: CS summer internship, Cross country captain, and track for 4 years. Planning to start a casual Debate club, maybe doing some volunteering Senior year. I've also been doing a few courses in Data Science and Statistics on Udemy, and I taught myself to code in Python.

I have some pretty good upward trend, however, my struggles with executive functioning disorder and a few other issues ruined my grades for the first semester of junior year (I had all B's), and tanked my overall GPA as well. Not counting that semester, I have a 3.8 unweighted GPA.  

I'm a white male, I also skipped a grade (kinda wanted to right an essay about maturity) 

I love math and statistics, and would ideally like to major in statistics and minor in computer science. 

I'd like a medium sized school (3-30k students)
Ideally, I would like to stay in California but am flexible

I'd definitely want a sociable school where I can learn to be socially fluid, and something relatively close to a city.

Would also like to find a school sympathetic to me and willing to consider me despite my shoddy GPA. 

My list right now is as follows; 

Reaches:

Carleton 

Claremont Mckenna 

UC Berkeley 

UCLA 

UPenn 

Harvey Mudd 

UC Hicago

Rice 

USC 

Matches:

I'm an intern web developer and a videogame enthusiast. I'm trying to build my second Pc which would be superior to my current one. I'm still looking through all the options in equipment and yet I always find something better but it'd change my setup entirely. Budget is secondary in options so I'm searching for the great but also in a good price. I live in Eu, Hungary and I'd like to hear some ideas for this kind of setup I'm trying to build!

Setup goal:

- Gaming Pc

- - Intel I7 processor

- - DDR4 RAM

- - Quiet cooling (Liquid is okay)

- 2 - 3 Monitors. One with the strongest GPU and the other(s) for casual. What I mean is the largest monitor connecting to the strongest Graphics card and the others to the inferior ones.
- Somewhat good looking case (Optional)

- 1 SSD (OS), 1 HDD for videos, 1 HDD for games, 1 HDD for programs (Doesn't need to have large capacity) and one for Backup.

- Power Supply to keep this all up!

Other - If you have a good suggestion in these topics share it with me!:

- A great Microphone.

- A decent sounds card

- Keyboard with lights

- Gaming mouse

- Headset / Sound System (2.1)

Me and my wife (23M/24F) are planning on moving towards the end of 2018 (hopefully) with our 2 small children who will be 4m and 1f at the time we're trying to move.

I'm already attending college, 3 semesters in at this point planning on continuing up until the very last possible semester before the move.

I'm using my post 9/11 gi bill which provides me with 2100$/month in my state for living expenses, bills or whatever I need. Transferring to an international School will reduce this amount to 1,566$/month

My wife also desires to go-to school, however she has not attended school since HS and has no VA benefits, but she has a better looking transcript for HS than I do.

I'm in college for a bachelor's in computer science (if a German University has a software engineering program I would rather enroll for that one instead) my wife has no idea what she wants other than a bachelor's degree

I have some questions/concerns if anyone would like to help out :)

1. Most importantly, the children, are we allowed to even take them with us on a student residence permit? And if we can do we have to do any special paperwork for them?


2. Can me and my wife have a joint student residence permit or do we have to file separately?


3. I've heard that some parts of Germany is super cheap to live in and people have gotten by on less than 700 euros/month, is the 1566$/month enough to comfortably live in Germany?


4. Does Germany even consider the VA benefits as sufficent income for a family of 4 on a student visa?


5. If not I know that you can work less than 20 hours/week iirc on a student residence permit, but is it like an open work permit like you can get a job at the German McDonald's or does it have to be something specific like an internship in a field related to your degree?


6. Is this even a good idea with 2 small children? ( We would have the means to fly back if things didn't pan out/in an emergency)


7. Transferring to college, do I have to take an entrance exam or is my completed semesters fulfill an entrance exam, if I do have to take an entrance exam do I get an acceptance letter before or after? ( I really don't want to fly there, get denied, and have to turn around and fly back)

Thanks for the help! :)

Extracurriculars:

Math League (4 years) - Been on our school's A team for 2 years. Chosen by coach and peers to be captain for next year (senior). I've finished in the top 30 in the county for the last 2 years (10th and 11th) and will next year also. This placed me on the team to represent our county at NYSML, which I've also attended twice (and will attend again). As captain, I'll be making several improvements such as moving signups online with Google Docs, holding regular team meetings to practice problems and teach concepts, and making a team website.

Science Olympiad (3 years) - Been on our school's A team for 2 years. Elected by peers to be president for next year (senior). This year I placed 1st in Astronomy and 4th in Optics at the county competition. Our team advanced to the state competition, where I placed 6th in Astronomy (out of top 50 teams in NY). I'm going to make a lot of changes to the way the team is run, including regular check-ins on progress so our team can do a lot better next year.

Orchestra (3 years) - I play trumpet. In 10th grade, I was principal trumpet in an orchestra at a music school in a nearby city. In 11th grade, I auditioned for the most prestigious orchestra of that music school and got in. This orchestra is one of the 2 most prestigious youth orchestras in the city. I will continue to play in it next year (12th grade), and I might (crossing fingers) get principal trumpet.

Jazz (4 years) - In my school there are 2 jazz groups - Jazz Band and Jazz Ensemble. Jazz Band is mostly underclassmen and isn't difficult to get in, but Jazz Ensemble is mostly upperclassmen and difficult to get into. In freshman year, I played principal trumpet in Jazz Band and 4th trumpet in Jazz Ensemble. Ever since, I've just been in Jazz Ensemble. I now play lead trumpet in Jazz Ensemble, and will continue. We've played in the Rochester International Jazz Festival for the last 3 years, and might again next year.

Cross Country (2? years) - I did XC for the first time this year (11th grade) and wasn't good enough for varsity, so I was on JV. Next year, if I continue it, I will get a varsity letter and automatically be on the varsity team. I will probably continue. Solo Festival (5 years) - I've been auditioning at Solo Festival each year since 8th grade. Each year I've done well enough to be invited to the All-County Band, and last year (10th grade) I qualified for Area All-State band. I hope to qualify for Conference All-State Band in the fall, but we'll see.

Robotics (1 year) - I did robotics in 10th grade and was on the programming team, but I didn't like how it was run and all the work was done by the top couple programmers, so I didn't continue (kinda regret this)

NHS (1 year) - I recently was inducted to NHS. It's NHS, not much to say lol.

Chess Club (4 years) - I go to chess club meetings afterschool to play chess, and attend meets.

Internship at U Rochester Laser Lab for Energetics - This summer I have an 8 week paid internship at the LLE at U of R. This is a selective internship, and only 12 out of over 60 people around the county get selected. I will write a research paper and submit it for both the Siemens Competition and the Regeneron STS.

Awards:

AIME Qualifier - Scored 100.5 on the AMC 12B (Feb 2017), and a 5 on the AIME I.

National Spanish Exam - Got a Gold Medal in Level 3 (95 percentile) and Silver Medal in Level 4 (91 percentile).

Clarkson University High School Achievement Award - In recognition of outstanding leadership qualities and academic promise. From the website: ""Qualified students will demonstrate leadership and outstanding academic achievement. Nominations are made by high school guidance counselors during the student's junior year of high school with final approval made by Clarkson University""

RIT Physics Olympiad Honorable Mention - I finished top 15 in the county.

American Chemical Society Achievement Award - Top 10% average in both Honors and AP Chemistry, 9th and 10th grade respectively.

Recommendations:

Will be asking from my math team coach (taught me 9th and 10th grade, chose me as captain) and Spanish teacher (had me for 2 years - 10th and 11th, likes me a lot).

Schools:

MIT, Caltech, Harvey Mudd, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, UC Hicago, UCLA, UC Berkeley, U Rochester. (Yes, I realize most of those are high reaches, but I want to know if I even have a chance of getting in)."
6loyom,0,2017-07-06,Am I competitive for MS or PhD programs?,DoubleBass93,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/6loyom/am_i_competitive_for_ms_or_phd_programs/,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering if I would be considered a competitive candidate for admission to an MS or PhD bioinformatics or biostatistics program.  In May 2016, I graduated with a BS in Chemical Engineering.  I had one 3 month biomedical research internship at a university, an extended internship at a biotechnology company, and two separate semesters of volunteer research with two different biomedical research groups, one at my undergrad, and another post-grad.  For the past year, I've been working in healthcare IT, supporting a hospital's electronic medical record, and I recently started as a phlebotomist, with the goal of applying to medical school.  

Medical research is undoubtedly my calling - I knew this very early on in undergrad, and ChemE seemed to be a great segue into that field.  Unfortunately, my internships have turned me off to working in labs.  Computer science has always been a hobby and personal interest of mine, and I used MATLAB to a certain extent during my ChemE curriculum.  Moreover, I thoroughly enjoy mathematics, statistics, and experimental design.

Unfortunately, working in the hospital is starting to cast doubt upon my medical school ambitions.  Starting in the hospital after spending a year in IT has me starting to think that I might prefer to work with mathematics and computers rather than patients.

I'm going to ride out this phlebotomy job for a while and see how things progress, but I think bioinformatics or biostatistics may be an excellent route for my future.  Given my background, what else would I need to do to prepare, or maintain my preparedness, for applications to MS or PhD programs in the field?  Should I be competitive for strong programs?

Thanks!"

I only just got an actual programming internship this summer and only barely (makes it awkward when people ask why I chose [company]).

I'm not even particularly interested in web/mobile development, but it seems to be the vast majority of tech careers.

Are there other jobs that might be more accessible to me?  How would I find them?  Are web/mobile dev positions ever willing to hire someone without experience and teach them up?  Is there a good way to teach myself this stuff while adding an impressive (at least impressive-sounding) project to my resume?"

Programming wasn't my first career choice, and as such I ended up taking part time classes at BCIT.

I just finished an associate certificate in Applied Software Development (wrote my last final on Tuesday, pretty darn sure I'm going to pass).

I've taken courses on:
Java (3 courses)
C# (2 courses)
C++ (2 courses)
Business Analysis and Systems design (SDLC)

I'm in Vancouver, BC, so coding jobs are plentiful, but so is the supply of coders.
I've looked at job ads and sent out a few resumes in the past months (mentioning I was currently a student) with no replies.

Theres some jobs I seem to have requires, many others I'm lacking a few requirements.

So my question is this:
Should I start building a portfolio while applying to every job I think I might handle, or go looking for an internship and get a part-time job on the side?

Any and all other advice is welcome."

I hope I am not breaking any subreddit rules by posting this, which may be considered off topic, but I figure that this may be a good place to ask for some advice.

I graduated in May with a degree in Electrical Engineering Technology, and am currently trying to find a job as an Embedded Software Engineer. However, I have been applying to about 5 jobs per day on average for the past 3 weeks, and I have not had much luck. I have had a couple call backs, but I have never gotten past a preliminary interview with an HR person.

I know 3 weeks isn't really a long time to have been applying but I am a little worried that I am wasting my time considering the amount of jobs I have applied for, and the small amount of responses I have received. I thought that this career choice would have been a safe bet, as I graduated with a 4.0, and also spent 1.5 years working as a Software Engineer Intern working on embedded systems for a major appliance company. However, when I go to apply for entry level jobs, most of the requirements for these jobs tend to list requirements that seem unrealistic for a person to know or have experience with straight out of school, even if they had internship experience, but I apply anyway because I can't seem to find other entry level jobs on a level below them. Most of these embedded jobs also list Comp Sci, normal EE, and other Science degrees as requirements.

Am I getting screened out, and my resume not even considered because I have an Engineering Technology degree, instead of a Comp Sci, or normal Engineering degree? Are these entry level jobs not actually meant for someone like me fresh out of college? If so, what can I do to find an actual entry level position? Or should I just give up and try to find a job more traditionally associated with my degree?

I would appreciate any advice from any Embedded Engineers who are in the business. :-)"

First just a hi to everyone and i feel your pain, all of you.

Now to the fun part, inspired by recent intern posts, during my university years I got an internal job as an IT student helper. This is a tops 20h/week contract as legally full time students aren't allowed to work full time. Job included anything from checking and replenishing printer toner and paper to setting up machines and helping students and staff with whatever it is that doesn't work.

Of all my student helper colleagues, i was the only one to have any tech wisdom and be in a computer science course too so I would get jobs and calls done really quick. That's a good thing, right? Wrong. As most of the times it would be a tech illiterate lecturer that didn't know how to use the teachers desk, which connects to the projector on the ceiling. 

Hey /u/Chipnstein , why doesn't the university give them a crash course? Oh but it does, every new academic year but they're big shot lecturers, advanced in age, very little you can (try) teach them, so they never show up and of course they're the ones saying it's our fault and whatnot.

But I'm getting sidetracked in setting the world I worked in. Something didn't work, they call central, they call us and I rush there to find out every time that te issue is a powered off screen or something was muted, or they didn't swap the input source and their laptop isn't on the projector, this that after such repetition, you just know what the problem is and know immediately where to look and fix it in a few moments.

Couple of weeks of this and my manager calls me in and says he wants a word. I wasn't scared of being fired or whatnot as I didn't do anything I thought was deserving of this. No, he calls me in with a big laugh and explaining to me that the lecturers were complaining I'm making them look bad in front of the class (maybe next time show up to the 30  min training sessions) and shouldn't fix their problems so fast. I laugh, I agree and ask, what should I do then? 

He said to use the desk keys, pretend to fiddle around a bit, even do a reboot if unnecessary and if they ask what you're doing just say ""I have to temporarily interrupt the main power flow to the front user interface and manually reinitialise the GUI"".

Needless to say I memorised that like a priest does Bible verses and still use it to this day, feel free to do so as well."

- Excessive of office politics, bureaucracy.
- The engineering tasks are very boring and move very slow, I don't feel like learning new things or developing new skill sets.
- Poor quality standards on the product, people just don't care about the product or the code they write (most of the people don't even write code).
- Very old legacy code that as been outsourced through the years to multiple countries, it's a spaghetti nightmare. 
- I can't specialize on anything, one day I'm correcting a bug in C++, the other I'm making a small script in perl, etc..
- There's no culture of getting things done or learning new stuff.
- As a result I'm feeling very unmotivated at a daily basis.  


The problem is that I can't decide what to do, I graduated in electrical engineering (MsC), I worked 2 years as an embedded software/hardware developer at a very small startup and then I jumped at the currently ""kind of"" software engineer for 3 years.


I can't find an answer to these questions:

- Should I pursue a more low level/hardware career? Or stick to software engineering?
- I feel that I need to improve my software skills somehow, but it's very hard for me to achieve that by self learning I need like a learning partner or pursue a PhD degree in computer science, is it worth it though?
- It is possible to get an internship at a company without currently being at college? Which are the best companies (worldwide) that can provide this?
- How or who can help me find my area of specialization? I'm thinking about data science but again I don't know how to start and I don't have any background.

I recently graduated with a BS in Comp Sci and, while I enjoy coding when I'm making something interesting, the majority of jobs I am qualified for at an entry-level are not interesting to me. I'm debating whether I want to get into a career for CS Education. I tutored a lot in college for intro level CS and really enjoy working with students and helping them understand core programming concepts like data structures, algorithms, big-O efficiency, etc. I guess I am more interested in CS Academia than the industry, as I had a summer internship at a finance company and was pretty bored working in J2EE and SQL on web apps, servlets, databases, etc. It just didn't spark my interest. I pretty much got all A's in my CS classes though because instead of dealing with large scale enterprise applications, it's more about algorithms and concepts, and this interests me more.

My question is this: does anyone know a good path I can take in CS education that also pays well? I would probably enjoy being a high school CS teacher, but I know that high school teachers don't get paid well. I may want to be a professor some day, but this would obviously require a PhD which I am in no position to afford at the moment.

I studied EE in college instead of CS because I was cocky and thought I knew everything I needed to know to be a good programmer already.  I started toying with programming as a kid (GWBasic) and in High School my father found me an non-paying summer internship which taught me to program in Delphi (aka visual Pascal).  So when I went to college I wanted to challenge myself and learn something I didn't already know so instead of CS I went in to EE.  I know now that there was plenty for me to learn with a CS degree, but sadly I didn't see it that way when I was younger.

My job is nice in some respects, but it has many issues as well.  I know I could be paid more given the number of years I have been professionally programming.  My previous internship landed me this job because both used the language of Delphi, but now I find myself having spent many years in a language that I consider dead (or dying at the very least).  In fact the compiler for it we use was last updated a few years before I graduated college to show how archaic the software we develop with is.  The past few years I have pushed for and managed to get myself on projects that involve C# (and Javascript/PHP for our website) which makes me happier for sure, but convincing them to take the leap and fully commit to stop development in the old language has been like pulling teeth.  They are getting better, but still we move very slowly towards my goal since as a team of 2 programmers I am the only one programming in C# while the other is still strickly in Delphi.

For monitary reasons my wife really wants me to move on.  For myself, I got in to programming because I loved it and that has always been what I wanted to do and still is.  I am starting to agree with her about finding a new job, buy my motivations are that I want to work on a team using modern tools and techniques building modern software.  Me and my wife have been talking about it and while it feels like a bit of a pipedream I want to work at a place like Microsoft, Google, or Amazon to name a few.  

I was watching a programming video recently (talk by Bjarne Stroustrup) on Youtube and on the side where they show suggested videos, YouTube suggested [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw) which is a mock interview for a development job at Google.  It was so disheartening to watch.  The interviewer presents a problem and the inteviewee starts working out the problem with her.  He immediately dismisses the most straight forward and simplest solution because it is inefficient.  Unfortunately that would have been the solution that I would have come up with.  They then go in to more novel, creative, and efficient ways to solve the same problem and even when she throws a wrench in his algorithm by changing the constraints he then quickly picks up the peices and approaches it with another novel way of solving the problem.  I know this was a mock interview and for all I know it could have been totally staged, but he looked to me like he was truly working out the problem in real-time and he was just on another level compared to me.  I don't know if this is because I never got my CS degree and taught myself or if it is because my job has never required me to push myself to this level but I feel inadequate and like I have been wasting my last 12 years after watching what Google considers to be the level they want their programmers to enter their company at.

Of course I could just walk away from the idea of working at one of these top level companies and stick to finding a job doing simple CRUD operations etc like I have been doing for the last decade.  But what if I wanted to challenge myself to getting on the level suggested in this video.  Does anyone here consider themselves to be a ""great"" programmer?  If so how would you suggest someone go about getting on your level?  I know I have the ability to teach myself whatever is needed (I taught myself in the first place after all), but it seems as though I have not been pushing myself in the correct ways and I have not been learning the right things.   Off the top of my head the best idea I have is to use something like MIT OCW and pick out the programming courses from their video catalog and go back to school (in a virtual sense).  Anyone have any ideas for an experienced programmer on how to take himself to the next level?"

6lynwd,1,2017-07-07,I am a recently graduated international student and I need some advice,vietjesus95,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6lynwd/i_am_a_recently_graduated_international_student/,"There will be a tl;dr for this because I am about to share with you my situation.

As in the title, I am an international student that just graduated from college with a degree in accounting. To put things simply, I am a shit student and i should have done better. I know this. When i took accounting 101, I thought to myself, this was possibly the easiest class and if the rest of the classes for accounting were this simple and straightforward, this would be a breeze, I would get an internship by summer of junior year and land a job before I graduate. That was not the case

My passion is for animals, I enjoy being around them, caring for them, messing around with them. Ive raised rabbits, fighting roosters, turtles, dogs, cats, fishes, and even a bearded dragon. However i could never put my love for animal or science into grades in high school which is why I did not pursue it in college because I felt that my GPA would turn to shit. Problem is, my decision to major in accounting was also a bad decision because by the time i reached intermediate or advanced accounting, I couldnt do anything. I could not bother to put in the effort to pass with flying colors. All i seem able to do was enough to graduate, by a thread if I were to be completely honest with you.

Because of this, I am now struggling to get anything done with my future. I am applying for job opportunities via a program called OPT which essentially puts my name into the system and sorts of helps me find job opportunities. However, i am bound by my degree as it will only work if i find a job in my degree.

My current situation is as so, I do not have a lot of time left and I dont know what to do. I have a friend who is very much like an older sister to me who is helping me out and putting me on track. I have set up an appointment with 2 school deans Im close with through club activities and now im posting here because I frequent reddit every night without fail before going to bed and I wanted a place to write everything I felt and the things im going through in hope someone can relate and help me out.

Of course I am not asking for redditers to give me a job. Thats out of the question, its my life, i have to work for my opportunities. But please, if theres anyone out there who knows what I can do to just straighten my life out, please advice me so. 
I want to stay in the US for another year, earn some money so that my parents could relax after constantly struggling to pay for college tuition to this disappointment of a son.

TL;DR, chose a major that didnt fit me, studied just to pass, now facing the reality that if i dont get a job within a month or so, im going home as the disappointment that i am."

I have two intellectual vitality essays- one already written and one newer idea.

1: My senior year honors information technology independent study project, where I research and apply classic and modern philosophical principles to developments in artificial intelligence and technological innovation as a whole. I also discuss my love for discovering the unknown and bridging the gap between the humanities and sciences

2: Discussing my experiences being a research intern in political science at a nearby university, and how I deepened my appreciation and knowledge about social policy, specifically educational policies. I want to tie in my background here to give context. I'm wondering if this should be my EC essay, but I've already written it (it's about debate).

I didn't have stellar grades and graduated with a 3.0 (mostly due to working full time and spending the rest of my time with the aforementioned engineering teams). 

However I do also have an AAS in Computer Science from a local community college with a 3.9 gpa, but most of the coursework there was focused on learning programming languages and the data structures/algorithms concepts were worked into C++ or Java classes. I'm just worried CS classes from a community college wont be viewed very favorably?

I will be taking in the first semester (12 weeks):

1. Media &amp; Democracy 

1. Statistical Reasoning 

1. Global Issues and Leadership (A joint transatlantic course with the Nunn School of International Affairs) 

1. Managing international crises and ensuring collective defence

1. Global Financial Regulation  

1. Conflicts and Negotiations in the Middle East

1. Diplomacy and Negotiation

1. Arabic Language

As I finished my first year I found that I was really passionate about CompSci and so the past semester has been dedicated to CompSci subjects to give myself a better taste and I can now say that I'm sure I want to study just a B CompSci.

Internship applications are now opening up and I'd really like to get an internship in the summer, but I keep doubting that I'd get one since I don't really have anything to show besides academic projects. I don't know whether to try and squeeze a project in before I apply or if I should just apply as bare as my resume would be and hope that they give me a chance.

Six month from now, I’ll be graduating with a Master in Computer Science (National University of Singapore, but in a double-degree program from France). GPA is looking very good.

I don’t really know where to go from here, and I’m trying to sort it out. To be honest, I’ve been following a rail all my life, and now that I have to make an actual choice, it’s frightening me.

I’m quite a shy guy. I’m better at finding solutions to specific problems, than at leading a team. Better at understanding stuff, than at explaining it.

My favorite field for now is everything related to computer vision. I’ve fiddled a lot with OpenCV, as a side project during my first year of engineering school and then as my main task during a 5-month internship. I’m also very interested in robotics in general (been part of a robotics club for 2 years, I've learned a lot of things from scratch, from Arduino to wiring to mechanical stuff), but my field of study forces me to focus more on the software side than the hardware side of thing.

I’ve some experience in C, C++ and Python, as well as a few libraries like Qt, SMFL, SDL. Also, 3D stuff with OpenGL. Also, I’m a long-time Linux user not afraid of command-line (very familiar with Raspberry Pi over SSH…).

However, I have zero experience nor knowledge on anything web or mobile related. No Javascript, no HTML, no CSS, no PHP...never developed for Android or iOS either. Never managed a server, never been a sysadmin.

The market seems very centered around thus stuff nowadays so I was wondering how that may affect my job opportunities. I’m not afraid of learning, but should I focus on the skill I have or the ones I don’t ?

Thanks in advance !"

6m0owu,4,2017-07-08,22F in Business/Finance. Passion lies in healthcare. What steps should I take?,cl3ophatra,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/6m0owu/22f_in_businessfinance_passion_lies_in_healthcare/,"I am in my last year of studying for a degree in Business with a Finance concentration. I studied another language for a year in between graduating HS/university so that's why I'm sort of late, but I don't regret it. I have an average GPA and will do an internship this year. I have come to the conclusion that this field is not for me. I enjoy some aspects of it (mainly courses that are economics-centric) and if the professor has interesting material, I can enjoy it (it's not that it's not interesting, I just really cannot see myself doing it). 


I've done surprisingly well in some of the courses known as the most difficult ones in the program that I would have thought I would suck at (portfolio analysis, derivatives/risk management, investment, and I managed to pass corporate finance which is one of the hardest classes with the hardest professor at our university). However, I think this has more to do with my ability to comprehend the material and my effort versus my being good at it or ""getting"" it naturally. The more I go see companies or meet people who work in finance, the more I feel I don't belong in that world.  


As a child, I always said I would be a doctor, then I grew to be indecisive and wanted to become everything under the sun. After failing to get into medical school abroad due to differences in diplomas (it was probably for the better as it would be in a foreign language), I decided to just study finance and have something under my name and work out the rest later. I'm glad I did what I did rather than waste more time trying to get into a program that may have been unnecessarily more difficult due to being in a foreign language, in another country, etc. and risk the chance of not getting in again anyway... but I am so unsatisfied. 

I am a person who loves studying, learning and researching but now hate going to university. I loathe it. I want to wake up semi-excited to learn the things I am learning and I would like to have a plan to make that a reality and plan out some possibilities to secure a job in the next few years that I will likely enjoy. 

I would like to choose something so that I don't end up doing anything that falls in my lap. I've spoken to people close to me just to get a feel for myself from an outside perspective in the hopes it would guide me a little better and open up some ideas. People who know me are quick to point out that I am very empathetic so they see me doing something that helps people and also that I do what I want (maybe that means driven? not sure). Numerous people have told me they see me working as a teacher or doing something more creative like working in marketing. My family and SO are also quick to point out that it seems I always return to wanting to do something in science, medicine, or health care. I believe I am flexible and can find content outside of these fields but I think most people can with the right pay, environment, etc. 

After tons of research and looking inwards I have found I am **interested in something that fits these requirements**:
 
**1)** ability to move up or continue specializing 

**2)** relatively well paying, good job outlook  

**3)** dealing with people in a helper role

**4)** Dealing with researching/brainstorming of some sort 

**5)** Creativity/variety day to day whether it is with people or tasks



I am a natural ""carer"" in my relationships with friends, family, etc. I enjoy helping other people with their problems or being in the role of responsible for helping/taking care of them... however I'm not sure this pans out career wise in the most obvious way. For example, I used to volunteer at school for children with special needs and also worked at a kindergarten and while both were somewhat rewarding, I disliked both enough to make the decision I wouldn't do it as a job in future. I love being around kids but disliked the lack of stimulation I got day to day as I was really only interacting with children. I would like to be more involved with adult people, if I am being honest.
 In addition both things fall under the pay minimum that I am comfortable with. It makes me feel selfish saying so but I would like to be able to live comfortably to raise a family of my own. I've also volunteered at a hospital, mostly doing paperwork for doctors but have always felt that when I am in a hospital it felt ""at home"" and I would love to work in that sort of setting, at least I think so when I picture an ideal future me. It just feels right.

I find another strength of mine is intuitively understanding people and wanting to listen and provide solutions. I very much enjoy being almost a ""project manager"" to people, but I am introverted and would not consider myself to be a natural ""boss"" or manager but rather  someone who likes the process of evaluating a person's life, problems and who they are and exploring solutions. 


I have considered getting into: 


* Advanced nursing (nurse anesthesiology intrigues me), clinical nurses, etc. 

* Genetic counseling 

* Public health or policy 

I know I may be able to do any number of advanced programs designed for those who have a degree already such as a one year BSN program or something, followed by a Masters in Nursing, for example. 

I would love to hear about any other jobs or fields to look into that I haven't mentioned already or more tips for the ones I have. 

Thank you so much!

I've accepted a volunteering position in my country for this summer, however I was also in the application process (interview next week) for a three-month internship abroad. I accepted the first offer because it will make my CV look better (compared to the other job) come autumn 2017 when I want to apply for roles beginning in autumn 2018 in a certain industry I plan to make my long-term career in.

However, the opportunity abroad is still really brilliant and I've love to do it next summer (so summer 2018) if they have the availability. I'm trying to write an email to this company explaining the situation but I still feel like I'm coming off as quite rude (and I may be being rude by asking this in the first place) so I'd appreciate some advice. I've copy pasted the email below.

(Rejected from UC Hicago, Williams, Amherst, Colby, Swarthmore. Waitlisted then rejected from Bowdoin, Grinnell, Carleton, Reed. Accepted at Messiah College.) 

I think that I was rejected due to a combination of: my high financial need, my international student status, my Asian-ness, sub-par SAT score and boring CommonApp essay. 

I decided to keep my application to Messiah on file, but I won't be attending this fall. Instead, I plan to reapply to some other colleges, in the US and UK.

CIE A-Levels 4A+s predicted grades (Further Math, Math, Physics, Chemistry)

SAT: 2130/2400

SAT II: 800 Math Level 2, 800 Physics

Asian International Student, high financial need

Prospective major(s): Math, History

Extra-curriculars:

Performing Arts: Club president, organised school-wide arts week, performed in multiple plays in big national theatres. Trinity Guildhall Grade 5 speech and drama with distinction.

Student Government: Student Body president, restarted school radio station, organised donation drive for flood victims, raised ~2000 dollars in funds, brought in board games facilities for students 

Math: Euclid contest international 96th percentile, Kangaroo math contest Silver medal, A-level math and logic competition 5th place nationwide

Debate: World Scholars Cup 16th place team in the world, National Novice championship quarterfinalist



In my gap year, I plan to work on my math by practicing STEP papers (Cambridge math entrance exam), apply to several internships (a business radio station for research, an NGO that teaches underprivileged kids, again for research and financial work, and a local business school set up in association with MIT, where interns are involved in administrative work, finance and research). Also, I will be teaching private tuition classes in Math. 

My questions: What colleges do you recommend me to apply to this round? What should I change in my application strategy? Are the things I'm doing in my gap year good enough? 


Thanks for making it through the entire thing! And I really appreciate any and all help/feedback.

I feel like I'm absurdly overpaid for how little I'm doing. All the other software interns are rising seniors and seem to be doing more than I am but it's really hard to tell.

I ask questions, but I try not to ask too many. I get an answer to one question, spend like 45 minutes making as much progress as I can, and then look back and realize I really didn't get much done at all. Repeat.


I talked to my boss while he was a tad drunk and he said something vaguely encouraging like ""I don't mind if it takes awhile as long as it won't break production"" which I don't know if I should take as a good or bad thing.

I had an internship last year and I feel like I had the same situation. It took me forever to do something as simple as a few line changes.

I do well in my coursework and go to a ""top"" college, so I like to believe I'm not stupid, but I just don't know how to compare my work. 

I enjoy my work when I at least sort of have a clue about what direction to move in. If I know enough about the task at hand to start coding right away, I enjoy it. If I am racking my head on how to start for hours, even after asking questions, I just feel like a pile of shit.

I'm a mechanical engineering student starting college this fall. I have a high interest in computational fluid dynamics and their aerospace/defense related applications. I'd like to gain industry exposure as I'm an AFROTC cadet and my career as a developmental engineer would heavily involve interfacing with contractors. Also, because of field training the summer after sophomore year, I only have two summers to take advantage of these opportunities (unless a company would be willing for me to take a month off, which would most likely only be possible if I was previously employed with them). I cannot do a co-op due to military training commitments during all fall/spring semesters.

My senior year of high school, I applied for 15 different internships. While I understood I was competing with college students for these positions, I marketed myself as being a competitive option as I had 50 college credits (2nd semester sophomore standing), two semesters of college calc, and one semester each of physics, chemistry, and statistics. I had a letter of recommendation from my physics teacher (PhD from a top 10 engineering school in Mech Eng with 11 years of R&amp;D experience at a Fortune 500 company) that described an extensive project I led concerned with additive manufacturing of airfoils, wind tunnel design and construction, CFD analysis of said airfoils, and data comparison between both experimental and simulated values. We had to apply for grant money and employ a lot of initiative, as we only had a month to do the project. Using this project, I asked her to rank my lab skills, project management ability, and technical ability among the students she had taught in college so that employers would have a better idea of where I'm situated. She placed me at senior undergrad/first year master's student.

However, half of the companies I talked to have me a flat no, while the other half expressed interest but where unable to bring me on because of either bureaucratic regulations for the job requirements for grade level. I've already compiled a comprehensive list of companies I'd like to intern at for the next summer, and these 80 companies span several industries, many locations, and levels of feasibility. Many are campus recruiters. Additionally, I'm doing an undergraduate research program at my college where I'll be assisting professors with research and will be formally recognized on academic papers. I'm hoping this will also boost my chances. I have also set up a LinkedIn account that is entirely developed and have begun building a network with current and former employers. I plan on attending all the job/internship fairs my college offers.

Anyways, I wanted to inquire what steps I should take to better position myself to take on an engineering internship after my freshman year. I'm open to any suggestions! Let me know if you need any further info from me to better inform your recommendation. I apologize for my long-winded post, and thank you in advance for any suggestions you may have."

So can anyone reccomend me textbooks and self teaching methods to become comfortable enough to do an internship like this? Experience in things like Java, Python and SQL are mentioned, sometimes C. Is this too hard to do without a computer science degree?

I've been looking for summer internship. I got offers from some companies but I didn't accept because there was 2 other companies that I really wanted to work. So I had interviews with those 2 companies after I refused all other oppotunities. All this searching an internship process was pretty good until this point.


The problem has started here. One of these companies is an international well-known tech company. After the interview, they gave me date when they will announce results of all internship interviews. Well, that date was last monday and as you can see in the title, I haven't heard anything yet. In tuesday, I emailed both of recruiters I talked and asked about my interview. None of them answered me back. I think I can assume that I failed, can't I? ( Btw I know that they announced results of others.)


Other place that I applied was a startup. They are one of most successful and promising startups in my country. The process was a bit strange with this company. They forgot every date we decided to meet or talk again. I had a phone call first. It was good ,and at the end, she told me that she was gonna send a project to assess my technical skills. I waited all week for that project, they didn't send anything. I called again ,and I was told that they didn't need any intern in mobile team (this was the position I applied for). At this point, this was my last chance for a summer job so I said that what do you need then. They told me it would be good if I can do some web development and I said yeah I can do it. Finally they sent me a javascript project and I completed it and sent it back. But I'm still waiting for any feedback. It's been a very long process and I was the one that always calls and asks for the next step. And I'm hesitating to send an e-mail to ask again for final result. Because I feel like that I'm pushing too hard. 


Anyway, this is the situation that I'm in right now. All my friends have already found their jobs and I turned down two offer in order to work in a place I would like. But now I have nothing and don't know what to do. Thanks for all advices and replies!"

It's also weird because I've been reading articles saying that the US has had a drop in unemployment, but I'm not sure if that affects my job prospects as a programmer. I'm also in the SF Bay Area if that matters.

TL;DR: Completed internship and job at software engineering, feels a little burnt out from working, trying to find a new job, not sure if it's normal to get rejected responses."
6m4iu8,3,2017-07-08,Just started a job a month ago but was offered a job at a different company for more money. What do I do?,bmitrano825,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/6m4iu8/just_started_a_job_a_month_ago_but_was_offered_a/,"I worked for this company during my senior year as an internship and I loved the company and my coworkers. At the end of the internship, I was offered a full time position doing what I was doing during my internship once I graduated. I happily accepted and started this past month. The pay is pretty decent and I was happy with where I was. 

Then, just this week, I was offered a job with another company that basically pays double what I am making now and doing work that I would say more closely aligns with what I want to be doing. The only catch is that it is basically a three month trial and if I do well enough, I will be offered a job. I do not doubt that I could get the job as I have the skills and my brother's friend is one of the managers, but there is still some risk of ending up without a job in the end.

I love the company I currently work for and would feel horrible telling my manager, who has lots of plans for me and definitely wants to make me a bigger part of the process, that I will be leaving. There is obviously opportunity to make more money than I am currently making with this company in the future, but it would take a few years and it is hard to turn down the chance to make double what I am making now.

Is it frowned upon to leave a job after such a short amount of time? Should I stick it out and see what happens?

Any advice or insight would be appreciated.

The way it is set up is that every intern is assigned to a different person, so no intern has the same experience, but a fellow intern brought up how he noticed how poorly I am being treated in comparison to the other interns.

I have never had a performance issue in any job that I have worked at, but she is seriously picking me apart for everything and is generally making my life miserable. She even yelled at me for going to a meeting five minutes early and made me wait at my desk until the meeting started. At a meeting yesterday she accused me of not finishing up a project that I was working on even though it was clearly done and saved in an appropriate folder on a shared drive.

The other day I had to take a day off because my mom had a surgery, and it was approved by my boss, and I even had a letter that was written by my moms doctor excusing me from work and to call him if there was an issue, and she made me feel bad even though my boss who is above her in the chain of command approved it.

In general, she is highly critical of me and my work, no matter how thorough or correct it is done, it is always wrong, or I am always wrong.

The internship is only 8 weeks and I am starting week 5 of 8 this week, but I am having a seriously hard time getting out of bed every morning to go to this place with how I am being treated. It's to the point where I feel like I am being targeted and being weakened just for the sake of it. My boss has not said anything to me or had any problems with me, neither have the other supervisors or interns, but the supervisor that I am reporting to is making my life hell at this place.

Any advice is much appreciated, thanks! "

up until a month ago, I did not know of this sub's existence, and upon reading it realized how I fucked myself by not getting an internship. 

My question is, when applications open up, should I apply for internships or FTE?

 If I receive an internship offer, I could delay my graduation date, coming back in the fall of 18 and graduating in the winter. 

If I do not get an offer, I will just apply for full time and graduate in May. 

Also, would it possible for me to say I am returning but actually just graduate in May? Obviously I would rather not do this, just wondering if someone had experience with this.

6m7ii6,0,2017-07-09,"Studying Computer Science, lost motivation while looking at available jobs. What to expect and should I bother to continue?",blu132-2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6m7ii6/studying_computer_science_lost_motivation_while/,"Hello,
right now I (21) am studying Computer Science at a university in Germany.  I used to be very enthusiastic about this.  I knew C, BASIC, bash/POSIX shell and some python before I had even started studying, and already used GNU/Linux exclusively.

For me, the magic is in creating something new, solving problems and automating tasks.  Every program I wrote felt like writing a song and I was proud of every single script I wrote as well (poetry?).  Now, I worked for two paid internships at the same company (they liked me so much they took me again) and felt great satisfaction from the work I was doing (administration, more automation with scripts, research and documentation, ...).  If I needed to know something, I learned it quickly on the fly.

University however, is another story.  I am more the creative type and the approach taken to Computer Science there is as methodic as a printing press at work.  You go in, do math, do Java, do more math, learn something about systems/networking/(depends on semester) and you come out as a Bachelor of Science.  Discipline (hint: I am bad at discipline) is key here.  While I agree that knowing many of these things is essential, the approach doesn't resonate with me at all.  When I did everything I was supposed to, I felt no satisfaction at all and at some point, lost interest and only did the bare minimum of what I needed to do.  Obviously, my University career is going downhill now.

As a result, I have been looking online for jobs that I could possibly do to build the motivation to continue.  However all I see is php, javascript with whateverishotthisweek.js and ""please only write us if you are CS Bachelor/Master with 6 years of experience."".  But all I have is a good (as in VERY good) reference from the company I worked at, as well as a school report that says I am good at creative things and IT, though terrible at math from Gymnasium.  I only got into that internship in the first place through helpful connections.  Either way, php, javascript and other web tech is stuff that I can't and don't really want to do anyway.

So University seems very unappealing and the jobs that seem to be available are unappealing.  Am I not looking in the right places?  Am I not fit for the modern IT/CS world because I don't want to do webdev?  Should I try an apprenticeship on the matter instead?  Should I quit and become a forest ranger instead?  I have been kind of lost in this spot for about half a year and my lack of engagement in university matters starts to take its toll.  My motivation for everything else is also slipping and I need to do something about it before the depression hits and I can't do anything about it anymore."

I've done some light PHP development in the past (simple REST GET api etc). If I learn PHP, I can leverage my job experience and possibly get on their development team but only if there are openings for a developer. However, ASP.NET has a larger job market and has been recently open-sourced. PHP jobs are significantly less than ASP.NET.

If I recall correctly, they provide students with a ""Shopping Period"" to tour different classes before selections and it is one of the best institutions to attend if you are undecided. I like not being restricted to a certain major or subject as I would be at more technical schools. 

Currently I could gear my application strongly towards specific passions and goals, but realistically I would want to look into other areas in college. (i.e I have great ECs and scores and demonstrated passion in polsci/history/business but I am still excited about STEM fields such as Computer Science, Aeronautics, Mechanical Engineering, Biology, etc.

I can't go back in time and focus more on STEM during high school, however college is awesome particularly because of all the new opportunities granted. I am interested in trying out other fields and was wondering what other great schools, besides Yale, would be excellent choices for an applicant like me.

Other information about my preferences: 
I like being somewhat close to urban areas because of the potential for internships, extra opportunity for dining, living, jobs, meeting people, etc. 
I like small student to teacher ratios but do not prefer small schools.
I take inspiration from natural beauty and nature, although extremely cold climates are not for me.
Attending a prestigious institution has many upsides, but I also don't want to be in a place with many arrogant or selfish people. I want there to be a collaborative and inspirational atmosphere.
Lastly, cost is a somewhat significant factor as family makes &lt;$65,000 annually. Yale is need blind and demonstrates full need. Any other colleges like this would also be outstanding.

Thanks for the long read and consideration!

TL;DR: I don't want to be restricted by major or study in college. I am curious about great schools that provide academic fluidity, a constructive atmosphere, rigor/prestige, great opportunity (urban, reputation, etc.), and good aid."

It's basically database with hotel, taxi and activity bookings of customers, in which you can view, add and edit new bookings. I am however not sure in which programming language to write it. I could do it in R, but I would prefer it to be a local standalone program with a simple graphic user interface, which seems like an impossible task in R.

I recently got an offer from what I think is a pretty good company (not Big N, but definitely brand name company) for a QA intern position and was wondering how this might affect the rest of my career.

I know when I say 'affect the rest of my career', it's a bit of an exaggeration, but I do want a better understanding of how it might play out in the future. I read some other posts about picking up a QA position on this subreddit and the answers ranged from ""don't worry about it"" to ""avoid all QA positions like the plague."" I was hoping for the possibility of moving to a developer's role if they chose to stick with me, be it immediately after the intern period or some time later down the road. I love the people I interviewed with, the environment, and the product, but am I being too optimistic in thinking of moving to a developer's role quickly?

Essentially, my biggest questions are:

* Would it be better to wait it out and continue applying to other companies for a developer role?
* Is it hard for people in a QA role to move to a developer's role?
* Are QA positions as lucrative/practical as developer positions?
* If I end up staying the QA path, what would advancement in terms of greater responsibilities and fulfilling tasks look like for me?

I'd love to hear any other experiences or stories from people currently in a QA role or people who have gone from QA to developers."
6m8zpi,1,2017-07-09,"How ""technical"" were your internships?",azncommie97,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6m8zpi/how_technical_were_your_internships/,"From what I've read and what my friends have told me, engineering internships seem to run the whole gamut in terms of technical work. Some have said that they used literally nothing from their classes, and that everything they worked on was learned on the job (these ones seem to involve a lot of Excel). Other experiences seem to be quite technical, especially in software and design intern roles, and these are where classes are very relevant. More still are somewhere in the middle.

I think I'm somewhere in the middle - I currently do a fair bit of DSP programming in Python at my internship, though I'd only taken a sophomore-level LTI signals and systems class and had a moderate grasp of C starting out. I've drawn on some basic intuition from the class as to what I'm doing, but the reality is all of the hard math is taken care of behind the scenes in Python, which I basically learned completely on the job. Moreover, most of the advanced concepts apparently aren't covered until DSP graduate courses, so I simply take my supervisor's DSP knowledge/specifications as gospel and use the appropriate NumPy/SciPy function for implementation. I graph the results and show them to him or another engineer for interpretation, and they tell me where and how to proceed from there.

So even though I've certainly learned a lot of Python over the past few months and seen indirectly how complicated and collaborative the engineering design process is, I really don't feel any deep intuition for the theory behind what I'm doing. Some of the stuff I've programmed sounds really fancy, but I didn't devise any of it and once I've got the first script for a certain thing done, much of the rest amounts to copy-pasting and tweaking some file and variable names.

I guess this is to be expected, and on some level I'm fine with it as an intern - I suppose that's what grad school is for, after all. Many of the engineers who work in my hallway have graduate degrees. It could also be some form of imposter syndrome. But on the other hand, I'm only three semesters away from graduating, and though I'm starting to take senior electives, it makes me a little uncomfortable knowing that the real world is only a year and a half away. Will these last three semesters really make that much of a difference?

Anyways, I've really gotten off track from the original question. if
you're reading this, thanks for taking the time.

TL;DR: What was the level of technical work for your internships, and do y'all feel unprepared for post-graduation?"

Thank you in advance. I will save the wall of text that will explains my reasons for wanting to commit to a 5 year PhD program and instead give a different wall of text. I found my voice in economics, and enter another world when I do the math pertaining to it. I have considered this for the past year now, and am fully convinced. However, I will say that I am more interested in think tanks, the Federal Reserve, and industry jobs rather than academia. I spent a combined three years both owning a private and group tutoring business and managing an international tutoring company to know that I could not teach as a main thing. My areas of interest: econometrics, financial economics, behavioral economics, and applied micro.
As background, I went to college a semester late, then went to community college for the first year of school, and went to a large state school (non research), all for financial reasons, to finish up. I finish in December, making it a 3 year degree. 4.0 GPA, Econ major, started Econ honor society, scholarship honoree since I have been here for the past 2 years. I am a couple of classes away from a math minor, but my scholarship runs out this fall to only cover my major, and I cannot find the funds to finish it in the spring. Ergo, here are some constraints: 
- my school is not a target at all, doubled with the fact I have no research experience. I am trying to set something up with a professor who is working on something very on the side. I also want to do a 'senior thesis' but it will not get recognized by the school and would be for my own edification 
- cannot finish a math minor, so I only have calc I + II, linear algebra, mathematics for economists and statistics. 
- no publications 
- my experience is more work related, such as being an account manager, or risk management intern at a fortune 100. I am sure that they would rather see something more academic work related
Statistics that may work in my favor 
- 4.0 GPA (in my major and overall) 
- 167 Q, 160 V GRE (awaiting writing) 
- hopefully a knock out SOP that can show them my desire to learn and potentiality to contribute to the greater study of economics
- LoRs from the economics department head, the professor I'm working on the research on, and I'm considering the third between someone from industry I've worked with in Risk or a math professor (this math professor also teaches a math camp at one of the Ivies during the summer and has given me last years math camp to do)

As I mentioned that I would like to use my degree in a more applied sense as opposed to academia, I have, at the suggestion of some PhD's I have spoken to, looked in business schools (IE Carnegie Mellon's Tepper school) for their PhD programs which seem to be designed more for that than the other top 10 ranked schools. My dream would be to go to Columbia (where I was accepted for undergrad but could not pay for), more specifically Columbia Business School. Other schools on my current list: Rice University, Fordham University, University of Georgia, Emory, CUNY, UHouston, UT Austin/Dallas, UC Riverside and USouthern California.
Realistically speaking, I feel like I am facing more negatives than positives in regards to getting into any of these programs. I have been speaking with some people I know at a federal reserve bank near me about an RA position with them (if I can get in) as a possibility. I have also looked into Master's programs (which would have to be funded, so, far and few in between) and am strongly considering applying to them too in case I cannot get in this application round. The other alternative I can see, which I hate, would be to apply to jobs for the time being and try to fit in some sort of research for the following year applications.

Hardware design, software integration, video games?",Amb1valence,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/6m9duq/another_recent_grad_needing_career_advice/,"Hey there, I'm just in need of a quick reality check as far as where I should start my career.

I dual-majored in EE and Biometrics, the former being my main interest and the latter mainly for in-state tuition and some lateral career movement freedom. Now that I'm a dirty hippie graduate looking for employment, I'm conflicted on where to go. I did multiple internships, the (only?) most serious ""big boy job""-ish one being a circuit/PCB design co-op at a pretty boring company that I cut short after the 2nd rotation, because they hired me before I took the meat of my EE classes and they didn't know that I didn't even know how a diode worked yet. Long story short I got a *bit* of experience reading datasheets and shadowing my officemates etc, but overall it was a mess and something I don't want to repeat.

Hence, I'd like to be more discerning now and go for gold in something I really want...but it's hard finding the overlap between all the !!really cool!! Google and Amazon Silicon Valley-type jobs, and something that is actually achievable with my credentials. (and preferably soon, as I just need to start working already).

Here's what I need advice on:

I'm open to options, but what I do know is my original passion is video games. Now I don't want to go a straight game dev, software-only route, and don't quite have the programming chops for it anyway, but I recently bought the [Steam Controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tjWsje9qBc) and love the ingenuity of it and the software customization. If I could work on designing something like that, it'd be so cool. Maybe work on the embedded hardware driving the touch-enabled trackpads?

More than just with gaming though, I fell in love with the way you can remap all the inputs however you want to multiple outputs. For example you can enable acceleration, so a fast swipe of your thumb across the pad (over a constant distance) results in twice the amplitude of the output being sent to the game. It got me thinking about how you could apply that same type of general ""controls"" concept to more than just video games, especially with IoT devices - what if I could help design a steam controller-like smart remote that integrates with an entire software suite controlling the lights in your house, or the HVAC system? And from there you could just handle everything in software, remapping the remote buttons, setting certain lights to come on automatically at different times of day, and at different brightnesses, etc.

**tl;dr** I guess really I'm just trying to find what balance of hardware work and software work I need to strive for on a career path. Specifically I wonder:

1. If I go for a more hardware-oriented design job, how much mechanical engineering-type concepts will I have to know? For example it matters the angle that the trackpad on the steam controller is placed relative to the level of voltage sent to the SoC depending on where your finger is. And in a smart HVAC system I'd probably have to have some prerequisite thermodynamics knowledge. Can I go for multidisciplinary work like this right out of college, or is that a wild goose chase and I'd be better off simply being a circuit design monkey?

2. I'm seeing in everything that involves even a little bit of software, more often than not, it's pretty much ALL purely software. Even the embedded engineer positions I'm applying to need primarily extensive C programming knowledge and barely any actual physical hardware experience, since everything's just on FPGA's and standardized SoCs anyway. If I want to do anything involving software, would I be better off disregarding EE entirely, taking some time to dive headlong into programming and brush up those skills before attempting to break into that field?

Thanks for any insight, I'm just really confused on how to work anywhere that's not a power plant."
6m9msw,66,2017-07-09,TIFU by underestimating a spiders intelligence and blood/sweet tea lust.,sirkellsworth,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6m9msw/tifu_by_underestimating_a_spiders_intelligence/,"So this story spans about 2 weeks. Over the summer, I have been working at an internship for $company in $nowhere Oklahoma. Not the town Nowhere but just somewhere in the middle of Oklahoma. I am renting a room from some people that own a house near $company. They have a place for me to park my truck by the side of the house, next to some fire wood and a sort of wooded area. Anyways, about 2 weeks ago, I notice a big spider web in my truck bed. Im not particularly scared of spiders...but I do not like them in my room, truck or on me. But I thought, ""its not hurting anyone, I'll just leave it until I need my truck bed."" That was my big FU. Because it was about the size of a quarter and a bright OSU orange. 

Over the next week or so, I noticed some cool patterns in my bed and just thought ""Cool! Look at that design!"" The next week, I commuted back home and my father helped me wash my truck. I didnt think of the spider and didnt find him anywhere while we were washing it. So I just thought that he died or moved on.

That takes us to day. I’m back in $nowhere, Oklahoma and I had the munchies for Freddies Stake burgers. I went to the drive through to get my burger. The cashier woman handed my my burger and my fries. And while she was trying to hand me my drink, this big ass spider jumps from my room MI3 style onto my succulent sweet tea. She, of course, flips out, throwing my drink and also the spider into the air. I, with my amazing reflexes, catch my drink upside down in a way so that the lid comes off and washes the spider onto the ground with a rush of that cool, cool sweet tea. She apologizes and gets me a new drink. I go home thinking that that will be the last of it but no. He somehow climbed back onto my truck and positioned himself on the middle of my driver side door. 

After I climb out of my truck, I notice that he is sitting there rubbing his sticky bastard feelers in a diabolical way and has somehow figured out how to change his color from OSU orange to death black. I knew that I would either have to deal with him now or tomorrow morning at 6am when I go to work. I ran inside and grabbed a cup of water and ran back outside. To my surprise, he was gone! That sneaky bastard knew I would come back with something to try to at least get rid of him and hid somewhere on my truck. Now, again, I'm not scared of spiders...however, this...thing! Has already attacked me (or maybe my sweet tea) and has taunted me in that evil spidery way. So I start looking around my truck thinking hes just trying to find someplace to make a web or something. After about 5 minutes of looking I think back to how he attacked me before. He jumped. Off of the roof. So I think “No, that was just a coincidence.” So I decided to get in the bed of my truck to check the roof. And there he is. That bitch of a spider is sitting right above the drivers door in a way that you can only see him from above! Waiting for me to climb back into my truck so he can make his next move!

He must have noticed that I found him because he turned to me and looked into my soul with his beady little eyes. After judging me to be his next target he, once again, jumps from the roof MI3 style onto the drivers door in a desperate way to escape. I was a little stunned because I have only seen squirrels and cats plot the destruction of man. So, I jump down from my truck bed, next to the right rear tire. Slowly walk over to the door only to see that he has dispersed again. Now at this point, I should have realized that my truck is no longer worth the trouble and I should have doused it in gasoline and burned it. But I was too scared of letting him learn about the destructive force that is know as fire. 

I search around again and find him hiding beneath my driver side mirror. Now this probably didn't happen but I was starting to freak out a bit and I swear I heard him hiss at me. I poured a little water on the mirror and he fucking jumped about 2 feet to my driver side window! I wasn't expecting that so jumped back and threw the rest of the water at him. It was a pretty damn good shot because it washed him off of my truck and about 5 feet away into the wood chips. I swear he hissed at me again and ran off. So now I’m hiding in my room with my trusty Dean Marten lighter and a bottle of hair spray just in case. I don't know how to kill a spider that has somehow adapted in such a way that it can change the color of its skin; is the size of a quarter and now probably has the taste for blood and, very likely, the taste for sweet tea. I hope that fire will have some effect on it so if anyone knows where I can buy some fireproof paint (preferably blue) for my truck or maybe a clear coat, I would very much like to know so I can shoot fire at him if he tries to MI3 me again.

TL:DR: Orange spider that is the size of a quarter learns how to change colors, learns the sweet taste of blood or maybe sweet tea and tries to kill me or kidnap my sweet tea. He hisses at me and plots his next move. I need to know where to get fire proof car paint in case of retaliation.

Edit: So I thought I should update you guys on the day after my encounter with what I can only assume is an apostate of Satan. Anyhow, this morning I carefully approached my truck with my lighter and hairspray in hand ready for the impending attack. And after a short inspection and a few ignorant remarks from my neighbor, I determined that the said apostate had run off. On my ride to work, I was most worried that he had webbed up my engine so he could attack me when I go to fix my engine, (you can tell I watch too many movies) but that didn't happen. My desk had a few more webs on it than usual and I'm pretty sure HR would be pretty pissed if I tried to cleanse my desk with fire so I just cleaned it with sanitary wipes. Have yet to see that little bastard and hopefully yesterday was the last and only attack...but paranoia (and too many movies) tell me that hes just waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. Still wondering where to get some flame retardant paint so I can blast killer spiders of biblical proportion off of my truck."
6m9mtd,1,2017-07-09,"I Fucking Hate Applying For Jobs (This is supposed to be in all-caps, but I'm trying this 'reddiquette' thing since I'm new.)",PorkSwordFracture,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/6m9mtd/i_fucking_hate_applying_for_jobs_this_is_supposed/,"There, I said it! And I just discovered that this sub-reddit exists so hopefully, these moderatin' folks will allow this post to circulate for a few moments.

I fucking hate applying for jobs! There it is!

I fucking hate writing and re-writing, and re-writing my resume, tailored to you, the DUMB-AS-ALL-HOLY-FUCKIN-ASSCRACKERS ""recruiter"", so that you can (slowly and carelessly) pass on my details to a hiring manager, who would hire anyone with a pulse (to include my cat, Mr. Raps) if they’re willing to work for peanuts, or for free, or, if they have really nice tits, which I unfortunately do not have. I also hate everyone’s well-intended advice that seeks to correct any shortcomings I may (probably) have. I should just quit asking for guidance and go back to waiting tables.

The scary thing I’m discovering is that I’m not alone by any means. I have read too many posts on Reddit or StackOverflow from more experienced web developers, back-end developers, sys-admins, and cybersecurity professionals, who are continuing to get shitted on, or, shit on themselves for agreeing to work for peanuts after being promised (or at least the idea being suggested) of promotion potential or other supplementary benefits after X years of tenure. Or whatever the case. Someone can contribute their experience to this thread, I can imagine.

My problem is I’m not playing the game well enough! How horrible of an idea that I am willing to negotiate fairly for an appropriate cut. I have roughly three years of IT experience (as well as my ~7 experience in the military/intel field), a security clearance, and working on my second Masters. Yes, I have an IT certification or two (which means DICK to you, I know). I live in Texas. I’m asking to start me around $55-60k. Not six figures! Not seventy thousand. I’m being more than reasonable...

What’s that, you don’t think I’m being reasonable? You’re right I’m not. I’ll lower my standards. I’ll sell my time--my nights and weekends--for ~$28k a year, how’s that?! No, I don’t need health insurance. What’s that you say? You’ll match .5% up to 3% of my pre-tax 401K contribution? Great! I may be able to pay these student loans off after all!

Seriously, if you’re a recruiter then you’re in “sales”, right? You’ll make your sale if you know your product/service, right? I’ll buy from the used-car salesman who knows the car and what’s wrong with it (there’s usually something wrong with the car, at least cosmetically). Know what the fuck you’re looking for regarding that job requisition. I don’t give a fuck how many requisitions or candidates you have. Get organized! These DevOps/IT specialists/InfoSec folks you’re trying to hire, it’s pretty difficult stuff to learn. Probably more difficult than getting numbers for your temp agency. You actually have to pay these professionals a competitive salary. Same can be said for junior or entry positions. I’m not going to work for 30k or 40k. Unless I have to. Maybe I have to. At any rate, many of these companies should just be reaching out to HS or college interns. They’re smart enough to do the work, and will probably work for free, especially if you can promise them they’ll make $30K upon graduation, whoop!

But! But, u/PorkSwordFracture! You have to network! It helps so much in finding jobs! Making those 3rd string connections are a necessary component to job search success!

You’re so correct random Reddit reader! Truth is, I hate networking! I hate being fake. Or representing myself as someone that gives a shit about this large firm where the CEO and executive team make at least 10 times what the majority of their subordinate employees will make. I hate pantomiming interest towards what you direct me to see: a shell of a hard-working, stress-free, American-Dream acquiring person who wants to blab about how great your children and your husband is, yadda yadda yadda.

Is it because I don’t do Facebook or Twitter or anything? Perhaps it’s because I’m not interested in aggregating the fountains of shit I have to wade through when I: read the news, listen to my girlfriend’s family drama, deal with my own family drama, etc.


I’m a really genuine guy when you get to know me. Guess that’s my problem! I’m too genuine from the get-go and that pushes away all the phonies. The small network I have, has been a great help, but truthfully they confess to me how their jobs eat away at their souls and how they wish they could have a fresh start at a career in interpretative dance choreography or something.

If you really want to network with me, come over and have a meal with me, or lets go get sloshed together or something. Either way, you’ll develop the confidence/trust you’ll need to “give me a shot”. vs. this programmed bullshit line of “Why, yes, I really am a hard-working team-player, and I’ll do anything to go above and beyond to meet the firm's quotas and expectations”. Ugh, just get the money shot over and done with. No, I don’t actually say that. I finesse my bullshit pretty well. I think. I don’t know. Fuck it.

So this is it, my mid-life crisis at 30s. Forget my attempt to change careers. I should just become a school teacher in the inner city. Get yelled at and slapped around by a bunch of kids living in Section-8 housing  (I was raised in section-8 too, don’t judge me; you'll judge me anyway). Then when I have enough of it, I deck a student in the jaw, fracturing his mandible (Now now, I wouldn’t hit a female) and then get arrested and get 25-to-life (with parole because I need that metaphorical carrot-on-a-stick to stay motivated) and put on the sex offender list, because that just seems to happen to every teacher now and days.

I’m done with my rant and it wasn’t as creative or self-healing as it could have been. It doesn’t really matter, there are worse things to rant about anyway. I’m going to drag myself to modify my resume once more, and convince these dumbshit HR folks that my degrees in underwater basket-weaving and my 10+ years of general work experience demonstrate that I have what it takes to put cover sheets on TPS reports.

I’ll work weekends too.

Or maybe I’ll start a bratwurst food-truck instead. “Can’t beat my meat, Planet Earth”.

6m9wgh,2,2017-07-09,"Terminated from summer internship, only worked there for FIVE days. Need help on how to get it back.",fratthrowaway11111,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/6m9wgh/terminated_from_summer_internship_only_worked/,"Basic info: 20 yrs old, rising junior at a large university, IT major. Received a call from the staffing agency who helped me get the job (instead of the company itself, what a total slap in the face) that the company I worked with terminated me because they are ""moving in a different direction) (which I see as a sneaky way to say 'fuck off'). They also added that there was ""really no work for me"" which I'll expand on further.

To begin with, I was offered an internship (on the spot by the way) by this company near my school. Do note that I went through a staffing agency (Kelly Services) to get this position. Anyways, the internship was labeled ""HR Intern"". In other words I had to help out the human resources department (which consisted of one administrative assistant and one manager who had to oversee hundreds of employees) with whatever they needed.

On the first day of work I was told that the workplace was ""very fast paced"" and that ""something always needed to be done."" I was also assigned a project on the first day: create a spreadsheet of every absence, callout, tardiness etc for every employee for the past five months. It was an extremely, extremely tedious project that was 99% data entry. But I still had it done, did it impressively and was commended for it. I finished it on the second day of work (the 500+ row spreadsheet). The day after, I covered the administrative assistants work shift because she had to take a day off, so my duty was to sit around and answer phone calls as well as tend to any visitors. Easy work, and I did it fine. No hitches in anything, as was the case during my time here. I dressed up well everyday, I come to work on time, I don't bother anybody. If there wasn't work to be done, I would get up and politely ask for some only to be greeted with a ""oh we're sorry, we don't really have work for you right now."" What would follow up after that is me sitting around doing nothing. I mean, what else am I supposed to do? I'm there to do what my employer tells me to do. Not to mention it's an internship - I'm there to learn and grow.

Anyways, obviously I cannot speak too much about my time here considering the company decided to flip me off after five days, but during my very short stint here the work that I did was very MENIAL and DULL. I would sort files out, do tons of data entry, yada yada. However, when I did do work, it was only 40 percent of the time. The other 60 percent of the time is me just sitting around not having any work to do. Which is not MY FAULT, it is their fault. Even when I was consistent about asking for work, I would still not be given it unless it was some bullshit menial task. 

In summation, as an HR intern, I just did menial shit for them. On top of this, whenever I was sitting around with nothing to do, my manager just felt bad for me. Clearly she expressed concern for my boredom. What's your thoughts on that, /r/internships?  

Furthermore, seeing as I'm just like every other college student desperate to put something on their resume, I still want to return to this company. And it's not even like I hated working there - I have a lot of patience and don't mind doing whatever they asked me to do (whenever I was asked). However it's a shame that I could not be given the chance to show myself and impress my employers which is the whole point of an internship, instead of sitting around doing humdrum tasks that have no benefit to myself and very, very little for them. I'm 100% confident I did nothing that would be a red flag for them as well. I have a professional and friendly conduct. I am just so lost and confused by this. I even hit up the other intern who worked there (he wasn't working for the HR dept like I was) and he was shocked that I was fired, and urges that I put them on blast for doing something so fucked and unprofessional.

So with all that being said, I want to ask you guys what's the best course of action to deal with this situation. I realize that it's going to take a lot to get this internship back (it's only for the summer anyways but still) however the mere fact that it took them five days to let me off and claim that they were ""going in a different direction"" is very poor on their end, especially for a company that has so many fucked up problems on top of an apparently high turnover rate."
6macvy,41,2017-07-09,"TIFU by the spending too much time with my girlfriend only to accidentally say ""I Love You"" and spend $50 to miss my flight.",TheHoneyBadger77,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6macvy/tifu_by_the_spending_too_much_time_with_my/,"Unlike most TIFUs, this happened today, 2 minutes ago to be precise. Let me tell you my humbling tale of why trying to be a good S/O burned me in the ass. 

I had the opportunity to visit the lady friend on the other side of the country due to summer internships (we are both students). Arrived early Friday, and spent a wonderful weekend with the gal: drinking, touring the city, the occasional late night movie. After a weekend full of fun and excitement, it was time to head back to the airport to make it home for work tomorrow. Unfortunately, we hadn't seen each other in awhile, so leaving was made rather difficult. After much pleading and prodding, I agreed to lay down for a quick 15 minute nap to cuddle in one more time before the big flight. This is where mistake number one happened. 

When finally awoke, I realized I hadn't proper set my alarm, and instead of laying down for 15 minutes it was 45! Frazzled, I quickly packed up my things and headed off to the metro to transport myself to the airport. I was worried, but not terribly so because I still was leaving 1.75 hours before my flight took off. I figured that 1 Hour would be plenty of time to get through security (I reign from a small town). Mistake number 2. The S/O asked if I would mind if she could accompany me to the airport on the metro and just turn around and take it back home. Seeing nothing wrong with this, I happily agreed because it meant we could spend more time together. This is mistake number three. 

As we get to the metro, we hop aboard the line and begin our trip. We had just made the train by a couple of seconds, so I was pleased with my luck and slightly let my guard town. When we arrived at our connecting station (had to switch lines), I headed to the other side of the station to get to the other line. As I approach the escalators I notice something was wrong. THEY WERE NOT MOVING. Puzzled, I hustled over to these moving stairs of hell only to find them roped off, ""Orange, Silver, and Blue Lines closed, free shuttle upstairs"". Panic started to set in. I did my best to remain calm and stay composed in front of her, but I was getting really nervous. We quickly ran up the stairs and made our way to the shuttle. 

We arrived at the shuttle just as it was taking off, and I couldn't believe my luck! Someone was looking out for me today! I asked the bus driver if the station at the next stop had the lines opened for travel. ""Sure thing sugar!"" she responded with a smile, and again for a short while I felt at ease. We arrived at the station 15 minutes later and I graciously thanked her for all her help. 

We departed the shuttle, and headed over to the stairways down to the metro. But of course, due to my false sense of hope and belief in humanity, entered the metro only to find the ENTIRE STATION roped off. At this this point I started swearing and hoping that I could finally catch a break. My girlfriend, who does well under pressure (and didn't understand how close I was cutting it) calmly said to call a ride share and that I could still make it on time. I was delighted to hear this quick thinking, and quickly purchased my $47 dollar ride to get to the airport (I was desperate ok?). The Uber arrived 10 minutes later, and I begin saying the drawn out ""I miss you's"" that is typical with these types of departures. Mistake 4. 

The hugs and goodbyes took longer than expected, so my driver honked at me indicating the end of our   weekend. Frantic, I quickly grabbed my bag and started running to the car. She called out for one last hug and kiss (last time we could see each other for a month and a half), and I complied. I ran up, gave her a peck on the lips, and turned to run to get in my cab. In my haste, stupid me thought it would be a great idea to mutter something as I broke our public display of affection and go back to my ride. ""I LOVE BABE!"" I shouted as I turned and got in the front seat. I still remember the surprised look in her eyes vividly etched in my mind. The, ""What the hell did you just say?"", mixed with a little deer caught in the headlines look. Now before you all explain how his is typically normal, we have only been dating for one month, and she strongly dislikes public displays of affection (the kiss I gave her didn't help). I rode to the airport in silence, wondering how she would take it or the retribution I would face via the confused text messages. I pushed this out of my mind as I arrived 45 minutes before my flight arrived. 

I ran off into the airport and went to check in at the station because the link on my phone wasn't working. When I printed my boarding pass, I noticed ""THIS IS NOT A BOARDING PASS, PLEASE SEE AN ATTENDANT"" stamped along the bottom. Confused, I rushed off to the line where I waited 15 minutes for the next available attendant. 

I explained my situation, and asked if she could print me off a boarding pass. She rolled her eyes, ""You should have been here an hour ago"", giving me an eye roll so hard that I thought she was my mother scolding me as a child for trying to eat dessert before supper. She said I was in luck, and printed off my pass and declared I had 35 minutes before my flight leaves. I rush off, and she yells ""NEXT TIME DONT FLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE THIS IRRESPONSIBLE"". Well thanks lady for the tip. 

I head through security, every minute a short dagger in my gut as the time clicks on. I get my boarding pass checked, and get in one of the 15 lines that appears to be the shortest. This was my last mistake. Apparently, the line was so short because the person working the scanners was new. This, coupled with the fact that people were ill prepared to put their objects in the bins for scanning left me with 10 minutes before my flight. I look around in panic, and swallowed my pride and begged to cut in another line. I rush through the security, grab my bag and shoes and start sprinting down the terminal. I was in such a rush that I didn't put on my shoes or belt, and ran holding my pants up as I sprinted down the long corridor. I was not in favor of the gods today, so my gate was at the other end of airport in another terminal...

I hopped in the train that shuttles to the other flight decks, and frantically look at my watch as we head over. 7 minutes until my flight leaves... I lace my shoes up and take off, with the speed and determination of a madman with nothing to lose. I think it is something to note, I likely could have been a lower division distance runner in college, so I imagine the sight I created as I took off full speed off the train.  I sprinted up the three flights of stairs (curse people who block both sides of escalator) and round the corner as I head into terminal C. I sprint as fast as I can, weaving in an out of people as I travel from C30 all the way to the end at C5. As I pass, I hear the sympathetic, yet mocking, cheers and shouts (particularly from the children) as I race through the humid airport in a full suit and tie. I arrive at my gate, four minutes before it leaves only to see the door closing behind a worker leaving the boarding arm thing. I frantically call out that I'm here, that that's my flight. He shakes his head and he informed me that the door was closed and I would have to wait until the next available flight. So here I sit, in the airport for an additional 7 hours, waiting for the other flight back home, a mere few hours before I work tomorrow because I wanted to spend more time with my girlfriend. 

Tl;dr - Spent too much time with the girlfriend only to accidentally blurt out ""I love you!"" to my new lady friend as I take a 50 dollar Uber to the airport to miss my flight by 1 minute.

I know this is a money drain, but I feel as though I have no other option. Whenever I see jobs that I want to apply for I see that I am not qualified for the position or lack the proper degree for it. 

In high school I got swept up in my degree because all my friends were doing it. I thought we would all be working together. 

In college I did well, and I loved it. But I didn't seem to realize just how important the classes were and internships, etc.

If I go back, I won't just slide through. I want to excel at my classes and field. I really need to get my career set by age 30 so this is very important to me. 

I've also considered a Masters degree, but I've completely given up on my field. I would need to take certain credits to even switch my Masters field so at that point I might as well just get the whole BA. I hope you guys understand my point of view

6mbsr0,1,2017-07-09,Not sure what jobs to apply for or what to do with my background.,pineapple6,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6mbsr0/not_sure_what_jobs_to_apply_for_or_what_to_do/,"Hi Reddit, 

I need some advice! I graduated in 2013 with an illustration BFA from a prestigious design school. I made the mistake of plowing through the program so as not to incur too much debt and therefore did not take the time for an internship. So upon graduation I got zero job offers despite whoring my portfolio/resume out like mad. I made friends, who are successful now (or at least working in the industry), but because I had nothing to offer them to further their careers they stopped associating with me. That's how it feels anyhow. Anyway, at this point I've semi-given up on having an art career. I've had a couple freelance jobs and have had some interest from a studio from an industry art convention but that's it.

In the interim I started substitute teaching k-12 and since last August have also been teaching a pre-GED class to adults (reading comprehension, math, grammar, writing). I hate subbing, kids are vicious (physical and mental threats, stolen property, harassment, and just general I want to cry in a corner situations). Adult ED isn't horrible but it's hourly. It will always be hourly, so if I'm not in the classroom I'm not getting paid. I get zero benefits, only 12 hours a week, and the prospect of changing that is very low within the next few years. (Teaching adult ed is basically having a bunch of part time jobs at different sites. If you're lucky and get enough hours at one school for benefits...lucky you). 

So here's where I need advice. I don't know what to do. I've tried applying to everything under the sun and barely get interviews. I realize it's my resume and will be posting to r/resume when I have a specific job I'm applying for since I know resumes need to be tailored. My question is, what (with that background) can I even hope to qualify for? I barely care what it is at this point so long as it's a full time job with benefits. I am almost 30 and live with my parents. I need to change that but I can't without sustainable income. And yes, my anxiety and depression has gotten to an all time high that I don't even know what my interests are anymore. I am beyond desperate and I just don't even know where/what to do at this point.

I've looked at corporate training/recruitment and applied to some positions in the past to no avail. But in general, I feel like that's such a vague job description I don't even know what to search for on indeed. In addition, I don't have experience. I don't qualify for internships anymore and i don't even know what to volunteer in. Ideally I'd like to get out of education all together. I never ever wanted to get into it in the first place and only got there because my parents are in it and I was desperate.

I'm willing to get another associate's degree to change careers completely but I just don't know in what. I'd even be willing to get another bachelors (accounting? marketing?) if I knew wtf to get it in. Or even a masters (threw around education or mba ideas). I managed to pay off all my debts so that's a positive, but that's also making me reluctant to amass anything new in that department.

I wouldn't mind getting into marketing, I have a friend who I graduated with who ended up with that..but her studio isn't hiring and she has no insight as to how to get in because she kind of fell into it. She got work through internships...and it's too late for that  now unless I enroll in another undergrad program.

My question is vague and I'm sorry, I'm just so lost I'm hoping someone can give me some insight into what to do next. What should I look for? What do I qualify for? What can I do? Or what should I pursue? I just want to make enough to be independent.

In regard to my skills here is a resume I used for my last job application for an inmate classroom facilitator position:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6qlUL7CTyHfc2ltM1JoeEF3RUk


I learn quickly, am like-able, and am dependable. I know I have the skills to do whatever I apply to but I know on paper that doesn't show. Please advise?

TLDR:

What career change can/should I do with an art/education background that isnot related to education? I'm at a loss pathetic and desperate. Please help.

6mcbdg,2,2017-07-10,"All Managers had to manually enter there intern's time-sheets, mines didn't and yelled at me. What should I do?",2Wheel4Real,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6mcbdg/all_managers_had_to_manually_enter_there_interns/,"TLDR at the bottom.

I'm a software developer intern and by our third week, I ran into my first bad experience with my manager. 

Here's the background information: My manager's job was to assign me a mentor and to basically enter in my time-sheet for the first week since we couldn't clock in and out into the ADP app (timesheet app). I forgot to clock out in the first week, and I forgot to clock back in another time when my manager had me leave to get my SSN papers nearby for I-9 verification. After the first week, I sent him an email of all of the hours that I worked, just like every intern was instructed to do so. 

I get no reply after 3 days, so I send him a instant message with the same message as a reminder. He thanks me for the reminder and tells me he will do it. He doesn't do it. The day after, I forward him the message again. No answer. Now, it's the third week. He hasn't done it. One of the social network recruiters and him come walking to my desk telling me that it's too late for my manager to put in my first weeks hours, so I am instructed to call HR department to do a historical edit. I call after they leave, and they ask for my hours in the first week. So I gave it to them, and they need my manager to talk on the phone to verify. My manager is super busy, but I message him informing him that HR is on the line and they need him on the phone. After waiting with HR on the phone for longer than 5 minutes, he comes all frustrated and when I hand him the phone, he wipes the phone with his shirt before talking on the phone. 

As he about finishes talking with them, I apologize for having him do this since I do realize this reflects badly on me as an intern. Either way, he hands me back the phone, and goes back to his call at his desk. HR is trying to get him to kill me because after they work on my timesheet, they requested for him to get back on the phone. So I message him again, and after another 5 minutes he comes even more frustrated. After he hangs up and all business is done, he takes a deep breath and tone manner, tells me ""do not to mess up my time sheet again. Clock in, clock out. I do not want to have to do this again."" 

I took his advice to heart. Now I set up alarms, a stopwatch, and a timer just to make sure I clock in and out after my 8 hours. 

How should I handle this as an intern? Should I just go about work as I usually am? I've talked to my other software developer friends who work for other companies and they told me that's absolutely wrong for him to have done that. My friends recommended that I can give an indirect review about it at the end of my internship when they ask for reviews. 

What are your thoughts? Thank you.

TLDR: Every intern at the company could not clock in and out during the first week, so all were required to manually keep record of their own time-sheets. By the second week, every intern had to have their manager manually enter in their intern's first week's time-sheet. My manager chose to procrastinate until the third week, which then disabled him from doing it. I had to call HR for them to do it, they needed to talk to him on the phone. That angered him. He threatens me not to mess up my time-sheet again. What do I do?"

I am an intern at a large software company in the bay area.  For the past few weeks I have been designing an internal testing tool for mass data ingestion.  I am going to break the problem down into parts.
***
**Background**

Basically, there is going to be a java service that manages the 'jobs' that need to be created, and each job is then sent to a separate node to be run (Think of a Heroku dyno).  

Now, the most difficult part is that these requests need to be dynamically created and sent out based upon a schema that is specified to the node.  
***
**Problem**

Initially I had planned on creating those smaller nodes in nodejs.  However, upon review and testing, I can get nowhere near the speed of requests necessary out of javascript, not to mention that multithreading in JS is basically non-existant.

How would you go about creating these nodes?

***
**Thoughts I have had**

I personally have never used it, however I think that nginx may be of service for this project.  Since it is written in C, shouldn't it be able to create requests far faster? 

I am really out of my element and any help is much appreciated.  I know it sort of sounds like I am building a DDOSing service, however I can assure you that I am not.  This is to test internal ingestion tools and for performance testing.

If there is a better sub for this sort of stuff, please let me know. 

Thanks!

i'm a 23 M, currently studying a master in finance, and i'll be soon doing my thesis defense in 5 days. 
here's my problem, as long as i can remember i have this obsession about thinking about my future and how i'll do things later in my life. the reason is ( as i keep telling myself) because i live in a precarious situation ( i have no money now, i just finished my internship in a big bank in Africa (Morocco)), my parents are divorced and we barely have enough money to put food on the table. so i'm always thinking about how i can support my mother in the future, but also how i'll do things to improve myself ( getting a girlfriend, having my own place, traveling) because i never did neither of theses things, never had the time nor the money.
the consequences of all these obsession about getting a job, becoming a better version of myself leave me sad and depressed all the time, and i end up doing nothing. so please if you can suggest me some tips or advice to stop thinking all the time, i'm fucking tired.

thanks to anyone who can help me overcome this situation, and i'm sorry for my shity english i'm just starting to learn."
6mf27l,21,2017-07-10,"TIFU by the spending too much time with my girlfriend to accidentally say ""I Love You"" and spending $50 to miss my flight only to ride share to the wrong location after after arriving home on the late flight (Part 2)",TheHoneyBadger77,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6mf27l/tifu_by_the_spending_too_much_time_with_my/,"Hey Reddit, it's me again. Weird to think how I go from not posting previously to two back to back TIFU's but I guess that's life some times. Well, let's get down to the FU.

Well the original FU can be found [here](https://redd.it/6macvy) if you care to see how my fun weekend turned into a crap shoot. Anyway, fast forward from there to the wee hours of the morning (late last night, technically early today). I had just departed my plane, and quickly called a ride share to end my night of exhaustion and torture. Because of the fiasco yesterday, I decided to do a ride share line to save some money. Basically, it pairs you up with random riders to lower the cost on your trip. Anyway, I run off to the bathroom because it was set to arrive in 12 minutes and I had been on a plane for 5 hours. As I was finishing my business, I hear the fabled *Tink* of my phone indicating that I received a message. I looked down at my phone and noticed that my ride had arrived early and was departing in one minute. Not wanting to miss my ride, I quickly ran out and looked for my car. The time ticked down to 10 seconds, and I begin to frantically run up and down the terminal looking for my car (It's a really big airport). I couldn't understand, I was right on top of it! I quickly called my driver and told her that I was here and to wait for me. She started to grow slightly inpatient, and kept asking if I was at the end of the walkway. She questioned if I was even in the right spot or level. Well Reddit, due to the combination of exhaustion and my unfamiliarity with this airport, I technically was correct, I was on top of her, literally. I had gone to the wrong departure point, and my ride was actually on a different floor! I quickly ran to the stairs and booked it to find my car waiting for me, just as she described. Pleased to find my car, I quickly got into a car with my fellow passengers, embarrassed but happy to be heading home.

I began to dose off, for I was queued second to be dropped off. I remember her taking a different interstate that I usually do, but figured it was faster (I am not a native of the area, I am here for an internship). I stopped paying attention as I drifted in and out of sleep.

I awoke to my driver smiling at me, ""We are only 7 minutes away from your drop off dear"" she happily declared. I was excited, this night of hell was finally almost over. I begin to look around to get my barrings, but was very confused as to where I was. I didn't recognize any of the building around me. We were nearing the stop, and that's when I realized my grave error. You see, I am visiting the area and am living summer housing near one of the major universities here. Typically, I like to use notable spots to both help drivers know where to drop me off and not directly lead them to my house. There is a local fraternity that is right next to my apartment that I typically use, and often input that as my drop off point. Well, in my tired state, I typed in the name of this fraternity and my state and it populated. Me, tired and too trusting, assumed that this was the location near my house. Well, I am sad to say that I had been driven to another university, around 20 miles away from my actual home. I had been defeated, and the look of disappointment spread across my face. My driver asked if something was wrong, but I was too embarrassed after my first mistake to speak up. My pride had taken enough that day. She asks if I was sure, and I squeaked out ,""yes"" as I opened the door and got out. Determined to make it home, I immediately called another ride to make it home full of shame and disappointment. And wouldn't you guess Reddit, I MATCHED WITH MY OLD DRIVER. In hindsight it was pretty obviously, there wouldn't likely have been any other drivers that night. But there I sat, in old/new ride share, sheepishly trying to explain my FU to my driver as she had a combination of disbelief and laughter. So I arrived to home an hour later than expected (after paying for two rides), took what now can be classified as a nap and returned to work today as I currently type this on my third cup of coffee...

tl;dr - Tiredly called a ride share to the wrong location 20 miles away only to call another ride, matched with my same driver and explained to her why I didn't say that my drop off location wasn't actually near my house."

I don't want to be here anymore but I know the people in my life couldn't cope with it if I died, so now I'm stuck living my life just for other people. I hate it. "

I've always had a soft spot for Montreal and was going to try to move there regardless of what happened in my life.(that's besides the point) I guess what I'm trying to say is this isn't due to any politics or anything of such which has came up recently.

 Okay so, I recently started dating this girl from Canada (Muskoka area in Ontario)  about a year and a half ago. We met online talked through twitter, then to snapchat and finally text messages. A full two years ago we met in Florida on my spring break and her spring holiday and I met her grandparents and siblings. I knew she was the one at that moment. 

I got hit with a predicament in that moment knowing she was from Canada and I'm a us citizen a little more than a stones throw from the northern border. So we took a half year to talk it out and make our plan with us being such a long distance. Since she would be going off to university. She made her choice of school  in Nova Scotia a whole 20 hour drive from her house in Ontario and i backed her completely. I came up august of last year and visited and formally met her family before this 2016-2017 school year started

During that school year (aug 2016- may 2017) there was seven trips throughout the school year going back in fourth whenever we had breaks spanning a total about two months together causing me to get my NEXUS card and a frequent flyers account. However, We plan for even more trips this upcoming year. We both plan to finish our degrees before we would be together with out trips to see each other.

As i am about a year and a half away from completing my degree soon i like to look a little ahead since it's quickly approaching.

I'm currently at a 4 year school perusing a bachelors in finance which i know will equivalent to a bachelors of business admin in Canada when i get it accredited. 
I'm currently doing a summer internship this year and i plan to do something similar this upcoming year since in the business field experience is key.

I am currently enrolled in French 1 and 2 accelerated in my college courses not for the only idea of coming to Canada but also for the scope of the business world. Since i'm taking some french classes i am planning on gaining a one on one tutor in Dallas and testing for my proficiency level when i am ready to send for my application to Canada.

But for the first part of our life we plan to spend it in Canada and have our kids north of the border and if things work out and jobs are steady hopefully birthing kids in Canada raise kids in the states and letting them pick between either country for school, and hopefully us bounce between two properties on both.

The main issue being I'm only 21 and don't wanna get married and not having a secure source of income because I'm in school still. I would like to be able to take some time and stay with her while working to find out if i should make the jump to marriage but i want to be able to work. 

My main concern is that yes we have spent time together and all that but i would like to be sure by staying in with her a couple of months before i make the full plunge to a marriage and go that route for a permanent resident or become a citizen. But if i do that on a visitors visa i wont be working and i cant justify that in a relationship that is suppose to be 50/50.

I know there is a ICE permit that i would gain through a recognized organization but I've heard horror story on it expiring and the people becoming barred for 5 years or so. I don't think i could arrange a living area and work a livable job on a working holiday visa either knowing the time is slowly slipping by.

Right now my plan was to go stay with my family in Pennsylvania while i pick up my Canadian certifications for finance coming across the border for day trips when i need to test and hopefully land a job for RBC CIBC Scotiabank BMO or TD as a financial analyst or something of such working up to a position.

as for a budget i have no clue honestly since this will be an ongoing thing

If you need anymore information i will be willing to give it out. I have researched this on and off between the past year and have yet to find something that leaves me sleep peacefully at night.

I guess i'm looking for advice or just hoping for an answer. But I don't know what route to take since I've seen people say your outta luck unless you're getting married.

TL/DR: In the grand scheme i would like to become a Permanent resident and i don't know the best way to go about it with out getting married.

Sorry if this is wrong formatting or anything I just made my account and joined today. 


Thank you for any and all help

I have been a lurker for a long time on this subreddit, and I can say that it has helped me immensely in preparing and going forward with my career in IT. I have a plan set in motion, and wondering if there is anything in my plan that I should tweak, fix, or if I should add anything to my plan to give it a bit of boost I would very much appreciate hearing your input!

Currently: I am a married, sophomore at my local community college in their Business, Industry, and Technology A.S. program. From their I plan on going to a State university to get my B.S. in Information Systems. (Here is a link to the program if anyone is curious; https://catalog.stcloudstate.edu/~/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&amp;catalogid=7&amp;topicgroupid=1988). It's definitely fairly ""business-y"" but I'm hoping to supplement that with trying to take as many technical electives and self-studying as I can. My main interest is in Networking, and I haven't quite nailed down more specifically what kind of Networking I would like delve deep into. I will probably figure that out down the road though. My plan though overall looks like this:

Graduate with B.S. - Information Systems with:
At least 2 years experience (Currently a Desktop Support intern doing break-fix work, within a Windows Environment, at an electric utilities company. Very likely that I will be hired on after this summer).

Have my CCNA &amp; Security+ finished (currently studying both slowly, as I am still pretty early in my plan. I'm hoping to get my CCNA though around next year). I am studying for them by going through NetAcad, Prof. Messer, and many of the resources that VA_Network_Nerd typically post bombs, such as packet tracer. 

I am hoping to get a junior Network Engineer position out of college with my plan. I understand that automation is hot thing right now, so I'm trying my hand at learning Python (slightly struggling) and researching automation tools like Puppet and Docker. 

Also, before anyone comments on it, I can imagine that personal projects and homelab is something that is missing from my plan. Money is a little tight right now for serious homelab, as I'm trying to pay cash for college. But more important than that, I'm pretty scatterbrained when it comes to projects, so I am never really sure what projects I should start that would be beneficial to me. That's just something I am going to have to keep working at, and doing more research to see what projects I can do that would fit my interests. 

So I only have a few questions: 
Should I stay hired on at my internship, even if I don't touch much of any networking right now, or look for another internship later on?
What other skills should I be learning to have when I graduate?
And what do you guys think of my plan? Thank you much!

tl;dr - Married Sophomore student, looking to get a B.S. in information systems and graduate with at least 2 years experience and two certs under his belt to get a Junior Network Engineer position. Attempting to learn Python, and automation tools."

&amp;nbsp;

The television in the living room shows a historical documentary. Occasionally, a head turns to watch a brief segment before returning back to current projects. Aristespha flips her long, silvery blue hair back with a sigh and sorts through another stack paperwork. She lifts a stack off the coffee table and places it in another pile next to her on the couch. Cideeda squints her eyes to focus upon a small patch of torn fabric on her body suit, while she rests upon a nest of pillows on the other half the couch. She carefully weaves a needle between the fibers around a tear in the body suit and cinches the edges closer together. Dretphi sits on the floor nearby in the middle of five baskets, each with a name written on the side. She plucks an article of clothing off the top of the large pile next to her, briefly examines it, and tosses it to the matching basket. Sotalia slowly traces a finger nail along the text in a notebook, pouring full attention into each word. She eyes over at the various alchemy instruments and ingredients along the kitchen counter top, bites her lip with frustration, and grumbles to herself as she scrutinizes her notes more. The kitchen door opens and Bach backs into the area with a laundry basket in his arms. He pivots once clear of the door and continues into the living room with a grimace upon his face.

Dretphi glances over to Bach as he places the laundry basket down. “Any success with your clothing?”

Bach immediately shakes his head and snorts as a reflexive chuckle forces its way out. “Not really. I mean, the duster is salvageable. But... The shirt is total loss. And the pants...”

He kneels down next to the laundry basket, rummages through the mix, and pulls up a pair of very holey, burnt pants. Dretphi’s eyes follow the length of the pants and she can only blink while her lips twist slightly. She holds her face with a hand while covering her mouth, and nods in agreement. “Yes. Those are rags now. You will need a new pair.”

Sotalia lifts her head away from her notebook and looks across the way to see the hole, burn ridden garment hanging from Bach’s hand. She places her hands on her hips, rolls her eyes, and cracks a smug grin from the corner of mouth. “Rags?! Come on, don’t you recognize designer clothing when you see it? I’m sure some teenager would pay top coin for THAT.”

An eye brow perks on Cideeda’s face and her eyes turn up from her repair work. She examines the pants and her mind churns on an idea. Eventually, a scheming smirk grows on her mouth. “Hey. Fold those up and put them with the bot’s head.”

Bach quickly rotates to face Cideeda and tilts his head in mild confusion as he narrows his eyes. “Are you actually going to try to sell my holey burnt pants?!”

Cideeda shrugs as she focuses back on repairing her suit and drags a threaded needle up off the garment. “You’d be surprised what sells. Again, I don’t make the fads, I just sell to them. Anyway, Steve at the game shop put me on the local aethermail list and I just found out a fandom convention is happening in a week and a half.”

Aristespha pauses from calculating numbers on one of her tablets and leans back into her seat on the couch. She lightly taps the tablet stylus to her lips and she glances through thoughts in her head. “You know I haven’t been to a decent convention in years. I actually wouldn’t mind going.”

Bach thinks for a moment and nods. “Same here. I haven’t been able to afford to go to one for a really long time. Used to be a lot of fun back in school.”

Dretphi shifts her gaze between Cideeda, Aristespha, and Bach with curiosity growing. “I have never been to one of these conventions. Heard of them. Never gone. Would not mind going.”

Sotalia glares at the others through the opening to the kitchen, her jaw hangs open in astonishment, and she poses incredulously at what she’s hearing. “You all DO realize, we literally do what those people obsess and act out at those places? Right?”

Cideeda perks an eyebrow at Sotalia. “This one is a general fandom convention. They have a little bit of everything. So, the whole adventurer fandom thing is only a part of it.”

A devious grin creeps onto Cideeda’s face as she continues her description. “I mean, this is a larger one. It even has a large ballroom just dedicated towards all the various vendors of small, unique items that many claim to be of a magical nature...”

Briefly, the cheek around Sotalia’s eye twitches as the corner of her mouth draws upwards. She quickly directs her head downwards to her alchemy project. Cideeda pushes up into her pillow covered seat upon the couch and develops a toothy grin. “And, the writer and artist for a particular series is on a few panels.”

A few moments of silence hang in the air, as expectant members of the group watch and wait for Sotalia to speak. While Sotalia looks down onto the counter top and goes through the motions of combining ingredients into the glass bowl, she bites her lip and contorts her face as her will loses restraint on desires. “Well, if you all want to go, I’m... Not against going. You might want to check with Sebastian.”

Bach rolls his eyes and laughs. “Oh, he’ll go. Hell, he’ll probably could be in the open. We’ll just say he’s a hologram or magical illusion. By the way, anyone know where he is?”

Aristespha lifts her arm up and points her finger in a sweeping gesture towards the outside, while an unamused expression seeps onto her face. “He’s outside trying to spy on THOSE adventurers. Nothing to speak of at the moment. Thankfully, they’re staying on their property.”

Sotalia groans and shakes her head as she pours a vial of liquid into the mixing bowl. “Still can’t believe they picked the one place next to us.”

Dretphi dons a stern expression as she flings a bundle of clothes into one basket. “That was not coincidence. Previous seasons, they kept adventurers in poor places. That house is very nice.”

Aristespha crosses her arms with a twist of her mouth and eyes Dretphi with a confirming nod. “I thought about that, too. We’re going to have to be careful if they’re around. Don’t need to give them any material they can put on the show.”

Cideeda sinks down in her pillows and works the needle through another spot in the fabric mesh of her body suit. “Well, hopefully they’ll find something else to do and let us enjoy the rest of the week off. I’d like to see if we can get the plasma projectile cannon and minigun working.”

Sebastian’s ethereal form passes through the sliding glass door and coasts into the room. “Anything new?”

Bach sets out the last article of clothing from the laundry basket and glances up to grin at his brother. “Up for going to a con in a week and half?”

Sebastian twists himself to face Bach mid flight excitedly and halts his drift through the room. “Hell, yes! It’s been forever since I’ve been to one. Been so busy between getting a group together and chasing Noxian that last few years that the opportunity never came up. But... I don’t know how much I’ll be able to enjoy it... being a ghost and all. I’ll make do.”

A smiles forms on Aristespha as she stares at Sebastian. He lands his feet onto the ground, pivots in place, and catches her eye on him. His eyes scans the immediate area around him before he raises a curious eyebrow at her. Aristespha continues to smile and gives Sebastian a sly wink. “Of course you’ll make do. Guess who’s going as a magical interactive illusion to the con?”

Sebastian stands in thought and his mind mulls over the concept. With a growing heroic smile, he puffs out his chest, brightens his visage, and puts on his best hero pose. “Hello! Welcome to the convention! I’m your friendly interactive illusion, state your command, and I will try to comply.”

He releases his pose, places a hand on his waist, and scratches his chin with the other. “You know, that could actually work. No one would even bother to question such a thing.”

Cideeda chuckles to herself and with a sly toothy grin. “And, we’ll only have to pay for five passes.”

Sebastian glances at Bach with a nonplussed expression and crosses his arms. “Is it strange that I’m honestly looking forward to seeing how much I can fuck with people in this form, bro?”

Bach shrugs and holds his hands up to his sides. “I don’t know, man. Might as well have fun with it? It’s not like many people get a chance like this.”

Sotalia calls out from the kitchen. “Aristespha! Okay, I’m at the last part of this potion. It’s seventy milliliters of the cherry flavoring? Correct?”

Aristespha blinks and shudders her head. She quickly snaps her confused gaze to the awaiting Sotalia. “No! Twenty milliliters of cherry flavoring! Where did you get seventy from?!”

There’s a long silence afterwards, eventually broken by the sounds of notebook pages flipping back and forth. Sotalia mumbles out loud as she leans very close to her notebook. “But I wrote down seventy for some reason, why the hell would I write seventy but it actually be twenty- Oh gods dammit!”

With a quick, violent flick of the wrist, Sotalia sends a small plastic pen at the lid of the kitchen garbage can. The pen contacts the lid, bounces the lid open downwards, and falls into the plastic bag. Sotalia groans as she pours twenty milliliters of cherry flavoring into the mixing bowl. “Next time we go shopping in town, let’s pick up some decent pens.”

&amp;nbsp;

Bright columns of light pour through the forest canopy onto the mossy ground below. Small patches of underbrush shake their remaining beads of morning dew with the gentle wind as the light sways along. A Fvalian woman in a plain green blouse and dark blue skirt follows behind an Emin woman wearing a form fitting and revealing gray t-shirt and equally matching shorts. Both maneuver their ways through the trees and brush towards the edge of the forest. The Fvalian woman directs a whisper to the Emin woman. “Tassilda?! How close are you going to get?”

Tassilda briefly eyes back at the Fvalian with a confident, smug grin. “As close as I can, Deedri. How close did you get?”

Deedri nervously turns her head back and points out a spot quite a distance away. “Over there. I just watched them briefly yesterday before they called us in for individual interviews.”

With a quick roll of the eyes, Tassilda quickly returns her head away from Deedri’s spot and focuses ahead to a patch of grass behind a concealing, short shrub. “Come along now. I want to get a good view of these practice exercises you saw.”

Deedri glances to Tassilda and back before reluctantly walking to the same patch of grass. She carefully sits down and settles next to Tassilda, carefully peeking over the very top of the leafy plant. Tassilda guides a finger in front of Deedri and directs her gaze to three people stand in an open field. “There they are. Both the mages and the intern? Interesting. I wonder what poor examples of spells they are going to teach that… Intern.”

Deedri shakes her head slightly and frowns gradually as her eyes remain fixed to targets in the distance. “I wouldn’t call him an intern. At least, don’t treat him like one.”

Tassilda lifts an eye brow and draws the corner of her mouth to a side while her eyes shift over to Deedri. “Really? That’s how they even referred to him and I haven’t seen anything to the contrary. Is there something you haven’t told me?”

Deedri blinks, pivots her head at Tassilda, and quickly shakes her head. “No. It just doesn’t make sense to me. From the information Samantha gave to Chad, he just joined recently and never completed school. But, somehow he put up that barrier the military had to blast off. I mean, that magical barrier didn’t dissipate, it actual shattered and continued to exist after that weird magical cable was pulled off! Have you ever known an intern to do magic like that? Because, I sure haven’t.”

Tassilda’s eyes drift back forward, away from Deedri, and guide the rest of Tassilda’s head along. Her expression wanders as her mind ponders recent memories. She pulls a few strands of her black hair over a horn and squints her blue on black eyes into the distance. A few seconds later, her eyes flit open as something in the distance seizes her full attention. “They are practicing magic. Good. I wonder what... She... Is capable of.”

Deedri concentrates her sight in the same direction as Tassilda. “She’s pretty good. She’s been practicing a fireball spell a lot, but it’s strange. She’s direct casting, but there’s something else going on. Even with my mage sight magic I can’t tell what exactly is going on from this far away.”

In the distance, Sotalia stands with her hands out around a glowing, orange-red orb of flames. The orb fluctuates and gradually changes colors to an orange-yellow color, while Sotalia grimaces and her postures strains. She eventually drops her head down and exhales dramatically letting her shoulders droop. Bach takes a few steps to Sotalia’s side, and gestures with his hands to the orb while saying something. Initially, Sotalia drifts her glare away from Bach as a pout forms and her hands slowly slide the orb from Bach’s reach. He pinches the bridge of his nose, holds his hands out to his side, and speaks to Sotalia. Tassilda notices Deedri’s ears perking and training upon the conversation, and she leans closer to Deedri. “What are they talking about?”

Deedri squints and her ears deftly aim themselves to the distant conversation. “He’s trying to get her to use her mage sight spell, but she says she can’t while focusing on casting this one. And he just offered to... Hold the spell for her?”

Tassilda blinks hard, cocks her head to the side, and mumbles in confusion. “Hold the spell? He does he expect to do that-”

Bach slowly extends his arms out, positions his hands at the ready around the flaming orb, and speaks again while craning his head around to gaze at Sotalia’s face. She briefly eyes Bach. With a sigh and growing appreciative smile in the corner of her mouth, she pivots her body towards Bach and carefully slides the orb between Bach’s awaiting hands. The orb momentarily shudders slightly as it remains still between Bach’s hands when Sotalia draws her hands away. She shakes her hands, stretches her arms and back, and walks around taking time to work out the tension in the rest of body.

Tassilda stares wide-eyed with her jaw creeping open. Deedri directs her eyes over to Tassilda, raises an eyebrow, and twists her mouth. “So. He’s the intern. Who never finished school. And just started adventuring with a group a few weeks ago.”

Tassilda slowly nods as her eyes continue to track the events before her. Her jaw rises back to close her mouth as her expression charts out her contemplation. “I think I understand your suspicions, quite clearly now.”

Aristespha stands up from a seat upon a bench near Bach and Sotalia. She moves to a spot near Sotalia, catches her attention, and alternates pointing at each others eyes while talking. Sotalia nods attentively after each key point in Aristespha’s instruction. Aristespha stands right beside Sotalia, gestures towards the flaming orb Bach maintains in the space between his hands, and both close their eyes after Aristespha’s cue. Aristespha opens her violet glowing eyes first and carefully watches Sotalia. With an initial struggle, Sotalia manages to open her golden, glowing eyes and keep them consistently bright. Bach tows the flaming orb closer and hovers it conveniently close to Aristespha and Sotalia. After a minute of debate between them, Bach’s eyes flash to a bright blue. The flaming orb’s color changes slowly from orange-yellow to bright blue-white. Sotalia and Aristespha scrutinize each second of the orb’s transformation and Bach takes moments to rotate and adjust the orb’s position to demonstrate some aspect of the process. The orb compacts down in a smaller ball and the waving flames disappear to a thin jet veil that covers the surface of the orb. With a final nod from both Aristespha and Sotalia, Bach swings the orb away from Aristespha and Sotalia and aims it towards a large boulder in the field. With a flex of the of the hands, the orb flies from Bach, darts across the open field, and explodes upon impact with the boulder.

Tassilda sits back upon the ground, straightens her back, and crosses her arms. She takes in a slow, deep breath, and exhales just as slowly. “What just happened there?”

Deedri draws her head back from watch over the top of the shrub and gazes at Tassilda. “I don’t know. I didn’t catch anything he did there. That may have been direct casting. Maybe some form of it that I’ve never seen before? It’s too far away even if I did use my mage sight.”

Tassilda shakes her head as she lifts a hand to place upon her cheek and rest her face against. “Maybe.”

A devious grin widens from the corner of Tassilda’s mouth and she turns her gaze directly upon Deedri. “Regardless, I believe WE WILL be visiting this spot quite bit more often in the future.”

Deedri dons a weak smile and darts her eyes nervously around before settling upon Tassilda. “O-Okay. I don’t have any problems with that.”

&amp;nbsp;

A thickening front of clouds coasts overhead and occasionally obscures the sun, drawing patches of shadow upon the field. Sotalia, Bach, and Aristespha stand in a rough group near the wood plank table. Sotalia interlocks her fingers, flips her hands around, and stretches her arms out with a content grin beaming on her face. “I think I’m getting the hang of this low level stuff.”

She slyly shifts her eyes to the side and gazes at Bach. Her eyes gently narrow and her grin tinges with a sinister motive. “Maybe someone will teach me that wonderful disintegration ball spell in the very near future.”

Bach averts his eyes to one side and then another and puts on a wary smile. “Ah, you know… All in good time. Right? How about we sure up those low level basics and then cover some slightly more advanced topics. Then, we’ll definitely get to that spell.”

Sotalia pivots upon on foot to face Bach, focuses a frown lead glare upon Bach, and breathes out a low growl of building frustration. Bach blinks as Sotalia places her hands on her hips and postures with obvious irritation. He slowly directs his attention to Aristespha and motions with his eyes to Sotalia trying to maintain an honest smile. Aristespha rolls her eyes and takes a few steps to stand in between the two. “Bach. You should teach her the spell...”

A smug smile pushes the frown off Sotalia’s face and her pose gradually changes to a more triumphant one. Aristespha catches sight of Sotalia’s posturing, flashes a wicked smile, and rotates her head to Sotalia. “BUT. Sotalia, you need to get MUCH better at controlling your magical energy flows.”

Sotalia immediately snarls her lip, crosses her arms, and turns her head away with a pout forming quickly. Aristespha claps her hands together and her expression brightens as her eyes look to both Bach and Sotalia. “And I have a way of helping you learn and teaching a valuable skill that is normally reserved for medical mages.”

The pout on Sotalia gives way to an unamused expression that thinly hides her developing interest. She returns her gaze to Aristespha and awaits with a slight sway of the hips. Aristespha smiles and gestures with her arms for both Bach and Sotalia to come closer. “Since we have three major magic users in the group, with different levels of magical energy reserves, I think it would be prudent to teach you two about energy transfer between people.”

Sotalia perks a brow, cracks a smile, and unfolds her arms placing her hands on her hips. “Now we’re talking. It’s about time! I forgot how many times I’ve asked you to show me that.”

She narrows her eyes quickly at Aristespha and her smile fades back. “And I almost forgot how many times you said you were too busy to show me.”

Aristespha continues with a happy grin as she holds her hands out to her sides with a shrug. “Well, things have changed. We have some time now and we have a third mage in the group which will make this a lot easier to teach.”

Bach scratches the back of his head and puzzles at Aristespha. “Why does a third mage this easier?”

Aristespha glances over to Bach with the happy grin now hinting a sly, ulterior motive. “Because, with your ability to manipulate low level energy flow, I fully expect you pick up any lesson I give very quickly.”

She turns a gaze directly at Sotalia and perks an eyebrow at her. “Then, you’ll be able to help Sotalia get the practice she will need.”

Sotalia stares back sternly to Aristespha. The two maintain eye contact for a few seconds before Sotalia breaks off to huff and sulk. “Damn it. I’m getting better.”

Aristespha places hand on each of Sotalia’s shoulders and lowers her head slightly to look Sotalia in the eyes. “You most certainly are. Just keep in mind how much more you’ll do with your massive reserves of magical energy when you learn more about energy control. I think I know a simple enough way to demonstrate the potential to you, that will certainly motivate you.”

Sotalia contorts her mouth until her pride subsides, cracks a smile, and sighs. “Okay. Let’s see it! I’m curious as to how this is suppose to motivate me.”

Aristespha lets go of Sotalia’s shoulders, takes a step back, and holds an open, palm up hand to both Back and Sotalia. “Okay, you two. Put a hand in mine and get ready to cast a spell. It’s getting a bit dark from the clouds, so let’s make it the simplest light orb spell. I am going to compare the energy efficiency between how you two cast spells.”

Both Bach and Sotalia place hand in one of Aristespha’s. Aristespha closes her eyes briefly and reopens them with a glowing violet light. She turns her head to Sotalia and eyes down to her hand. “Go ahead and cast.”

Sotalia watches her hand and she quickly gestures with very small motions of her fingers. With a smug, confident expression, an orb of light appears above Sotalia’s hand in mere moments and hovers there. Aristespha nods and then rotates her head to Bach. “For you, I want you to keep on casting that light orb spell of yours until I tell you to stop.”

Bach simply shrugs as his eyes illuminate blue. He looks down at his hand and a glowing orb floating above his hand greets his gaze. He reaches with his other hand, plucks the glowing orb away, and releases in the air nearby. He repeats this process for the second, third, forth, fifth, and sixth orbs. Sotalia slowly removes her hand from Aristespha’s and crosses her arms as her mouth opens slightly at the scene. Bach continues to create the seventh, eight, ninth and tenth orbs. Sotalia squirms while resettling her crossed arms and tilts her head as her mouth hangs open in an indignant confusion. Bach removes the eleventh orb from his hand, quickly scans the immediate area around him filled with other orbs, and flicks the orb in hand towards the tree line. He sends off the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth orbs off roughly towards the tree line. As one orb drifts over a low, short patch of bushes, it drops sharply behind the bushes and disappears out of sight. Sotalia’s indignation gives way to sheer astonishment and she dramatically mouths in a quiet whisper to Aristespha. “Really?!”

Aristespha glances over to Sotalia and slowly nods with a tight smile on her face. As Bach readies for the sixteenth orb, Aristespha calls out quickly. “Stop. That’s about the same amount of energy used.”

Sotalia taps her fingers on her arms and twitches her mouth while she processes the demonstration. Bach gazes up the darkening skies as the lighter clouds of before are now the dark, heavier variety. He fans off the orbs near him and pinches one in hand to wield around. Aristespha’s eyes dim back to normal and she drops her hands to her sides. “I hope that was informative for the both of you.”

She glances over to Bach, but rests her remaining gaze on Sotalia. Sotalia briefly narrows her eyes at Aristespha, but releases a sigh and nods a few times with an uncomfortable smile. “Yes. It was.”

An eager grin cracks upon Sotalia face and her confident aura seeps back up to the surface. “So? About this energy transfer skill you are going to teach us.”

Aristespha’s eyes track a drifting light orb and she gently coaxes it into her hand. “Let’s go inside, first. It will take awhile to explain the basics and I don’t want to be interrupted by the rain.”

Bach and Sotalia agree. Bach and Aristespha both walk towards the house and use the light orbs to shine light ahead on their paths. Sotalia takes a few steps, stops, quickly pivots, and snatches an idle light orb. She tags behind the other two and examines the light orb more often than using it for a light source. A loud rumble of thunder rolls over the area from the distance and motivates the three to speed to and through back sliding glass door.

As the field darkens and the dark clouds completely coat the sky above, two figures rush across the open grass. Their march shifts to a full charge as drops of rain fall upon the area. The pace of drops increases and further obscures the figures as they halt around the wooden plank picnic tablet and drifting light orbs. The orbs move erratically to the figures, some disappearing completely while a few dim. The two figures dart off back into the tree line, with dim points of light tracing them the whole way.

&amp;nbsp;

The rain pelts the side of the sliding glass door and echoes soft patters into the living room. Dretphi aims the television remote at the television screen and flips through a number of channels. With a sigh, she drops the remote onto the coffee table and sinks into the couch cushions. Cideeda slowly blinks she fends off a fit of drowsiness and stretches out her arms and legs on the other side of the couch. She turns her head to eye Dretphi. Dretphi also turns her head to meet Cideeda’s gaze. Cideeda simply nods once and dons a sly, toothy grin. “I think it’s time. I’ll get the adapter cables, you get the television ready and clear the area.”

Dretphi cracks an equally sly smile and gingerly stands up from the couch. Cideeda pulls herself off the couch and walks fast into the hallway. A few seconds later, the faint sounds of shuffling and rummaging carry into the living room. At the dining table, Aristespha, Bach, and Sotalia sit on one end. Sebastian hovers over head and splits his attention between Aristespha’s lesson and Cideeda and Dretphi’s new project. Sotalia concentrates her mind and presses her open hand against Aristespha’s. Sotalia contorts her face in genuine struggle as her eyes faintly illuminate a golden light. Meanwhile, Aristespha calmly watches Sotalia’s antics and continues to keep her hand in place. After a few seconds, Sotalia carefully draws her hand away and small ball of magical energy emerges from Aristespha’s hand. She continues drawing her hand back and a grin of sheer accomplishment flashes onto her face. As her fingers curl around the energy ball, Sotalia hoists her hand up into the air, beaming. “YES! Finally! Wow! That was much harder than before. Holy shit.”

Aristespha smiles, places her hand down, and glides it over to secure a mug of tea. “Hence the difference between a cooperative and idle energy transfer. Your body and mind naturally want to avoid leaking magical energy everywhere. So, when you are not willing it, magical energy will tend to keep to established flow routes and avoid deviations. Also, established flow routes are typically the path of least resistance in comparison.”

She lifts the mug up to her mouth and slips the hot, steaming brew. With a calm grace, she places it back down and continues. “There is another type of transfer. And that is confrontational energy transfers. Those are the type made when the mind and body are on a full active defense. We’ll cover those another time. For now, you can practice the basics. If you need more of a challenge, you can use magical energy insulation techniques from basic spellcasting to put up a more active defense.”

Behind Aristespha, Cideeda skips through the hallway archway and hauls a metal suitcase covered in various game and game company stickers. Dretphi withdraws her head from behind the television, nods at Cideeda, and returns to the back of the television. Sotalia swings her gaze to Bach and radiates a superior arrogance through a cornered smile. “I’ll have you know, I was top of my class in all my spellcasting courses.”

She presents her open hand up to Bach and focuses her eyes upon him. “I’ll just use a number of those insulation tricks and maybe a few of my own to make it challenging to you.”

Bach tilts his head to the side and meekly shrugs at Sotalia. “Umm… How about we just try a few of those cooperative energy pulls and maybe a few idle ones? Let’s make sure we know what we are doing before making needlessly difficult.”

Sotalia narrows her eyes at Bach and her smile morphs into a devious grin. She provocatively lowers her eyelids and her tone patronizes. “Aww. Are you too tired? Did those little light orbs run you out of energy today?”

She dramatically sighs and rolls her eyes dismissively. “Well, if that’s the case, I guess I understand...”

Aristespha glares towards Sotalia and frowns. She begins to open her mouth when Sebastian flies down next to her and whispers into her ear. “Wait. Look at my bro.”

Aristespha spots an odd, wry smirk hidden in the corner of Bach’s mouth away from Sotalia. Bach places an open hand against Sotalia’s and smiles. “Okay. I’ll humor you.”

Sotalia smiles eagerly, rolls her shoulders in a stretch, and settles into her seat at the ready. She focuses on her and Bach’s hands. “Whenever you are ready. Don’t hold back, because I want a challenge. Surprise me.”

She closes her eyes and takes a long deep breath in. Bach’s smirks erupts to a wicked grin. “Okay. I’ll surprise you.”

Sotalia’s eyes fly wide open as she reacts to the sudden, firm grasp of a hand on the back of her neck. She eyes the path and finds Bach to be the hand’s owner. Before she can open her mouth, a sudden pull of magical energy stops her. Her jaw opens midway through a gritting her teeth and her lips twist in confusion. One eye nearly closes in a cringe as her head tilts to one side. Her shoulders tense up and her spine squirms into a near arch. Her toes curl and her fingers claw up. Finally, she howls out a mix of utter shock and girlish disgust. “The fuck- AIIIEEE!!!”

Bach quickly removes his hand free from the back of Sotalia’s next with an orb of magical energy securely in his palm. Sotalia covers the back of her neck with her free hand and flashes death glare right at Bach. “WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!”

Aristespha tightly secures her mouth with a hand and can barely contain herself as snorts of laughter leak out. Sebastian keeps his mouth shut with the stiffest smile he can muster and avoids accidental direct eye contact with Sotalia. Cideeda stares over towards the living room table and blinks in confusion while she holds a game controller and its plug. Dretphi just finishes turning the television back around before she snaps her head to scan dining table area. Bach grins triumphantly and displays the energy orb. “Well, your surprise of course.”

Sotalia’s eyes flash with anger at Bach, but she quickly subsides to an amused smile. Immediately, Bach’s grin decays to a much more wary expression. Sotalia lightly chuckles to herself and sighs. “Well. To be fair, I DID ask for a surprise.”

She rolls her eyes and shakes her head. “And, I did goad you. But, your master plan has one flaw.”

Bach darts his eyes around his mind in an attempt to locate what the flaw is. He feels four points of pressure pressing upon the back of his hand. Bach aims his head down to see Sotalia’s fingers weaving between his and curling to press her thick black nails into the backside of his hand. Sotalia torques her hand forward and Bach seizes to attention. She extends her free hand, points to the energy orb in Bach’s other hand, and gestures by opening and closing her free hand. Bach grimaces, grumbles, and places the energy orb into Sotalia’s awaiting hand. In seconds, the energy absorbs back into Sotalia and she releases her grip of Bach. Aristespha rolls her eyes and shakes her head. “Okay. Are you two children done for the day?”

Sotalia nods simply with a content smile. “Yes, teacher.”

Bach glances over while rubbing his hand. “I’m good. No more surprises.”

Aristespha props her arm on the table top and rests her chin upon her hand with a sigh. “Good. I do have a question for you, Sotalia.”

Sotalia curiously faces Aristespha and pays attention to her. “Yes? What is it?”

Aristespha presents an amused expression and lifts her mug of tea close to her mouth. “So, did it feel like a bucket of ice water going down your back?”

Sotalia nods very quickly and squirms a bit in her chair. “YES! Oh gods! It’s like someone dumped the ice maker down the back of my shirt.”

Bach eyes Sotalia and snorts with snarl of the lip. “Sort of like someone casted a freeze ray spell up your back?”

Sotalia opens her mouth, halts, quirks an eyebrow at Bach, and pulls her mouth to a corner. “I hope you aren’t holding a grudge for that? I honestly missed that time.”

Bach shakes his head and shrugs. “Nah. I just thought it was good point of comparison.”

Sotalia returns to Aristespha with a quizzical expression. “How did you know it felt like ice water down your back?”

Aristespha finishes a long sip of her tea and continues to smile with a tinge of nostalgia. “Oh, it’s something all the medical mage students would do to keep each other on our toes. If you got caught napping anywhere other than the break room or were late to your shift because you were napping in the break room, you could expect a VERY rude wake up. Honestly, that sensation is almost better than coffee.”

She places her mug back down on the table and casts a gaze to both Bach and Sotalia. “And, in emergency situations, that region is one of the easiest to access places to tap into the body’s major magical energy flows. It was not uncommon for a medical mage to snag a student for magical energy when the situations got dire.”

Her face dons a stern, dark glare and her tone turns serious. “That said, I would recommend you two stick to hands and arms for practice. You two aren’t medical mages and neither of your energy control skills are good enough to casually play around with major energy flows like that. Understand?”

Both Bach and Sotalia nod slowly, wide-eyed. Aristespha resumes a smile. “Very good.”

A melodic, electronic tune sounds out from the television. Aristespha, Bach, Sebastian and Sotalia shift their attentions over toward Cideeda and Dretphi. The two sit comfortably on the couch, each with a game controller in hand. Upon the coffee table, the holoplayer projects a status screen while a series of adapters and cables run to the television and an old gaming console. Sotalia’s eyes widen upon sight of the assembly and she slides back in her chair. “Well, that’s enough training today. We’ll continue tomorrow.”

She gets up from the chair, strides over to the couch, and perches upon a couch arm. “I call next!”

Bach turns back around in his chair, bites his lip, and faces his head to Aristespha with a quiet voice. “Ah... Sorry, if I went a little too far with Sotalia and trying to pull energy from the back of her neck and all.”

Aristespha softly chuckles and shakes her head slightly with a quiet response. “Oh, don’t worry. You have far better energy control and you wouldn’t have done anything to harm her. Also, someone needed to put her ego in check and you just happen to know the right way to do it.”

Sebastian leans in closer to the conversation with a proud grin. “And well, you had every right to show her up, bro. She called you out and you delivered.”

Bach nods calmly and lets out a breath of relief. “Okay. Wanted to make sure I didn’t do anything too stupid.”

Sebastian snorts and winks to Bach. “No worst than standing out from cover, raving like a madman, and taking pistol shots at a rampaging combat robot.”

Bach groans and partially buries his face into a palm. Aristespha gently pats Bach’s shoulder. “No need to kick yourself, it did that more than enough.”

Sebastian leans further and partially through the table to look at Bach directly with a sincere smile. “And you saved our asses. So, can’t fault you too much.”

Sebastian rights himself and watches a video game load up on the television screen. He drifts towards the couch and glances back. “Now come on, I can’t play so you’ll need to defend the family honor.”

Aristespha stands up from the table with her mug in hand. Bach pushes his chair back and joins the gathering. He watches the title screen appear and amuses in honest surprise. “Wow! Champions of Nexus. I haven’t play this since school.”

Aristespha crosses her arms with a slight grin and nods. “Yes. We found an old warehouse and for some reason there was perfectly good system and cache of games. I’ve been trying to get back to what I was back in my medical mage school days. Who did you normally play?”

Bach scratches the back of his neck and sheepishly admits. “Um. Ionis, actually.”

Aristespha blinks and cranes her head toward Bach with a trailing pivot of the body. “Ionis? Really? I could never figure out his power up chain and his energy use is ridiculously hard to manage...”

She stops talking and returns to watching the television screen. Bach watches the action on the screen and does not notice Aristespha musing.

&amp;nbsp;

Howard’s voice resonates through the speakerphone. “How are our adventurers settling in? Any good moments for show?”

Samantha stacks another pillow onto the bed and settles herself on top and into the pile. “They’re doing just fine. And plenty of moments when moving it.”

She rolls over closer to the aetherphone on the nightstand. “We got an hour clip alone of Chad, Tassilda, and Trakenthin in a yelling match at who would get the biggest room. The best part I think was seeing Mordoran and Deedri working together to sneak their stuff into two of the rooms off at the end of the house.”

An intrigued trill colors Howard’s voice through the speaker. “Ooo. That’s a possibility I hadn’t quite considered yet. Let’s leave it alone for now and see if something sparks. Also, is the crew enjoying the their house?”

Samantha smiles as she types notes into her laptop. “Yes we are! A really good vantage point, great reception with the wireless cameras, and plenty of room for us to stage.”

Howard yawns as the creak of a bed frame echoes in the room on the other side of the call. “Excellent. Turned out to be much cheaper than the hotels. Anything else before I get some much needed sleep.”

A plotting grin draws upon Samantha face, she leans in very close to the aetherphone, and speaks with a suggestive tone. “Yes. Quite. One of our cameras pointed to the forest near the other group caught Deedri sneaking off into the forest yesterday. Then today, Deedri and Tassilda went out together.”

A quick sudden squeak of the bed frame and the sounds of covers fluttering sound out before Howard’s voice grows closer with an anticipating breath. “And?!”

Samantha bites her lip and seductively tenses her voice. “When the rain fell, Gerald recorded them running from the forest carrying some kind of magical artifacts. They played off needing to change in their rooms to the others, but they actually were studying the artifacts.”

A giddy chirp peaks out of the speaker. “Keep me updated. Watch in quiet for now.”

Samantha grins deviously. “Will do.”"

My manager and mentor have told me that I'm slowly improving, but that it's not enough for a return offer yet. Also, I know ""It's not over till it's over"", but I want to think about contingency plans here. 

I'm interning at a Big 4 (see username) company right now and I want to figure out how I could spin this in future interviews.

I started work last week at a small (~10-15 employees) tech company in California as an intern. Since marijuana is legal here for both medicinal and recreational use, I've been considering pursuing medicinal marijuana to treat anxiety. I already obtained a doctor's recommendation, but I'm having second thoughts in the event that my company decides to drug test me. I haven't been tested yet, and I've already been working here just under a week. I like to think I've made a good impression so far (I've done my best to go the extra mile and my boss has complimented me on the work I've done so far), so I don't think I give off the impression that I'm a slacker or stoner. While the workplace policy doesn't require drug testing, it does allow for random tests, and since my company does take on federal contracts, it seems possible.

My boss seems like a relaxed guy so I was considering sitting down with him one-on-one, and explaining that this was something I was considering after already having been to counseling, while emphasizing that I would never come to work under the influence or let it affect my performance, and that the job is my priority. Is this a bad idea? Could this reflect negatively on me? Is there a better way I can approach this?

Thanks for all the help!"

6mn344,3,2017-07-11,What should I expect as an intern at a well established web development company in my city?,BMWigglestein,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/6mn344/what_should_i_expect_as_an_intern_at_a_well/,"Hello all,

Sorry for the long post, but I have some paranoia about an upcoming internship that I have in August.  I don't know what to expect and was hoping to get some advice from someone who has done an internship before.  

Here is a little backstory about myself:

I have a few years of my Computer Science degree completed, but I am planning on not finishing the degree, because my son was born and I decided to go ahead and start trying to find a career.

I started applying for jobs and internships and landed a sweet internship at a web dev company.  It is a three month internship, full-time, unpaid.  The thing is, I didn't know anything about web development.  I was upfront with them about this.  I was also up front about not finishing my degree.  What keeps picking at my brain is why they decided to even give me a chance. 

I am almost thirty years old, which I assume is way older than most of the intern candidates.   I am worried that the company is just putting me through the ringer.  I'm not sure if companies will get interns just to have three months free labor.  Even if they did, I'm sure there are more qualified, unsuspecting, potential interns.

I really like the CEO of the company, and I think that he really likes me.  We seemed to get along really well when I had my interview.  My wife keeps telling me that they are giving me a chance because they like me.  Is that a common thing in the workforce?

Now, I am not stupid.  I assured them that I can learn whatever I need to be an asset to the company.  I have since learned a hefty amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I am about to start diving into MySQL, JQuery, and a few other frameworks that I think will be helpful.  I have shown them the few projects that I have been working on since I got accepted, and I got a ""nice job, keep it up"" reply.

My main goal is to become such an asset to the company that they offer me a job after the three months are over.  So ultimately, my questions are:

* What is the best way to get offered a job after an internship?

* How do I get over the fear that this is some kind of prank that is getting pulled on me?

* What are common roles of interns at web development companies?

* Is there anything else you think I should know before starting my internship in August?
 
Again, sorry for the long, seemingly unorganized,  post.  If you can think of a better place to post this, feel free to tell me."

I'm a senior in Computer Science taking a 12-week internship right now. This is my first time in a corporate setting, and I can already tell that I'm not going to like the standard 9-to-5 corporate job. I feel like a lot of my time is wasted, and when there is free time in the day I'm stuck here. I would much rather have a really focused 4 hour work day where I can leave early and do my own thing. It seems like it would be an insanely better use of my time. I've talked about this with a few people who know way more about careers than me, and they told me that I should consider doing some of the following:

* Working at a startup
* Freelancing
* Contracting
* Entrepreneurship

Each of these sounds like a great idea to me, but I know that I would need time, experience, and savings before I could do any of these. What are your thoughts? Maybe I can start off in one then work my way into another? Either way, 9-to-5 work doesn't excite me and makes me feel like my brain is rotting at a desk."

I'm also a student in college, double majoring in Computer and Electrical Engineering. Second year, when most of my friends have internships or co-ops.

I have been suspended from college for a semester due to poor completion percentage. Not bad grades, as I have aced every non-explicitly mathematics-based course I have taken so far.

Turns out, I have ADHD and general anxiety focused towards mathematics. My parents have know that I have ADHD since I was very small (pediatrician told my mother to have me checked by a psychiatrist). They decided to not even get me checked (not an insurance problem at all, just did not want to get me checked) because I was doing well in school. 

Back to current year. I had an interview with a larger company for an IT internship. If I had passed two classes this year, I would have had the internship (last question asked in the interview, wanted to answer honestly).

After last year, where I took two semesters to pass Calculus I, as well as not passing some other classes, my parents still did not decide to tell me that it might be ADHD, and I might want to see at least a psychologist. I learned this myself as I was going through my university Psychology class (elective, aced because it was interesting). 

In my mind (possibly not to others, might be just me), if I had been told even at the end of my freshmen year, that I might have ADHD and if I had seen a psychologist then, and gotten even coping mechanisms (not necessarily even medication), I may have done better in those classes. Had I been able to do those classes better, I may just be in a decent internship. I wouldn't have to worry about rent. I would be able to have some spending money for myself, rather than sending it all to rent for a house that I won't even be able to live at until the winter, when I get back into school. 

All of this stems from my parents deciding that I was doing well enough, and didn't need to be told that my problems with school might be because of an actual developmental issue, and not just my ""not trying hard enough"", like my teachers (and parents sometimes) said. 

Sorry for the rant, just needed to get this off my chest."

The catch: My grades a pretty bad as I spend a lot of my waking hours providing support for the company I currently work for (I know its a terrible excuse). I don't mind that much because I have learned so much more actually working than I ever will learn at school.

In January of 2016, I got an internship at a residential management and development company doing helpdesk-related work which morphed into more of a network admin role over the course of the next year (switch/patch panel/firewall/AP installs/configuration for fiber-based networks). During this time, I dipped my toes into Active Directory/Powershell work but didn't really focus on it as I was busy with other stuff. 

About 6 months ago, our only sysadmin left us with an ageing infrastructure. Since then, I have been assuming his job and learning the infrastructure here as his replacement. In that time, I oversaw a change from a PRI-based phone system to a VoIP phone system and a number of other projects involving VMWare ESXi, Hybrid Linux/Windows environment, AD, DHCP/DNS, Powershell and Selenium automation, etc. I am also offered a lot of autonomy which is nice (I think since my boss likes the work I do). So I am getting valuable experience here.

I am thinking about quitting at the end of this summer semester (August) in order to focus on school so that I can bump up my grades and finish without any hitches hopefully by August 2018. That being said, I really enjoy working with the people I work with and I know that that can be invaluable.
 
This brings me to my questions: 

1 - Is losing out on 1 more year of experience going to set me back a lot when I start to look for jobs in my last semester for post-graduation?

3 - Does anyone have any experience with part-time contracting with a company they previously worked at?

I'm currently a summer IT intern for a medium sized software development company. I go to school for IT, I'm a quick learner, and everyone ever has told me that school is neat but I'll need real experience, so here I am. Internship started out great, it's pretty relaxed. It began as half ""image these laptops, figure out why this display won't connect, etc"", half ""here's a server and a copy of esxi, go nuts"".

I've set up a vSphere of two hosts and some VMs with isos I got from my university's Microsoft Imagine subscription. I have DNS and AD set up. From here, I'm not really sure what else to do. The guy that hired me is never here and the two guys I have contact with don't offer much in the way of guidance. I guess my question is, what kind of neat things can I set up in my environment to test/play with?

Tl;dr Don't have anything to do at my internship, please give me ideas."

I have not taken the GRE yet, but lets assume that with a lot of studying I will be able to get around average. My gpa is only a 3.2(major and total). I have done 3 semesters of research(2 different labs) and two internships at a good company, if these are relevant to the application process at all. I never really thought about going to grad school until now, which is why I focused my time more on working part-time during school and extracurriculars(club leadership, peer advising, tutoring, teaching assistant).

What kind of schools should I aim for? Is there anything I can do to improve my chances?

Let me preface with this is my first post in this subreddit, not much of a lurker here, so I apologize if formatting is incorrect or if anything here is breaking the rules (I did look at them so I think I'm in the clear)

Basically here's my dillema (I'll provide a tl;dr at the end as well)- I'm currently a 4th year student at university, however I'm slightly behind on credits because I decided to transfer colleges a few times to see the country and be in places that I wanted to be. None of this I regret despite the deeper hole I ended up digging for myself. Anyway, I'm currently doing my degree in Marketing, however after all of these years I absolutely hate it, I've worked in the industry, I've freelanced and ran my own marketing company working with smaller start-ups and local businesses and I've encountered success, however while searching for actual jobs/internships I've had a very difficult time getting my foot in the door due to being ""over-qualified"" as an intern, however when applying for actual positions I get turned down for not having a degree yet. Now the more I work in marketing, and the more I learn about marketing; the more I dislike it.

So here's my question; is it a drastic/stupid move for me to change from Marketing to something related to IT or Computer Science as that is something that has been a passion of mine since I was younger, but I was pushed to business school by family. I've been looking at career opportunities, job market growth, and everything looks promising compared to marketing and it's forecasted growth. Now if I made the change, I would be going through an accelerated masters program at the same time (I would spend 2 years finishing up my degree while taking some masters classes, and then another half year after that to complete my masters). 

TL;DR- Hate marketing. Have experience in IT &amp; CS (not a serious programmer. made a few apps, websites, and a turn-based game over the last 10 years). Is it stupid to change my major so far in (both time and debt), for something that I've found genuine enjoyment in in the past considering I haven't liked marketing since day 1 but continued due to parental pressure? 

Thanks in advance for any advice or insights you all might offer, and I hope you have a wonderful day!

6mptwe,1,2017-07-11,I want to quit my job,BooBailey808,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6mptwe/i_want_to_quit_my_job/,"Some background.  I've been working at a startup agency as 'Chief Technologist' for 6 months.  Live in the bay area. This is my first time in this position. I was just a web developer (4 years) before.  So I had to learn about AWS, project scoping, etc, on the job. Founding member, and a one-woman department.  There is only 4.5 of us.  4 of us came from the same company together to start this.  I am getting paid 70k.  He won't hire anyone right now (we tried to get an intern a couple of times, but he always changed his mind).

My boss is a manipulative bully who doesn't listen to me, makes his own time estimates, berates me to develop faster, calls me unprofessional and threatens to fire me for ""challenging him"" (asking questions) or being emotional (hard not to be when you get 3 hours of sleep and constantly pressured and yelled at.  I'm talking literal mental breakdowns), overbooks me, then yells at me for when the project is behind or not perfect.  If I bring up that I need more time, he lashes out that i ""approved the timeline"".  And this is all just the current project.  I scoped a month and a half dev time for this project, he gave me a month.  Then he scheduled another week-long project during the same time.  He pulled the same scheduling trick for the next project.   And all of this he did a few moths ago, but way worse.  And he blamed that mess on me.
  
I am so overwhelmed, I am freaking out.  I started lying to him about my progress because I can't face him anymore.  If I mention that anything is amiss, he yells at me. I've never done that before.  I have a solid work ethic and I work hard.  I'm working until 2 am and weekends, trying to get everything done and I don't know if I can.  Just recently, I mentioned a feature that was missing and he freaked.  He brought it up during daily check-in and lectured everyone about accountability.  The thing is, he never put any processes into place.  He was relying on what was agreed upon at the beginning of the project and a line item in an spreadsheet that's apparently on the drive.  I'm trying to put processes into place to prevent stuff like this.  I started to mention a tool that we can use and he immediately interrupted me condescendingly about how I always look for a tool for everything.  I only introduced 2 tools to the company - a time tracking tool, and a project management tool (which didn't work out, found a better one, but he won't let me implement it)  He went on to talk about how a tool isn't going to fix this, that we need to communicate.

I almost quit earlier this year because his policies are so strict and thinks he communicates them but doesn't.  He gives us a hard time if we step out for a bit, or don't get to work at 9am but he's constantly doing those things.  He also wouldn't let us work from home, unless he feels like it.  Also because of that threatening to fire me thing.   But I decided to stick it out,  signed up for a few classes, and try to do better - a decision I regret now.  

Thing is, I don't know how to quit.  I'm not a very good quitter.  And I don't have time to seek out a job or take time off for interviews.  If I do that, he'll get suspicious.  If I tell him I'm looking for a job, he'll ask for my 2 weeks.  I could quit right now.  But I don't have a lot of money saved, enough for a month of expenses plus a little more (I have debt).

I also would feel guilty for quitting.  We have contracts signed.  They would be really screwed if I quit.  Maybe even shut down.  And while I don't care about my boss anymore (he made his bed), I feel bad for my coworkers.  Also, he's making one of my coworkers managing partners.  This could make it better, but I will still be stuck in a small office (About to get smaller) with the guy.

I don't know how to get out.  Please, if anyone has any advice, I am deseperate.

TL:DR  Boss is an manipulative bully.  Deadlines are impossible.  I don't know how to leave."

First the interview was supposed to be on Friday(one of two back-to-back interviews), the interviewer bailed and never called,  so the interview got scheduled today and the recruiter found some new interviewer on a short notice. 

Received the google doc link 2 hours before the interview. The interviewer called a few minutes late (hardest 4-5 minutes of my life lol! I thought they were probably just pulling pranks on me). 

Got an extremely ill-defined problem and the interviewer's thick accent only added to the confusion. For one of the methods, it literally said that it's supposed to return a value but guess what? the method header had the return type void. 

Oh and since things were going so smoothly, the interviewer decided to turn on their speaker phone - I just kept hearing back my own voice. 

Somehow I managed to code the solutions. The questions weren't hard at all actually. Now as I walked through the solution and identified edge cases that would need fixing the interviewer would simply say that I don't have to worry about that. That she would guarantee an input that won't have those edge cases. 

40 minutes in, the nightmare ended, but I am not too confident. I feel like the interviewer had zero interest and was just forced into the interview (or worse that it was probably some random person that the recruiter had me interview with as a formality). What do you guys think I should do? Is talking to the recruiter about it worth it?   "

Right now, I have the opportunity to enter the Ivey Business School's HBA Program, or stick with my current Accounting program at Western.

At first I was dead set on accounting, confident that I could achieve Big 4 out of school from the accounting program. I then realized that it would be foolish for me to decide on accounting this early when I haven't even really been exposed to other industries like finance.


Now I've also been accepted to Ivey Business School. Definitely one of the best business programs in Canada but it comes at a cost. If I went to Ivey, I would have the option to consider entering the field of Finance or sticking with accounting. Otherwise I would have to stay with accounting.


Now the money part:

If I stay in the BMOS accounting program, I will finish school with approx $20 000 in debt, after bursaries and everything.

If I enter the Ivey program, I will be in the hole for $60 000.

What draws me toward Ivey is the exceptional alumni network, the flexibility (Finance/Accounting), the prestige. Honestly, I feel like I've pretty much fallen for their marketing.


At Ivey, I would be an average student most likely. No Goldman Sachs or BCG. My family does not make very much money at all. In fact as of right now, I am the only one employed in my family (full time summer internship). I would have to take a student loan of credit to fund my schooling. The line of credit is at prime rate (currently 2.70%).

About $34,000 would be borrowed from the line of credit, the remaining being loaned from OSAP (no interest until 6 months after graduation).


I was really gungho and excited to enter Ivey, until I realized how selfish it would be for me to take on this huge debt while my family is hurting financially. At the same time, I think this is a huge opportunity to invest in myself.

I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance."

I've had a previous job in retail which included some admin work - replying to emails/updating spreadsheets/telephoning customers etc. I'm very computer savvy so am confident in my ability to pick something up quickly. 

I've applied for around 300 jobs (if not more) via online applications/handing in CVs over the past 11 months and have only ever got 2 interviews - the first was for a part time job 2 days a week in the public sector, and the second was for an administrative job which I got rejected from last week. I thought the interview went great and in the rejection email I was told I interviewed really well and they liked me and it was a tough decision for them but they went with someone with more experience. 

I just feel like my lack of experience isn't getting my job applications noticed by employers but I've also applied for numerous internships (paid/unpaid) and volunteer work to build my CV and never heard anything back from those either.

I've had people look over my CV/job applications/personal statement/cover letters since I was paranoid I was going terribly wrong somewhere but everyone has given me positive feedback.

I also live on the edges of a capital city so the area is very competitive.

I just feel like I'm in a bit of a rut as it has really impacted my confidence.
It's depressing feeling so useless when I know I am able.

Any advice would be great on how I can proceed.

First, context:

* I'm an international student (from Central America) studying in Asia in one of the best universities in my field (Engineering). 

* I just finished my second year of a four year bachelor's program and recently took a course with this professor (Signal Processing) where I did pretty well (taking into account the class was pretty basic)

* This professor's research is focused on control systems, signals processing, unmanned vehicles and similar stuff up to what I know.

* As of right now I would like to get a Master's but I'm still not sure if I would prefer a life in Academia or Industry. My long-lasting interests include Nuclear Energy (fission and fusion), Signal Processing, Computer Simulations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (not sure if this goes together with the previous one) and Artificial Intelligence.

Second, the situation itself:

* I was supposed to meet up with the professor one day to talk more in detail about the summer research project but I fucked up big time and got late there then he had another schedule with someone else and so he told me to send him an email and that he would get me into contact me with a senior student. 

* This senior student explained to me the basics of what he had been researching on (Brain-Computer Interfaces) and explained to me how it was not until recently that they got a kit from OpenBCI to actually do measurements and experiments but he plans to spend his summer doing an internship and later on he plans to focus on another project.

* Now, he told me he would give me some information from his research but after leaving for his internship he has been unresponsive. I just got a book and some general ideas of what should he thinks I should read about.

* The professor explained to me that in the lab everyone does a part of the job. In this case my job or immediate goal would be to design a method to use the device to control vehicles by using brain-waves.

Third, my problems: 

* My senior was the only person working on this project. Up to what I know no one else knows anything about the subject (AFAIK). He told me to learn Machine Learning and even though I have a basic programming knowledge I feel a bit overwhelmed. I have seen multiple comments  with differing opinions that suggest to either read a book or take an online course, which language to use (Python, Matlab, R), the math prerequisites (Linear Algebra?) and the more I read into from where begin the more confused I get.

* I ended up taking the book (Brain-Computer Interfaces Principles and Practices by Jonathan Wolpaw) he left as a reference to start from. So far, it has taken me two days to go through three chapters (around 60 pages of a total of 400) and without understanding the contents fully. I try to summarize the basic ideas but if we go into details I feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of topics covered in the book (neuroanatomy and neurophysiology which I have absolutely no previous knowledge about ignoring basic high school biology) and my sluggishness in going through the chapters.


I am wondering if anyone has any experience with being a similar situation before and if so how to deal with it or any recommendations in general for academic research or this subject in particular? (How many hours should I work on this/ Is it ok to work from home when I am not doing experiments or should I always work at the lab? / How can I make the best of my time in there? /Is it worth to invest so much time into something that I may or may not keep working on in the future? Or any other suggestions would be useful). hanks a lot and sorry for the wall of text.

After asking for an opportunity to get experience for future graduate school applications my professor assigned me to work on a brain-computer interface (BCI) project and I feel a bit overwhelmed with questions.

First, context:

* I'm an international student (from Central America) studying in Asia in one of the best universities in my field (Engineering). 

* I just finished my second year of a four year bachelor's program and recently took a course with this professor (Signal Processing) where I did pretty well (taking into account the class was pretty basic)

* This professor's research is focused on control systems, signals processing, unmanned vehicles and similar stuff up to what I know.

* As of right now I would like to get a Master's but I'm still not sure if I would prefer a life in Academia or Industry. My long-lasting interests include Nuclear Energy (fission and fusion), Signal Processing, Computer Simulations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (not sure if this goes together with the previous one) and Artificial Intelligence.

Second, the situation itself:

* I was supposed to meet up with the professor one day to talk more in detail about the summer research project but I fucked up big time and got late there then he had another schedule with someone else and so he told me to send him an email and that he would get me into contact me with a senior student. 

* This senior student explained to me the basics of what he had been researching on (Brain-Computer Interfaces) and explained to me how it was not until recently that they got a kit from OpenBCI to actually do measurements and experiments but he plans to spend his summer doing an internship and later on he plans to focus on another project.

* Now, he told me he would give me some information from his research but after leaving for his internship he has been unresponsive. I just got a book and some general ideas of what should he thinks I should read about.

* The professor explained to me that in the lab everyone does a part of the job. In this case my job or immediate goal would be to design a method to use the device to control vehicles by using brain-waves.

Third, my problems: 

* My senior was the only person working on this project. Up to what I know no one else knows anything about the subject (AFAIK). He told me to learn Machine Learning and even though I have a basic programming knowledge I feel a bit overwhelmed. I have seen multiple comments  with differing opinions that suggest to either read a book or take an online course, which language to use (Python, Matlab, R), the math prerequisites (Linear Algebra?) and the more I read into from where begin the more confused I get.

* I ended up taking the book (Brain-Computer Interfaces Principles and Practices by Jonathan Wolpaw) he left as a reference to start from. So far, it has taken me two days to go through three chapters (around 60 pages of a total of 400) and without understanding the contents fully.

I'm still trying to decide on going down a business analyst path or sysadmin (leaning towards the BA at the moment). I'm going to be applying for internships in the fall (currently a junior), and wanted to have as much on my resume as possible to stand out. I don't have any kind of side projects because I work around 70 hours a week and frankly just don't have the time to do anything extra outside of work and school.

Idk if it's feasible to obtain a cert between now and then, or what I could even get a cert in, if possible. My technical skills consist mainly of python, SQL, and a little bit of VBA that I've learned in my free time. 

Also, I had an auditing internship with a B4 firm, will that help at all when applying for these IT positions? I figured it might help just being able to say I worked for one of them, even if it's not IT related.

Thanks!"

The Case Files Wiki: [Here](http://case-file.wikia.com/wiki/Case_File_Wiki)

*Case File: 028-151*

*Case File Date: 10/12/2006*

*Location: St. Rosa, New Mexico*

*Subject: Alec Boardwine*

*Entity: Female Ghost*

*The following comes from video tapes found in Mr. Boardwine’s house.*

Alec: Hey. Yo? This on? Testing, testing. Oh, there’s the red light. Guess it’s recording. Anyway, I thought I’d set up a brief intro or whatever to this thing. So, over the last few weeks someone has been snooping around my house. I’ve talked to the cops and they had a patrol car stay outside my house but haven’t seen anyone. And yet, I still can tell people have been to my place regardless. I wake up to old antiques being pulled out of my basement, sometimes the burglar alarm goes off in the middle of the night, and worst of all they have been vandalizing things that my Aiko used to own.

*Mr. Boardwine appears quite crestfallen as he stares into the camera.*

Alec: Nobody really believes me right now. And…and I guess I don’t blame them. It’s been nearly a year since she took her-since her passing. And I’m no closer to closure than I was the day she died. I think everyone thinks this is a way for me to grieve. I’m getting fake sympathy or, maybe real sympathy. But people don’t believe me and that’s the issue. So I’ve set up these security cameras all around the house. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to get all the footage I need on the trespasser.

*Mr. Boardwine begins to walk around his residence, pointing out the various security cameras.*

Alec: As you can see here, I’ve got a camera set up in the living room. This is where I keep finding all our old stuff laid out. It’s a lot of stuff that Aiko brought over from Japan.

And over here I’ve set up a camera in the entrance hallway. I figure that I can keep an eye on the burglar alarm, maybe I’ll catch them fiddling with something. As a bonus I’ll be able to look into my…uh, office, I guess. Since the break-ins have started I’ve gotten a little paranoid with having my back turned to a doorway. I guess I could just rearrange the room but…it’s really just a silly notion in the first place.

I’ve put another camera down in the basement. Specifically pointed it at the pile of boxes that keep getting raided for our belongings. I think that’s pretty self-explanatory. Catch them in the act. So, my quest to catch them starts now. Follow along with me, eh?

*Mr. Boardwine looks into the camera and gives it a quick wink before turning it off.*

*The next section of footage is from the camera pointed towards Mr. Boardwine’s office. He appears to be talking to someone else in the room although they never come into frame.*

Alec: Come on man, don’t say shit like that.

Man: This isn’t healthy Alec. Mom told me all about these cameras. Claiming someone is coming in to mess with Aiko’s stuff? Look, I’m not supposed to say anything but people are starting to talk a bit. A few of our cousins think this is some sort of psychotic break, that you’re the one pulling out this stuff every night and you just aren’t remembering correctly.

Alec: Was it Tony? Fuck Tony. Prick. Anyways, that’s the whole reason for the cameras. If it’s just me having a breakdown than the cameras will prove that and I’ll go get help or whatever. It’s fairly win-win right? Also, seriously, fuck Tony. I’m not going to his wedding next month.

Man: Alright. Fine. Fair enough. I’ll talk to Mom and try to smooth things out. Just be careful, alright little brother?

Alec: Yeah…yeah. No worries.

*The next section of footage comes from the camera situated in the living room. It appears to be late night/early morning due to the relative darkness and Mr. Boardwine is passed out on his couch, seemingly dozing off while watching television. The footage suddenly buzzes with static, much as we’ve seen before with other entities. The static worsens to the point where you cannot see the camera footage and then the static very quickly and suddenly condenses to a humanoid form standing behind the couch, looking down at Mr. Boardwine. The figure reaches towards Mr. Boardwine and the static slowly fades to reveal a pale girl although it is difficult to discern any notable features in the low light. Her hand brushes against Mr. Boardwine and the static picks up to a dull roar. Suddenly, all is calm, the mysterious girl is gone, and Mr. Boardwine wakens with a start. He gets up and turns off the television, his encounter wholly unknown to him.*

*It is unknown how much time passes between this next clip but it most likely occurs no more than a few days after the first encounter due to Mr. Boardwine not stumbling onto the footage of his encounter quite yet. The footage starts with the basement camera acting up from interference. When the footage clears up the pale woman can be seem rummaging through the boxes and pulling out various knick-knacks, most of which have an oriental origin. The woman walks out of the cameras frame and immediately appears on the living room camera, walking in from the side. The timestamps on the cameras seem to indicate that she got there inhumanly fast, moving from the basement to the living room in less than a half second. The woman lays out all the trinkets and then apparently notices the camera for the first time. She walks out of frame, never looking away from the camera. Her way of movement is highly disturbing as to appear to slide out of frame more so than walk. The camera suddenly fills with static and a metallic screaming can be heard before the static suddenly gives way to an empty and quiet room. This is quickly replaced with the woman’s head sliding in to view mere inches from the camera. This is highly unusual as the strange woman wasn’t very tall and the camera was placed near the ceiling of the room. Getting a clear view of the woman it is now clear to see that she has crazed eyes sunken deep in her face, certainly patches of her face seem to barely hold on to her skull, and there’s a deep and decidedly lethal gash that follows along her neckline. She stares into the camera for the better part of an hour before sliding back out of view.*

*It should be noted here that this is the point where the entity in question was deemed to be an onryo and measures were taken to protect any who viewed the footage while compiling the rest of this Case File. Other, special precautions were taken in regard to Mr. Boardwine.*

*The next bit of footage comes from Mr. Boardwine’s handheld camera. He has it pointed at his face and looks to be rather ecstatic.*

Alec: Oh baby, we did it! I got that footage to prove someone was in my house. But oh man, I was not prepared.

*Mr. Boardwine swings the camera around and replays the two previous clips that had the onryo interacting in his house. He pauses it on the onryo’s close up and sets the camera down while he settles in to his computer chair.*

Alec: That’s gotta be my Aiko, from, like, beyond the grave or something. She was always superstitious, something about a family ghost or curse. I always laughed it off but she’s still here in the house, trying to get my attention! I mean, the woman in these clips is a dead ringer for her, minus the…um, spooky parts. And that gash on her neck…

*Mr. Boardwine looks crestfallen.*

Alec: That’s…how she passed. Chalked up to a suicide. Maybe she’s trying to tell me something now…

*Mr. Boardwine stares off towards the floor while the computer monitor behind him begins to move. More accurately, the onryo in the footage moves. She reorients her position to stare at Mr. Boardwine and reaches out from the monitor to grab him. It appears she would be successful but at the last moment the doorbell rings and Mr. Boardwine quickly rises from the chair and avoids the hand. The onryo resettles into the monitor and assumes her original position. She glances over at the handheld camera as copious amounts of blood pour from her neck wound and the footage fills with static and cuts out.*

*The next clip is another one of Mr. Boardwine on the handheld camera.*

Alec: So…it’s been a few days since I’ve seen the footage of Aiko around the house. The cameras haven’t picked up anything new since then. I also haven’t really told anyone about her yet. My folks are fine with thinking this is a psychotic break. If I let them know Aiko is still haunting the place they pull out an exorcism or something. I can’t have her taken from me again. Well, that sounds weird to say. No. That’s not entirely what I meant. She’s a ghost now right? That must mean there’s some sort of purpose or reason she’s hanging around. I’d rather help her with whatever that is and have her move on with contentment as opposed to some priest forcing her away. If that’s even how this stuff works. I haven’t worked out a way to communicate with her yet but that’s my next step.

*The clip ends only to lead into another one with Mr. Boardwine directly addressing the camera again.*

Alec: I’ve got it! I know how I’ll talk to Aiko. A séance. Sorta. She had all these old…uh, relics? Paranormal stuff? I think her family back in Japan did some sort of ghost hunting or communicating with the dead. To be honest she didn’t like to talk about her family much. The only item she ever kept that seemed like a family keepsake was this business card for some shop her grandfather owned. I always thought it was a weird thing to keep remembering her grandfather by but she always was adamant about how important it was. I wonder where that card went. I haven’t been able to find it since her passing. Thinking back on it I find it kind of interesting that we have all this ghost stuff in our house that should let me talk to Aiko. Like, it’s a big coincidence.

*Mr. Boardwine places a strange device on the table. It looks like fusion of a clock and a sundial. There are little notches on the side that looks like something small fits into them. Mr. Boardwine takes two sticks of incense and inserts them into the notches. He lights the incense and then presses a button the machine. The arms that appeared reminiscent of those of a clock begin to twirl and spin the incense smoke around.*

Alec: I’m not entirely sure what this machine does to be honest…or rather, I saw Aiko use it once when she thought I wasn’t home. She appeared to be talking or commanding someone so I thought I’d give it a go as well. Ahem. Aiko? Aiko, are you there? Hey sweetheart, I’ve seen you wandering around the house and trying to get my attention.

*The camera starts to pick up a faint static haze.*

Alec: I miss you, you know? It’s been awhile… I mean, I still remember how you were the day I came home and found you like…well, that.

*The static worsens.*

Alec: Could you maybe tell me why it happened? Why you did it? I won’t be mad, I promise. But I need to know so I can help you move on. There’s a reason you’re stuck here and trying to communicate with me.

*Static overwhelms the camera. It suddenly gives way completely to show the onryo standing behind Mr. Boardwine. She does not move and simply stares down at him.*

Alec: So please, let me help you sweetheart. Show me why this all happened… Please…

*The onryo suddenly lashes out at Mr. Boardwine and strikes him with her inhuman power. Mr. Boardwine slams into the wall and crumples in a heap. Static fills the camera up once more before dissapaiting completely. In place of the onryo is a single, small cassette the likes of which would be used to store footage filmed on Mr. Boardwine’s handheld camera.*

*Hours go by but eventually Mr. Boardwine wakes up and steadies himself. While getting his bearings he looks down to see the broken séance machine and the cassette tape beside it.*

Alec: She must have visited me… I can’t believe I blacked out. Oh…looks like the machine bro- wait. What is this? A tape? I didn’t leave this here. I only have the one. Oh, and the few that Aiko and I filmed back we we…oh. Oh. Oh! 

*Mr. Boardwine grabs the tape and runs back up to his study. He slams the cassette into a converter he has plugged into his computer. While waiting for everything to process he excitedly sets the handheld camera behind him on a stand. It appears that he’s forgotten it’s even on and recording.*

Alec: This must be whatever Aiko wants me to see… I mean, it has to be. I remember looking forever to find the camera. It wasn’t in the box where we left it after our final vacation. She must have filmed some things she couldn’t tell me or… something.

*After a few minutes of him nervously fidgeting the conversion is complete and Mr. Boardwine watches the contents of the cassette. The following is a transcription of the tape after we gained possession of it. It was watched once for transcription purposes and then was promptly sealed to contain the spread of the onryo’s haunting grounds.*

*The footage first starts with a younger girl that we eventually identified as a young Aiko. She is sitting at a table with two people that appear to be her parents and an older lady that appears to be her grandmother. Something to note is that a familiar static is covering the footage at times. We assume this means the onryo was present, although she strangely does not appear in the footage.*

*The footage then transitions to another scene of the family sitting at the dinner table only this time Aiko’s mother is missing. The family looks more somber this time around. While Aiko and her father quietly talk to each other the grandmother appears to be staring down the back hallway for the entirety of the footage. Upon lightening up a few frames taken from this segment we picked up a silhouette of a woman in the back of the hall.*

*Another transition leads to one final scene from the dinner table. This time only Aiko and her father are present. Aiko looks visibly scared while her father stoically cradles her. Perhaps more jarring is that the onryo from Mr. Boardwine’s footage is standing in the doorway to the kitchen and staring at the pair. Another thing to note is that in the previous two clips the audio was distorted passed the point of us being able to recover the sound clips, yet this one was salvageable. With the help of a translator we gleaned that her father was consoling her and telling her not to look at the onryo.  He mentions that her grandfather will be picking her up momentarily and that he loves her greatly. The onryo makes a sudden lunge towards the pair and the father gets up and appears to confront the onryo with some sort of holy symbol in his hand. The footage cuts abruptly.*

*The next clip of footage appears to be taken from a later point in time as Aiko appears somewhat older. She is now reminiscent of her appearance as an adult so it can be assumed that she is most likely a teenager at this point. What is more startling is the location that she appears in. It’s the paranormal shop found in File #017-102. Aiko walks up to the shopkeeper from File #017-102 and refers to him as “Grandfather”. The two talk in front of the shop briefly before the old man suddenly looks towards the camera and with a rather stern look in his eyes pulls her inside the shop.*

*The clip transitions to a more voyeur looking shot as it appears to be from a neighboring building looking into the paranormal shop. The footage merely shows the shopkeeper giving teenage Aiko a rather archaic looking necklace to wear before the footage being overcome with a rather large burst of static.*

*The next several clips share a similar theme and thus seem to be connected. It appears that the onryo stalked Aiko over a period of time from a distance. There’s clips of her walking through the city, relaxing in a park, attending school. There’s even several clips that include Mr. Boardwine, such as their first meeting and several clips of the two hanging out. These clips bridge the gap in Aiko’s age to one closer to how she looked right before her death. These far away voyeur style clips stop after a final clip of Aiko and Mr. Boardwine boarding a plane.*

*The following clip shows the camera looking in to Mr. Boardwine’s house from the living room window. This is the first time we get to see the Boardwine Residence on this tape. Aiko and her husband appear to be having an intense conversation with Mr. Boardwine appearing a little heated. In his hands one can see an expensive looking necklace. He points at the more archaic necklace that Aiko got from her grandfather and appears flustered that she won’t take it off. After a little deliberation Mr. Boardwine sets the necklace down on an end table and exits the house. Aiko looks distraught while lying on the couch. Tears run down her face and she looks beyond conflicted. After some time she gets up and cautiously looks out all of the windows with a grim look on her face. She then carefully removes her necklace and puts on the new one. The segment of footage cuts.*

*The next clip shows Aiko and Mr. Boardwine walking arm in arm through a park together. While the two look happy it is abundantly clear that the camera or camera’s point of view is much closer than it had been over the last few years. Aiko occasionally gives a nervous glance around but appears happy for the most part.*

*The pervious clip ends with a violent burst of static and gives way to Aiko in the basement. The lighting is dim and she appears to be on her knees, shaking rather oddly. A sudden burst of static reveals that the onryo is standing over top of her and holding her down. The static ends and the onryo disappears from view once more. Some time passes with Aiko being held down before once can see a bulge appear in her throat. The bulge grows larger and larger until the footage once again emits a burst of static. The onryo appears to be shoving needles down Aiko’s mouth and they are getting stuck in her throat. This continues for several more minutes with Aiko doing nothing in her defense barring the tears streaming down her face. Finally the needles burst through her throat and she collapses to the ground in a heap of blood. The static dies out again and the onryo and the needles disappear leaving an Aiko who appears to have savagely slit her own throat.*

*The cassette tape ends here. By this point Mr. Boardwine’s camera had already shut off so we can only speculate on his reaction. It is known that he was checked into the hospital several days later after a neighbor heard a commotion coming from his house and found him lying on the ground with severe damage to his throat, on the cusp of death. It was chalked up to a suicide attempt. It was at this point that we stepped in. We got a tip from one of our sources in the area that the house had all the markings of a haunting ground. Mr. Boardwine has been in our care since then, all the artifacts and footage has been compiled, and the house has been listed as “condemned” to prevent other people from stumbling across the onryo.*

*Unfortunately Mr. Boardwine has more or less lost the ability to speak due to his injuries. On top of that he appears to be in an intense form of shock and can’t communicate with us through other means either. He is to be kept under our protection until we can properly communicate with him and glean what information we can out of him. His accommodations are rather unique as well to keep his presence hidden from the onryo. We’re not sure if it was actually hunting him but we’re trying an experimental treatment to remove whatever mark she may have made on him.*

*Our team in Japan also happened to find the shop that Aiko’s grandfather owns. Strangely, he seemed to know of us and answered a few brief questions before shooing us away. Our agents have summarized that the man told them they were cursed by an onryo that slowly killed all the women in their family. The grandfather had intensely studied the paranormal to save his wife, daughter, and granddaughter before they could be taken. To that effect they would move around a lot. Eventually the onryo took his wife and daughter in quick succession, while his son in law was killed protecting Aiko so she could live with him. The onryo apparently had issues getting into his shop due to all the holy relics he had stored there. This coupled with the grandfather finding a rather powerful necklace saved Aiko’s life. The grandfather signed off on her moving to the United States in an effort to finally get away from the onryo.*

*Having told the agents all that he then shooed them away in a hurry before they could delve anymore into his past and actions in other Files. The agents were later told to bring the old man in for questioning but the shop was empty and the neighbors claimed the building had been empty for years. It has bee decided that Aiko’s grandfather is no ordinary man we’ll keep an eye out for any of his activities.*

*Case File: Pending.*

*Update: Several figures wearing black business suits and porcelain masks infiltrated the facility where Mr. Boardwine was being kept and have taken him. This matter has been considered a slap in the face by the Facility Lead and being looked in to extensively.*

[She's watching you, Secrets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9pavMzUY-c)

Edit: Tsk. Hey Nosleep, Secrets here. So I made an update on my little personal subreddit letting everyone know that I've been mostly fine lately, my health hasn't been 100% but I was still under the assumption that I wasn't being haunted. Eh, I'm not completely sold on that now.

So this Case File had been mysteriously sent to me like the others around a month ago. I purposefully didn't post it because I wanted to test the person adding the links to that Japanese stream. So I waited, and continued to wait. Sure enough, the second I post this damn File that link appears.

I'm...not sure I'm doing okay. My fiancé has left for an internship in another city so I've just been living by myself. Work is a blur. I just go home and sleep for hours at a time. The nightmares haven't stopped. I'm worried. I still haven't seen the onryo but I guess that doesn't necessarily mean anything. She might be here. I just don't think I can afford to assume she isn't, that I'm not in danger.

Still no word from Tattle. Maybe they've given up on me. Maybe a guy being hunted by an onryo is too dangerous to be around. Maybe it's nothing at all. A sick prank from Tattle or some O440 Operative with too much time on their hands. Whatever.

I am trying to search for a job since the last 2-3 months. Have a good resume/ was able to reach onsite rounds of tech giants. But unfortunately couldn't convert to offer because I was slow in coming up with some algorithmic solutions. Right now I have internship offer for 6 months from a startup. My question is should I continue with my job hunt and look for full time opportunities or should I work-hard here during internship, convert to full-time and THEN look for better opportunities? How does a 6 month internship look on a resume for someone who has already graduated? The internship will involve lots of challenging software engineering work based on the job description and the product that the startup is building.

NOTE: I am in India. Second, I think having a year gap seems to hurt indirectly perhaps. Also, intern salary for 6 months offer that I have is very low."

This is related to a personal ""you live, you learn"" moment that I went through in one my internships, and knowing that our community focuses so much on excellence in our work, we some times forget how important it is to properly navigate the professional workplace, aka office politics.  
  
You may not agree with the content of this story, which comes from a book by Robert Greene. If that's the case, your constructive and reasonable commentary is appreciated, but try to keep our discussion civil.
  
---  
  
**Law #1 - Never outshine the master**   
  
Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you, however, you must take a different approach: when it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.  
  
Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life are like kings and queens: they want to feel secure in their positions, and superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a deadly but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting your gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affection. He may feign appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will not admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid himself of your presence.  
  
This Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inadvertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are masters who are more insecure than others, monstrously insecure; you may naturally outshine them by your charm and grace.  
  
No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of Faenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated his subjects with his generosity and open spirit.  
  
In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who, however, decided to spare the town: he simply occupied its fortress, executed non of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.  
  
A few weeks later though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with some sort of trumped up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real problem was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man was outshining him without even trying. Given Manfredi's natural talents, the prince's mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charismatic. The lesson is simple: if you cannot help being charming and superior, you mucst learn to avoid such monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a way to mute your good qualities when in the company of Cesare Bogia.  
  
Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In late-sixteenth century Japan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had become an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi's most trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored throughout Japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had him arrested and sentenced to death. Rikyu took his own life instead. The cause for his sudden change of fortune was discovered later: it seems that Rikyu, former peasant and later courtfavority, had had a wooden statue made of himself wearing sandals (a sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in the most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the royalty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that Rikyu had no sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as those of the highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the emperor, and had come to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was an unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it with his life. Remember the following: never take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.  
  
Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite. Make him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experience may direct rancor and ill will at you instead.  
  
If your ideas are more creative than your master's ascribe them to him, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is merely an echo of his advice.  
  
If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court jester, but do not make him appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone down your humor if necessary and find ways to make him seem the dispenser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud tha blocks his radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which everyone revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you are thrust into the position of entertaining him, a display of your limited means may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress him with your grace and generosity can prove fatal. Learn from Fouquet or pay the price.  
  
In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strenghs if in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being the victim of their insecurity. This will all come in handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo, you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted.

Anyone have tips on how they got used to this? And/or if there's any recourse I have when it is completely out of  hand? I'm currently peeved because I have to go to work and I did not get nearly enough sleep last night, so excuse if this comes off a little harsh."

What worries me is that the name of some of the courses are too general and ""catchy"" (I will have taken most of what's in the first year anyway by the time I graduate, even if at an undergrad level). I like the compulsory internship, which from what I know might also take place as a Research Assistant at the University's Institute for Data Science and Analytics. I'm geared towards the Data Science track.

To add some context, I attend the BSc in Economics and Computer Science at the same Uni and thus know (and like a lot) the faculty and will probably talk with my professors once lectures start again, but at the same time I'd like to start thinking in advance about the matter because I'm considering taking some extra classes (in mathematics) as a non-degree seeking student if I decide not to stick with this in order to increase my chances at getting at a good program elsewhere.

Quick question:
I have just graduated with a dual major in Marketing and Business Management. I've been applying to many jobs over the past few weeks and I've had several interviews at different companies already - some which I've rejected, and some which I have been rejected from. I hadn't thought about doing another summer internship, rather just find a full time position at a company that I would enjoy working at, and be done with the jobs search. 

Anyways, I applied as a Junior Business Analyst at a company. I received an email saying I was not accepted, but the HR manager presented me with the option to discuss over the phone a possibility of working as a summer intern (paid) for 3 months with the option of going full-time if the company says I'm good enough. 
I guess it doesn't hurt to look into it and figure out what they have to say. Should I give it a go? My main concern with all this is that I am nervous that if I take the internship with this company, after 3 months, they say I'm not good enough, and again I have to search for jobs. What should I do?

Triple murder- police baffled!

A triple homicide in the rural town of Nox, Montana has police baffled. Three teenagers were found dead in their homes with markings on their face, arms and necks. The markings appear to have been done with markers or spray paint and appear to be dotted lines marking cuts of meat. The three victims were killed in identical fashion, their throats slit with ""surgical precision"" according to the autopsy report. The report also noticed that metal shards were recovered from the victims wounds. The crimes are particularly bizarre due to the fact that all three victims' rooms were locked from the inside and had no other means of entrance. As of now police have no leads on who perpetrated this heinous crime. The department declined a statement saying only that ""justice would be served"". 

Local meat packing plant suffers casualty

6mycs2,7,2017-07-12,Feel severely unqualified outside of grades which are still not exceptional,throwawaybcscared1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6mycs2/feel_severely_unqualified_outside_of_grades_which/,"Hi /r/applyingtocollege

I am an incoming junior who wants to major in international relations. However, I feel *severely* unqualified to get into any of the major players in the field. The main schools I want to get into are GWU, American, and WashU at St Louis. These are great schools but not elite. My reach schools are Georgetown and Tufts, which at this point feel like extreme reaches. 

My grades have been decent so far, but nothing too outstanding. This year, my final grades were: An A in APUSH, A in Honors English, A in Honors Chem, A in Honors Spanish, and a B+ in Honors Geometry. In terms 3 and 4, I got my lowest grades ever in geometry: an 84 and 85, respectively. Before this, I had never gotten anything lower than an 89. I don't know how to calculate UW GPA, and I can't see my weighted GPA because the website to access my grades is closed for the summer (for this reason I also cannot see my grades from Freshman year, although they were similar with an A- or A in every class but math which was a B+, and all were Honors). My class rank is only 22/224. I barely made the top 10% of my class. 

I haven't taken ANY SAT subject tests yet btw. So...

Next year I am taking 3 AP classes, 2 Honors classes, and no electives. I'm going to be taking APUSH II, AP Gov, AP English, Honors math, and Honors Spanish. I feel like my courses are not rigorous enough to get into a good college because I barely have any ECs.

My ECs are so incredibly bad. Freshman year, all I did was baseball in the spring. Sophomore year, all I did was Model Senate, and track in the spring. No awards. No jobs except for working at my parent's store this summer for 2-4 hours a day. I've been so lazy. Meanwhile, from what I've read on reddit, people who've gotten into Tufts and Georgetown for international relations were getting prestigious State Dept summer bullshit, prestigious Governor's programs, making their own businesses, whatever. My useless ass has been reading memes (not even making them), playing video games, and browsing reddit. 

I have no awards other than one bullshit joke of an award given to me for a business elective. For what it's worth I thought I would have gotten one for APUSH because I was probably one of the 5 best students in it but I didn't.

I have no idea how to show interest in international relations. I'm going to be participating in Model UN next year, and continuing track and Model Senate, but other than that I have no idea. Are there any internships or *anything* I can do? I'm also going to try to join the academic decathlon team, but from what I've read on my school's website, it's highly selective and priority is given to seniors, so I'm probably not gonna get in (it's alright though I'm used to rejection).

I live in the Greater Boston Area in MA, are there any opportunities for me during the course of the school year? I obviously can't commute to Boston everyday, but I probably could on the weekends. I was thinking an internship with a think tank, but I haven't looked at any, and at this point I'm too scared to because they probably don't exist and if they do I'm not getting in.

SO... TL;DR:

* I'm an incoming junior, want to major in international relations. Top 3 schools are George Wash. U, American, Wash U at St Louis but still feel like I can't do well enough to get in. Absolute reach schools are Georgetown and Tufts (&lt;0.000000001% chance of getting in). 

* Decent grades, final grades were A in APUSH, A in 3 Honors classes, B+ in Honors math BUT I also got my first term grades below an 89 in math this year (term 3 and 4 I got an 84 and 85, respectively). Class rank is 22/224, barely in the top 10%. No SAT subject tests and have no idea how to take them and no plan.

* Next year I'm taking APUSH II, AP Gov, AP English, Honors Math, Honors Spanish, no electives... advice?

* I've done absolutely fuck all for 2 years. Baseball in freshman year, Model Senate and track sophomore year. Planning on doing Model UN, Model Senate, track, and academic decathlon (if I get in) junior year, which are the most typical political ECs there are. I mean seriously millions of people are doing that exact same thing

* No jobs at all because I'm a useless lazy fuck. I've been working at my parent's business for 2-4 hours a day this summer, which probably doesn't count. 

* No awards besides one bullshit business elective one but I feel snubbed for APUSH but it's no big deal ^yes^it^is

* I live in the Boston suburbs like 30 minutes away without traffic. This is the perfect opportunity for a summer internship but me being the jackass that I am didn't look at any and now it's too late. 

* Want an internship at maybe a think tank but I don't know if they exist or what the fuck I would do at one.

* I am ass at summarizing because this ""summary"" is like the same exact length as my post

EDIT REAL QUICK. I have no idea how to answer the question, ""why are you passionate in international relations?"" I just am. I've been reading the ""World"" sections of NYTimes, WaPo, Reuters, BBC since September. I'm a participant in /r/geopolitics (not this account silly this is a throwaway). I tend to dominate class discussions on current events. Multiple times throughout the day I'll check syriancivilwarmap.com. I've been doing this since October. 

I like to think I'm really good at Spanish. My first two terms I got an A- each time, but the next two I got A+s both terms. I really love to learn the language and love the culture. I go on /r/argentina which is probably the most active Spanish-speaking community on reddit to learn it. I'm not doing anything during the summer but I've been keeping my Spanish sharp on Duolingo. I love listening to Spanish songs to help my comprehension. HOWEVER I don't want to specialize in a Spanish-speaking area in my international relations course (plot twist) (I sound *really* obnoxious with my parentheses and my italics don't I?). I would rather specialize in the middle east, the Levant or the Gulf more specifically, but I don't speak a word of Arabic.

ALSO REAL QUICK I'm learning Python this summer on Youtube that might be relevant it might not just wanted to put it out there just in case it is.

One last thing, are there any summer classes I could maybe take that accept applications on July 12?? ^^Fuck ^^me..."

6mz4z3,2,2017-07-12,How do I get a job out of college?,gusmuenas,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6mz4z3/how_do_i_get_a_job_out_of_college/,"I graduated college. Had nearly a 3.5 GPA. Got on the dean's list my last year of college. Got my degree in psychology. And now, I can't get a job.  
It's been 7 months since I've graduated. I've put in applications from everything from HR positions to psychology research internships. The ones that I have heard back from denied me instantly. One job, which emphasized that it didn't require any previous experience, denied me after the interview (in which the interviewer continuously mentioned the fact that you don't need experience), with an email stating that I wouldn't be hired due to lack of experience. I thought the phone interview went well. I thought all my cover letters have been very good. Thoroughly researched the companies, followed guides for cover letters online, the whole nine yards, and now I wonder if they even read the letters or just see my resume and say ""nope.""  
The only job I could get was in fast food, which was supposed to be temporary.  
My resume was created with the help of the career counselors at my school, so it should be proper format, well written, etc.  
I don't get why I'm getting denied instantly from the over 100+ jobs I've applied to, including ones that don't even require a degree. Some only required a high school diploma or GED, or even associate's degree. I had quit my warehouse job, which paid well enough for me to get out of my parent's house, had a 401k, had vision/dental/health, and was steady, because I was always told that college would get me farther in life, so I prioritized school over work and left that job. And now, I lost the best job I had ever had, and can't get hired anywhere else, had to move back in with my parents, and I have no foreseeable future.  
I have a college degree, and I work with 16 year olds in fast food. I'm 25, live with my parents, and I can't even afford health insurance. My job has no chance of moving up. I can't even get my foot in the door with any company, whether they are big companies or small companies.  
I've had a diverse background of jobs, mostly low paying minimum wage standard jobs, from fast food to cashiering, with my warehouse experience and an internship in a completely different field sprinkled in between. Nothing has lasted more than months or a few years, due to the majority of the positions being seasonal. Maybe that's the only reason I get denied from everywhere, because ""jumping around between jobs"" looks bad...but you can't really help that when the only places that will hire you are temporary.  
I also fear that one of my previous jobs, which I quit due to a hostile work environment, may also be giving me bad recommendations. The boss was extremely discriminatory toward me and other previous employees, and I wouldn't put it past her to lie, or even to disclose confidential information to other companies to get them to not hire me as well. I don't know if she is doing that, and I have no reason to believe she is, but I wouldn't put it past her-this woman bullied and harassed a coworker of mine to the point of suicide, so I wouldn't put much of anything past her. I also know that she knows that I can still sue her for harassment, and also that I refused to give a statement to her lawyers when she was trying to cover her ass from a wrongful death lawsuit. I generally put ""do not contact"" under this employer when applying for job applications, which probably looks bad as well, the whole ""if you don't have anything to hide, then you won't hide it"" reasoning. Even when I do put do not contact under that employer, that probably doesn't guarantee they won't contact them, and if they don't have that as an option, it's just on my resume. I wonder if I should leave that job off my resume, but I don't know if I can, or if having a year gap of unemployment would look worse.  
I know the biggest thing that would help my resume is experience in a particular field...but no one will give me a chance, so I can't get my foot in the door anywhere. I feel trapped, like I'll never be able to progress in life, that I'll be stuck in fast food forever, that my college degree was useless, that maybe I'm a victim of circumstance or maybe there's just something wrong with me. On paper, I've qualified for nearly every job I've put in for. I've even applied for bullshit data entry positions. I was told that for many jobs, it doesn't even matter what your college degree is, just the fact that you have a degree is enough. So far, it doesn't matter even if the job posting asks specifically for my degree or the area I studied in school, I still get denied.  
I don't know what else to do. I can't really afford to have an unpaid internship just for experience, and even if I could, the ones I applied for within the past two years all denied me anyways. I don't know if returning to school will help or not. I'm told it would, getting a higher degree would get me the job, but that's what I was told about my first degree, so I'm inclined to think that's bullshit. Everyone I've talked to with decent jobs only got in because of friends or family-it seems like it's all ""who you know"" and not ""what you know"", many of which weren't qualified at all for their jobs. Unfortunately, all the people I know are in the same boat as me.

I'm thinking about applying to PhD programs for either 2018 or 2019, but I'm not sure how competitive I am either for top schools like MIT/CMU (not that anyone has a really strong chance of getting in there), or of still good, but second tier schools like GA Tech.

I studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and have a B.S. in Physics with a GPA of 3.61, and an M.S. in Computer Science with a GPA of 3.89, graduating with my M.S. in May 2016. As an undergraduate, I was first author on 2 publications, one to a solid journal and the other to a pretty obscure journal, but I have no CS-based publications. I've had internships at my own school, Vanderbilt University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (co-op), all as a researcher, and at Cisco Systems as a software engineer. I had a full-time position out in Silicon Valley at Cisco for about a year as a software engineer, and I'm currently working at Capital One in New York City, also as a software engineer.

My M.S. thesis was nothing to write home about, it was a masters project instead of a true thesis, and, it was just a (very minimal) POSIX-based kernel. My advisor is no big name, but would write me a good recommendation, and securing two more from my research advisors in physics would be no problem.

In short, how competitive am I for programs? I'm looking to go the AI/ML route, which I find both fascinating, and it leverages my mathematics background from physics more. Obviously, I'd love to have a shot at MIT/CMU/Stanford, but if my credentials aren't up to scratch, I'd rather save my money. What might some of my target reach schools be? I know my B.S. GPA is a little on the low side, but my M.S. GPA is pretty high, does that count for much?"

I had a few questions I thought you all might be able to help me with regarding Computer Science at UCI:

1. What is the main language (or are there multiple languages) used for some, if not all, of the upper division courses? 

2. What do you think is a competitive grade point average to gain admission into Computer Science? I am afraid I have a fairly low grade point average, including fall grade projections, it will be around 3.34 - 3.40. If you think I am not competitive, do you suggest I list Informatics (or a less competitive major) as my first major then petition to transfer into Computer Science? And let's say I am rejected and I appeal, and I receive relatively good grades in the spring, does having a high grade point average in the spring play any role in that appeal? Or am I, slightly joking, deluding myself?

3. What may I do now to increase my chances of gaining admission? I live in a nearby city (Tustin) and about spend my fourth year (on and off) at a community college, and the only school I have planned to attend is Irvine. I love the campus, I lurk around with friends who attend there, and am a big fan of: the beer and chicken tenders at the bar on campus (did read they are closing, ah), and the air-conditioned food court(s) along with Subway. Plus, other schools require different prerequisites than Irvine, i.e. a science series, etc.

4. The prerequisites that I will be missing are four courses per the report on Assist: Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Computer Science (STATS 67), Boolean Algebra and Logic (I&amp;C SCI 6B), New Students Seminar (I&amp;C SCI 90), Principles in System Design Laboratory (I&amp;C SCI 53L), and Principles in System Design (I&amp;C SCI 53). Do you think that will be okay, and I will be okay?

5. If there are any other Computer Science majors (or any other major) in this sub and are keen to talk about: the tech industry, how to be competitive for getting summer internships and jobs after graduating, setting up a portfolio/blog, learning languages, working in the terminal, needing help with something, setting up a laptop club where we just do work at a cafe, wanting to go hiking (swimming, camping, road-tripping, etc), etc, do send me a message.

The question that I'm posing is how soon should I get the ball rolling. As of right now, I see two plausible paths to take: 1. stay with the job while working on the degree, and start applying for jobs a couple of semesters before completion, or 2. apply for internships to gain more relevant experience in the field as soon as I finish data structures and algorithms (which should be by next spring), quit the job if I receive and accept any internship offers, and then continue my degree to completion until I land a full time offer. Which course of action would you advise me to take? Also if you have suggestions outside of the two paths that I'm boxing myself into, feel free to offer them! Thanks in advance. "

A couple of months ago I was on a flight too NY and was lucky enough to meet two alumni from my school who happened to work at Google. I networked pretty hard with both of them, and one of them said he would schedule an interview for me for a summer internship. I'm extremely interested in pursuing a career in CS, but I feel like I shouldn't even waste my time going to this interview for a couple of reasons. First off, I do program fairly a lot in my free time but mostly on two larger scale projects I've been working on for about a year now. Because of this, my resume doesn't have many projects to showcase compared to others who might apply. Second, I have never actually done any work in the field of CS whether it be free lance, for a company, or even an internship, so I feel like that puts me at a significant disadvantage compared to other applicants. Should I even bother scheduling an interview because realistically what are my chance of actually being offered an internship? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks ahead of time, and if anything is unclear just lemme know and hopefully I can clear it up."

Spoiler: 

This is VERY long .Dont be intimidated, but please read everything. I need all help I can get

About me:

I am a to-be junior in msjhs in California (so all except UPenn are in-state)

I know its a bit too early for me to be ""chanced"", but i just want to know where i sit right now

Im a not-so-low middle class south indian male(i probably have the smallest house of all of my friends, who are pretty rich compared to my family, but we can still afford to live in an area where the prices are high af)

I plan on becoming a chemical engineer or a mechanical engineer, but the stakes pretty damn high. 
As for a job, Nanotechnology is very interesting, but I have no robotics background, so I plan on sticking on chemical engineering and mechanical engineering.


SAT I: 

I'm getting 1440s right now, but i think i can pull off a 1500 on the August 26th SAT. (I took a practice test yesterday and got a 1570 lol. I graded it right but I think I got lucky. XD) 

I'm getting 780s in math but it should get to 800. 

My English side isn't as strong. I get high 600s (I suck at critical reading, writing is meh). 

My essays are pretty ass in the analysis, I can probably pull off a 5 or 6 on the August test. 

My writing is like a 7 and my reading is a 6 or seven. I took the PSAT this year, and i know that it doesnt count. It was my first SAT experience, and i got a 1350. I can probably get a 1450-1500 on PSAT in junior year.


SAT IIs:

We got back subject test scores today, and i got a 760 on chem and 740 on math I (parents told me to take it lol). I'm planning on taking physics and math II next year. I didn't take bio in 9th grade because I didn't know about it.


APs:

I self studied psych during sophomore and got a 5. YAY! 

I started self studying for comp sci(Im not that much of a coder, but my parents can), stats(friends say its easy to self study, and technically im partner studying because im doing it with someone else), physics I(not really self study because im taking course in school), and physics II(only true-to-name self study) and I plan to take all these exams in junior.

In senior year, i plan on self studying micro/macro, and I will be taking calc AB/BC (idk which one yet), chem, and physics C. (in the comments, can someone explain how colleges view selfstudying for ap tests vs taking the course? I heard that courses are preffered, but i feel that if i put the same amount of time, it would look better if i did by my self with ""no outside help"" Thx)


Courses/Grades:

Our school is a complete ass even though it is highly ambitious. Many schools allow sophomores to take precalc, but our school doesn't, so i took alg II/trig H. Same goes for science. No AP courses allowed until junior year. 

Taken:

9th: 

english 9H: B-,B (Hard, but good teacher)

geometry H: A-,B+ (meh teacher)

bio H: A,A- (Shit teacher)

10th:

english 10H: B, B+(Good teacher. could have an A-, but he forgot to round : /)

Alg II/ Trig H: B, B-(Excellent teacher, but extremely hard)

Chemistry H: A,A+ (meh teacher)

Projected Schedule

11th:

precalc H, english 11H (no ap lang/lit go figure), AP Physics I, Spanish 3, Band, cpUSH (APUSH teacher is cancer)

12th:

English 12 AP(I might go for honors), Calc AB/BC (Ill probably end up taking BC exam), Physics C (both physics Cs are combined as 1 course), band, AP Chem, gov/econ
our school doesnt offer honors gov/econ, and honors ush, or ap euro/ap world

that totals me for 5-6 honors classes in 10 and 11 grade and 8-9 over all four years

1 AP course in 10-11, with 5 AP tests from 10-11, and 4-5 AP courses in total, and 11-12 tests over all years

Its evident that science is my forte.

I am very interested in chemistry and physics, but one of our physics teachers is ass.

Our school doesnt weight gpa, so i have a 3.71 with marching band semester, then a 3.67 without marching band. 

My Bs are in English and Math. UW GPA is an average of 3.69, and my W GPA is 4.1 (not that great)


EC:

dont judge but i used to do traditional singing for 9 years and then I quit because I had no time and my voice was changing and because there were hella girls in our class, i was the only one singing low.

I am currently brown belt(testing to red belt in a month), and that leaves me for one more belt test until black belt in Kung Fu. (Im a fast learner, and Ive only been going for 2 years so far. I believe colleges think it takes time, but I started in end of 8th grade. go figure) I have already started teaching lower belts, but because it isnt non profit, i dont get hours

I play clarinet in band, i can play well above average, but the other clarinet players at my school are hella good. This year, I applied for rank captain in our marching band because the others dont seem interested, but there are two clarinets older than us, so I might get a position in Senior year (too late?) 

I quit tennis in 9th grade because I thought i was good until i realized I was absolute shit (I could only volley, but they were killer. I would be good in doubles, but you would have to rotate so...)

I am affiliated with a religious organization, and i get volunteer hours for teaching 2nd graders more about their religion and culture.

I have like 60 hrs logged in my system, with another 30 added by the end of summer, and another 40 by the end of junior year, totaling to like 100+ hours.

I used to swim and play basketball and soccer (all at different times), but i was pretty bad at all of them. I did tae kwan do, but I quit because it was a lot of money($200/test, kung fu is only $100/test)

Given some instructions, i can do substantially better origami than most people. (I have a friend who is better than me: he memorizes even more complex models, where I struggle to remember how to fold intermediate models. However, his folds arent neat lol) Im planning on teaching next year or this winter or spring in the AC library.
I realize that most of my EC has nothing to do with my major, so I plan on applying for an engineering internship next year or lab assistant (junior summer) but i couldn't find any this year

As part of the religious organization, there is a retreat to India where we help develop rural parts of the country, and my mom is planning to sign me up for it, but if it interferes with finals studying(fremont finals are after winter break), then we might have to drop. Every hour of all 2 weeks count as volunteer hours, so thats like 300+ hrs. Its both EC and hrs, but I dont know anyone there. Ill be pretty lonely, probably studying for AP physics during break. I know one friend who is also in the organization, but if i go with him, hes not gonna let me study for even a minute, but I wont be bored XD


Other:

For some reason, my teachers dont seem to like me, even though I am pretty smart. Its probably because I ask too many questions that they never clarify(they always say ""why do you always have questions but nobody else has them?"" its because they are lazy. 

Rec letters might be a problem. I plan on staying in touch with whoever my AP physics I teacher is next year, for a good rec letter in my majoring area. Same for AP Chem in senior year.

A lot my friends in my class are extremely smart, but it is due to short term memorization, where they cram the night before the test. I try to actually learn something, but i get lower grades than them. They dont seem to actually store information. 

Many of my schools teachers are ass, but apparently colleges dont care...

I can cook stuff, and I have a good relationship with my parents on cooking and chores(not to say that the rest are bad, but these are the heights of my relationships with my parents)

I dont have a facebook, and Im not as tech-savvy as my friends who complain about their Samsung S8 having low resolution while I have an iPhone 5s that used to be my dad's. Dont know if thats a plus or minus

Im not that good at making new friends, but if I meet someone that one of my other friends knows, then Ill get along well. feelsbadman

Either im EXTREMELY organized, or I dont give a shit about organization. I attempt to be a perfectionist at organizing, but if i dont, then i dont even try. (half of my study desk is a landfill while the other half is clean.)


**sidenotes: 

the list of colleges in the title are in the order of my preference.

Also, does anyone know how colleges view grades? I feel like my grades dont display my potential: I can demonstrate mastery of trig ratios snd their relationships wnd whatnot, but my math grade isnt that great.
I would like to know where I stand( I know its a bit early but it helps to take initiative)
I feel like the last 2 are more of safetys because I know they are easier to get in to, but their engineering department isnt as good as those of Berkeley, CalTech, and UCLA


So...
thanks for reading my long summary of my life and please judge me with your best. Be frank and be harsh if possible (Im used to being insulted). Id like to prepare for the worst case scenario. And as mentioned earlier, i am new here, and this being my first post, i dont know what to expect. I really want to get into Berkeley, but I might just be paranoid. Living in a competitive area, alot of people, especially my friends, are better than me (Im maybe top 20%, but thats because some people actually dont know that sin 90 degrees is even after taking trig)
please tell me if i need to lower my expectations.

Also please point out: 
where I stand in my competition
my pros and cons
how I can improve
what makes me different from others
if my goals are too high

Dont forget to chance me, not just to answer the above questions!

Please don't give me the ""you have better chances than me"" stuff. A lot of people will probably say that, but that is only emotionally relieving and doesn't change much in the long run. I guess its kinda motivating... (sorry if I sound cocky, picky, and too demanding. It is completely unintentional, and is not intended to hurt anyone's opinions or emotions. I feel like i can start off fine, but as I continue writing/typing, my tone gets more cocky and demanding.)

Thank you all for your time and consideration. I greatly appreciate all advice and help you all can give. Its time to criticize!!"

Realistically, what are the tradeoffs here?",phat_connall,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6n3j3b/intern_manager_hinted_at_full_time_offer_starting/,"Some background: I'm 26 and haven't gotten my bachelor's yet. I don't do well with the academic process, and have been in and out of school for 8 years now at a prestigious, but Probably Not Truly Elite CS school.

Most recently, I took two years off school after finishing all my required CS work (in 2015), thinking I could just freelance with that info alone (spoilers: didn't work out). Ended up working IT and tutoring to barely get by for a few years. Tried getting a proper coding job off and on, but realized I would never get through HR without the degree.

Came back in the spring, set to graduate spring 2018. However...

I've got an internship at a Most Definitely Truly Elite tech company. Absolutely loving the culture, environment, work, people, location, yadda yadda. My mindset has been that this is probably my one shot, so I've been giving it my absolute all and crushin it. Midpoint review mentioning ""output we'd expect from a full employee who's been here a year or so."" That sort of thing.

Today, I spoke with the intern manager, and asked if they ever would pay for a year of undergrad. Answer was a hard no on that but that ""actually starting full time next month"" was a real possibility.

Putting the cart a fair ways in front of the horse (still got four weeks left), but what ramifications would there be in the future from skipping the degree? I assume initial salary would take a hit, but it feels preferable to start on lower pay now and avoid another year of real poverty living and the debt of a full year of school. Also having &lt;very desirable company to work for&gt; hire me without a bachelor's seems far more noteworthy than ""BsCS, 2.3 GPA, Respected Public University"" in the long run. No idea. 

It's most definitely a short term win in my eyes, but what could this mess up down the road?"

The documents included a ""No Disparagement"" clause, which I guess compliments the NDA I had to sign when they hired me.

They wouldn't tell me right there why they're firing me, though I can make some guesses. The boss told me outright that I was a good employee on the numbers, but felt I didn't have the right personality. (All my work was done in a timely manner, with professionalism and almost always to their liking.) I was either ""too serious"" or ""didn't have a sense of urgency"" depending on the day, according to this person.

Full disclosure and background: I was brought on as an ""intern"" (really Temp-to-Hire) with part-time, self-made scheduling, good pay and no set end date. A few months ago I complained about a fixture in the bathroom being broken and the boss told me first that I was imagining it and then that it *was* right but that I was being rude for harping on it. This was the first time the issue of my ""attitude"" was brought up. 

On Monday I was told that the ""internship"" was winding down and would end on Sept. 1st. (The end date was thrown in retroactively, as I had been led to believe prior to this that I was there indefinitely on an at-will basis.) On Tuesday I was working normally, though I did use time on my break to apply for jobs.

On Wednesday morning my employee email was deleted, and this morning I was given the boot. They said they'd schedule an exit interview for me to happen in two weeks. Meanwhile I need a new job, I'm understandably upset and confused, but I wanna maintain my composure and remain respectful/professional, especially with the aforementioned legal documents in play.

As of right now I haven't said anything publicly (i.e. social media), but I have deleted much of their presence from my feeds and history. I recognize that badmouthing them will do nothing but hurt me (at least in the short term), so I'm pretty sure I'll be the bigger man on that front.

My priority is simply figuring out where I go from here (physically, emotionally, professionally) and how I navigate new applications with this mark on my employment history (not to mention the mystery of their reasoning for terminating me). Maybe sign on to a staffing company? IDK.

TL, DR: Was fired, not told why. Need to know how what I can or can't say during applications and where I should go."

I've been a sysadmin for the last 15 years, but the problem is that I've worked in small business, so while I had some exposure to various technologies, including AD, Exchange, VMware, Linux, networking, storage and so on, the scale and depth wasn't that great - the largest organization I had to work for has about 10 locations with something about 30 physical and around a 100 virtual servers with a couple of smaller SANs (couple of Brocade switches and couple of HP MSA's), some 300 desktops and a couple hundred mobile clients, about a hundred managed switches and hundred WiFi AP's, stuff like that.
So how do I get a job at a bigger corp? Obviously I'm not that young and inexperienced, so I wouldn't fit a very junior role that is usually filled with interns and new grads, but on the other hand I lack the exposure and experience required for more senior roles in a bigger enterprise.

6n6h30,49,2017-07-13,My work is slowly driving me insane and I don't sure what to do,ShouldIVisit,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/6n6h30/my_work_is_slowly_driving_me_insane_and_i_dont/,"I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. I am working far more than full time as a full stack web developer for a web software company on a salary that ends up coming in around minimum wage. 

My boss has limited experience and no formal background with computer science but is certain he knows best on any technical issue. 

* One of the first things he wanted me to do when I came here was to write up a style guide based on industry standards and the existing codebase. He really liked it and stuck to it for a while but as of late has mostly ignored it. He gets mad at me whenever I use any pattern he doesn't, like returning a base case instead of listing it at the end after a bunch of checks that the base case hasn't been reached or using tools built into the language (Becuase he doesn't ""use those anywhere""). Some of these language-specific tools are in the style guide and are standards. Instead, he prefers I rewrite them. Fine, ugly, but something I can deal with. He recently decided he wants to switch over to a more recent syntax I had suggested months ago. 
* The company uses one suite, and all of us within a 10 foot radius. While my coworkers are constantly talking amongst themselves, which of course we can hear and I have no issue with, if I respond to anything, the boss/CEO immediately interjects to remind me to focus. This includes things directly relevant to what I'm working on at the time. 
* He says the code should be written so that someone reading it would think it was his, which he justifies by saying that he's written and is still writing most of the code, which is because I'm working mostly on the backend. It's also because writing ""in his style"" slows me down considerably (More on this later); I am working as many, if not more, hours than him because anything less and he gets upset at how slowly things are moving ahead. 
* When I tell him an implementation is very nonstandard he references that he's been in the particular industry for longer. I signed onto this internship because I have been working with this company throughout the year and we had agreed the pay would be increased for the internship and I thought I had leverage because of a project I was managing to essentially rewrite the codebase on a new platform with new features, while going to classes full time but a few months in, after massive progress and right before my internship became full time, he decided to ""throw out"" some of the work because he didn't think the style was enough like his, then ended up rewriting parts of it, copy and pasting large chunks of the project I managed, which he now takes complete credit for and accuses me of wasting x amount of time and y amount of money.
* During the rebuild, he repeatedly referenced equity if I ""add value"" with that project, which was part of why I didn't look for other intership opportunities while they were still going on. He loves to remind me that the leader of sales (Who I respect a lot) is ""more important to the company"" than me. This is also how he justified why sales is allowed to chat while I'm not. 
* I'm earning less than the outsourced freelancers who I was managing for the rebuild, even though I'm doing full stack work and they were working solely on the front end. I am a college student at one of the handful of top US universities and have interned at multiple companies before in various roles and wanted to get a taste of different kinds of industries. 
* I have since then done several major projects adding substantial features and saved more in infrastructure costs than I earn. At this point, any belief that I am going to receive equity has disappeared, which is a shame, because part of the reason I stayed with this company was originally because I think the product's value is enormous, and having known and respected the CEO before working for him. 
* I would leave, but I love the freedom of living on my own in a city and I am still taking classes which I need to commute to occasionally, although I'm watching the lectures online and the homework submission is digital. Also, summer ends in late September so I only have to do this for a few more months. And, since I have so much responsibility in this company, combined with my previous internships, I will have a lot to put on my resume in looking for work elsewhere in the future. 
* He is absolutely sure that if he does anything, then that is the right way to do it, and if you show that it leads to serious issues and he changes it, he just pretends he never said that.
* He is constantly condescending towards me.
* For the sake of not making a design decision he wouldn't be happy with, since this was the main reason he decided to ""throw out"" and ""rewrite"" the rebuild, I will often present a problem to him, that usually arises from his design style elsewhere and ask which of two design patterns to use. His favorite thing is to just tell me ""Oh, easy, do this"", take over the keyboard, type several lines in his style, then run into the exact problem with that decision that made me ask, which often makes the solution take much longer, and when I describe why the alternative approach may be more maintainable and direct, he tells me to ""just do it this way."" Then, when I finally build it out in the more convoluted but stylistically consistent way, he asks why it took so long. 
* We have a massive function for a simple recursive search that is constantly causing errors and we have to keep fixing to add cases to, which I have put hours into, because rewriting what should be less than 20 lines would take up too much of my time. I tried to write it quickly and, despite nearly having a working function 20 minutes later, after coming over to ""fix"" the noodle version he noticed it and got upset, having told me not to waste my time rewriting it. Pointing out that I've spent substantially more time rewriting it than it would have taken me to rewrite it only made him angrier. 
* Whenever he gives me some direction and his direction fails, he gets annoyed at me because of something that should have been ""obvious."" When I outline some process and he decides to do it his own way or ignoring a step, which fails, he gets mad at me for not including that approach in my directions, even if I can explain what went wrong or why it's impossible immediately. 
* I originally stuck to this time because it gave me a sense of purpose after a hard time in my life, but I am really struggling to keep myself going. 

I know I have screwed myself over in some sense because of my naivety, but I really don't know what to do. It is starting to affect my classes, which, combined with a (locally) cheap rent and primarily cooking for myself, consume everything I earn. I feel like I'm slowly cracking."

6n7502,3,2017-07-14,2nd part degree in cybersecurity or graduate diploma in systems analysis?,Lipstickandbaygon,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6n7502/2nd_part_degree_in_cybersecurity_or_graduate/,"Hi all, Im thinking of moving over to IT because the job prospects seem to be much brighter, especially in cybersecurity! I am currently torn between these two choices. Both choices are at my local national university where i did my undergraduate. 

The cybersecurity degree is a part time degree but I missed the application deadline by 2 weeks (found out about it end june) and have to wait till next year august intake. My original plan was to sit in all the lectures from aug to next year and sit for tests for the first 2 intro to comp sci mods and 1 math mod (since they allow exemption for these 3 mods) and get exempted from them when I apply next year. The program is quite a traditional degree program and I should be able to get exempted from most of the 'extra' university requirements since I did my undergrad there. It looks like quite a rigorious program with lots of focus on systems and mods with security in the name but I'm not sure how competitive it will be to get in. I believe there is also a work study (40hrs?) component in it.

I also just found out there is a Graduate diploma in System analysis which is a full time 1 year diploma meant for graduates switching into IT. Looking at the modules, it seems like there is SQL, full stack, java suite, asp.net, mobile, project management and a 5 month internship as well. It seems highly geared to being as 'work' ready as possible. It starts in Feb 2018 and applications end in Sept. 

So I'm torn in which one I should go for, not to mention I'm not sure how competitive they are since they are kind of under the radar at the moment (i hope) and I screwed up my bachelors with a poor GPA (below 3.0) and graduated in Philosophy. They both cost roughly the same per year but the part time degree runs longer of course. I've been learning web dev (hate it) and python on my own so I'm just a beginner. Any advice will be greatly appreciated!"

I'm a contributing member of the team now, and we've recently got a new intern who will be with us for a year. I understand that when you're new you can expect a very long ramp up time (having recently gone through it myself). However my main issue is that he seems REALLY bad at listening to instructions. 

We have given him multiple step-by-step guides and he's not been capable of following them at all e.g. There will be an instruction ""move A to B"". He will read half of it and then ask where to move A to. Another example is I had asked him to perform this process (again, it had step-by-step instructions, and i was available if he had any questions, i made that clear). The next day I verify he's done it correctly, he hasn't. So I ask him which step he got confused about and he says ""oh I got to this bit then wasn't sure what to do, so I randomly clicked around"".

So far me and our old intern have been the ones training him and giving him work, my line manager has barely interacted with him to see this. I will be speaking to my manager in my usual 1 on 1 with him soon, but is there anything I can/should do?

Thing is, it was not what I wanted to take from the beginning. After high school I wanted to study information technology, computer science, programming and those of the same sorts, because I love computers and are quite good at working with them. Dad's a businessman and he thought it was cooler to do business and tried his best to convince me about a bright future in that field. Well he succeeded.

I never thought about it much in the last 6 years. After college I worked for 18 months before currently taking my master's degree. But not until just recently I got an internship in data engineering at an app development company. I was very lucky to get this job, I can code in statistics programming language, and I study business. For this job they're looking for someone who can help write up programs and provide insights for business decision making. They were willing to take me in despite knowing I would require lots of training cuz I knew nothing about computer systems, I just knew how to code.

And this is my very first exposure to working as a programmer, I first had to learn a few new programming languages, which was an ease. The colleagues here help train me as well. With that knowledge I've been building up a program that does sophisticated customer targeting, and it's been just over a month. I learned how computer works, how to design a complete working system, how to make subsystems communicate with each other, how to run a local server to test my system and everything. Everyday going to work I know I will learn lots of new things about computers and I am sooo eager in the way that I never felt before on any day going to college.

I know how hard and how impractical it is to start all over at this age (24) and pursue what I should have had 6 years ago. But the more I am at this job, the more surreal the prospect is becoming and overwhelming my mind. Maybe if I continue on with this job for a few years, I could get a scholarship somewhere to start new? I would be 30 by the time I finish college (again), that might be quite bad? I really wanna hear some advice. Thanks!"

6n9agb,3,2017-07-14,Lease ended during an ownership transition. Signed new lease but was told I would have to sign a new one. Tenant at will for a month now and worried.,aperssico,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n9agb/lease_ended_during_an_ownership_transition_signed/,"Hi everyone.

I live in Massachusetts. I moved into this apartment complex in 2015 right when it was built. I was one of the first people to move into my building. The apartment management has been pretty flukey and not great since the start, but I've always brushed it off since my apartment is gorgeous, the complex offers nice amenities, and my utilities are consistently unbelievably cheap. 

My lease ended on June 30th. On June 28th, the complex announced that they had been sold to a new management company. I made sure to email the new management, CCing the old management, to let them know that my lease was ending. I am on an affordable unit plan since I was working as an intern when I first moved there... I have since gotten a full time job with great pay but still fall under the ""current tenant income limit"" which is 140% of the new tenant cutoff. I explained that I had all of my paperwork for the income verification ready to drop off and that I was prepared to sign my lease at their earliest convenience. 

After verifying all of my paperwork, they provided me with an online lease on June 29th. I noticed several errors in the lease, but was afraid to wait to sign it since I was already on my final day of my last lease. This happened last year as well, but I was close with the leasing office manager and ended up signing the lease and following it up with a comprehensive email to him regarding any and all corrections. This year, I did the same. I signed the lease, saved a copy of the lease to my computer (pre-signing... I do not have a copy of the signed lease, I'll explain why in a bit) and then emailed them a list of corrections and questions.

I received an email on July 1st that read ""Please stop by office at your earliest convenience. Our apologies, but there is a good chance we will have to have you re-sign the lease due to the change in management. I'm here today until 4:00 and here on Monday from 10-3. Thank you!"" 

I stopped by the leasing office that day around 2 and was told, ""Oh, the lease isn't ready yet. We will contact you when it is."" I emailed them again on July 5th to say, ""Just checking in since I stopped by on Saturday around 2pm and was told that the lease was not ready yet. Do you know when it will be ready for me to re-sign? Also, when will residents regain access to the web portal?""

Now, I should note that everything at my apartment is done via the web portal. After I was told that I would likely need to resign my lease, I tried to sign in to the web portal to try and obtain a copy of the signed lease but found that they had shut it down while they transitioned to a new host. This is why I do not have a copy of the signed lease. 

They responded with ""We will have this out to you as soon as possible! And the resident portal will be back up for 8/1 to be able to pay rent online. Thank you for your patience while we make this transition!"" 

This past Monday, July 10th, I stopped at the leasing office to pick up a package. The woman in the office again reassured me that my lease would be ready to sign soon and that I am ""still within [my] lease"" so I shouldn't be worried. However, if they are in fact considering the lease I signed on June 29th to be null and void, I am not within my lease. 

Should I be worried? Is there a chance that I will somehow be screwed over in this process?

EDIT: I also looked at the updated website for my apartment complex (the website is accessible – the resident web portal is not) and they are listing the affordable units at $1,373 a month, not including pet rent which is an additional $60 per month. The lease that I just signed, which may now be void, was $1,310 including pet rent. Is it possible for them to change the rent on the new lease that I will be signing and do I have any defense for myself to fight it if they do? 

EDIT 2: I also meant to mention that since the web portal is down, the leasing office is asking people to pay via check for July's rent. I have not yet paid, since I am not under a lease and do not know how to approach it. What would be my best plan of action for paying this month's rent? "

Now I have been offered a position as a junior information security analyst as well as another position as a junior web developer for the same salary. I got into development/tech after learning about information security, penetration testing, exploits etc. My goal is to be good at penetration testing and exploit development as well as develop custom software within the information security domain. I will definitely need to be able to build REST api's to achieve these goals. I feel like the junior programmer role would be a great opportunity to learn API development on the job while the information security role is more about development operations. In addition, I feel like you need to be good with low-level kernel type of programming to be a good exploit developer and the programming route would be a better path to learn those skills. However, penetration testing requires you to be good with operations and admin stuff. Web application penetration testing is also a thing. I feel pretty confident in being able to google my way through most admin operations but I feel as though I would miss out on 'real world' infosec skills by taking the programming job. Either way, I feel that I can make it to a penetration testing job in the same amount of time by pursuing certifications on the side. However, I am also going to school on the side and want to maximize on the job learning. Which path do you see as being better? At this moment, should I focus on being a good infosec analyst or a good web developer?"

I've struggled mentally for 6 month with no direction unemployed and no motivation to apply to any jobs(I have no plans of going for engineering). I decided to get myself up by at least working part time job somewhere else to get my head together while paying off student loan monthly so I've been working as sales associate for 6 month in retail store until now. 

I've been thinking about going for programming career as I'm interested in the idea of having control over what you create and being able to make anything using programming language.
I've started taking cs50 from online edx and about to move on to week 1 which I believe will start with the c language. 

My questions are

1. So it's been a whole year since my graduation and I didn't really have any specialized full time career other than part time jobs and as it'll take time before I start applying for cs jobs as I need to study and work on portfolios. So will not having career for 1 year or so after graduating hurt my chance of getting a good job? 

2. I really don't think employers will like the fact that I struggled with depression and didn't apply to any jobs for 6 months after graduation. Do you think it's a bad idea to make up stories like ""I went back to my country for 6 month""?

3. I've been hearing lots of good things about this course that I thought it'd be good idea to start taking the class. Can you please give me advice of what I could do on the side while taking the course or what to take after I finish the course? 

thank you "

I had an intern in development that was more interested in pleasing management than doing development.  He was a real ass-kisser and liked volunteering development into doing things.  Needless to say, when intern asked for a job, I moved heaven and Earth to block his employment chances.

This was his last volunteering story.  We had a client that wants an ecommerce site.  No big deal. They also want Fed ex shipping.  Again, no big deal.  These can be handled via standard plugins.  

Client now wants the CMS to store FedEx tracking codes to orders and email shipping updates to the orders.  Ok, problem.

Intern volunteers ""no problem!  This should be easy!"".  He sees FedEx has an api and states that was the ""hard part"".   

I rubbed my forehead and said ""no, that's the easy part.  How will you relate tracking numbers to orders?  Who is going to write the plug-in to write these database row?  How often will we be polling fed exs servers for shipping updates?  Who is going to develop the front end and back end interface for this?""

He didn't understand and kept saying the API was the ""hard part"" and the rest will be easy.  The senior developer finally shut intern up saying ""listen to Dev, he's right"""

Ideally, I would love to work for Microsoft, not as a engineer researcher, but rather as someone who studies the effects that Virtual Reality, and other technologies have on people and society. I am really into computer technology and where it's heading.

I didn't intern at all in school (instead I was a server at chili's), so I know I'll have to begin as an intern. I'm just worried about two things:

1. Does it matter where I intern at, or with what company? Will it effect what researching companies will want to hire me in the future?

2. Since my degree is Sociology, I know that I can't do any clinical research either. So, What career paths are there for me? What should I look into? How did you get into becoming a researcher?

*It's more difficult than it should be to find (via googling) job titles that I can apply to, or anything other than engineering/science and clinical research.

This post is open to anyone, but of course anyone who has researching experience, majoring in research, or is currently or previously a researcher (of any kind) is STRONGLY encouraged to leave me a response, I could definitely use some help with this. Thank you.

My background:

I graduated from undergrad with a Bachelors in Psychology, and then went on to complete a Masters of Education in Counseling and Personnel Services with a concentration in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. During my internship while in graduate school I provided outpatient therapy to adults, and after graduating I was hired for a job providing school-based therapy to children. I graduated with my M.Ed. in August 2016 and started my current position in late September. I have been really unhappy in this job, even after only a couple months into it. If I am honest, I had a lot of doubts throughout my graduate program and my internship about if this was the right fit, but didn't listen to those doubts and kept on with my program.

I think that a transition into human resources or something similar could possibly be a good fit, but I am not sure how to make that transition. I am also open to other alternatives as well.

In the past few months I have applied for a lot of jobs, ranging from community outreach type positions, entry level HR positions, and administrative assistant positions. I have heard nothing back from the majority of these jobs, and have gotten rejection e-mails from a handful. I know that likely the main problem is that my resume is entirely related to counseling/therapy, because that is what my education and experience is in, with the exception of a retail job I had during grad school. How can I make my resume more appealing? Should I remove the content related to research projects and awards I received during college?

I am willing to complete online certifications if that would be helpful. However, I have a lot of student loan debt from my Masters degree, so going back to school doesn't really feel like a good option.

I just feel completely stuck and kind of hopeless. I would really appreciate any guidance that you may have."

(U.S.)",academiahelpaway,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/6nbdhu/advice_accepted_phd_program_offer_in_april_recent/,"Thank you all for your time and professional perspectives in advance. I wholeheartedly appreciate the community here.

***Resume Background***
As an undergrad I worked in a strong lab for two years, managed to get a sole authored paper out (forthcoming) and am finishing a co-authored paper (I'm first author) with my advisor. I completed a summer training internship at a prominent research center in my field. Applying for funding, jobs, and graduate school, I earned funding support from two national agencies for my research potential.

Got into grad school at a few places, two of which are relevant here. Accepted offer from the strongest program (relatively, for my areas), will be starting in the Fall. Turned down an offer from a similar ranked program near my home town (still a solid choice). 


***Today***
Today my father (only parent, mother was never around) and I were informed that his previously non-aggressive form of cancer has expanded rapidly, leaving him (most likely) with somewhere between 1-2 years to live. Clearly if I had known this in April I would have gone with the program near home. 

***Options*** A key prior: My father would be very upset with me doing nothing for a year, and doesn't under any circumstances want to sit at home and care for him. He will not allow this. Even so, I've contacted both of my external funding sources today and both are fine with postponing their guaranteed support for family medical situations, so **1.** I do have the option of not attending school for a year.

**2.** I can do nothing, head to my current offer (away from home) and try to transfer to home next application cycle. I would be up front about this with the program.

**3.** I have no idea how possible this is, but theoretically I could contact the graduate director, chair, and dean of the program here at home again and try to get admitted and start this Fall. This is FAR past April and budget submission dates for departments, though....

**4.** I can see about a relevant research job at the nearby school and/or accompany industry firms nearby and apply for Fall 2018 admission.

**5. ?**

What can I do here? Thank you.

AlasConnect is a subsidiary of Matanuska Telephone Association, a telecommunications company which services part of southern Alaska. AlasConnect itself is a Managed Service Provider (generally Microsoft) and has clients throughout the Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Palmer areas.

I run a small team of developers which supports and writes software for both companies. The MTA side has a bit of C#/.NET and is fairly enterprise-y, although various new projects are being written in Haskell. On the AC side we are slowly gearing up to be a 100% Haskell using consulting/software development shop.

C#/.NET experience would be nice, but it's not a hard requirement. Just so there aren't any surprises, there's a chance you may be asked to help support some existing systems written in it. Given a long enough timeline we'll make Enterprise Haskell a thing though.

Answers to questions that I've typically seen come up in job posts:

* No remote, onsite only.
* No internships. This is a mid-career position, so a few years of practical software engineering experience is required.
* We are not in a position to sponsor visas, and therefore can only consider people authorized to work in the US.

How screwed am I?,csmiserableintern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ncmae/im_graduating_next_year_and_i_think_i_chose_the/,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account.....I am a rising senior majoring in computer science. I've had two summers of software developer internships (I am at my second this summer) and honestly, I think I chose the wrong major. It's so depressing. I sometimes shed some tears during work when I am alone or when I drive back to home because of how depressing it is for me. I always feel stuck and needing guidance for my intern work. I don't know what to do. I am so sad. I cannot take starring at a text editor for this long any longer. The thought of programming 6-8 hours a day terrifies and demoralizes me. I am also always asking for help during work. It makes me embarrassed when I always keep asking because they are all probably looking down on me and thinking ""this kid doesn't know anything."" I browse this sub-reddit and everyone here is like a rockstar. They talk about grinding out Leetcode problems, finding the most optimal solutions, always building side-projects, etc...I'm not like that. I hate crancking Leetcode. I code in my free time occasionally when I am bored but I like to spend my free time with my family and doing other hobbies such as gardening, running and hiking. Once I finish my internship work for the day, I just want to do those and relax. But it appears I have to be building side-projects during that time so I can stay up to date with the latest technologies. It is so discouraging and depressing. I don't know how I will ever pass an intense technical interview. My internship interviews were basic OOP questions and questions on specific languages (e.g. JavaScript) and previous work experience. They were not like the scary whiteboarding questions I always keep hearing here. How screwed am I? If I change majors, I would probably have to spend another 2-3 years at university to graduate. However I do not think that is a good choice to do. I was thinking about just grinding out the last year of school and try to get ANY software job that I can get for 2-3 years just for the experience and then pursue an MBA because I like the business side of technology much MUCH better. I enjoy reading books and listening to podcasts on it, and I try to pop-in on those meetings when they happen during work. Is this a better alternative? Will an MBA open doors for me? When I researched on this sub, many people said that the people on the management side are usually senior developers who transitioned over and have years and years of experience. I am looking for any advice possible or anyone who has a similar experience or knows someone who does. I hope I didn't waste my undergraduate years. Thank you very much for your time and support."

As well, if anyone has specific questions about how to portray *X*, *Y*, or *Z* then I am totally willing to give my advice.
Without further ado, here is the list:

1.	Study, get tutoring, do whatever it takes to get a perfect PSAT score (in 11th grade) and ACT or SAT score on your first try, whenever you decide to take it.
2.	Do not waste your breaks! Either take online courses through services like CTY or SUMAC, attend college courses in person, do summer enrichment programs (Like COSMOS, Yale Young Global Scholars, or Research Science Institute), or get internships related to your desired area of study.
3.	Try to found and lead as many clubs/organizations as possible. If some of these double as service work, that is even better. They do not have to be related to your expected area of study, but do be consistent and stay in your clubs for as long as possible to show your passion for them. 
4.	If you are not an excellent writer, use a third-party service to help with the brainstorming, structuring, and implementing of your essays. Plenty of extremely intelligent applicants get screwed over in the college process because they couldn’t express themselves well.
5.	Do whatever it takes to get an A in every single class you take. However, in at least two classes Junior year, go above and beyond getting an A; try to make a strong impression on your teachers that you are extremely easy to work with, extremely intelligent, extremely passionate about the subject, etc. This will be vital in receiving strong letters of recommendation.
6.	Take, at the very minimum, three AP classes per year (if your school has those offerings); try to minimize your number of unweighted classes.
7.	Show passion and success in more than one area. These can be non-academic, for example being on the #1 team in the state for basketball, winning an international art competition, etc. Things that seem impressive to the regular person, such as winning a schoolwide competition, or being a third degree black-belt, or being the leader of varsity team for multiple years, are not nearly enough to stand out. 
8.	There are Olympiads for pretty much every STEM subject out there. Prepare, take them, and do well! Many schools offers math competitions like the AMC, CAML, NIMO, etc. which, if you do well on them, allow you to advance to the competitions that will stand out in your application. For other tests, like F=ma, ARML, the chemistry or programming Olympiad exams, etc., you will have to coordinate on your own outside of school; but, if you excel in a non-math STEM subject, this is the way to show to a college that you really stand out.
9.	Get an interview at every single school, and know beforehand why you like the school and what type of students the school is looking for. Interview practice is helpful but not necessary if you are confident you can show up as nice, respectful, passionate, and intelligent among whatever other attributes that the specific college expects out of students (for example, Brown would want you to show social activism, UChicago wants you to show a deep love for learning, MIT wants you to show nerdiness, etc.).
10.	Take as many SAT Subject tests as you have competency for, but don’t take a test if you think you will get below 800 on it (study as necessary). Going into STEM you need to take at the very least the Math II exam and a science exam, but the more you take, the more competency you show.

That's it! I hope that this is interesting and useful to some of the rising sophomores/juniors/seniors out there; good luck!

6nf8mh,2,2017-07-15,Panic attacks while driving: Should I cancel my internship?,violescentcrescent,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6nf8mh/panic_attacks_while_driving_should_i_cancel_my/,"Okay  this might be long. 

**Backstory**: At the beginning of the year I fucked up my back without noticing which led to me driving on the freeway and suddenly being unable to breathe and calling an ambulance. Nobody knew what was wrong and first suspicions were that my lungs or my heart might be fucked up. I stayed in the hospital for a night, they found nothing, I was released. Only because of the tip of a nurse I got my back checked out and it turned out that one my ribs was pushed in and obstructing my lungs and my heart doing their work. It was really scary because I sometimes couldn't even feel my heart beating. 
I didn't return to uni because there was only a month of the semester left and I felt awful and wanted to stay with my family and then my grandfather, who I was really close to, was dying. So as you can see I didn't have the best months from a mental standpoint. I also had some bad depressive episodes in the past but not so bad that I felt like I couldn't pull through and get better (and I always felt a bit better again). 
I decided to take off the next semester from uni and managed to land an internship to at least do something while I was at home. I tried to go to therapy when I realized that I still had some small issues breathing while driving but everyone was booked. So I thought I'll postpone it until fall. I tried actively to get better, taking things for my lack of vitamin D and magnesium and getting up at a regular hour each day even though I didn't need to because I know things like a sleep schedule etc. are essential to mood disorders and other things. I felt really good in May after having a stressful April where I almost couldn't eat. I still lost 20 pounds though and don't want this to continue, either. It's not an eating disorder per se but linked to the stress I feel even though no one in my life is putting me under any kind of pressure at all.

**Now for the part I need some advice for**:
I started my internship this week and I love it. It's what I wanted, I feel skilled to do the job, it pays well and is only 20 hours a week so I only work 3 days and they are very flexible with which days I want to work. I like everyone there even though I'm a person who struggles to build friendships or generally relationships in real life. While working there I felt no anxiety or stress, I felt like I imagine people who are completely mentally healthy feel and after months of feeling worthless and insecure about my future I was even excited about my future life again. 
When I was driving home from work, though, (a very busy 4-lane freeway in the rush hour) I completely chocked and my breathing rhythm fucked up again. It's like my body is in panic so it forgets how to breathe so I have to breathe ""manually"". But this breathing is too fast so my heart starts beating like hell and my body goes into full on panic mode. I got off the next exit and had to calm myself down and thought I might be able to continue but I had a full on sobbing mess meltdown because I was scared of this happening again. I had to call my mom and sister to come get me and even though they love me and told me it's no big deal I feel like an incapable human being. So now I'm at home and have to return to work either Tuesday or Wednesday. And I have no clue what I should do. The option to take a train or bus is not possible either because I realized this fear is not linked to driving. I always loved driving and if I just drive into the city or for half an hour or so I'm absolutely fine. But the fear is basically linked to me being on my own (if I drive with someone next to me, I'm fine) in a confined space where I'm kind of trapped. A similar thing happened to me on a train and I got scared because I thought that I couldn't just stop and get off whenever I wanted. With a car I have more freedom regarding that but I'm kind of afraid I'll just pass out and crash on the freeway so that's out. I just have no clue what to do so I need an outsider perspective. I was always kind of a nervous person, sure, like when you got an interview or have to give a speech but this kind of terror I experience is new and I'd rather take a day of my gloomy depressive episode where I don't feel anything than feeling like my body constantly tells me that I'm just going to die. 

The thing is that I don't know what to do now. I could end my internship and maybe even come back there next year and actively try getting therapy again or try medication or whatever and hang out at home for another few months (which wasn't bad for my mental health because I found two new hobbies and kept busy and my family supports me 100%) or I could try just driving there again and maybe the same thing happening (or happening even more likely this time because the fear is still fresh now) or find some other way to get there (have someone drive and get me every day which would be a huge hassle and make me feel guilty as fuck). 
The thing is that I have no idea what is the right thing to do here. I'm always torn between: ""Hey, things are tough but you can do this, just keep pulling through."" and ""Hey, you had a really bad year and a lot of traumatic shit happening to you in the past that you probably also didn't really work out and it's time to step back and realize that you need to do something for your mental health and everything else is second.""
The internship would be 3 months and as I said only 3 days a week so it doesn't sound that much but I'm afraid that maybe I'm too proud to admit defeat because getting this internship is the best thing happening to me in a while and I can already feel the pity from family and friends when I have to quit. I was talking about it for months and it also eased the anxiety I had about not finding a good job after university but I don't know if this is worth it. The thought of calling them and trying to think of what to tell them makes me sick, though because everyone there is really nice and I feel as if I took away someone else's spot and let them down. On the other hand I'm not really eating regularly and the stress about thinking about the driving situation doesn't make the 4 days off I have that relaxing, either. 
Sorry for the wall of text, I needed to get this off my chest and also still can't believe that I regressed so much as an independent person that this is my life now.

**TL;DR**: I have an internship I love but can't get there on my own because my mental health is fucked. 

Please tell me what you would do in my situation or maybe even how you dealth with a similar situation in the past. "

Since it's a 6 month internship, I'm dreading having to go to work for the next 5 months. I have no idea what I'm doing and my boss and the other engineers look at me like I'm stupid ( I most likely am). It took me over a week to set up my laptop since no one wanted to help me and the company resource pages were flat out wrong in its instructions.

I'm still working on  my first project which my manager said should not have taken more than a week despite not having any experience at all working with APIs, GUIs, or Windows programming. I am completely lost and every time I ask for help, I get told to look it up and figure it out since I'm supposed to be smart. I've asked if there were any documentation on the files I'm working with and told no and just figure it out. The only solution I've come up with would have me reverse engineer the unknown unmanaged dll's I'm working with from assembly which , needless to say, is waaaaaay over my head. Like I said, I'm probably dumb and there's a simple solution but I can't figure it out.

I seriously want to quit but also need the money to pay for tuition and it'll look bad for the university if I quit. I am so stressed out where it's affecting my health (lost 10 pounds since I started). Should I stick it out and pray it gets better or just pull the plug for my own sanity?"
6nh0oy,1,2017-07-15,"Go for the internship, or go for research?",xSonicPenguin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6nh0oy/go_for_the_internship_or_go_for_research/,"I'm a student at a mid range (50ish) ranked CS university. I'm aiming to go for a Master's after I graduate, and not at the current university I'm attending. I'm a first-year student, but through AP Credits and the Summer Semester I'm doing, I am at a Sophomore standing (I can graduate in 3 years if I needed to).

My question is, what should I be doing the next summer? If my goal were to try and get a Master's, what should my priority try to be, to get undergraduate research, or work as an intern?

I didn't get it, but I'd be interested in reapplying for an internship or full-time position in the spring.  I got pretty far in the process all the way to the recruiter calling me back after the technical interviews to confirm availability and compensation.  I got a rejection email a few days later.  The recruiter was kind enough to give me some feedback when I asked and here's what I got:

&gt;""Unfortunately, I can't dive into too much feedback, but I will share that the group thought that you came across as very well prepared. You had no issues solving [one of the technical questions] and did well with implementing [another technical question].

&gt;It really came down to another student that have very strong CS fundamentals, projects and overall communication.""

Does this mean I wasn't as good as someone else on the technical questions, or they thought I did well enough but decided to go with a better ""culture fit"" with more experience?  Are my problems severe and they're letting me down easy?  I'm just trying to see what I should focus on improving before I reapply.  I'm especially curious what is meant by ""CS fundamentals"".  Does this mean I need to review CS101 terminology or start learning more frameworks and technology?

I don't have strong independent projects so I'm pretty aware of what that means."

My biggest concerns are: 
     Does the power supply provide enough power for the entire computer?
     Would it be a better decision to get a standalone CPU cooler as opposed to the integrated cooling case I chose?
     Memory, storage, SSD, good or bad choices?

  My goal with this build is to be able to play any game on steam at maximum graphics settings, and any new games that might come out in the next few years. My goal is not to spend the absolute most amount of money, so if you can simplify components that don't affect the output performance, I'd appreciate it. I am a complete noob at building PCs, however, I am interested at Overclocking in order to increase performance even further, which is why I went with the i7 7700k processor and the integrated cooling case.

I'm still researching 4k monitors, so if you have any suggestions on monitors those would be appreciated as well."

In theory its really nice but actually I hate it so much that I don't want to be stuck there at all,What I hate: 

1- The company is putting the entire load on interns and it lacks seniority, in my team I have 3 interns 1 Soft Eng. me and my team leader ... in other teams just 2 inters 1 Soft Eng and the team leader and so on (not sure if this is normal or not so please enlighten me) (PS: they barely pay for interns)

2- Lack of professionalism, in my interview I was elected to work with team A ... when I received my job offer it was with a different team (B) and when I arrived on my first day... without apologizing to me I get moved to team C !! 

3-Favoritism, my classmate started 1 week before me ... (should mention that he is first in class though) he gets trained on totally different (much more cool stuff) a more flexible schedule and he gets paid around 40% higher than me even though we both have the same position in the company and he got promised by his team leader to get a promotion in a year + a raise after probation.

So these reasons are making me hate my first ever job even though I do like working with my team and I feel like I would get a great experience but I feel like I would be a fool to sign such a contract. 

Grateful to any tip on how to deal with a similar situation.

6nizhr,14,2017-07-15,When you get those weird vibes...,shakespearestark,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6nizhr/when_you_get_those_weird_vibes/,"The year was 1991. My mom and her best friend, who for the sake of her privacy we'll call Annie, had just graduated from university. They met in their freshman Chemistry class, joined the same sorority, volunteered at the same soup kitchen for four years, and my mom had recently even been a bridesmaid in Annie's wedding. It was only natural they decided to apply for jobs at a call center about three miles north of the college town they'd been living in. It was soon becoming their new hometown too. My mom said the first year after graduation, life was pretty simple. Her and Annie would carpool to work, at the time my mom was still single yet she never felt that stab of jealousy about her best friend being married. In fact...it was often the opposite. Every morning of their drive to work, my mom was filled in with some story of what Annie's asshole husband was up to. Whether he was a slob, a drunk, a potential womanizer, my mom heard it all. 

It wasn't too surprising that a year later, Annie was filing for divorce. Sleeping on my mom's couch the first couple weeks, and then moving out in a rush to a crappy apartment that mostly housed loud college students. Annie was miserable after that point, showing up to work late, hungover, tired. My mom didn't know what to do for her and even the boss was starting to hint that Annie wouldn't be there much longer. 

That was when Peter showed up. New to the call center. Charming, super good looking. About ten years older than my mom and Annie, but an alum of their university. Annie was super quick to chat up Peter and offer to be his guide at work. He took all of his lunch and smoke breaks with them soon. My mom tells me she didn't mind at first, but after a while, she began to realize how narcissistic and arrogant Peter was. Every conversation revolved around him. He was always quick to point out if Annie's makeup was caked, if her eyes were bloodshot, her hair frizzy, but Annie would laugh it off and take it as helpful. My mom thought he was a little too blunt about things. He seemed to find stuff that was wrong to point out, and always use it as a way to look like a good friend. After a while, his advice was telling Annie to lose weight, for my mom to wear more makeup if she wanted to find a man. All the while, he was bringing salads to work and saying how he was in such great shape for his age, how he couldn't get even the female boss to stop flirting with him...

My mom got sick of hanging around Peter. She found other friends at work. She said for the next couple of months, Annie didn't even care if my mom took lunch at a different table. She tried to catch Annie outside of work, but Annie would be going out with Peter. They mostly hung around bars, Annie was trying to be sort of careful to not go too fast considering her divorce wasn't final yet. But it was obvious that the workplace romance was brewing. 

It was close to Christmas time when Peter got fired. Seemingly out of the blue. My mom found out when she came into work and Peter's cubicle was cleaned. Annie was shocked too. They boldly asked their boss where he was or what had happened. The boss was super cold and said for them not to concern themselves and to concentrate on doing their jobs better, because performance reviews were coming up. Clearly Peter had been fired before them. My mom was somewhat relieved while Annie was super annoyed. Annie later relayed to my mom that she'd called Peter and he had told her he'd actually quit. My mom didn't buy the story. She flirted with one of the interns in the HR department to get the scoop that Peter had been terminated rather than handing in a resignation.

That didn't stop Annie from seeing him, it just had to be strictly outside of work. Right after New Year's, Annie called my mom to announce that Peter had FINALLY asked her on a proper date. My mom did Annie's makeup and hair that night. Annie was wearing a tight blue cocktail dress, they'd made plans to eat at a nice Italian place.

Around 2 AM, my mom gets woken up from a phone call from Annie. Annie says she's calling from a payphone at a gas station, two blocks down from the Italian place. She seems fine, but she says that she had Peter drop her off here and needs a ride. My mom throws on proper clothing and hurries to the gas station. Annie hops in, her heels are broken.

Annie assures my mom nothing horrible happened. The heels broke as they were trying to climb up ridiculously steep marble stairs to the top floor of the restaurant. The dinner was fine, except for Peter remarking that Annie could perhaps ""slow down"" with eating pasta, suggesting she eat some greens, telling her that they'd be drinking only water because wine could ""bloat her."" Annie had finally had enough at that point. The red flags were finally flying around her. The final moment came when the waitress had slightly bent over their table to grab their check and Peter lightly tapped her butt. The waitress had immediately grabbed a manager, who came to ask them to leave the restaurant. 

Annie knew she wanted to go home, but Peter was acting as if nothing had happened. He suggested a little walk around their alma mater. Even with her broken heels. Annie said sure, as she was hoping the walk would help him sober up as he'd enjoyed a couple glasses of wine for himself. When he'd sober up, she'd have him drive her straight to a public place as she didn't want him to know where she lived. All of the great vibes she'd had around him before had completely evaporated. Now she was feeling cold and slimy in his presence. When he was trying to hold her hand on their walk around the college, Annie said it felt as if spiders were crawling up her arm. She was so repulsed by his touch it made her even feel physically sick. 

Their walk took them to the front of the Chemistry building, Annie was trying to tell him a story about meeting my mom there, but he was fixated on something else. In a window on the second floor, a young, blonde woman was sitting at a table facing the window, glancing down at either a notebook or textbook. Peter was staring at this girl as if she was an angel delivering a message from heaven. Annie called his name six times before he finally broke his gaze and stared at her dumbfound. She asked him if he could take her home. Down the road, she told him to pull over, drop her off, and to please go on home by himself. He didn't even argue, he grinned and told her to have a pleasant rest of the night. 

My mom rolled her eyes and remarked how completely bizarre Peter was, he was always a freak, etc. Annie laughed it off and said she'd stay single for a while and it was decent timing that Peter didn't work at the call center anyway.

Two days later, Annie and my mom are clocking in at work when their boss hurries up to them, clutching a newspaper under her arms. Their boss asks them if they've heard the news. What news? Well, a Chemistry professor at the university was found dead in one of the labs. The professor had come into her office late and at one point went into a lab on the second floor of the building. At one point, someone else comes in then strangles her. The police have closed the university for the rest of the week pending the investigation. 

Annie ran into the bathroom to throw up. My mom helps her clean up. They get the rest of the day off from work so my mom can drive Annie to the police station to give them a witness statement. But the odd thing is, Peter is brought in and questioned, DNA samples taken, and they can't find a match. Peter seemingly has an alibi. But get this. The professor was  strangled between 10-11 PM per forensics. Annie insists Peter dropped her off at the gas station at 10. But who checks out Peter's alibi? An off-duty police officer who swears he met up with Peter at 10 to grab some drinks, some old buddies going to catch up after Peter's ""disastrous"" date. 

Peter's never charged, never arrested. The waitress at the Italian place? Beautiful, college student Hayley Martin. She goes missing three weeks after the murder of the professor. Annie also gets sick after seeing that girl's photo on the front page of the newspaper. Martin is never found.

Annie quits her job at the call center. Moves back to her hometown a good 150 miles away. She says she wants to recuperate more after the divorce. My mom speculates she really wants to wash her hands clean of Peter, and maybe the professor, and Hayley Martin...

It's speculation though. Annie was just having a rough time post-divorce..."

**Q1**) When should I apply?

**Q2**) In no specific order, I can take 3 courses in 2 semesters and 4 in one semester. I decided not to rush and take my time to prepare for interviews. (Fall '17, Spring '18 and Fall '18)
Should I take least course possible (3courses) for next semester to fully prepare for technical interviews (Algo &amp; DS &amp; LeetCode &amp; Discrete Math)?

**Q3**) I've been just solely solving leetcode problems daily but additionally I'm planning to:

1. Implement every ""popular"" data structures &amp; algorithms, such as AVL trees, fibonacci search, etc.

2. Solve more than 300 leetcode problems and go over them more than once.

3. Skim through CLRS &amp; Cracking the Coding Interview.

4. Go over java fundamentals, from how JDK and JRE works to how it compares to C++, etc.

5. Build a side project, though will not be my main focus.

The most common use case for Udacity is a very educated CS major who works as a developer already but wants to learn more about Machine Learning or self driving cars. 

To my knowledge there are literally a handful of that 5000 that solely learned from Udacity and got jobs as developers. This is worse than the worst bootcamps I've seen and really astounds me.

-The position's salary range is around 45-120k per annum (which is huge, I know)
-I'll be on a work visa (so I'll be relocating to the US)
-I was offered approximately 78k

-I received a visa letter before my official offer which stated I'd be payed about 82k (which I was happy about).  However the visa office had estimated this figure before HR had calculated my salary at 78k, so when I received my official offer a few days after the visa letter, the figure was lower than I expected.

11-12: Git pull, Build, code reviews

12-1: Lunch

1-15: Get a drink from kitchen, check news, stock markets etc

115-6ish: Mostly Coding, Code Reviews, Testing. Usually take a coffee break from 3-315. Meetings, 1-on-1's happen sometimes.



The above is my rough schedule. If I am nearing a deadline, it is usually more tight, and I might end up working a few hours in the night between 10-1 (my most productive).

How is your schedule?. Please indicate the type of company and the area you work at.

I also work at a venture funded startup (Seattle) where the management is relatively laid back. I am especially curious how the work pressure is at big tech companies, for example I have a friend at AMZN Seattle and he tells me it is a lot crazier for them (oncall, lots of meetings, mentoring interns etc, recruiting etc).

Is it too late for me to learn programming and get a job in this field? I would be fine with something in logistics (like transportation optimization) or some sort of finance related programming job too.

I started learning python a little bit, and I can only do a couple things like guessing games and fibonacci but I really like it so far. Do you think it would be worth drastically changing my career path, or is it too late at this point.

I can take a couple computer science classes my senior year (I've never taken any before). If I took an extra year of school, I could probably graduate with a minor in it. Do you guys think it would be worth doing that?

Thanks a lot for any help/advice you can offer me. Also is python the right way to go about doing this right now? And what are some good resources for learning it, I've just been using practicepython.com"

Where To Start?,Cbrum11,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6nws28/mechanical_engineer_grad_interested_in/,"Recent ME Graduate here trying to narrow down the next step.  I had an internship with a large fortune 500 company, and although I respected the work they did, I did not find the large, slow moving company life very attractive.  As a mechanical, they put me in the electrical department... and I DID really enjoy learning about the electrical side of things.

This then moved into my senior project, and I was fortunate enough to do some coding (Arduino's, Node-Red, ESP8266, MQTT) type stuff.  I REALLY enjoyed that.  Specifically the data transfer stuff (MQTT)... it felt like magic.  I'm glad I have the basic mechanical background, but unfortunately everything I'm interested in seems to have a large coding/electromechanical/software component attached to it. 

 At the current time, my knowledge base simply isn't there (not to mention the experience in those areas that companies look for on a resume).

My main areas of interest are micro-controllers and coding, actual manufacturing of physical things (I find the combination of hands on and computer aided design of CNC work really fulfilling), and machine learning/data science.

I'm looking for some guidance on ways to land entry level data science/machine learning/software/micro-controller jobs with a ME degree (or programs/ways to become more knowledgeable in these skill-sets and eventually land a job).  I'm also looking for advice on searching for any jobs that may combine the above mentioned skill-sets in interesting ways... as I do still enjoy the mechanical field.  Grad school is also not out of the picture (but I'm pretty school'd out at the moment).

Any and all opinions are welcome, and thanks in advance!"

I'm an administrative assistant caught in a rock and a hard place as offices go leaner. I'm used to *supporting* an office manager but more in the end stages of a task and more I see the duties I associate with that role requested of ""administrative assistants""/office assistants/operations assistants.

I actually enjoy office administration but there are certain things I've never helped out with in my experience - planning an event (e.g., according to goals of an event, following a schedule of set-up/payment of vendors, and generating feedback); onboarding new employees (so, those HR duties); or accounting duties (accounts receivables, creating expense reports, analyzing budgets); entertaining a client (.e.g, of a cloud service); ""key performance indicators"" as it relates to client goals; creating a presentation showing visualized data (and of course, that looks professional enough for a CEO or director). 

I realize something like the proprietary software will vary from office to office but I don't feel confident interviewing or doing even the temp roles I have in front of me, having never seen these fundamental parts of running an office or observed the flow of competing these tasks from start to finish.

I could ""intern"" for a week or two for you if necessary and actually provide office support (as is my background - cleaning up meeting areas, greeting guests, managing phone calls, shipping packages, setting up and breaking down meeting spaces), just to see how you go about fulfilling your duties. 

I know this is a strange request but I'm out of the age range for conventional internships offered to college students and in my duties as an administrative volunteer, there weren't any opportunities to learn many fundamental aspects of operations, and it's without a given that person that's new to these things simply wont' get hired. There's no ""training""; the office manager might be the only conventional administrative player in a start-up of 50 people.

Obviously, if this sounds reasonable to an office manager or EA that desperately needs actual support, I'm here for hire as well, even on a temp or (technically) ""intern"" basis. I have Salesforce and Excel experience, I have customer and front desk experience, I'm used to generation and submitting end-of-business reports after payment reconciliation, and I'm a conscientious member of a team. 

An interviewer recently asked what I'd be willing to take on within an administrative role, so long as I was trained to create, say, a technical presentation in software new to me - the answer is, anything. My job is the make the lives of my supervisor easier. 

Any help would be appreciated; feel free to message me privately."
6o28xz,1,2017-07-18,"In Junior year of high school, started out as an intern at a small startup (~2 years); beginning of summer, transitioned into a full position -- but it's unpaid and I'm the only developer on the team. Need some guidance.",ericblobb,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/6o28xz/in_junior_year_of_high_school_started_out_as_an/,"I had some personal projects under my belt, on my GitHub etc., and so I applied to a bunch of startups on AngelList around February of this year. This one startup actually replied, and after a bunch of interviews, they accepted me for an intern position. I basically just fixed bugs on both the back-end and front-end, and implemented small new features.

Summer rolls around and I want to keep working at the startup. They like what I've done and so I get tasked with implementing the next version of their app. I'm basically a full time developer at this point, but since the startup's making very little money, no one's getting paid, including the CEO.

My experience in actual web development is very limited though, and that's whats scaring me. The developer who implemented the initial version of the app left for some other startup, but he's available for help through email. It's just that email is super slow and sometimes he doesn't get back very fast.

I really don't want to fuck this up. If I really think about it, the stuff that I'm tasked with isn't really that difficult from a programming perspective. It's just that my code is going to run on a product used by thousands at this point. I only know the very basics of TDD, and know next to nothing about any of the other important aspects of writing production-ready code.

It would be awesome if any of you veterans or just people with experience in startups etc. could give some advice. Perhaps point me to some good resources? I have a subscription to Treehouse which I plan to use actively to learn about a bunch of stuff. The startup uses Django for the back-end, and jQuery and SCSS for the front-end.

Thanks."

I am going into my senior year, and have been pre-med my whole career. That said, I have always been business minded, and think I could make a bigger difference in the world by working with a non-profit/starting a company. 

Major: Biology B.S, minors in political science and business. Went to a decent state school. 

GPA: 3.9
GMAT: haven't taken yet.
Race: Indian-American (was born in the U.S ) 
Sex: M

Work experience: Was a Biology tutor/teaching aid for two years. Had a paid internship at a hospital for a summer where I worked with doctors in several different fields. I also have done hundreds of hours shadowing doctors. (I know nothing business related really)

Extracurriculars: I worked with a global vaccination imitative for two years where I visited members of congress in D.C /did advocacy work in my home state, and also attended marketing meetings. I am starting a club for this on my campus next year. Also, I went on a mobile clinic trip to Tanzania for 2 weeks. 

Volunteering: Did over 100 hours at a hospital and another 150 at a hospice care center. Also volunteered on a state senate campaign for 7 months during the last election cycle. 

Leadership: Was elected VP of recruitment twice in a row for my medical fraternity, where I did a lot to change things. Also was elected to my hall council freshman year.  (I will also be the president of the vaccine advocacy club I'm starting next year).

Other: Did research in a pharma lab for 7 months.  Running tests, analyzing data and what not.

Goal for MBA: Join a non-profit and see what I can do to improve healthcare around the world. Also, perhaps work for a health insurance company.

Target schools: Harvard 2+2 or Stanford deferred admission. From what I've read these programs are for students with no work experience and who were not on a business track. However, I'm not sure if no work experience means that you still need to have done business internships. The narrative I'll sell is that everything I do is for a purpose greater than myself, and I've gotten into leadership positions and found ways to improve the organization/cause. 

Please let me know if I am at all qualified for these deferred admission programs (given I get a good gmat score), or if I don't stand a chance without more pure business experience. Thanks!!!

I came into college as a Computer Engineering major, but took a 6 month internship that really affected my course work. I'm behind about two quarters and haven't declared into my major yet. CS is competitive in my school, and it's so bad that the major takes about 5 years to complete. 

After looking into my college plan, there was no room to really finish engineering in 4 years. I switched to doing a BA in Computer Science, but realized that I wasn't doing very well in my data structures class, and when it came to getting help, office hours and tutoring hours wer all impacted.

Right now I'm a software engineering intern as a sophomore, making $40hr, and I love what I do, and it's not all the tedious school work that I'm used to. 

I know if I do the BA in CS, I'll just struggle for the next 2.5 years. With the BS Cognitive Science / AI, I'll graduate early and can take my return offer. 

Doing a Masters in CS is something that I'm thinking about, but maybe not just yet. 

In this sub, everyone pushes to get that CS Degree. Does anyone have an opinion for me?

They hate me for being bi and I'm afraid that they'll kill me or kick me out of the house. I'm only 16 years old and I would have no one to turn to. I need advice on how to survive living in my house until I'm 18, when I have a better chance at escaping.**   



I am 16 years old and am bisexual. I've known I was bi since middle school (currently a high school junior), but was closeted until June. 
 

Back in March, I was looking for internship opportunities. Out of curiosity, I started looking at LGBT organizations to see if they had any open positions. I found out that one nationally-known LGBT organization had an internship position open. I spent some time considering the pros and cons of applying. Getting the internship would mean having to come out since the position requires me to be vocal about my experiences as an LGBT person. My parents seemed to be pretty tolerant of LGBT people and were aware of how supportive I am of LGBT rights. I decided that the pros outweighed the cons, and that if I got the position, that I could use it as an opportunity to come out to my parents. I doubted I would get the internship, since the organization is extremely well-known, it's incredibly hard getting an internship at the organization, and the application process was 3 rounds of interviews and different applications (video, essay, etc).


I applied and told my parents that I was applying to a national organization for an internship position, which made them happy. To my surprise, I made it past the first round. The next 2 months were filled with me having to fill out multiple forms, create videos, and undergo numerous interviews. My parents saw me stress over the entire process, but supported and encouraged me throughout it. In late May, I was notified that I had received the position. I was incredibly overjoyed and spent the next few weeks figuring out how to tell my parents the news and come out to them.   


In early June, I came out to my parents. I sat down and told them the news, before finally telling them I was bisexual. It went horribly wrong. At first, they were disbelieving and thought I was joking, but once they realized I was serious, they became incredibly angry. My parents yelled at me, saying that I was wrong and how I was too young to know what I wanted. They screamed at me for an hour, saying how I was doing it all for attention and trying to ruin their reputation, while I tried in vain to explain. My brother and sister called halfway through their rant, and they outed me to them, saying how I was pretending to be LGBT. They spent more time yelling at me for crying, saying how me crying was an indication that I was too immature to know what I'm attracted to.   


The weeks since then have been hell. My parents either ignore me and pretend I don't exist, or yell at me, saying how I ruined their lives and that I was a mistake. My mom told me that if she had known I was going to end up bi, she would have killed me as a baby. My parents have both expressed that they're planning to disown me if I'm still 'like this' once I turn 18, and that if I wasn't a minor, that they would have thrown me out of the house already. They've refused to let me hang out with any friends, and have interrogated me about each of my friends, asking if they're gay. I'm not allowed out of the house anymore, and the only time I can go outside is to the library. They act like this is the worst thing I've ever done to them, and get pissed at me whenever I mention the internship or do something related to it. My parents tried to get my siblings to cut me off, but I'm still in contact with them since they're not homophobic.   


I've become depressed over the past few weeks. While I don't regret coming out to them, I'm just embarrassed that I believed that they would accept me for who I am. I'm afraid that they'll kick me out of the house or kill me. My mom even told me that she hopes I kill myself, and that if it were legal, she would kill me herself. I live in the middle of nowhere and would have no one to turn to if that happened. I don't know how I'm going to manage to survive until I turn 18. I feel incredibly helpless and like I'm trapped in my own house.

Here's my backstory:
I have went through some personal trauma in my earlier life which I had severe depression and my future wasn't even something I had in mind. I started feeling saner and a little more confident around my late 20s and decided that maybe I should consider a career working with computers after all, all my life I have been messing around them everyone in my family always teased me (which wasn't really good for my self esteem in the 1st place) about being on them so much. But anyway, I enroll in a local community college where I think I bit off more than I could chew. I knew I wanted to work with computers but not exactly what I actually wanted to do with them if that makes any sense. 

The beginners courses were a breath of fresh air because they were actually about computer hardware and operating systems which I taught myself about and knew how to make them work but with the classes I now knew why they worked, not the usual how to use microsoft word fluff that they start you off with in some schools but then I got into some network classes which course curricular I was in steers you straight into the cisco tree and that's where I got lost and eventually lost my confidence all over again because I didn't know what I was doing or how the hell I ended up there. 

To sum up the early community college experience, I did manage to graduate but looking back I don't even know how I did and I didn't get any certs while I was there. If I actually took some comptia test I would have gotten an automatic A in some of the courses and wouldn't have to show up for those classes again but I was too scary to try. And when I enrolled in those cisco courses, you bet I was too chicken shit to even try that test even though I managed to complete the entire ccna course load. And never really took advantage of any opportunities they had because I was just a clueless idiot. I did manage to get into an internship which also counted as a class credit but it was mostly job shadowing, not much actual hands on. There was actually a paid internship that I could have signed up for too that could have lead to full time employment during that time but as you might have figured, me making bad decisions had me choose to do the unpaid job shadowing one. I guess you could say self doubt had me going through the motions with school. After I left there I took time away from school again since I was depressed again and wasn't so sure where exactly I was headed.

My current situation:
 Now I'm enrolled in a uni and I am trying to complete my bachelors and this time I am more sure about where I want to be. I realized my passion is really in cyber security. I hope that one day I can become a pen tester and work my way through the ranks to become one but in the meantime I really need to get my foot in the door to start making that a reality and I figure I need to do it now so I can have a decent amount of experience under my belt by the time I graduate which will be next year but I don't have that much real experience working with customer service or in a help desk environment so when I do apply for entry level help desk jobs I am rejected almost immediately by recruiters. I really don't have much to pad my resume with since I'm inexperienced but I had a few different professors look at it and they  agree its very professional looking so its not the format of it thats throwing them off but my lack of experience in general. I did manage to land a few interviews which led to in person interviews but the last one I went to the person that interviewed me made me feel very embarrassed and I knew I wasn't getting the job then and ever since that 1 interview, I never received a reply back from anyone ever again which made me feel worthless once more. I'm told that help desk jobs open all the time but here I am and I can't even get a level 1 tech job. I have also apply for internships to be told I don't have enough experience (wtf)

Also I may have to add that I didn't make any connections while attending CC and I still haven't networked with anyone yet. I have been battling with social anxiety since I was a kid so I have a hard time starting and maintaining conversations with people without it getting awkward. But when I am engaged enough I can hold my own well. Its not bad to the point that I can't hold eye contact. I have sought help with my interviewing skills in which I got positive feedback but its still nerve wrecking for me. I know part of my problem stems from not having someone to vouch for me. So when I'm asked for references on applications I hit a brick wall.

I still haven't gotten any certs. I know I should have at least one by now, but since I'm almost at the finish line with my  bachelors degree I really don't know where I should start. I figured maybe I should get an A+ to be taken more seriously but then I'm told how worthless it really is especially since I'm almost at a bachelors degree. So I don't know if I should pursue that or just skip to the network+ and sec+ or just skip comptia altogether and go for a ccna and some microsoft certs. And I'm also told since I don't have a lot of real world experience I shouldn't go for something like a ccna... idk  I'm overwhelmed just thinking about which ones to get with so much conflicting info.

So in short I really don't know wtf to do now and I feel frustrated, worthless, and stupid. Sometimes I feel like maybe I should just quit because I'm getting nowhere and I place that blame on myself and no one else but I also feel if I quit I don't know what I'll do because I've been really tinkering with tech all my life and its all I know.

So in short I guess I'm asking what should a person in my situation do? What certifications should I consider? Is there still a chance for me to turn it around?

TL;DR
Depressed for a long time went to school for IT and ended up getting lost in the curricular and didn't know wtf I was doing. graduated with associates although depressed again and didn't gain any real experience or certs. Took time off and went back for bachelors degree, still feeling hopeless since I can't get entry level job. Still need to get certs but don't know which ones I should get. I'm an idiot who's squandered opportunities and I need help."

For example, can such a person break into web or mobile development even though his/her previous internships were in other areas such as computer networking or machine learning engineering?  Or does such a person get thrown behind all the undergrads with the ""relevant"" experience and all the [bootcampers](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ny4g2/whats_the_point_of_a_cs_degree/) too?

I'd like to believe that by earning and completing internship(s), that is also a signal that the candidate is responsible and reasonably good with other people and has *general* technical ability AND has the ability to learn things quickly---after all, isn't a major reason to get a CS bachelors to learn *HOW* to learn (beyond acquisition of specific technical skills)??

Besides, it's not like interns are saving the world or anything.  Interns have lowered expectations, and often have smaller scale ""just-for-intern"" projects anyway.

But then again, I may be wrong here, which is why to ask this question in the first place.  Thanks in advance!"

I'm expected to graduate in a year and a half in the fall.

My GPA is very weak (3.15), but my CS GPA is good (3.75), but I've only taken 3 courses (intro, data structures, discrete math), so it seems like artifice to list it. My resume is fairly barren, and I haven't even considered applying anywhere until I've hacked together my first dumb side project over the summer.

I'm going to apply for a summer position for 2018, and hopefully I'll get something. I'm not sure what happens if my senior year is just a semester, and I'd only have 1 internship beforehand. Should I plan to apply for internships for spring/summer 2018 (after graduation) during my graduating semester? A lot of internship descriptions imply they're not taking graduating seniors."

I am a computer science student who will be graduating in December with a 4-year degree. My advisor said I would benefit by doing an internship. Anyhow, I land an ""IT"" internship. The company wanted two interns to build them an android/iOS app. The internship started the first of May and ends before school, which is like august 20th. Anyhow - the other intern jumped shipped the first week. It had to do with the low pay ($10 an hour) and the long drive for him. 

Here's the facts: 
-Almost alone, I have built them an amazing android and iOS app. The app is on android play and we are finalizing on the Apple app store.

-I took a hit by accepting this internship. I did this internship entirely for my resume/experience. I worked a 'contract' job which paid almost $20 an hour. This internship was $10 an hour.

-I need a part time job come fall during school. I have class MTW so i could on work Thursday/Friday at my current job/internship.

-There is only one other ""IT/app designer"" at this job. He made the database, he is old school and doesn't have a clue about PHP. 

-Not that php is hard, but a lot of functionality went into these pages...they are going to need someone to maintain/improve app. It will be a learning curve for someone to learn all my scripts/how pages work.

-The other ""programming guy"" hinted heavily that they will be offering me a part time job. He even said something along the lines of 50k. 

-Another option is applying for other internships. One place in particular I know pays $20 an hour for interns.

-The ""main boss"" has hinted at a secret project. He plans to tell me at the end of the month. I think this is when he is going to offer me a promotion.

My question is - how much do you think I should hold out for? I feel like I deserve at least $20 an hour. Is that too low? Anything lower I think I would consider trying other places/go back to my contract job. I think the ball is heavily in my park. "

The first thing I need to do is to take the description column, and match that to another on a separate sheet within the document. When it finds that match, it needs to multiply the quantity of that item by an already calculated coefficient in the other sheet, and then record that value in the correct cell block.  
  
After that, I will need a second process that identifies the phase code associated with that item, then take the value found from previous, and add them together by phase code.  
  
This is for about 1400 lines, has approximately 15k hours divided up into quite small portions.  
  
If I were to do this by hand it would be, Copy, Ctrl-F, find the coefficient, then multiply that by the item qty, paste that number, then add each item by phase code.  
  
I am decent enough with VB, and have visual studio, would it be easier to do this in excel or just write a program. (I have found some resources on microsoft support)

Have times really changed or still career suicide?,Plato_on_a_stick,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6o8ert/job_hopping_have_times_really_changed_or_still/,"Hy guys, so basically I am a bit scared about job hopping and would like some advice.

I have a BA in polisci and minor in commerce from a top school. Im 25 and left uni a little less than 2 years ago. After uni I did a diploma in digital marketing while doing an unpaid internship for a startup. 

After that I got a job working sales for a startup, but after 4 months the whole company moved operations to silicon valley and I couldn't go due to visa issues. 

Being unemplolyed I took (stupidly) the first job offered working sales at a call center. I felt the job was beneath me (ashamed to say, nothing wrong with call center jobs) but I rolled my sleeves and worked hard and did pretty well. After 7 months I volunteered to help with digital marketing, did that for 2 months while still in the call center. After they told me they didn't had a position for me but would love to work with me in the future. I quit due to family reasons and just being tired of the call center.

At this time I decided to move back to my home country (moved to the US for school). My mom had health problems and I felt like a change was due. I took a job here working as a project coordinator for a digital firm, and while promising after 5 months the job looked bleak. I feel undervalued and underpaid, and don't see a career for me in my office. I left a lot of things back in the US, like my girlfriend... so I was thinking about moving back. 

I know its been a lot of stupid knee jerk decision making for me lately. Moving countries, then moving back, etc. I am afraid of quitting this job and moving back and having a hard time finding something decent back there. I have marketable skills, good at interviews, and a couple of recommendation letters, and I think my biggest flaw has been the indecision and moving around. Any advice? Much appreciated!

TLDR: At 25 and with almost 2 years out of uni, does your job durations matter as much? Can you still get good work? Can you solve this issue or too late for you?"

Is this a good deal or is it worth it to upgrade to the i7 7700HQ, screen to 300cd/m2 and include an extra 8GB RAM slot for 16GB ram in total?

My uses are gaming mostly with webdesigning coming in later this year during an internship. 

Games I play: Guild Wars 2, Overwatch, PUBG and soon Destiny 2 and possible broadcasting gameplay to Twitch.tv

The upgrade costs i'm looking at would cost me at around 1000€ for the entire laptop vs 819€ standard costs. (I already have a 500GB SSD I plan on putting in).

The lounge lasted for 9 months and I eventually closed it due to my inexperience and underestimation of how much money, work and knowledge is needed to keep a business running.  By the time I had figured it out it was too late.  I did everything; front-end customer service, back-end paper work, taxes, marketing, ordering shipments of goods, finances, managing employees and schedules, etc, etc.


Despite taking a mental and financial beating over 9 months, ""blind trial by fire"" if you will, I feel as though I did gain an immense amount of knowledge and wisdom through it all.  Maybe more so than my 4 years at university.


So now I am a CS major who has basic knowledges of various languages with an experience running a business.


Anyways the questions I am here to ask are:

How do I market myself now?

What skills can I even put down on my resume that look good?

How do you market yourself when you have broad knowledge but no specialization? (Im stuck with the Jack of All Trades, Master of None gambit)


Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you.

6oaswt,4,2017-07-19,Investigating missing person and cult to help pay for Student loans,VMProductions,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6oaswt/investigating_missing_person_and_cult_to_help_pay/,"My name is Alex, Creative producer’s assistant for VM productions, I went back to school because I wanted to get into the film industry. My job includes doing social media (this), and investigating the disappearance of VM productions missing screenwriter, and creating a video-style blog following my efforts.

This was to be my first step into the film industry, I’d do this, then I’d become a famous Hollywood producer…

However, Unknown to me, Robert Hurley, a screenwriter for VM productions went missing shortly after working on a rough draft of the script ""Notes from the New World"", with Vitaly Sumin, the director. 

I wondered why I was doing this? I dropped out of summer army internship training, this is something for the FBI, but after researching, Hurley was an orphan from Culver City, Ca. , so the LAPD closed it pretty quickly

Robert Hurley spent his last days (not missing). researching this cult for future films, Shades of Day (Deals with Vampires) He allegedly made contact with the cult, as well. 
The cult focuses on drinking blood, and sacrificing women, apparently he even made contact with them, providing sketches of their rituals, these sketches were roughly drawn, but depicted women being sacrificed, and their nipples being cut off. Then, the cult members would cut themselves as well, mixing their blood with the woman, and drinking it, to gain immortality.

He went missing shortly after, but has been seen in Europe, Europe is the base for this cult-- similar to an eastern-European Illuminati, so to speak. They’re credited with the knights Templar, the rise of communism, Grigor Rasputin, etc.


I began my task of investigating the cult and their beliefs, texts, and their links to the real world. I even tracked down a local ""goth"" bar where people drink blood. I'm not going to lie, I got a little tipsy, and I was dancing with a hot girl, she then produced a razor, either out of her bra or mouth (tipsy), and sliced herself shallowly, she then made me taste her blood. 

AND THEN I TURNED INTO A VAMPIRE, just kidding. I hung out with her a little more, but got really intoxicated so my friends had to take me home. That night, I had the scariest dreams, real occult ritual stuff, 


I woke up in the morning and go back to the cult notes, the ritual I dreamt was written later on in Roberts Journal.

I didn't read much of the journal before, because it was a bunch of screenwriting notes, numbers, etc. but towards the end I found an exact description of the ritual. 
“Blood drawn pentagram”, “harnessing magic”. I’ve never been into this new-age stuff, but I feel ‘different’, after that dream, if that makes sense.

So, I have to also film my investigation Vlog-style, as part of my job. It’s pretty much me saying I’ve gotten nowhere; however, While filming, a bang occurred, I finished up the take and looked over, I opened up a piece of paper, and it said “we have been watching you”.

I'm doing well in my courses and enjoying the subject matter, but I'm a little old for the undergrad social scene and I find the day-to-day routine of studying by myself to be boring, isolating, and ultimately depressing. My core coursework - basic OOP in Java, Data Structures in C++, Basic Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Discrete Mathematics - is complete, and I have about 3 full time semesters left in my degree program. In addition, I've already completed a major in the social sciences (good GPA in both majors).

My long-term boyfriend (3+ yrs, which is significant for a 21 y/o) just finished his master's and got a full time job 700 miles from where we were both raised/went to school. He's supposed to move in a week, and obviously leaving his childhood home means a ton of work and stress. I'm trying to help him clean his apartment and get packed, and I'm going to be driving down with him, so most of my evenings are full of cleaning and packing and what not.

In addition, I have an internship doing programming. We're in the last few weeks before we're supposed to release the project I've been working on all summer, which means we're in the big crunch/bug hunting time, and in addition we're supposed to do a limited release in a week and a half, which is the Mon after I'm supposed to help my bf move. Originally I was going to stay down there for a week, help him find a place to live, and also just hang out since I won't be able to move until I finish my degree (which is at least 2 yrs out), but I'm not sure trying to work remotely during that week is a good idea since the goal of the limited release was to get feedback and do a bunch more bug hunting/fixing, so I have less time to spend with him than I thought, AND work is super busy and stressful right now.

On top of that, I was supposed to finish a bunch of homework for a class I blew off last semester, and if I don't finish that homework I'm definitely going to fail that class and now I have less than a month to finish a semester's worth of work, or I have to retake it to graduate (which I really don't want to do because I've already been burned out and lacking motivation for school). 

My best friend also moved to her full time job at the beginning of the summer, and I don't have many friends here that I feel safe talking to about everything, and none who are interested in/able to do a lot of the things that help me with stress (like hiking, climbing, lifting, etc.) and I haven't been able to just go to the bouldering wall at the gym or lift because I hurt my hand and can't put pressure on it, and every time I've tried hiking I've been rained/stormed out.

There's also a good chance I'm going to move in August to be closer to school/in a better position to bike, but for right now having another thing on my plate just feels like too much stress. I know nothing that's happening is excessive, and I know most adults could handle this stuff graciously, but lately when I have free time I find myself just laying around and playing Rune Factory or Harvest Moon and shirking responsibilities, and when I do make myself do something I spend more time just staring at the task than doing anything.

Does anyone have any suggestions for handling the stress better? I know I can't keep pushing things off and crying about everything but I don't know how to get myself going. . ."

From what I can tell with the research I've done online, Rice, UT Austin and TAMU are the 3 best schools in the state for Computer Science.

Rice is out of the question because it's 40K a year, and I have no interest in TAMU (seriously, none at all).

So my dream school is UT Austin, great school, awesome location, etc.

However being in Houston I was considering UH Main or UHCL.

However I'm branching out and trying to see what other schools in the state of Texas have good Comp Sci programs.

I'm looking to start a new career, so job placement / internship help is important. Networking through CS Clubs and Events is also something I'd like to get into, I don't want to just go to school and that's it. I'd like to get more involved.

So what can you tell me about UTD?
I know it was founder by the people from Texas Instruments, but that's about all I know...

How does it compare to the likes of UH main or UHCL?

I don't think I got necessarily lucky in the interview, as I feel like interview questions are more easy to just learn how to solve. However, I've been at my internship for some weeks now and I feel soooo lost. I understand maybe 10% of the jargon that my team uses, and I google 90% of the day but it's not enough to figure out everything. I feel like everyone expects me to be able to understand these things, but I just don't seem to have the ability to comprehend higher level CS concepts and tools that are being used. I feel bad asking so many questions, so a lot of the time I just give up and say I understand and then try to make up the knowledge through google (which slows me down). Even when I do ask questions, a lot of the time I understand the response but then I can't really get it to stick, either that or I really need an ELI5 which makes me feel like I'm wasting coworkers time. I'm really unconfident in my knowledge of the material that whenever I try to talk whatever comes out is a soup of random words which essentially means nothing. The material that I'm a master of at school (algorithms, data structures, theory) doesn't seem to be of any use to me since I can't grasp simple concepts in the team that I'm working on. I still don't really understand my project's goal, and I've somehow managed to push some code out, but idk what to do.

Basically I threw my life away the last 6-7 years because of addiction, not drugs or alcohol, more so gaming addiction.

I was average in school, finished whats called ""realschule"" in germany and went on to a school thats similiar to a High School, it's one level below it and it's called ""fachabitur"" in german. When I google the translation it says ""Advanced Vocational Certificate of Education"". So yea it's worth a bit less than a High school graduation, but it's enough to study in germany. I started to study roughly 6 1/2 years ago, my first semester was a complete desaster, my mother was fighting with cancer, which in retrospect affected me more than I thought at the time and I was very motivated and worked way more than I did on my previous schools, but it didnt work out, I should've quit right there and said fuck it and looked for a job, there wouldn't have been a problem, but somehow I didn't wanna disappoint my family (which is the most awesome family you could imagine, which makes all this even harder, if I had a shit family I would've just killed me already, but whenever I think about suicide (which I did a lot) I always thought I can't do this to my family). 


Whatever, lets get on with the story. Once I figured I wouldn't be able to work it out in 2 of my 6 subjects I just stopped going to university and stayed home. Somehow I got even more into gaming because I had way more time available now. I somehow told myself that I'll try again next semester but I pretty much lied to myself there. After 3 years I thought I need a new start, I couldn't go on like this anymore, so I changed the field in which I was studying. But I got back into the same habbit for another 3 1/2 years now. Now is finally the time where I know I can't lie to myself anymore and I need to find a job and live my life somehow. I can't bring it over my heart to tell this to my family, which was very supportive the last few years while I lived off heritage (which I still have a decent amount of, like 50k€) because I was living as cheap as possible. I just want to fix my life myself, but I don't know how. My education was not the greatest before those wasted 6 1/2 years, but now how am I ever getting employed. How can I find an apprenticeship, how am I supposed to explain that I studied for 6 1/2 years without doing a single test. If I was looking for someone I would instantly throw my own application in the bin. So my questions for you guys are :

How should I write this in my application, how in my résumé and where should I try to aim at with my applications? I thought about jobs that don't require High school, so I at least have something that hightlights me. 
But even then, imagine I would get to a job interview, how am I supposed to explain this. When I think about it it seems impossible. I really want to make a change in my life and when I was doing internships in my time at school I always loved working, I have no idea why I even got the idea to study, because I hated school back then already. I was really enjoying working. It's just another thing that makes me question my former self even more. Why did I not just work back then, but I guess it's too late now and I have to just look to find anything that can get my life back on track. I know it will be hard but it has to somehow be possible. It can't be over right here. I have no idea where the last 6 1/2 years went, I was very depressive, that much I know, and video games were a way to just leave the real world behind and forget about anything thats real. All problems were forgotten for years. It's strange how unreal this whole time was to me, like all problems would solve themselves somehow.

So writing this wall of text was pretty tough, but I hope someone here reads at least some of it, every small advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated. I don't think I can figure it all out myself. All I know is that I was enough of a burden for my family and that I don't want to disappoint them any more. I have to somehow find a way out of this without them, at least once in my life I have to be a bit independant."

I haven't had an internship or anything, so without any industry experience and only a few classes under my belt it's hard to make a guess at what interests me. 

I've made a list of the upper div classes that interest me and based on that I've thought about software engr, systems programming, security, &amp; DBIS (DBIS and soft engr a little less than the other two but still enough I've considered them, p much all other tracks are uninteresting to me). Upperclassmen, what made you decide to pursue a certain track and how did you end up feeling about it?

I've heard that tracks really don't make a huge difference to recruiters and what matters is just the classes you've taken and how you've applied yourself in/outside them based on your interests. I'm the kind of person who always needs to have a plan tho, so I'm trying to narrow it down now even if I change my mind later :p 
I also have the scheduling flexibility and the motivation (for now) to specialize in more than one area, and excluding DBIS I know there's a lot of overlap in the ones I've listed which seems to make it viable but by all means correct me if I'm wrong :p
just wondering about perspective from people who've been around the block with upper div CS classes. Thanks! "

Most other people seem to struggle with the work we do but I've been able to pick up everything pretty fast so they're teaching me how to process more advanced work. I even learned how to code in excel with VBA to help me process faster and I'm currently processing work nearly twice as fast with significantly less errors as everyone else because of it. Because of this I've been in contact with some higher ups about my future at the firm and other potential opportunities but they're incredibly busy so the process of acquiring a job in a different role here has been slow.

1-Would you advise asking for a pay increase? If so how should I go about doing this? 

2-Is the low pay a standard practice for internship positions at a firm like this?

3-Are there any other better opportunities I should look into where I can better apply my skills or receive better pay?

4-I'm contracted through a separate company and feel like the people that are doing similar work that are paid on a salary directly through this firm are getting paid significantly more. Am I being taken advantage of?

5-Is there a standard for how to treat internships like this? Should I take it less seriously and think of it as something to throw on a resume?

I don't know at all if I should be leaving my job now as I am not feeling good at all there.

I've started working right after my last internship (different company), no holidays for 3 years except for Christmas.

Job interview was rushed, I feel like having being pushed to accept an offer I was unhappy with, especially the salary which is WAY too low (1k4€ per month, Master degree in marketing, 1,5 years of experience in several countries and big companies).

I have a tremendous amount of work to do, which isn't a problem in itself, but I am working for 2 companies (one in the morning, the other in the afternoon) so I have the double of work for half the time. 

I don't like the atmosphere at all, people seems to be agressive, insulting and rude towards each others. 

I feel very poorly coming to work every morning, and it's been only 3 days. I have 1h30 commute to go to work, it is very exhausting for me and it is compromising my ability to go to my therapy (1h+ commute ans psychiatrist ending at 5pm, but I can't leave before 5pm). 

On the positive side my boss is very nice and I just have a very good feeling with her. The big boss is also nice. My missions are very versatile and interesting. My boss is allowing me to have holidays for the summer.

Also I am afraid of leaving as I don't want to be unemployed for months after, I need experience. I am applying for other jobs but I probably won't be able to attend job interviews as I can't leave my job during the day or before 5pm. I don't even have my work contract yet.

6oencs,27,2017-07-20,Silence after the Carnage,sevvvenseconds,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6oencs/silence_after_the_carnage/,"Today is a special anniversary for me. 

Ten years ago tonight, I was visiting my parents for the summer after having just wrapped up my junior year of college. It wasn’t my choice to spend the summer with my parents; on the contrary, I had applied to several summer internships and had been rejected from all of them. “Everything happens for a reason,” my dad told me when he picked me up from the airport. I guess he was right. 

The summer was, as anticipated, uneventful. I connected with old friends that I had lost contact with after high school, I drank too many six packs of warm beer in gas station parking lots with said friends, and I genuinely relaxed. My little brother, Danny, would tag along. Even though Danny was sixteen, he still looked up to me in a way that made me feel proud. Or maybe it was the fact that I could get booze for him and his friends. I’ll never know. 

One night, my mom called me to tell me that she and my father would be out late at a work event and that I would need to go pick up Danny from a neighbor’s house. He had summer school in the morning for a class he had failed during the year. My mom’s tone was biting on the other end. I groaned and told her to call him—I was too tired to go. My mother insisted, and there was no arguing with her. So I went. 

Danny was best friends with a neighbor kid, Allen, that I had known when we were growing up together. Even though I was older, Allen was one of those lifelong childhood friends to my brother that you never forget. My parents joked that Allen’s parents moved into the neighborhood just to have Allen closer to Danny. Allen’s parents were eccentric and quirky; their front porch was filled with handmade bird houses that his parents sold at local flea markets. Allen’s father taught at a community college and his mother volunteered at a homeless shelter. Everyone loved them, and they were generous people. 

I made my way across the street and stepped onto the sidewalk. Allen’s house was only a few yards away with two houses in between theirs and mine. The houses on either side of the street were still and quiet. In suburbia, everyone goes to bed before nine o’clock. It was nearing midnight.

I remember that night being unusually chilly for a mid-July evening. I could see lights flickering through Allen’s living room window, which I assumed was from the TV. I climbed onto the porch, ducked under a low-hanging birdhouse, and pressed the doorbell. Silence. Then I heard a voice, muffled, whispering urgently—but not to me. 

“Danny? It’s me. Mom wants you to come home,” I said, my nose pressed against the wooden door. I waited for a few seconds before knocking again. Silence. Then the porch light flipped on. I jumped at the sudden burst of light. 

The deadbolt slid out of place. I waited for a moment for someone to open the door, but I was again met with silence. After a few seconds, I could hear very soft footfalls echoing back into the house. I was growing agitated by that point. I turned the handle and opened the door. 

It was dark. It was also hot, I remember that. From the chilly night air, the front entrance of the house felt like I was stepping into a sauna. I couldn’t see even a foot in front of me. 

“Danny?” I called out into the darkness. Silence. 

I took a step forward and immediately hit something. I lifted my foot and tapped it; it was soft and mushy. Then I got anxious. I kept calling Danny’s name, but I was suddenly afraid of the dark and quiet house. Every instinct and muscle was wanting to turn around and run through the door. 

My hand found the light switch, and then I saw everything. In the floor in front of me was Allen’s father. His body was already bloated and turning purple. His lips were blue. He had been dead for a while. In this moment, I went cold. My hand rested on the wall to steady me. I may have screamed, but my ears were ringing so I can’t be sure what happened. 

I backed out of the doorway, back onto the porch, and saw Allen making his way up the driveway. He was wearing a yellow t-shirt, but it was splattered in red—with blood. His eyes were wild, open, and trained on me. He was sweating, breathing hard. He had just been running from somewhere. We stared at each other in silence for what had to be a solid minute. When I moved to walk down the steps, he pulled a small pistol from his back pocket. I tripped over myself as I dove back inside the house and slammed the door. 

I could hear Allen screaming and pounding on the door. I dropped to my hands and knees, half expecting a gunshot to go through the door at any second. I was staring at the corpse of Allen’s father. I was shaking so violently that I could not stand. I crawled over the body, into the kitchen, and my hands immediately slipped out from under me. I rolled over to see that Allen’s mother had been stabbed in the chest multiple times. Her eyes were open, blood was splattered in her eyes. I was covered in her blood. I vomited.

Allen continued pounding on the door. He was screaming. I was crying. Somehow, I managed to stand up and grab a knife from the shelf. I ran to the back door. At this time, Danny came stumbling out of the back hallway. He was holding a bleeding wound in his side, crying. I had forgotten all about him, and I held the knife out on instinct, petrified. 

“Allen killed them,” Danny told me through trembling sobs. “He tried to kill me.” His voice was growing quieter. Then I realized that Allen was no longer at the front door. Silence radiated through the dead house. 

I ran to the window and looked out. The backyard was dark, but I could see a light on in the neighbor’s house. As I was about to pull open the door, I heard a gunshot. Shattering glass hit me in the face. I could taste the blood in my mouth caused by the glass cutting my face. I fell to the floor. Danny screamed. 

I didn’t see what happened, but I heard shuffling, muffled breathing, and the sound of flesh pounding flesh. Then there was a gurgling sound. There was the unmistakable sound of Allen’s frail voice whispering, *“What is happening to you?”*

I felt someone come wrench the knife out of my hand. Then I heard a “thud.” Then nothing. 

The police came after the first gunshot. It took them about twenty minutes. I didn’t move until I felt a police officer shaking me. I was in a state of catatonia for two hours and came to in the hospital. I was informed, by a police officer, that according to Danny's statement, Allen had become unstable that evening and begun attacking his parents. Danny tried to stop him, but was stabbed in the process. There never a clear answer given as to what had happen or prompted this tragedy. There was a lengthy investigation for about a year, but then it suddenly died down. People wanted this suburban massacre to fade away. And it did. Sometimes even I forget what happened. 

That evening, I returned home with only scratches on my face and a prescription for Xanax to deal with my undeniable PTSD. After my parents left me alone, their own tears running over their eyes, I was left with the silence. This unbearable, painful silence. My ears continued ringing. I couldn't move. Danny came into my room and sat with me. We didn’t say anything for a while, until he whispered, “It’s weird that things are so silent now. The silence after the carnage.” He grinned, looked at me, and then he left. 

Ten years later, we’ve all moved on. My parents moved after my brother went to college. Danny is engaged to a wonderful woman and is working his way through medical school. I just wrapped up my third year as an adjunct faculty member getting my doctorate degree. Our lives are normal, and people don’t know what we went through unless they do an extensive Google search on my name. 

Today, after teaching my last class of the day, I sat down in my office to respond to student emails. The first email in my inbox said “Happy Anniversary!” I clicked it, expecting it to be spam. There was a file attached. Wary of viruses, I clicked on the thumbnail to preview it and could make out a very grainy image of Danny—ten years ago. *From that night.*

I quickly opened the file and a low-quality phone video pulled up. Only seven seconds long. It was recorded through a window. Allen’s mother was convulsing on the kitchen floor, blood spilling onto the beige tile. Standing over her was Danny, knife held in his trembling hand. He looked to the window—straight into the camera—and winked. Then he was gone. 

The video ended. I was thrown back into the silence. 

Seven seconds just changed everything.

I'm just graduating from my engineering school, and therefore I'm looking for a first job opportunity.


I've three choices for the moment :

* Android dev in London
* Java/C++ dev in London
* Solution engineer in Barcelona

The position in Barcelona is less technical than the two others, as I would be in charge of integrating the product in the client environment, but I would not be working directly on the product. And what I understand is that the integration is not so demanding in terms of technical skills (mainly front end stuff) but more in terms of soft skills.


So my question is, if i'm taking the Barcelona job, would it be a bad move? I mean, could I have difficulties to return to a more technical job after this one?

Also, I have two internships under my belt, and they are quite technicals (one about java development and the other on android/ios dev).

And a last thing, the salary for both London positions are about 28K£/year (36,325 usd), and the Barcelona one is about 30K€/year (34,681 usd). Does it look okay for a graduate software engineer position?"

I got this internship through my uncle who is friends with the jewelry company’s main designer’s daughter. I initially accepted because my mom wanted me to have something to do throughout the summer, but also because since my uncle (as well as most of my family - except for my siblings and me) knows who runs the company very well.  
The family of the main designer are well-known in the area and are very wealthy as they own many companies. Many of my aunts and uncles work for one of the companies. My cousin who is one year younger than me also has a job with the main designer’s father which she gets paid for doing things like filing.
Okay so I went to an interview, got offered the internship - never did they specify whether this was paid or not and I was stupid and forgot to ask. The basically told me that I was going to become the head of marketing for the company and that another marketing student would also be interning and since I’m a year older, I would be in charge of her too. They also asked me if I could model some sunglasses for them and I agreed and came in a few days early for a photoshoot.There was nothing signed when I took on the internship. 
Now the actual internship. Initially, I was asked to come in three days a week, but after the first week they changed it to four days a week from 10am to 5pm. The people in charge are always talking about how they have no budget for marketing or advertising. I found out I wasn't being paid a couple of weeks ago. I am also not getting school credit.
my daily tasks include:  •creating marketing campaigns  •copywriting •creating a lookbook template •design and send out newsletters •fixing and updating the website  •writing press releases •graphic design •help with social media •bring in our friends to model for free •update the email list •I had to write an ‘About’ page for the brand with  •SEO 
Two weeks ago the brand took part in a yearly local designers market and I was asked to help come up with the booth design + the graphics to go along with it.
My dad seems to be the only adult who notices how weird the circumstances are in this internship. My mom keeps telling me that I’m gaining experience - all of which I’m teaching myself. And she thinks that this will make me more hirable in the long run. My friends and cousins tell me that I should quit and find something else however I feel that it is too late as summer is coming close to an end. They tell me that I’m being taken advantage of and that I’m not good enough friends with the main designer or her family to be giving my time and work for free.
I don’t really know what to do. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. I’m scared that if I say or do something it will ruin my family’s relationship with this family.

6ohf3s,2,2017-07-20,OK to ask for more money? How,textually_attracted,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/6ohf3s/ok_to_ask_for_more_money_how/,"(1) Am I in a decent spot to ask for money?
(2) How would critique how I am planning to ask for it?

I am in the field of engineering as an intern. I graduate in a year; I have been a senior for a couple years, so I was in the top hourly rate bracket at my internship--$20 an hour. 

At the beginning of this summer, I switched companies. The new company offers slightly less money to their senior interns--$18 an hour, $2 less than my previous job.

When I brought up the pay difference to the HR person who brought me in, she told me that I couldn't negotiate a higher wage until my second rotation, which begins in January.

Now, at the end of this summer, I will be discussing with the new manager here about coming back for another rotation in January. I recently did really well on a presentation for the directors and president of the company, and so they are pretty gung ho about bringing me back. They have had a hard time keeping employees. I do an all-right job; I haven't had much time to prove myself beyond being able to write emails, modify macros, and follow-up with stuff on time.

Here's the thing; I feel hesitant about asking for more money, after only being here for 8 weeks. I *was* paid higher at my previous internship, and I do have 4 years of internship experience, but I am not sure if that really is relevant enough to this company to allocate a special pay-rate to a newish intern.

A further nuance, another department at the company is interested in hiring me, so I wonder if I can use that as leverage. My guess is that it would cause unnecessary drama and make them think I'm wishy washy.

Here's my approach: I was going to be to tell the manager, ""I think my labor is worth $22/hr,"" which is a *bit* of a highball. It's essentially a $4 raise, which I don't expect to get. My second offer will be $20.20, which is a $2.20 raise.

I don't think I have enough time to go the, ""I have three better offers lined up"" route, which I know is a better route. I will be studying full-time abroad all fall and won't be back until after Christmas. (I acknowledge that Skype interviews are possible, and I might take this route if they decline my request for moar money).

Finally, I don't feel I have *too* much to lose. I am not that interested in working for this company once I graduate. I won't take this attitude with me into the interview with my manager, but I think it makes me more willing to try out asking for more money.

TL;DR, I am only 8 weeks into my job, but HR told me I could negotiate a wage to match my previous internship, prior to my second rotation. Not sure what approach to take, if any, since I don't have any offers lined up for January, which is due to being out of the country. My idea is to say simply, ""I think my labor is worth $22/hr and that's what I want my pay-rate to be in January,"" and see where it goes from there. I have 4 years of engineering internship &amp; 5 years of engineering school experience, but not super interested in working here after graduation."

6ohpq6,2,2017-07-20,"Feeling completely deflated. What can I do, at this point?",MaximumIntroversion,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6ohpq6/feeling_completely_deflated_what_can_i_do_at_this/,"I apologize in advance for what will probably be a long-winded post. I partially just feel like venting, but I guess I'm also looking for some glimmer of hope.

I guess the core of my frustration is that I'm inching closer and closer to 30, and I've amounted to nothing, career-wise. I've spent the last nine years working low end retail/ customer service jobs. Truth be told, I hate retail/ service, but for people with limited qualifications, that's basically all there is. The point is, I have no desire whatsoever to move up into management or corporate, or anything like that. Just to put that out there.

After high school, I spent a few years kind of aimlessly taking classes in college. I was always the type that ""didn't know what they wanted to be when they grew up"". Never even had the slightest idea, really. I'd always just hoped I'd eventually find something that made sense to me. I found myself really hating college because I just didn't feel like I was actually moving towards something. Eventually, though, I finally figured out that I felt I had a good affinity towards working with video, specifically editing and post-production, and I focused my education on that, and completed it. Not with, like, a four year bachelor's degree or anything, mind you, but still. During that period, I tried hard to take advantage of the internship opportunities that the school fielded, but I really never found any video-related ones, and I never was really able to ""network"" with anyone in the industry.

I finished school and spent a couple years scouring for and applying to any opportunity I could find for that type of thing. I tried applying to any and all local TV stations, I tried looking for and reaching out to any production companies that might be looking for help, I looked and looked and looked, and applied to whatever I could find, even if it was an unpaid internship, but I just couldn't get my foot in the door anywhere. I've tried looking for local film groups, or whatever, that I could maybe even just mingle with, but even that has turned up a lot of nothing.

The conclusion I came to was that this was a failed endeavor. Which sucks, but I mean, that's life. It happens. Since I couldn't do it professionally, I decided to at least do it as a hobby, and I made a YouTube channel that I've been playing with for the last year and a half. My channel has been totally unsuccessful, I have no audience, and it doesn't look like that will ever change, but it's just a hobby, at this point, so I'm not particularly bothered by that.

But the problem is, I've never had a ""plan B"". It took ages for me to figure out I had an affinity towards working with video. That was about the only thing I could ever come up with. I'm not against, like, returning to school, but I don't want to go back without a ""plan"" in mind. I don't want to spend another however many years floating around aimlessly and hoping maybe something else will stick. And I don't know what else to do.

I've spent some time looking over degree programs from colleges, trying to see if I could find something that I feel like makes sense for me, to pursue as a new endeavor, but nothing has clicked with me. I've tried taking, like, I guess you could call them ""career aptitude"" type tests, but their results always turn up menial things that I just can't see myself doing. I've tried looking up local temp agencies, but they all basically say that they primarily place people in jobs for sales, call centers, customer service, etc., which isn't really different enough from what I'm doing now.

I just can't figure out what my ""place"" in life is, and it's frustrating to still be stuck in low end service jobs, with absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel and nothing on the horizon. I'm tired of this being my life. But I just don't know how to find a way out, at this point. And I don't really know what else I can do. What CAN I do?"
6ohsyz,4,2017-07-20,Chase my dreams or chase the (bigger) dollar?,soilislife,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6ohsyz/chase_my_dreams_or_chase_the_bigger_dollar/,"So I'm 26, graduated with my bachelors this spring and currently ready to start my Masters in Civil Engineering with a focus on Transportation and Traffic this fall. I love the field and my dream career is being a Traffic and ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) Engineer. The field is much easier to break into with a Masters though. The median pay is good, but I always catch my self thinking about the more lucrative careers like CS, ""Big Data"", finance, management consulting, etc. I always think the grass is greener on the other side.

Now, I have no real concerns about getting a job in my field post graduation. I did very well in my undergrad, plenty of intern experience and I've been offered full time positions this summer in tangentially related fields I liked (roadway/highway engineering). The starting pay offers were around 50-55k for a 45 hr work week, and a masters would bump me up another 5k. Mid career I'd reasonably expect to be in the 80k range at least. 

Like anyone else I dreamed of a mid 100k salary with a huge bonus. I plan on having kids and would prefer if my wife didn't have to work to ends meet. While I love what I'm passionate about, finishing up a masters in CS while creating my own projects or getting some work experience before trying to get into the best MBA program sound promising as well. I can imagine scenarios where there are some aspect of these careers I would excel in, making the amount of money I feel I would need.

The only thing really stopping me is the fact that I would be losing more income not working and incurring more debt to chase the dollar. But also the risk could always outweigh the reward I know this all sounds stupid, but this is a constant tug of war. So in my situation, what would you do or recommend?"

I got 3 phone interviews so far and 1 offer (the other 2 are still pending). The recruiter that gave me an offer said their maximum budget for this position is $48k CAD + health insurance.

The thing is, the internship I had in school (which was also full-time and lasted for over a year) gave me $50k annually. I was hoping to get a job which paid me more than my internship since I now have full-time experience and more beefed up credentials.

This discrepancy might be because I interned at a Fortune 500 company which might mean they had a bigger budget as opposed to this current company that I am considering.

But I am getting anxious because I am not sure if the other 2 interviews I had are going to result in offers...If I don't get better offers from them, I may mess up if I refuse this one.
Would any of you advise that I settle for $48k or do I keep applying to get a better deal? I am not sure what the consensus usually is with regards to graduating then taking a job that pays less than your school internship."
6oiebf,5,2017-07-20,Low GPA Masters Admission,MSMEdreams,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/6oiebf/low_gpa_masters_admission/,"Hi Everyone,

Sorry about another low GPA post, but I haven't found anything on my particular situation so I figured I'd reach out and see what the public has to say.

I graduated in 2015 with a B.S. in Physics from a state university and achieved a low GPA: about 2.5.  On top of that, I have no research experience. My problem at the time was a lack of motivation.  I got lost in a sea of ""where am I going in life?""  I'd like to believe that I'm way past that by now.  

After graduation, I got lucky enough to immediately land an engineering internship position.  I worked my ass off, staying late every day without taking any extra pay to get everything done.  The hard work paid off and after about 6 months, I got hired as a full time employee; a Mechanical Engineer.  I have worked at the position since then (~a year and 7 months). 

Since coming into this position, I've found my passion and have never wanted anything more than to become a productive engineer and to learn as much as I possibly can about the field.  It truly fascinates me.

My goal is to earn a Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering.  To fill in some theoretical knowledge gaps, I've began to take MOOCs (massive online open courses), and to fill in some more practical gaps, I've started volunteering at a local maker-space where I can gain hands-on experience with several manufacturing techniques.   I also plan on doing some hands-on projects to display my design skills and drive to guide a project to completion.  I was thinking of making a Segway-like device to start off. 

I'd like to know what I can possibly do to get into a Masters program.  It seems like completing some graduate courses as a non-degree student is what people recommend, but I'm worried that I may not even be able to accepted as a non-degree student due to my low GPA.  I truly have confidence that I have the ability to prove myself now - it's just getting the opportunity.  The other side of things is that it seems like I need research experience.  Would that mean that I would need to look for a research job?  Is it unheard of for professors to take volunteers during nights/weekends?  

I'm looking to work hard towards my goal.  I just need a path."

I come from a middle-upper class family. Both my parents had jobs that paid well. We lived in the country and had a nice cabin up north that we visited frequently. He lived in a mobile home park with his single mom. I later learned that he had come to the area with her after a very nasty divorce. When the hauntings started, everyone chalked it up to emotional turmoil and overactive imagination. I wasn't old enough to understand the first, but I know they had that second part right. That guy could DRAW!  

We were an interesting pair, I had a creative mind, but my interests tended more towards math and science. He could draw, invented crazy games, and could play nearly any instrument he picked up. I can't say I excelled at classes, but I did enough to get by, and the teachers were always commenting on what a bright young man I was becoming. Johnny, on the other hand, did rather poorly in class. As we progressed in our education, it became more and more difficult to hang out together, as the academic paths we took seemed to pull us apart.  

The first time that I stayed over at his house, I was a little put off by where he lived. Being a bit of a spoiled, only child, I was used to the open, clean, well-lit house of my parents. The single-wide that he lived in was strange and new to me though, and the excitement of my first sleep-over overcame that particular class divide. My parents did raise me with manners, so I finished the dinner that his mom gave us with a smile and a ""Thank you, Miss Fulton!""  

That night we stayed up watching scary movies that my parents would never have let me watch. When his mom came out from her room to tell us to go to bed, we were both too wired on adrenaline and Mountian Dew for that! Even if I had been tired, the foreignness and the tight, dirty feeling of the place would have kept me from sleeping.  Lying on a sleeping bag on the floor in his cramped room, I was directly below a shelf holding his collection of sketch pads. It was summer, and the unit didn't have an air conditioner. Instead, a fan was situated by the open door, and the window was open to pull a breeze through. I remember hearing the pitch of the fan change, as though someone had moved past it. As me and my bag occupied the only floor space in the room, I braced to be tripped over, but nothing happened. Looking up in confusion, I saw the doorway was empty. At that moment, I felt a sharp pain to the top of my head, and something fell past my face. Having just watched a few hours of brutal murder, I reacted how anybody of my age would and screamed my head off. This did bring his mom into the room, and after a bit of confusion and calming, we found that the source of my surprise had been a couple of his sketch books falling off the shelf.  Their cat, António must have climbed up and knocked them down. That would explain what I had heard come into the room. 

After his mom left (""Those damned movies"") we tried to get back to sleep again, but to no avail. As I lay with my eyes tightly shut, I remember hearing him whisper to me, ""That wasn't the cat, I was watching. It was the ghost. Mom doesn't believe me, but one lives here."" I replied that that was stupid, ghosts only lived in old abandoned buildings with spider webs over the windows. I believed him, but really didn’t want to. He told me that I didn't know anything about ghosts, and that António didn't like coming into his room because of his ghost. That's how he said it, “my ghost."" The next weekend, he stayed over at my house. I don't remember anything odd about the night, but later my parents would tell me that our dog hadn't left my side the entire time Johnny was in the house. 

We stayed friends through most of high school, although by the end, we were more like good acquaintances than the ""best friends"" of our youth. I went to a private university for engineering, and he went to community college while working at a string of local businesses. Was I created a new social circle, joining a fraternity and several student groups, our communications nearly ended. The last time we met, it was at a local dive bar. There was a small crowd of regulars, but I do remember noticing a couple of young women sitting at the bar as soon as I walked in. I filled him in on my endeavors, and found that he had been studying psychology! ""I had you figured for an art major! Weren't you trying for your dream job of doing make-up for horror movies?"" He uncomfortably shifted and replied that he had “kinda started on something else.” He seemed fidgety after that. It was like he was building up the courage to ask me something. As I bugged him about the details of his psychology, he asked me about an obscure German psychologist named Schiller. This caught me off guard. “I recently read a book that mentioned him. An old physicist, Niels Bohr had been interested in something he said…” 

“Yes, that’s it!” and he rattled off something in German that left me staring at him blankly. He gave me a look of patronage, chugged the rest of his beer and looked me right in the eye. “Those girls at the bar, do you want one? We could have them tonight.” I could only stare at him, my own beer partially raised to my mouth. “Wha…” was my dumbfounded reply. They were behind him. I naturally glanced over at them after he said this, one was looking at me interestedly. She was smiling, and looking right at me. The other, the one oriented away from us, was turning her head in our direction. I gave what I thought was a nice smile, nodded, and turned back to John. I thought I must have been glancing at them all night, that’s the only way he could have caught on. “I know you’re a virgin, we could fix that, you know.” This conversation would have made me uncomfortable with one of my fraternity brothers, but THIS, was downright creepy. “How did you know that?” 

 “What, the girls, or the v-card thing? They were both pretty obvious.” The virgin thing was true, and I always assumed that people could read it like a sign over my head. At least, that’s what I was telling myself at the moment. I had grown up quite religious, and the small college I went to made dating a lot harder. I can’t deny that a small part of me was actually interested in seeing where this went, and that made the situation that much more uncomfortable. No, this was all wrong, and creepy as all hell.  
 
“No? Your loss.” He shrugged, and the conversation drifted back to less dangerous topics. Now, I couldn’t stop glancing back at the girls. But I remember this. They didn’t look over at us again the rest of the time they were there. It wasn’t pointed ignorance, it was natural, like we were part of the surroundings. On my way out of the bar, I managed to catch one’s eye, smile, and incline my head. She looked quizzically at me, then turned back to her friend like nothing happened. 

We lost touch after that night. A year or so later I saw an article on the internet about a drug bust in my home town. For some reason, this made me think of John. As I sat back, wondering what happened to him, my phone started ringing. The caller ID told me it was my mom, so I answered. 
 
“Have you talked to John lately?” Was the first thing she said. No questions about how I was doing, nothing about classes, just straight to the point. 
 “No, I haven’t talked to him in a couple years.” 
‘Are you sure? I mean, it’s okay if you have.” 

I chuckled. this was strange behavior, even for my mom. “I’m sure, but it is the oddest thing, I was thinking about him right as you called. I guess we’re on the same wavelength or something. What’s up?” She didn’t completely loose the mistrust in her voice, but continued to tell me that he had been caught with a lot of drugs in his apartment. It looked as though he had been manufacturing them. I needed to tell her right now if I was buying from him. 
 
“I have an internship that drug tests, I’d be an idiot to do that. And you know I don’t do drugs!” This last part wasn’t entirely true, but nothing that was “manufactured” and I certainly hadn’t bought anything from him. I don’t remember much more from this conversation, and John quickly faded into the recesses of my mind until another conversation with my mom. She called to tell me that he had killed himself. 

It wasn’t completely clear that suicide was his intention, or that what happened wasn’t his own doing. He was found in his apartment by a “friend” who came in to find him sitting in an old dentist’s chair with an odd contraption strapped to his head. He was staring off into space, mumbling the words “Turn him off,” repeatedly. Police investigation revealed that the contraption was a device apparently designed by him for the function of allowing one to auto-lobotomize. He died not too long after of a brain embolism. I don’t know what he was trying to do, but I guess it didn’t work out for him. 

The night after the funeral, while I was staying in my parent’s house, his mother stopped by. She had some boxes of old books that had belonged to John. She said that she remembered that I loved books, and that she’d rather have John’s valued possessions with me than to hand them over to a book store. She associated them with the way he had been before he died, so she didn’t want to keep them. The books remained deep in a closet for a long time. The owner of the house I was renting was selling the house, and I was throwing everything away on the advice of some podcast I had heard. I can be a bit of a slave to trends. 

Anyway, I quickly found that books made up the minority of what those boxes held. The bulk consisted of dozens of composition notebooks. Each was filled with a combination of orderly and wildly written notes on everything from psychology to chemistry, and, weirdly enough, what looked like notes on the Bible and demonology. The drawings of demons didn’t surprise me so much as their placement in the books. His drawings had taken on a demonic hint towards the end of high school, but why would he have them alongside complex chemical formulas? At the very bottom of the last box was the biggest oddity: a leather bound book, written in John’s hand. The cover had the title: “On Becoming One,” in large, ornate text. Thumbing through it, if I had to guess, it was the finished product of all the other notes that I had just looked through. It clearly had taken a lot of time and effort to write. I’m really busy with life right now, but I feel almost as though I owe it to John to read it. Seeing as it’s the last thing I have of my old friend, and what looks like the object of his life’s work, I feel like I need to try and understand it. But I also feel like I’m just getting drawn into the rantings of a madman. I’ll let you know either way.

I am a recent college graduate with a B.A. in computer science. I live in the Seattle area. I recently made it through an interview process and ended up with a job offer in writing for 65k a year. 
In my first interview the recruiter quoted me at a 65-70 salary range.    
   
I called the recruiter today and asked for 73k. (Fully expecting to meet somewhere in the middle around 69k) They seemed almost offended and said there is no way they could do that. I asked if there was any way we could negotiate up from the original figure. The recruiter told me it would have to be discussed and that I have now countered and the original offer is void and that they would get back to me.

I am kind of freaking out now because I would like to have a job even though the salary is a little on the low end for the area. The written job offer says I have until tomorrow to respond. Should I swallow my pride and sign the original offer? It it truly possible to verbally void an offer just by asking for more? Should I risk losing an offer all together and wait for them to respond?
   
Some additional facts:   
I have no experience in the industry other than an internship.   
I graduated with a B.A. instead of a B.S.   
I graduated near top of my class with a 3.8 GPA.   
   
Update: I got more money."

6oldm7,1,2017-07-20,What are important factors when applying to CS Masters program after a few years in industry? Low grades in core CS classes except for those related to subject of interest.,heres_some_advice23,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/6oldm7/what_are_important_factors_when_applying_to_cs/,"I have a 3.75 GPA from a top 5 computer science school. Unfortunately, my CS grades aren't great (got a B+ in all of my core cs classes (algorithms, discrete, compilers) except for systems and software engineering (My research interest is in systems)), so I am planning on joining the workforce for a year or two before applying to graduate school.

If I am wrong on this please let me know, but I have a hard time believe that Stanford or CMU MS would accept a student who did mediocre in the core algorithm class and has below a 3.9 gpa (it seems that the vast majority of accepted applicants have above a 3.9). It is worth noting that I will have 2 published papers by the time I apply, as well as 3 internships at top tech companies related to my interests.

My question on applying after some industry experience is: what can a candidate do in order to raise his chances into getting into CS masters programs while they are working in industry? Do admissions panels really care that you worked at some tech company for 2 years? Does work experience play a substantial role in improving ones chances? I have a job lined up as a low-level systems engineer at a top tech company. However, I find it hard to believe that this is enough to substantially increase my chances compared to where I am now. What are admissions panels looking for from industry-experienced applicants that is different from what they are looking for from undergraduates?"

6omm9k,2,2017-07-21,Undecided &amp; Uninterested but need to choose my major soon! help!,undecided19,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/6omm9k/undecided_uninterested_but_need_to_choose_my/,"tl;dr Cant decide what to major in: finance,anthro,econ,math. No passions only slight interest in anthro but want a good salary. 


Im a sophomore at a top 20 private university with little interest in any major. A lot of kids at my school come from rich families who can afford to spend 70K a year on their kids, but my family is middle class and Im on a really big scholarship. I don't have rich parents too fall back on, and I don't have parents with connections to any good company. People say to find a job that you love but I think I'm the type of person who's job will just be a ""job"". I can't see myself loving any job I do. A big part of choosing a career for me will be finding one that pays well.

So I started out freshman year thinking i wld major in anthropology on a pre-med track but I hated chemistry so much and almost failed the class 2nd semester. I had strict parents and no good friends growing up, so ended up partying and drinking too much freshman year and ended the year with a 3.1 GPA after having taking the minimum number of credits each semester. Now that Im reflecting over my freshman year decisions, I regret not taking other classes in other areas and not exploring major options because now I have no idea what to major in when all my friends are declared by now. And I regret not working harder too bc my GPA is so low compared to my friends with 3.5+ GPAs and its uncompetitive in the internship market. 

I really want to major in engineering or computer science but I don't think I have the mindset for it and Im not smart enough. (If I couldn't do chem how cld i expect to do engineering right?) Honestly, I just like the idea that that a career in this field is so respectable and pays well, and that Id be part of the small percentage of minority females in this field.
Other options would be anthropology major with finance as a 2nd major since I don't want to switch to the business school. Or maybe a econ major or maybe a math major. 
I got an A- in Calc 2 without even trying last semester and I always did well in Math in high school so thats why I'm considering math. Im considering econ and finance bc they pay well after college (compared to just anthro) but I've never taken a class in any other these areas tbh.

Honestly, I just think that all these majors are boring and hard and don't know what to do. When I read the descriptions of the classes in these majors, and it just bores me. The closest thing to a subject I find any interest in is probably sociology or anthropology but I would never solely major in this.

I don't need to choose my major now i know, but I do need to be somewhat on track before the next school year. My scholarship is only renewable for 4 years so I need to graduate on time. Also, I really want to study abroad since it seems like a onceinalifetime chance (the scholarship pays for it and I cld never afford to go abroad without my scholarship).

Everyone says that you have ""so much time to decide"" and that ""you'll find what you're passionate about"", but nothing has clicked for me and time is running out. 

Any advice on what to do?

6oo09d,4,2017-07-21,Becoming back-end/full-stack from front-end web dev.,purpleboy123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6oo09d/becoming_backendfullstack_from_frontend_web_dev/,"I'm a student who's going to university to study CS/Electronic/Computer Engineering in Autumn 2018. I've been learning Python so far, and wish to learn HTML, CSS and JS before starting university so that I have experience with programming. My goal is to create multiple web apps and websites to showcase my expertise (if I hopefully have any).

The thing is, I've heard from many employers here that many applicants from CS background have little experience with programming so I was thinking of perhaps doing contract work or an internship if my first year at university, during summer 2019, if I'm good enough to work for companies like that, but my ultimate goal is to work in back-end or full stack or (something I'm really interested in) big data. However, I was wondering whether you can use the experience of web dev during university to get a job in one of those sections of the industry, especially big data.

The university I want to go to has modules on C programming, Java programming, functional (i.e. Haskell) programming and SQL programming, but these modules are done at the end of the first year and the subsequent years, rather than the start of the first year (when I'll be applying for internships and contract work) and there's a placement year for the courses at this university, and they're well-known for getting almost 100% of their graduates into professional or managerial roles, but of course, I'd like to do work experience during the summers to gain 1.75 years of experience, but the only ones I can find in back-end or big data tend to require lots of experience or, if they're internships, there's few of them and they're very competitive, but I've found a lot of web dev internships and contract work, many of which are 3 months, which would be perfect for the 3 month summer holiday. However, I'm worried that an employer will look at this web dev experience and think I'm not good enough for back-end or big data.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Want to do web dev internships and contract work during university summer holidays, but my ultimate goal is work in back-end/full-stack/big-data."

I also worry about age. I'll be in my early thirties by the time I finish this degree and even be ready to apply. I wonder if this will be a problem in getting hired at a good company.  Another problem will be internships. Am I too old for those?

Today I singed a contract for an internship in a studio here in Germany, it's a pretty big studio, I've played all their games and landing a job here has been something that I can't still believe!!!

And there is the problem... monday I will start working there and I'm terrified... I feel like an impostor, I have 0 real experience, I feel like they will think I'm retarded or something... I don't know why I feel this way (I'm a pretty confident person overall and always had good grades) but I don't know... it's such a big chance and in a way I feel I'm not ready.

Has any of you ever felt this way? is it normal? "

A working holiday visa is typically valid for 12 months and gives you the right to work in the destination country.  
Has anyone gone through this process before? What resources and job sites did you use in order to find a job abroad as an monolingual English speaker?  
A contract position would be most ideal, as it would work well with the finite nature of my working visa, however, I would also be open to internships and really any job in my field that would hire me."

My friend from college is at MSFT right now and referred my resume to HR for an internship next summer.

In my spare time I have solved 64 Leetcode problems to prep for next summer's interviews because I really want to go out west to Seattle or SF.

What concepts should I focus on? I am running out of time and need to take an 80/20 approach. For example, I've been told not to expect DP and trie questions, but to definitely know array and string permutations, linked list and tree traversal and hash tables....so that is what I have practiced!

I have looked through past posts, but thought that maybe things have changed in 2017 since most of them are 1-3 years old.

So a about five weeks back I finally left my job as a server to start working at a gas station that's a closer drive and pays just a bit more, but something happened to where they only have just recently scheduled my training for next week. My original plan was to start working at the gas station and quit my other job as well since I have an internship this fall that would take up a good bit of my time and all three of those plus being a full time student would be hell. BUT since my training got pushed back I worked a few more weeks at my current job and even got a raise; it's still not much but it would match what the gas station would pay overall. The issue I have is this, I'm actually starting to consider not leaving my current job but leaving before I start work at the gas station. Because I have the internship, which is paid, I feel comfortable not having two other jobs as backups. Though the gas station would give me more hours and is also a much closer drive and would actually probably be better long term since they offer paid vacation and some semblance of health insurance, my current job is basically weekend focused, allowing my internship to be my focus during the week, and is much more forgiving with scheduling. So what path should I take?"

I am finally finishing up my undergrad in Computer Engineering this December. But the thought of not having a job is already depressing me. I have a lot of student loans to take care of, so I don't really have the luxury to wait for a job. 

I went to almost every career fair that the school holds, but to be quite honest I don't find it very useful since most employers want me to apply online. I've only went to the career fair to find internships. Never a full time job. 

I can really use some good advice on what to do to have a job guaranteed after graduation. Should I contact some sort of agency? Should I email requiters? What can I do to make a good impression to at least land an interview? 

Thanks a lot in advance. Looking forward to some great advice.  "

I am a developer who has just graduated university with a BS in CS. As of this past Monday, I am a full-time employee of a financial software company. It's a good company and I feel very fortunate to have been hired. Up to this (early) point in my career, I am mostly a back-end developer, and have a lot of experience with OO dev and OO languages. This is the competency that I would like to maintain and improve upon.

Anyway, in this new role, I am working as part of a team that is responsible for the trading platform. As you might imagine, speed here is crucial. The platform is primarily C++. I enjoy working with C++ and am pretty good with it, having worked with it extensively in school and in previous internships. But I can't help but feel a little uncertain regarding the value of continuing to use (and improve at) C++. Put another way: should I be concerned about my future market value as a C++ developer?

6or7l4,10,2017-07-21,Obligatory I passed the 220-901 Exam Post ((804) + 902 Question +Tips,coryt_sec,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/6or7l4/obligatory_i_passed_the_220901_exam_post_804_902/,"I've been studying for the A+ for about a month and a half. I was planning to get the trifecta finished before school started back up again in late August to help land an internship next summer (In InfoSec or Network Engineering). At the bare minimum, I was planning on Network+ by the end of summer, and I figured by now I'd be almost ready to take the 902, but you know life happens. 


I put my 902 question at the bottom because I figure people are like me checking the sub daily for any study tips/prep material reviews they can get.




**My background:** I'm a Senior in a Computer Science program, 25-30 years old. I have no professional IT experience, but I have been obsessed with computers for as long as I can remember. Even learning HTML in the 90s to publish a DBZ fan website(lol). I have built, maintained, and upgraded my own computers for about 15 years now. The most intensive repair I have done was replacing my old laptop's LCD screen about 5 years ago (I wish I knew about those dang WiFi antennas back then) and later replacing the DC jack. 


I have my own homelab with 2 servers, a Cisco switch, and I just added a pfSense router this week that is running on a Lenovo SFF computer.




**Prep Material Used**: I decided to start out with [Pluralsight's A+ Course](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/comptia-a-plus) because I had a free trial from being a student.


The content was good and the modules were set up so each one corresponded with a specific exam objective. At the end of each module, he assigns homework which I actually liked. It ranged from reading your desktop computer's motherboard manual to figure out what the maximum RAM upgrade you could install in it and then go price it, to analyzing WiFi networks around your home and seeing how you can optimize your wireless network by changing the channel.


They also list related Pluralsight courses at the end of each module and for most people, I think going through those is overkill, but if you have a limited computing background or are extremely weak in one subject then it would help.


The modules are divided up into 4 courses, each one covering one of the broad exam objectives. They have 10 question practice quizzes for each course. The questions themselves are good to take after you finish each course but are not as challenging as the real Exam or some of the practice Exams I took and after taking it 4-5 times you start to get the mostly the same questions.




**Pluralsight Trials:** There are two that you can get with an EDU email, VisualStudio will automatically create a Pluralsight account for you. Microsoft Dreamspark(Imagine) will give you a key that you can redeem, but for some reason, you can only use the key when creating a new account, not an existing account. I contacted their support email about this and they couldn't tell me why it was set up this way.


[Microsoft VisualStudio](https://my.visualstudio.com/)


[Microsoft Imagine](https://imagine.microsoft.com/)


[Link to redeem the Pluralsight Trial Code](https://pluralsight.com/training/offers/?cc=Imagine)


After finishing the Pluralsight courses I started to watch Professor Messer's videos on 1.5 speed and sometimes only paying half attention to them. I kind of wish I had done 1.25x and paid more attention to them, but at this point, I was so bored with some concepts(mostly Objective 1 stuff I knew before deciding to take the A+) that I just wanted to rush through it and get the exam over with.


I'm glad I used /u/professormesser videos and Pluralsight because on some things it did help having two points of view and some things 1 covered but the other didn't. The only thing I can think of off of the top of my head is Professor Messer mentioned TRRS where as Pluralsight only mentioned TRS.




**Studying:** My friend who has his A+ gave me Professor Messer's course notes, but they were so invaluable I would have bought them had he not. 


I also used the set of 1500 [Anki flash cards](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j65faz8m1ww4evs/A%2B%20901.apkg?dl=0) that are pinned in the CompTIA Discord chat. I tried searching the subreddit for the creator, I think it's /u/hhhax7 if it is let me know so I can give you credit.


I also used the [A+ Acronyms Anki flash cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/5t0945/i_made_an_anki_flash_card_deck_for_studying_the_a/) that /u/Stiverton made. Again a set I wish I had started using much earlier.


I made my own flashcards with [gFlash+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gwhizmobile.gflashplus) it's a simple app I've been using for a few years. I like it because you can easily make a flash card set using just a 2 column GoogleDocs Spreadsheet. I used it mainly to study things I was having a hard time remembering that Anki didn't cover often enough because the flashcard sets are so huge.


Be careful with other people's flash card sets, and confirm every flash card you think may be incorrect. I've seen a few that had one word wrong. The one I can remember is 


&gt;""What is one disadvantage of GPT?""


&gt;""GPT cannot support hard drives larger than 2.2 TB"" 


And it should be ""can support hard drives larger than 2.2 TB""




**Practice Exams:** I used all of the free practice exams, bought Professor Messer's A+ practice questions PDF, took all of Professor Messer's daily A+ pop quizzes as they came out for the last month, and went through and watched 4 most recent Professor Messer A+ study groups.


ExamCompass' tests are way harder than you will actually see on the exams, but take them anyway because I guarantee you will learn something new that could somehow help you. I found their best test was the 110 question 901 Acronyms Quiz.


CrucialExams and GoCertify were more like what you would see on the exam and almost on par with Professor Messer's questions. I went through all of the Professor Messer questions and graded myself at the end and reviewed what areas I was bad in to focus my study habits on. His exams were the closest to the exam questions, but maybe not as specific as the exam questions. The exam questions would mostly throw 3-4 symptoms at me for troubleshooting where as maybe his questions mostly would have only thrown 1 or 2.




**The Day of:** Get there early especially if this is your first time at the testing center. I did not follow this advice because I kept studying and watching videos. My GPS I thought was telling me to turn into the parking lot but actually took me into a neighborhood and told me my destination was the wall dividing the neighborhood from the parking lot. I made it in there on time with no time to quickly study in my car (not that it mattered I accidentally left my Professor Messer printouts at home).


Read the exam agreement before you go to the testing center because if you have test anxiety or are almost late like I was you can quickly skim the agreement and use the remaining time to take some deep breaths and calm your nerves.




**The Exam:** The exam was much harder than I anticipated. Against Professor Messer's study tips I actually did the Performance Based Questions first but flagged them for later review. Answer every question on your first pass through even if you think you are wrong, that way you can flag them and not have to worry about answering questions as fast as possible with only 5 minutes on the clock.


I actually thought I had failed the exam because on my first pass through I must have flagged more than half of the questions and only on my 3rd pass through of my flagged questions did I finally have none flagged, but that was mainly a ""well I don't have much time left and probably won't get this one if I haven't by now"" mentality because I still had other questions to review. Once I had no more questions flagged I had 9 minutes left and was able to quickly check all of the questions, mainly checking the non-flagged ones just in case.


As far as pin counts go I had questions about cable pin counts, but no RAM or CPU pin count questions. 


I had a few printer questions, but not as much as other people have had.


On the troubleshooting questions read everything slowly and ask yourself if this makes sense. Like if you have made it past POST and get a blue screen in Windows maybe it's a driver error rather than bad/underpowered hardware.


The best advice I think I saw in a Professor Messer Study Group video was using the process of elimination on choices, if you know that some answer choices are not related at all to the question you can eliminate them and usually get down to only 2 options to pick from. There were only a few where I was able to eliminate all the choices except the correct answer.


The craziest question I had that I don't think anyone would get unless they have a solid grasp of the Theory and Math behind Computer Networks was on the actual workings of ECC RAM. I wish I could say more, but it was a short question and any more info I give on it would easily give away the question. I was blown away that they would ask it since I hadn't seen it covered anywhere. I only got it right because of a Computer Networks class I took last year.


I started to stress out over the acronyms a week ago after printing out the exam objectives and realizing most of them I had never seen before, but for the most part reviewing the acronyms didn't really help me much because they never came up in questions on the exams.


**After:** Pat yourself on the back and reward yourself with a nice stiff glass of the vice of your choice you deserve it. For the guy who posted this advice a few weeks ago and myself, it's a nice bourbon. Also, make a post and share your methods with other people, all of the ""I passed the 901"" posts where people detail their methods helped me out a lot.




**Question:** I was mainly taking the A+ to help prepare me for Network+, but also as a backup plan in case I can't land an internship next summer and need to take a Help Desk job after I graduate. Since it is so late in the summer I am thinking of studying for the Network+ next because I think it will look better for the internships I'll be applying for than the A+ would. My question for anyone who is both A+ and Network+ certified: how much overlap does the 902 have with Network+? Aside from objective 4.2(command line tools), it doesn't seem like it would have as much overlap as the 901 did. If that is the case I'm probably going to study for the Network+ next and slowly work on the 902 during the fall semester and study for Security+ in the Spring to take it before CompTIA retires the 401 in July 2018.

Had 3 phone interviews which all went well that led to nothing. Need advice. 


So, I went to Penn State for Information Sciences and Technology: Design and Development. I finished all of my classes already and the only thing I need to graduate is an internship. My biggest issue is that I have to get it in the Orlando, FL area.

I've applied to over 50 internships over the last several months (every single relevant one I could find in the Orlando area) and I've had one HR phone interview that went okay that didn't result in any follow-up interview, one phone interview that went really well and the interviewer told me it was extremely likely that he'd call me back, and a third that also went really well and the interviewer told me they'd be sending me an assessment quiz that was never sent. I followed up with an e-mail but received no response.

Every other internship I've applied to, I received either no response or a rejection e-mail. I've been applying to every tech-internship I can find, not just software development.

I think my issues involve the fact that I didn't go for Computer Science and that my projects aren't super amazing. I don't know what else to do besides keep learning and working on projects to try to build out my resume.

I cannot take an internship more than a 1.5 hours away from Orlando, FL as I cannot move. I am so lost here. I just moved to Orlando and spoke with a recruiter who will be looking for me, but I just want to graduate already and start making good money as my student loans will be due soon.

I'm passionate, I'm intermediate in a couple languages, and I have projects on my resume. I don't know what to do.

Any and all advice is welcome. Thanks everyone. "

6orz4b,0,2017-07-21,[Florida] Can a company refuse to hire someone because of a medical accommodation that the same company previously accommodated for the same employee?,ADAquestionthrowaway,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6orz4b/florida_can_a_company_refuse_to_hire_someone/,"Hi, sorry in advance for a somewhat long post. I'm changing some terms here and there to reduce how identifiable my company is.

I work for a company in Florida that owns some theme parks among other things. I am currently working in a temporary internship, and have been since late last summer. It was supposed to go from August to January, but my managers asked me to extend it twice, from January to May and then from May until now, because they don't want to lose me as an employee. My internship ends in about a week, and about a month and a half ago (the earliest they'd let me) I applied for part time or full time employment with the same company. About two weeks ago, I received a part time offer for a different location in the same park that I work in. I have a medical condition, and have two medical accommodations on file as a result. My current location has been able to accommodate both without issue for an extended period of time (1 for the whole year I've worked here, the other since december, so ~8 months or so). I called our centralized hiring office to verify that the new location could accommodate both, because the newer accommodation caused me to be denied a transfer after it had already been offered to me, back in January. So I stayed at my current location for the whole year. I also applied to stay in my current location that has been accommodating me this whole time, but from what I've been told there isn't any availability here, despite the fact that 5+ positions have opened up in the last two weeks or so, and despite the fact that my managers want me to stay at our location. However, it is up to the hiring office to decide if I can or not, not my managers. 

Over the course of the last few weeks, I've been dealing with the hiring office, and other departments, to get this worked out. For the most part, the issue was ignored. I called the day I got my offer, and they said I'd hear back in 24 hours. Then four days later I called again since I hadn't heard anything and they said to leave a voicemail for another department, who would get back to me within 24 hours. They never respond, so I call back a couple of days ago (about two weeks after I got my offer) and had to threaten a lawsuit to get the ball rolling. Multiple departments get involved, and within two hours or so I have two different departments looking for a different spot for me in case the new location can't work with my situation. I finally get a call back today, saying that the new location cannot accommodate me, so my offer has essentially been rescinded. They are looking for other locations in our parks and associated resorts that can accommodate me, but my internship ends in less than a week, and they've been dragging their feet the whole time. They've been saying that it could be four to five weeks before a decision is made about if I'll still have a job offer. I'm not from Florida, and I can't afford to stay here for a month without any income, which is going to require me to move back home (to Texas) next week, which these various departments are aware of. 

My understanding is that they have to handle situations with medical accommodations within a reasonable time frame. They've had my application for 6+ weeks now, they made me an offer 2+ weeks ago, and the whole time, the accommodations were on my file for them to see. They sat on this information for weeks and have done nothing to help until the last couple of days. It seems to me like they're trying to not accommodate me despite the fact that they can, and they're intentionally dragging it out so that I'll have to move away before they do anything. This seems like disability discrimination to me, since they clearly can accommodate me, but are going out of their way to not do so, or to wait so long to make an offer that I won't be able to accept it. Is constructive dismissal something I need to be worried about here? I know that's not exactly what that is, but it seems similar to me so maybe it's relevant. I'm not a lawyer so obviously I might be misunderstanding the situation, but I was wondering if you guys had any input.

Thanks!

6os1eg,5,2017-07-21,Should I know what kind of developer I want to be?,mr_manbearpig,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6os1eg/should_i_know_what_kind_of_developer_i_want_to_be/,"I’m a CS undergrad student who is graduating this December (WOOHOO!). My fall schedule (3 classes) allows me to work full time so I have been applying to both internships and full time (entry level) developer positions. I’m lucky enough to live in a super active tech scene (LA) and have had two interviews in the past two weeks, and I’ve connected with two other companies through networking. 

The positions I have been applying for have varied from general entry-level developers to Android developer internships to front-end developing. One of the interviews that I had was straight from Cracking the Coding Interview. They wanted to gauge my CS knowledge and how I solve problems. The other one, which was for an Android development internship, was pretty standard as well. However, one question they asked me made me get all introspective after the interview. The interviewer asked me something along the lines of “Why are you passionate about Android development?” I handled it well and said something like “I’ve been using a Galaxy phone for years and took a graduate class last year in Mobile Computing - which had projects based on Android. That’s where my interest in Android development started.” 

The thing is, I don’t have a particular “passion” for Android development or any other particular development for that matter. I made Android apps because I knew Java and because of my class. I know some web development because a group of friends and I made a cross-platform mobile app using Cordova. My first internship was with a .NET shop so I was exposed to all the glory that is MSDN. 

I loved it all. However, when people have asked what kind of developing I want to do (i.e. Web, embedded, Java, ect..), I don’t know how to answer. The thing is – I love coding and software development in general. I love solving problems and I have always felt that every problem has better and worse ways to solve it. I feel that I haven’t really been exposed to enough real-world situations to know what I would want to do all day every day. 

SO! My question is…Should I already know what I want to do? It would certainly narrow down my job search and help me to target certain companies. The only field I REALLY want to avoid is game development. I love gaming but after talking to a friend who works as a game developer, I am not looking for that kind of work environment. 

**Tl;dr – Soon-to-be CS grad loves programming but doesn’t know what to “specialize” in. Should he?**

I work part time, attend college as an animation major and have an internship at a animation studio ~45 minutes away from where I live.  

3 of my best friends have been living together for a little over a year now, and they (along with one of their girlfriends) have decided to move into a bigger house and invited me to move in with them.  

The house has 4 bedrooms and the rent is $700/month (split between five people, but doesn't include utilities). My main concern is my friend and his girlfriend breaking up, and then having to pick up the extra rent.  They haven't been dating for very long but they've known each other for a couple years.  

I don't mind living at home, I have a decent sized room and my mom doesn't really care what I do as long as I don't burn the house down.  I have a year left in school, and I can't help but feel like a huge loser because I still live with my mom.

I'm not really sure what to do, has anyone else been in a similar situation?  "

It's been a while, but I'll try to keep this brief. I'm currently interning in the Bay Area and before I started, I was really excited at the opportunity to be living out here. I had only been here twice before, and both times I really enjoyed it.

I'm originally from LA and I have found myself starting to miss the area. Don't get me wrong: the Bay Area is really nice and has been lots of fun to explore, but I miss being within driving distance to my friends. I miss being near the OC, and I miss other places that I was able to go to simply because I lived there. I guess you could call it a bit of homesickness too...

I'm torn for multiple reasons. 1 is that the general consensus is that the Bay Area (I guess Silicon Valley specifically, but I might be out of the loop) is probably one of the better/best places for software developers to work, and 2 is that I still really like the Bay, and there's more for me to explore, certainly enough that I won't be able to cover it all before I leave my internship in two weeks.

All of this being said, are there places to work in LA that'll enable me to make a living like I'd be able to in the Bay? In other words, can I make as much in LA as I could the Bay? I know salary isn't everything and that differences in cost of living will affect this, but it's something I want to be aware of as I consider where I want to be.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! :-)"
6ositq,1,2017-07-21,How should I approach negotiating a second internship as a paid internship?,anonintern17,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6ositq/how_should_i_approach_negotiating_a_second/,"(Originally posted on r/cscareerquestions)

For my Summer internship, I have been working as a developer at a local (well-known) organization on its SharePoint team.

Our team follows Scrum, and I have worked on the same tickets as other team members. I participate in and attend all Sprint meetings (standup, planning, refinement, review, retro). I also meet and communicate with customers to discuss tickets and ask questions. So in short, I am doing ""real work"" and not stereotypical internship work.

I have absolutely enjoyed my experience this summer and love working with my team. My mentor and team have both said I have been doing a great job. After demoing my work for a customer at a recent sprint review, the customer said I did a ""damn good job"" and also thanked me in an email after the review. I spoke with some of my team about it afterwards, and our PO said the customer privately had spoke to him, praised me, and said that he had only said that about two other times during his time at the organization.

Today I received an offer from my supervisor to continue as a Fall unpaid intern. Because of travel costs, I am unwilling/unable to be unpaid and stated this to my mentor before I applied. My mentor told me today she recommended to my supervisor for me to paid in the Fall.

I am looking for any advice on how to discuss with my mentor/ supervisor about returning as a paid intern and what would be a good way to approach this. Thanks.

I will be making enough money to build a decent gaming rig. I will also be working during the school year to make more money. I've wanted a gaming pc ever since I was about 11 years old when I got into MMOs. I want to know if having a gaming pc in a dorm room will be a nuisance for me or any possible room mates. When I apply for colleges and choose which college I will go to next year, I will try to obtain a single, but that's very unlikely to happen. What worries me the most is the possibility of having my stuff stolen: gaming gear(mouse, headset, keyboard), chair, the monitor, or even the pc itself. I have pondered the thought of buying a gaming laptop, but I would very much like to experience building my very own pc for the first time and also saving money. So, is having a gaming pc in college practical, or is it not worth the hassle?

Side note: I know I could be saving this money to buy books or save it for just-in-case situations(and I'm still wondering if that's the right thing to do), but having a gaming pc has been a dream of mine throughout my entire adolescence and I feel like the happiness it will give me will far exceed the financial burden(s) I will take on."
6osvbh,4,2017-07-21,Transfer tips for a prospective freshman?,user_namen,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6osvbh/transfer_tips_for_a_prospective_freshman/,"Hi guys!

A little backstory: I didn't do very well in high school and ended up earning a 3.7 unweighted GPA, 25 ACT with like a 19 in math, etc. I started off high school strong after always having been the quiet smart kid and kind of dropped the ball for awhile due to now irrelevant personal reasons. Not an excuse, just getting across that those stats don't represent the type of student I am.

Long story short, I got denied from every school except for the school I'm now going to attend in the fall. I know, I know, I should give my school a chance, and I fully intend to. The only problem is that my school is pretty well known for being quite terrible in academics (very low ranking state school) and a huge party school. Now there's nothing wrong with that, it just doesn't seem like it's my thing. I'm going to college to learn, not to party, and my fear is that the atmosphere of the college might compromise that. So, my plan is to go into the school giving it my 100% all to fit into the culture, and academically treat it as if I'm planning to transfer. I might decide that I don't fit in and transfer, or I might decide I like it and stay. Who knows? I might love it there, and worst case scenario is that I push myself a little harder than I would have and be an exemplary student, which is totally cool for me.

So my question is to students who have (or are going through) the transfer process: what are some things I should do in order to be a competitive transfer applicant to top-tier schools (like, say, the UCs)? Do you have any tips for me, having gone through the experience yourself? I plan to get as close to a 4.0 as possible, be very active in ECs involving my major (clubs and personal projects, as a computer science major), network as best I can with the faculty, and intern relevant to my major (if possible). Is there anything else I could do to improve my chances? Are there any things you did while transferring/preparing to transfer that you wish you did differently? Is the advice to applying as a freshman pretty much the same as applying as a transfer?

TLDR: What tips would you give an incoming freshman on being a competitive transfer applicant?

Thanks a ton in advance! I really appreciate it. :)

I started my IT career 3.5 years ago doing PC repair through geek squad, putting myself through school. I then got an internship with an MSP and was hired on, worked there for about 2.5 years. I ended up getting fed up with the bullshit office politics and inconsistency, so I started job searching. I landed a gig doing help desk items with promises of various projects as I progress and adapt to the companies culture. I am one of the only guys on the team with in depth server knowledge (besides the director). I have been here two weeks and I am getting the feeling that I am not going to be challenged very much. Most of the issues are with internal systems and it feels more like a tech support job than actual IT, I should note that its internal. After two weeks working here I do not feel very challenged and I am not sure if I am doing myself a service being so new into my career by taking a gig that doesnt seem to have much new experience to offer.  
  
That being said, im in a better place mentally, have more time to finish school and actually will be reimbursed for it, and im making 51k salaried as apposed to the 42k hourly that I had to grind for at my previous company. My family says that I just need to adjust, and perhaps they are right. I have been so used to putting out fires and dealing with shit issue after shit issue that I am not used to the slow pace that an internal gig can offer. Opinions and experience appreciated, im a young guy (23), trying to make my way and I just dont want to put myself at a disadvantage by missing out on an opportunity.

These posts are usually filled with regrets and realizations of where they've fallen short, and it's rather painful to see this.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has experienced this type of emotional response to these posts of desperation and despair on this awesome sub, but I'm sure many of the more experienced and seasoned veterans of the software development field who also participate in this sub have thought of ways that these students could have been more proactive and avoided being in a pressing situation where they can not find an internship/first job.

So to the people on this sub who have been through these situations before and have identified solutions for avoiding these scenarios, what are some general or very specific ways that students can act proactively earlier in their college career so that they can avoid feeling trapped as they approach graduation?

I'm not necessarily even looking for advice for me personally. I am currently a rising sophomore at a tiny Christian liberal arts college in the Midwest with a solid software internship in my hometown, and I feel like I'm on the right path. However, I recognize that any advantage I can give myself by acting proactively and spending my time wisely is something I want to pursue.

It seemed strange to me at first, and I made the argument that a typo such as `if( (getDataUsage() &gt; MAX_LIMIT) = false)` could end up with a head-scratching debug session. But, after a few months of using their `== false` methodology, it's kind of grown on me as a more natural way of reading a lot of code.

Honestly, I have had great experiences, such as flying over to France to join a conference (and meet Lo'real CEO visiting us!), dealing with pressuring situations (such as server breaking down an hour before an important demo).

However, I'm concerned now - the team size is decreasing, and honestly, I feel I'm demanded of too much work compared to what I'm getting paid.

I have recently received BASc in Mechanical Engineering from one of the most prestigious universities in Canada. (3.8 GPA, 6 internships.. 2 of which at top-tier automotive engineering &amp; production fields)

That being said, I have been struggling to find a job over the past 6 months.  Job market for mechanical engineering sucks in Canada, and I feel very remorseful about choosing this profession. 

Therefore, I am considering a career switch to something that's more promising in terms of job prospects. Right now, I am looking into pursuing a second degree in computer science at UBC. 

For those of you who have some insight into IT/software fields in Canada, I'd like to ask you how good job market is, and some advice.

Thank you,

Summer rolls around and I want to keep working at the startup.

I feel like I should say something, sue them, or whatever. So far I've added quite a lot of value to their product. I've fixed two critical bugs, implemented Facebook analytics and user activity tracking. I've added at least two new features crucial to the next version of their platform. 

I just kind of went along with the whole unpaid thing because I thought it was a good experience, good for my college application, good for connections and whatnot. Plus, the founder told me that she talked to a bunch of other startups who all said they took on unpaid interns. I'm kind of lost at this point.

I attended community college first and got two associate's degrees. I was in the honors college and never had a schedule below 21 hours. I was also very involved in my college's student organizations. I will be working towards a BS in Physics with the goal of transferring to a medical school and, hopefully, becoming a forensic pathologist for the FBI. 

My school has a program called ISS, which stands for Intelligence Security Studies. This program is a competitive minor and the requirements include an internship with one of the major government information agencies such as the CIA or FBI. I feel like this would be a great leg up on competition when it comes to trying to get a job with the FBI, but my schedule's pretty tight (I'll get to it) and this minor has its own requirements.

Currently, I guess you can say I'm behind in my studies. To apply for medical school I have to take 2 organic chemistry classes, which I have to take in two separate semesters. I'm currently only enrolled in the lecture class because the labs were filled. So somehow I am going to have to take the lab another time and take the other chem class + lab at the same time. I also have to take an advanced biology class and, let's not forget I have to fulfill the requirements of my major, which includes a lot of Physics classes (of course) and several math classes. 

My school also requires at least two years of a foreign language, which I did not take in Community College. This takes up another spot on my schedule and will continue to take up a spot because I plan to minor in this language. I'm also the type of student who wants to study abroad and am currently thinking about studying abroad in my language's country.

Can you see my problem?

I'm currently enrolled in 18 credit hours and that's only because I could not go above this for my first semester at the university. 

So I need your advice. Should I try to go for the ISS program and forget about the language minor and study abroad experience? Or should I study abroad and pursue an internship with the FBI on my own, without the ISS program?"

I am seriously considering moving to a European country in Fennoscandia or Germany or Ireland in the future. I really like European culture and languages, and I personally would prefer raising a family in these countries instead of Canada/China. I am open to the idea of doing a Master's degree in a European country if that will help me achieve my goals, and I'm definitely eager to learn the language(s) of the country that I will be (hopefully) settling in.

* Age: 20 

* Citizenships/Status: I am a Chinese citizen who has been living in Canada for the past 6 years. I can apply for permanent residency in Canada but I personally don't fancy the idea of permanently living here. I was born in Japan and I hold Japanese permanent residency (I could naturalize if I live/work in Japan for a few months). 

* Education Background: I'm currently pursuing an undergraduate/bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Waterloo in Canada. So I will most likely live here for another 2.5 years to get my degree.

* Language Skills: Native in English and Mandarin Chinese, N2 in Japanese, A1 in German and Norwegian, minimal French.

* Job Skills: 2-3 years of experience in Java, Python, Android, web front end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript etc.) and databases (Prometheus, InfluxDB, SQL, Postgres, Mongo); Fairly knowledgeable in statistics, linguistics, and machine learning (NLP, CV etc.)

* Work experience: 1 year in total from internships; One was at a multinational data security company developing and testing a crypto API, and another one was building scalable metric collection and storage solutions and developing internal build tools for an SF startup . I know I don't have much experience in this field, but I still have 4 more internships left in my degree so I will definitely be more prepared when I graduate.

* Criminal Convictions: None

* Temporary or Permanent: Permanent preferred, but I'm okay with moving around in the EU once every few years.

* Alternative Destinations: I'm okay with any country that speaks a Germanic language and has a significant presence of Germanic culture (and plus Finland).

* Spouses/Dependants: None

* Financial Situation: I will have some savings when I graduate from my internship earnings - tuition. Will probably have $15k CAD (~ 10k Euro) 

Thank you so much for reading this and any suggestions/input will be greatly appreciated!"

Need advice looking for first engineering job.,nathanwl2004,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/6p5oj9/graduating_soon_with_a_msme_need_advice_looking/,"As the title of this post says. I will be graduating with my MSME this December and I have a few questions that I hope some of you guys with more experience might be able to help shed some light on for me. 

1. Does a project based thesis and academic work experience count towards overall work experience? Although I have been designing and constructing precision metrology instruments throughout my graduate program, I don't know if anyone would consider this to be ""work experience""? My wife and I somewhat disagree on this (she is also about to graduate with her MSME, and is looking for her first engineering job as well). I am under the impression that our internship experiences and work as research assistants doing design work should count towards our overall experience in some way. She believes employers are only interested in work outside of an academic setting.

2. Along the same lines, where along the engineering career path should I be targeting? Are MSME graduates primarily hired for entry level positions or should I be looking slightly higher up the ladder? Obviously this is probably dependant on industry and whether or not the company has an actual need or desire for an engineer with a graduate degree. I'm just looking for some general guidance here

3. What are companies looking for with regards to required or desired experience. For instance say a company lists that they require someone with experience in control systems. I have taken linear and graduate non linear controls classes as well as graduate nonlinear dynamics courses. In addition I have worked with matlab and simulink in creating plant models. Additionally I have designed feedback control systems in labview as well as all of the required instrumentation sytems for a humidity controlled chamber I built. Would you guys consider this to be sufficient experience to claim a working knowledge of the subject?  For another example I have taken a course on computational fluid dynamics which involved a large project portion. Additionally I have done a significant amount of course and project work involving aerodynamics. What if a company asked for experience with computational fluid dynamics? I could not walk onto a job tomorrow and instantly start creating appropriate meshes and developing simulations, but I could get back up to speed on it in relatively short order. Should I list this as experience? What level of competency are most companies looking for?

I apologize for the long post but I do appreciate any and all help."

I've been learning Python 3 for a while now, but this has been bothering me lately. 

(Before I go on I'd like to add this valuable tidbit: *two* of the six-seven employers said as for Java proficiency, a **certification** would suffice.)

Right now I'm thinking to finish learning Python and then start on Java. However I would like to know about the worst case scenario: say I am still learning Java while the next job fair rolls around. Am I screwed? Or would a small portfolio in Python and partial knowledge of Java suffice?

I've been vaguely interested in computers/tech most of my life, but I picked a pretty generic IT program because I wasn't sure what niche I wanted to go into. 

This summer, I'm working an internship in a networking-focused company and while it's been a cool experience, the subject still isn't any less boring to me than it was in cisco class. 

But on the other hand, I'm taking a C class and I'm actually really enjoying it! So I'm starting to narrow down what I actually want to do.

The school I'm at offers some kind of webdev program, but they keep the degree programs pretty compartmentalized, so I don't think anything I've taken so far would really apply to that degree. But the course I'm in now has a pretty heavy emphasis on coding, even if it's ostensibly about Linux admin. Two C courses, two full-stack LAMP courses, and I'll probably take another programming class (Java or JS?) for my last elective. 

And obviously there are numerous other free or relatively cheap resources that I can use to buff up my skills on my own, which I'm planning on doing after I graduate. Learning JS and MEAN stack seems useful and interesting. 

Kinda got rambling, but my main question is, is this level of formal education and maybe another year of self-study a good plan to get into the field? I'm almost considering a bootcamp right after I graduate just because their placement rates seem so good, but there'd probably be some conceptual overlap with my LAMP courses even if they use a different framework, and they're expensive, and I'd have to figure out 6mo living expenses since there aren't any locally.

Thoughts? Ideas? Am I on the right track?

6p6jxi,13,2017-07-24,(xpost from /r/thelastpsychiatrist) Lando Calrissian and why startups are only for the living,plebpat,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/6p6jxi/xpost_from_rthelastpsychiatrist_lando_calrissian/,"Michael Seibel, president of the Y Combinator (YC), recently published an essay on the type of person startups make sense for. The original article is here: https://blog.ycombinator.com/why-should-i-start-a-startup/

For context: YC is a prolific investment firm for very young startups. Reddit was accepted into the first batch of YC companies. Seibel is a successful entrepreneur now turned investor. From his experience and job role, he has many data points on aspirational entrepreneurs who make it, those who don’t, and most importantly, *who those people were before we knew how they’d turn out*.

Language and ideas were the original “scaling platform”/software/meme, so it makes sense that YC would be interested in facilitating these platforms. Consequently, they also run a popular discussion forum (“Hacker News”) for people interested in startups and technology, colloquially referred to as “hackers”. Seibel’s essay was submitted to the forum for discussion and discussed heavily here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14806393. With ~280 comments and 500 upvotes in two days, it’s reasonable to say the post has struck a nerve.

I’ll save you the effort of trawling through the comments (that’s my job), but the most frequent reactions fall along these lines:


1. Loved it: Super motivating, I relate, let’s talk shop, tactics, mentors, tools, etc.


2. Hated it: This article encourages hubris about one’s ability, most startups fail and need luck. Also, privilege, lots of money, lack of wife, kids, family, mortgage, yada yada.


3. The ontologists: people who concerned with being. **This is where the gold is.**


To clarify, most people genuinely shouldn’t try to start a startup. Preaching that kind of tactic based panacea is just as helpful as telling everyone to be “happy”. 

What’s useful about startups, however, is that they’re rigorously executed petri dishes of life experiments. Startups are defined by growth, whether its users, time spent on the platform, revenue, profit, etc. For our personal case study, if we substitute growth for the more neutral term “change”, startups become fantastic case studies to a certain type of existence, specifically, a dynamic one. 

Back to ontology. There is a key moment that got pushed to the bottom where Michael tries to respond to Q&amp;A’s, and he has this insightful interaction:

A: What's the origin of your desire to be better than all of your peers?


MW: Because I realized that I could be better


B: In what ways? Sorry Michael, but I reject the idea that you can be 'better' than another person.


MW: I should have said I realized I could be better at the game of high school student looking to get into a good college.

Commenter B was looking for evidence that people in startups think they’re better than us plebeians. But give yourself a gut check of Seibel’s life and you can probably conclude this is unlikely. How’s that joke go again? Oh right. 

“Would you rather be a white woman or black male?” 

Though tech has gotten better and will continue to do so (proof: https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/16/stop-blaming-the-tech-industry-for-the-worlds-problems/), the reality is positions of power for men of color remain statistically abnormalities. On a good day, Seibel may have looked at his life and job and felt like the Obama of Silicon Valley. And for all the others, Chris Washington. Heck, that scene from Get Out might have been inspired by a hypothetical party I just made up where Billy Dee Williams/Lando Calrissian and Seibel bump into each other, and the two men give each other a wink and nod of camaraderie. “I see you brother, keep making cash.” 

Which is to say, it is unlikely for Seibel to have grown up internalizing that he was better than others. Read his original piece and this alternate hypothesis checks out. Now that we’ve set aside that interpretation, it begs the question: *what did he mean to really mean?*

“I realized I could be better” reads very different if we read it as “I realized I could **become Better.**”

Later on, when another commenter asks why the 3 constraints (1. underdog preference, 2. loves the thrill of poor odds, 3. Amor fati) that Seibel said were the preferred constraints of startup founders, he claimed no answer. After all, even Seibel won’t purport to have God-given Moses style tablets on the commandments of constraints that founders must have. 

With help from Nicholas Nassim Taleb’s “Antifragile”, we can conclude that all three constraints are great *heuristics* of the **type of shock** that biological systems benefit from. Cue the tape: 

“The bold conjecture made here is that everything that has life in it is to some extent antifragile (but not the reverse). It looks like the secret of life is antifragility. Typically, the natural—the biological—is both antifragile and fragile, depending on the source (and the range) of variation. A human body can benefit from the name Wolff’s Law after an 1892 article by a German surgeon. But a dish, a car, an inanimate object will not—these may be robust but cannot be intrinsically antifragile. Inanimate—that is, nonliving—material, typically, when subjected to stress, either undergoes material fatigue or breaks. 

We can use the distinction as a marker between living and nonliving. The fact that the artificial needs to be antifragile for us to be able to use it as tissue is quite a telling difference between the biological and the synthetic. Your house, your food processor, and your computer desk eventually wear down and don’t self-repair. They may look better with age (when artisanal), just as your jeans will look more fashionable with use, but eventually time will catch up with them and the hardest material will end up looking like Roman ruins. Your jeans may look improved and more fashionable when worn out, but their material did not get stronger, nor do they self-repair.”

Seibel can’t write too philosophically, or he comes off as a mystical Internet cult writer. Once again, that’s my job. So let’s put it together.

There is good evidence (Seibel’s data points as President of YC) to believe that, for a certain group of people, subjecting themselves to stress (in the form of unfavorable odds) is a desirable end goal. Further, we know that the indicator of living, organic systems is their system’s ability to grow from the right type of stressors: sprints in working out, not marathons; keeping a low personal cost of living so you can risk taking an unpaid internship at your dream company; etc. So what do this all mean?

For people who are more Life than Death, starting a startup is a fantastic way of becoming who you deeply want to be. Be it warrior, saint or thinker, many of the commenters never realized that Seibel was writing an article about **character formation**. In fact, he explicitly refutes financial success as the basis of why he recommends starting a startup. But because of his need for propriety due to his status, he can’t outright and say “adversity will give you the opportunity become exactly the type of person you respect, leading you to respect yourself more and be more satisfied. This is guaranteed regardless of the financial outcome.”

Why can’t he say this? Because there’s a non-trivial percentage of the population that is OK with “death”, living instead of Life. Fear sells much better than hope. And in their defense, even Taleb writes about this. Remember, most startup founders will financially fail, but the backroom secret is that most news fail to report the astonishingly high satisfaction rate (https://unsupervisedmethods.com/the-startup-failure-myth-b80fc4b6af45), even among “failed” entreprneurs, as opposed to the normal population’s job satisfaction (http://www.gallup.com/poll/188144/employee-engagement-stagnant-2015.aspx) The antifragility of the system requires individuals to be fragile. Barbells leverage means you need to have people manning libraries, fire stations and police departments vs. jetting off to Hawaii and crowdfunding video game playthroughs. If you’re willing to live like a pauper to do what you love, your self-satisfaction will be its own reward. 

The key is to choose with eyes wide open. Well, maybe a wink is fine ;)"

""qualifications"".

* First Coop: A hardware position, worked on printed-circuit board (PCB) design, embedded processor programming (in C)

* Side ""projects"": Nothing exciting, a few rudimentary Python scripts (such as a ESRI shapefile-to-XML converter, Facebook friend sorter), a (rather poorly made, unreleased) Android game

* Would Prefer: Something better than QA and IT support, preferably. Would prefer another embedded/hardware job if possible, I hate coding but would not mind a developer position if it were at all possible. No location preference, no salary preference, no company-name preference.

Additional Question: My first co-op was located in China, which maybe has a bad reputation(?)
 (Although I am very much Canadian in culture, birth, and citizenship). Would this affect prospective employers? (E.g. would they ""look down"" on internships in China due to say, the hypothetical unreliability of quality?). If yes, if there a way to remove the co-op location on the WaterlooWorks work history part of the application?"

6p9aza,2,2017-07-24,"I've been offered a networking/security role, but with likely little programming duties. I currently have a job, but it's minimal frontend work. New role would pay better. Local market usually shows 0 dev jobs. What do I choose?",csdad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6p9aza/ive_been_offered_a_networkingsecurity_role_but/,"**TLDR;** I'm married with a son, and we struggle with finances. I get small pay in my current frontend position. A company I've interned for offered for me to work in their tech department part-time - but more than just programming...they pay much better. Do I stay, or do I take the networking/higher pay position but obtain less (potentially little to none) programming experience?

# context

The local tech market has very few companies (mainly consultants), each only hiring a handful of employees. Despite this, I've been very fortunate/lucky enough to land a job as a student working for my university's web team. Before this, I was working sales positions to support my wife and our son. I made more money before, but my wife and I decided to bite the bullet, and take the paycut so that I could gain some experience in the field here...

I've now been here for about a year and a half, and it is a comfortable working environment...however, there's no room for growth (unless someone retires), and management is very political. I've done all of my work on time, made my manager look good, but have been shot down every time I suggest a new project or idea for them to expand on.

Things like:

- new faculty webpage templates
- new campus map
- new feature for degree exploration

have all been shot down due to concerns about lack of maintainability, and about ""issues with the level of skill with future student assistants."" I understand both concerns...however, due to this, I'm limited to really only gaining experience with ADA compliance issues, and creating custom widgets that fit within our CMS system. I've also been told that I won't be allowed to work on anything CMS related in the present or future (we're moving to Drupal), no matter my prior experience.

Presently, I've also been interning at a local company for the summertime. I'm creating a new website for them, and also creating marketing materials for their future use (very broad). The IT director has really been great to me the whole time, and has even suggested that I come back in the future to work again. He's also been savvy about giving me a project to work on (likely in C# or Visual Basic), following marketing's approval of the website and materials. It would tie into their current networking infrastructure in the future. He has also shown me some personal projects he'd be interested in bringing me in on (web hosting stuff + hobby interests).

The crux of the matter is that my boss at the internship is interested in keeping me on as a regular employee, free to work as much as I want around my classes. It would be less programming focused, and more holistic in the sense that:

- I would be learning about their network infrastructure and security systems
- Hardware maintenance will be involved (i.e. working on rigs, custom equipment)
- Potentially creating software that would, long-term, be used to replace expensive/hefty applications that they currently purchase

He would also like for me to get certified and focus on security. So I'd be looking at the Sec+, maybe Net+, as well as further certs down the line. All of this, he hopes, would eventually result in my working at the company - he feels that they need to train someone now, since he would like to retire in 5-6 years without worry for their current IT team (pretty small shop, but they're very smart and hardworking people).


**I don't really have any other options for employment around here beyond moving back to old sales positions.** I may try to intern next summer out of town, but my wife doesn't like the idea (neither do I really, but we could use the money). I graduate in the Fall of 2018. Would it be best for me to get more broad experience (plus pay and future employment!) in this new IT role, or stay where I'm at doing just frontend work?"

6pbh4l,9,2017-07-24,Dishonest timesheets (but I snooped on them) and being paid late...What to do?,throwawarchitect,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6pbh4l/dishonest_timesheets_but_i_snooped_on_them_and/,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this... please let me know if there is a better, more appropriate sub for this kind of thing. I need some advice and the small architecture firm where I work does not have a HR department. 

I have been working at an architecture firm for just over 3 years now and I really like it. Currently there are 4 project managers and 2 lead principals. Each of the project managers work independently on projects with the 2 principals. I love the autonomy and I have gained 2 very good mentors in my bosses. My experience in architecture is very different from colleagues that I graduated with in that I have learned much more about the process of getting a project built and taking on much more responsibility. Long story short: I very much like my job and think it's a very good opportunity. 

Lately, the 4 project managers have been getting paid late and last paycheck completely lapsed. This is not a massive problem for me as I do have some savings and I do not live paycheck to paycheck however, I have noticed a few things: 2 of my coworkers have recently returned from family leave and are now ""full time"". I have noticed that they do not come in on time and they do leave early. Our timesheets are stored on a shared network folder where we mark hourly time spent on each project. The files are for each individual employee but are accessible by all. I have opened their excel sheets many times to see how honest they are being with their hours (I realize this is not OK but I could not help myself). What I found were full 8 hour days and sometimes overtime hours (we get paid time and a half for overtime). It is possible to have completed work outside of the office because we have Teamviewer installed on the computers and they COULD work remotely, however, I have turned on their screens when they are supposedly working remotely and never see the screen change. One of these coworkers is supposed to be working remotely every Friday and I have NEVER noticed her screen being different from the beginning of the day to the end (no work is being done remotely). 

3 of the 4 of us designers are not registered architects and so we are essentially hourly employees but one of them who was on family leave and doesn't work on her remote day (Friday) is a salaried employee.

These employees are getting paid for work that is not being done and meanwhile, we are getting paychecks late. There is no doubt a correlation between the two events, however, the way that I have discovered the inconsistency is slightly shady and a breach of what I should be looking at. 

I'm upset that I am working full time and I am honest about my hours while my coworkers are lying about their hours and getting paid for it. The larger amount of money owed to them is no doubt delaying paychecks for all of us and it is simply unfair. 

My boss that deals with this type of stuff is very trusting (clearly) but has delegated ""watchdog"" status to these 2 employees. They are always a part of delegating new projects to full time employees and summer interns. I feel like they have his ear and trust and are taking advantage of my bosses, having the impact of delaying my paychecks. Ostensibly, this could be delaying a raise for myself because it appears to my boss like he doesn't have the cash to give me a raise when in reality it's there but being paid towards hours that aren't worked. I have been due for a raise since early June. 

I'm at a loss of how to address this situation for fear of the reaction of my boss knowing that I have snooped on my coworker's timesheets and comparing it to what I see them doing and NOT doing. 

tl/dr: I've snooped on my coworkers timesheets and computers and have seen them put down more hours than they work. We are paid hourly. We have also been paid late for the past 7 months and I think there is definitely a relationship to the timesheet inconsistencies. "

6pc1fn,0,2017-07-24,"Going to move to EEUU (NYC) in a year, I'm an Engineer that wants to get deeper into Programming.",Radinax,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6pc1fn/going_to_move_to_eeuu_nyc_in_a_year_im_an/,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask for advice, I read the FAQ and the sidebar first and didn't found anything that could help me so I'm going to expose my case, if this isn't the right place then direct me to the right one.

So I'm 26 y/o and my Mom died recently.. I live in Venezuela where I graduated as Electric Engineer at 22 y/o and was working as Physics teacher for three years. During my free time I was getting into Web Development (and using MATLAB in my work) learning the usual HTML, CSS and Javascript, I've been doing the Free Code Camp course for the last year and I'm stuck at the Tic Tac Toe section but still going at it.

I've been focusing a lot of my time into learning Javascript (no frameworks save Jquery) and have been reading YDKJS to further develop myself. 

So thats a bit of background of me, since I'm going to EEUU I'm going to be competing with the best of the best and I want to be at a good level and want to use my free time to getting deep into programming. I'm getting an Internship when I arrive but I still want some advice on couple of things:


- Seeing my background, which area would you recommend me going for? Computer Science? Computer Engineering? Software Engineering? Plain Programming? My math level is quite high considering my archivements. 

- Follow up from the above question, which careers are most wanted over there?

- I know I have to do actual Projects and showcase them in Github to show what I can do, what are some good ideas for Projects for a begginer in Programming such as myself? Seeing I'm about to finish Free Code Camp that should give you a general idea of my Javascript level.

- I also want to get deep into programming to further advance myself as an Electric Engineer and create software to solve problems in a future. Which languages would you recommend me to work on after I finish mastering Javascript?

- What would you advice me to do to further develop myself as a programmer in my free time? I saw a related question in the FAQ but another current opinion would be nice to read as well.

Thanks in advance, I'm willing to work very hard but I could use some advice and guidance into choosing the right path."
6pc4ev,1589,2017-07-24,Creepy Internet pictures come from somewhere,M59Gar,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6pc4ev/creepy_internet_pictures_come_from_somewhere/,"I drink not because I like alcohol, but because I've recently seen the horrifying underbelly of the world, and I can't go back to blissful ignorance in any other way than through the bottom of a bottle. I can't sleep, either, so I'm writing this out to hopefully get some of the poison out of my head.

It began with a picture.

I'm nobody special, don't get me wrong. Just the opposite. Not a detective, not a cop, nothing like that. I was just a senior in college with an office job lined up, and I only had to coast out until the end of the year. All that free time made me vulnerable to questions. The question—and the picture that came with it—would have just flowed past my mind like every other bit of internet flotsam if not for that peculiar state of aggravated-bored I found myself in that freezing February afternoon.

Two local girls had recently gone missing. That much I knew; my year-older friend worked as an intern at the city news channel, and he told me nobody could make heads or tails of what had happened. ""Look,"" he wrote in an email. ""Someone at another news group sent us this. The cops found two pictures uploaded from their phones after the last time anyone saw them. They're hoping somebody can identify this guy.""

I remember rolling my eyes. That was not the first time he'd forwarded me email chains full of internet meme bullshit. He was a sucker for clickbait. The pictures were the typical 'scary' type, taken in darkness and limited in scope such that nothing could really be discerned beyond 'look at how weird this is.'

The first image was taken from directly behind the head of a man with short brown hair, close enough that the flash illuminated his intermittent scalp in bright white. He appeared to be somewhere dark and slightly foggy; over his shoulder, a brandished knife could be seen, held forward for some unknown reason.

The second image was of a man lying face down in a hotel bed surrounded by empty liquor bottles and scattered pills. From his disheveled and sweat-matted short brown hair and the shape of the back of his head, it looked to be the same man. Convenient that his face was hidden in both shots, I remember thinking. Behind him was a peeling hotel wall and a mirror that somebody appeared to have spit on; in the mirror it was possible to see the man's left arm held out in such a manner that he was taking the picture himself with a cellphone. Given the context, I guessed the phone belonged to one of the two missing girls.

I tended not to believe things like this, because they never turned out to be anything. The two girls had likely snuck off to Spring Break and this was some sort of prank. Absolute worst case scenario, this was just some drunk frat guy they'd hung out with. ""Let me guess,"" I wrote back to my friend. ""An expert thinks this guy was *dead* when he took the picture of himself. Ooooooh, spooky, right?""

""He's definitely recently dead based on the way his limbs are behaving in that picture, and the discoloration and slight bloating of the skin, but that's not it. It's totally possible to put your camera on a timer to take a picture later, so they thought this was a suicide until they noticed something. Look closer. By his right hand.""

I enlarged the image on my monitor and realized that there was actually something in his hand. But it couldn't be—

I printed out the photo to get a better look, and it *was* what I'd suspected: the exact same photo we were looking at was in the dead man's hand. An aging clock on the wall had the same hand positions in both images. He had, in his hand, a picture of himself dead—apparently the same photo he would later take of himself by using the camera's timer. I emailed back, ""What are we looking at here?""

""Nobody knows, man. But they crowd-sourced finding the wallpaper and they figured out which hotel it was taken at.""

""Crowd-sourced?""

""Yeah, new technique. They make some clues public and let thousands of people see it online. Eventually someone recognizes the clue, and then they've got a lead. It's a hotel in Brazil.""

February was almost over and Spring Break was nigh. Holy shit, I had an opportunity to do something weird and crazy and prove to my friend that clickbait was stupid. ""Dude, I'm gonna go there.""

""Where?""

""That hotel.""

""You're not serious.""

""Why not? I've got my passport because my mom pestered me to do it last year. And I've got the money to fly down there because of my summer internship. If there's nothing to see, I'll just hang out on the beach and have a normal Spring Break.""

""I can give you the specific hotel, but are you sure you want to do that? That's like... crazy.""

The peculiar mix of aggravated boredom and intrigued indignation brewing in me compelled me to say yes. I'd seen so many ridiculous internet myths in my time online, it seemed an incredible opportunity to debunk one.

I'd never really left the country before, of course, but I fought down the nervousness and did my best to research everything I could. The hotel was near a popular tourist destination, so it wasn't like I was going somewhere horrible. The beaches were beautiful, if nothing else.

The trip by plane was disarmingly familiar. Civilization, air conditioning, and safety shrouded me all through the flight, landing, and disembarkation. I waited for my bag while a bunch of people stood around checking their cellphones—just like home—and it didn't hit me that I'd flown to a foreign country and continent until I barged through that last glass door and smacked right into a brutal wall of humid heat. 

Christ, it was straight winter back home, and here it was legitimately late summer. I'd chosen my initial clothes poorly, and they immediately became sweat-soaked drapes in a taxi that had no air conditioning. As high as the prices were in the hotel gift shop and as mass-produced and bland as they were, I bought lighter shirts and shorts and then sought refuge in my room.

I sat by the wall air conditioning unit until I'd recovered, and then I looked around my room. My friend had given me the right info—the wallpaper was the same pattern from the photo, and the bed, mirror, and clock were all the right design. Did a guy really commit suicide by pill in this hotel under mysterious circumstances? The nearness of it sent a biting air-conditioned shiver down my spine. Scary images sent in email chains online were supposed to be stupid myths, not something from a specific real location.

Once acclimated, I fought the churning fear in my stomach and forced myself to walk down to the lobby. I had pictures of the two girls on my phone, and I was debating whether to ask the concierge about them, but I didn't have to. Their photos were already on a bulletin board by the front desk—among others.

The concierge that I'd been considering approaching instead approached me when he saw me studying the pictures. ""Você reconhece alguém?""

I remember laughing nervously. ""What?""

""Oh, tourist?""

""Yes."" Well, I figured I might as well try, or else my friend would mercilessly tease me about flying all the way down there for nothing. I touched the pinned papers. ""These two.""

""Ah."" The older Brazilian man sighed. ""Very stupid, very bad. They went on a hike and never returned. The, ahm—"" He waved his hands for a moment before seeming to settle with a sigh on a less accurate word. ""—jungle. It eats people here.""

That was something more than the gossip back home about the incident. ""A hike?""

""Yes. Many trails have beautiful sights. Calm and peaceful belies the danger beneath. Do not go swimming, the currents are swift. Do not climb, the rocks are loose and the trees untrustworthy. Do not stay after dark, for the, ahm—"" He paused again and appeared to frown at having to use the same word. ""—the *jungle*—""

""It eats people,"" I finished for him. ""Is it safe to go alone during the day if I stick to the marked paths?""

He glared, but drew lines for me on a local map to show me where the girls had said they were hiking. ""I don't want to put your picture up here, too,"" he said. ""But a polícia did not go looking, just gave us these papers. We do not risk our own to find foolish tourists. It's possible those two are still alive if the jungle did not find them at night. Hurt, maybe. It's sad.""

I gulped, but put on a brave face. What was I doing? *And why?* I clutched the local map and adjusted my backpack as the concierge went back to his duties. I should have just gone home. I remember thinking I wanted to go home. Or, hell, even just to the beach. But presented with a stark cold fact like that—the police didn't even look—it felt impossible to go sit at the beach and ogle women while two fellow American girls were possibly dying at the very same time.

There were some guides for hire outside the hotel, but I felt less safe with a stranger than by myself. I couldn't stop thinking about tales of guides tricking people into captivity and selling their organs on the black market. All I had to do was walk a few paths, right? It was stupid. I *knew* it was stupid. The guides saw my direction, listened to my insistence on going alone, and looked at me as if I was a dead man. When he saw I was serious, one pressed a survival knife into my hand and shook his head when I tried to pay him. I accepted the gift and put it in my backpack before heading down the long dirt road toward the tourist hiking paths.

This wasn't like the small trails around hotels and campgrounds back home. The jungle here was not a mastered entity, and life was swarming everywhere. Thick clouds of insects hovered together only to be scooped up by flocks of little birds—or perhaps they were bats. I wasn't sure. It was humid as hell, and stuffy under the thick canopy of gloom and green, but I'd somehow stumbled my way into a mission and I couldn't turn back without hating myself.

A creek about a foot wide presented itself a few steps off the path, and I nearly went over to it to splash and cool myself down before I remembered the concierge's warnings. I took a long stick and lowered it in only to have the branch jerked out of my hands. The creek was a foot wide, but impossibly deep, and the current under those placidly flowing bubbles was murderous. If the girls had fallen in here—

No. Their phones had uploaded photos after they'd disappeared. Whatever had happened, it had not involved instant death.

Where would they have gone? For hours, I followed the path they'd indicated to the concierge until I reached a fork in the narrow overgrown trails. One path followed the black line he'd drawn, and the other led to what looked like a gorgeous waterfall basin.

Never in my life had I experienced such a strong fatal instinct. They'd gone the less-traveled path in the hopes of taking gorgeous pictures for their online profiles. Thus, possibly, it was death by Facebook.

Another twenty minutes of exhausting hike later, I found that the wide round basin was accessible down a steep scree and then along a slope of crumbling root-sprouting dirt. I ever so carefully picked my way down—and then nearly stumbled over a shoe. It was a dirty black American sneaker, and I picked it up to examine it.

Jumping back and letting out a short scream of shock, I threw it down on the ground.

It had a foot in it.

A goddamn foot!

Holding back overwhelming revulsion, I peeled back the tongue of the sneaker to confirm it was a female foot. Oh, God, I can still remember how it smelled; I can still remember the swarming flies and budding maggots in that stump of red flesh.

Yep. They were dead. Christ. I leaned back against the root-sprouting dirt wall behind me and tried not to throw up. I'd come all the way out here to find a rotting foot. This was why the police hadn't looked; why they never looked. They were right in assuming anyone that didn't come back from this horrible tangle was just plain dead.

I checked my cellphone—no signal, of course. I couldn't see the sun through the maze of greenery above, but my phone said it was getting late on the schedule I'd set for myself. Dusk would be coming, and it was time to head back. Even though I'd ignored the warning about climbing, I intended to heed the one about avoiding nighttime. Every single bush and hillock out here hid something *alive*, and I didn't want to see what might emerge in the dark.

And then, I heard her. ""*Heeeelp!*""

It was the faintest echo through the dense foliage, but I was dead certain it had been a hopeless female shout. I shouted back a half-dozen times, even screaming 'til my throat was raw, but she didn't seem to hear me in return. Or, maybe, she was incapable of shouting again. It hit me: one rotting foot didn't mean they were both dead. They could both have been alive, for all I knew, and the foot was the result of some injury or animal attack that had left them stranded and hurt out here.

Shit. Shit shit shit! If only I'd gone home thirty seconds earlier, I would never have kept looking.

The waterfall above was beautiful but austere. There was no climbing up that way, which meant the girls had likely followed the resulting narrow river if they were unable to climb back up the scree I'd just come down. Judging my footholds and handholds, I clambered along clean rock, thankful to be out of the tangle for a time. The progress wasn't hard, just precarious, and I guessed that someone could do it minus a foot if needed.

Eventually, the terrain became more like a canyon with a river at the bottom, and I was forced to lift up onto dirt again. Here, I found an animal trail splitting off in three directions. A cellphone with a cracked screen lay half-buried. I brushed it off to discover that it still had some battery power and that it was not password-protected.

The text messages were mostly mundane conversations from the owner to her friends; the most recent ones were variations on *help* and *are you getting this?* based on frustration from the lack of signal out here. There was no information there about what'd happened.

But then I checked the pictures on her camera.

Beyond all the typical selfies and photos of the airport, the flight, and the hotel, there were a few of the jungle I'd just traversed, the waterfall basin, and then the very path I was standing on. The next picture seemed to be taken from hiding; between the leaves the image showed a man brandishing a knife and peering into the underbrush opposite. I still couldn't see his face, but he was dressed in local wear I recognized from the shop. Had he seen the girls at the hotel and followed them out here? From the back of his head, it was the same man from the suicide picture.

This was serious. I needed to be ready for a fight, or to run. Suddenly tense, I put my backpack down, hid it under a few bushes, and withdrew the survival knife the guide had given me. With the knife out and at the ready in one hand and the cellphone in the other, I swiped slowly through the photos.

The next few were of the trail I was on, and I followed it step by step, retracing the path the girls had gone. The man was not in these pictures; they seemed to be photos of landmarks that might help them find their way back. Many were blurry and had been taken in haste. No doubt they'd been running.

I couldn't shout anymore either, not without potentially revealing my presence to that man. Had he cut off one of the girl's feet or something? How had her foot ended up back by that waterfall?

Swipe. There's the rock. Swipe. Ok, there's the bend in the path. Swipe, there's the arranged stones to mark a direction when no other landmark would suffice. A few more swipes and—I was back where I'd started. The animal trails split off in three directions, and I could hear the river out beyond the trees. So they'd come full circle by accident, realized they were lost, then what? Dropped their phone here in frustration? Or had they run into the man with the knife again and gotten caught?

If there were three paths out of here and two looped to one another, that meant the middle one had to go elsewhere, right?

I heard a noise behind me; whirled, saw nobody and nothing. I stared out into the jungle as dusk swept a dim shroud between the trees. I'd stayed too long, and night was almost upon me. I had to go home. What was I going to do, fight a knife-wielding madman in the dark? I could get the cops and bring down the cavalry on this shit.

And then, I heard her. ""*Heeeelp!*""

It came from down the middle path.

Goddamnit!

As it became harder and harder to see, I crept down that middle path, my knife held forward. If there *was* someone out here, I would only have a split second to strike back or run. The only advantage I had was that they had no idea I was here, and it was as hard for them to see me as it was for me to see them as long as I only checked the phone intermittently to keep its light to a minimum.

Swipe. A picture of the middle path in gloom. Alright, on a night sometime earlier this week, they'd gone this way. Had they again looped back somehow to drop this phone? I swiped ahead a few times to see multiple shots of the path I was on. I stopped at a shot of the knife-wielding man from the side; all that could be seen was a silhouette in deep forest dusk. Looking at the shot disturbed me. Was I witnessing the events leading up to someone's murder? I swiped back to the path shots and continued following their trail.

When I reached the spot where the man's picture had been taken from the side, I heard something crunching out in the darkness. I froze for what felt like an eternity as dusk began to approach night. All my senses told me that *something* was out there. Something was waiting and watching with malicious intent; perhaps even with glee. I could feel it.

As absolute darkness fell, a change came over the humid and dense air. The birds went quiet, and my ears stopped hearing their shrieking calls with a sudden internal echo. I thought I'd gone deaf for a moment, but I could still hear my own breathing. Moving step by quiet step back down the path and behind a boulder, I got out the phone to light my way and to check further pictures.

""*Heeeelp!*""

I turned my head suddenly to try to get a bead on the scream in the absolute silence. It sounded closer somehow.

""*Heeeelp!*""

This time it came from the opposite direction, a little further away.

""*Heeeelp!*""

That one came from right on the path ahead, exactly where I'd been about to walk before the sensation of being watched had stopped me in my tracks.

It was the same scream every single time. The same intonations, the same length, the same emotion.

I swallowed down panic. That girl had died days ago, and someone or something was using her last scream to toy with me. It was insane to think so, but it was the only conclusion.

Swiping all the way ahead in the pictures on her phone, I found a photo of an arm over a face; a man was wincing against the flash of the camera. Had they used the flash as a weapon to blind him? I—

I held my arm up as a series of flashes erupted right in front of my face.

I couldn't choose a direction. I ran. Somehow, someone or something had snuck right up in front of me and—and somehow—it was impossible but—

Pushing down the trail, I ran in absolute terror until the same scream erupted a few feet ahead of me. 

""*Heeeelp!*""

It was loud this time, painfully loud, and I sliced at empty darkness. The light from the phone showed nothing ahead, just unmoving leaves and fronds. I held the knife forward with no idea what I could even do with it—until a series of flashes went off right behind my head.

Was it behind me? I ran for my life.

Down the dirt, climb along the river canyon in the dark, leap up the scree, sprain my ankle. That's what I remember. Limp along the path I'd come down earlier that day. I'd lost my backpack and the map inside it. I thought I could remember, but the jungle transforms at night. All of the landmarks I looked for were impossible to find in darkness, and I knew something was out there hunting me.

Obviously, because I'm writing this now—as I said, to get the poison out of my head—I made it out of there, but not for nearly a day. I spent that night crammed into a small rock hollow with stones piled up to block the entrance and only enough space for my knife to stab out; all night long, ""*Heeeelp!*"", ""*Heeeelp!*"", ""*Heeeelp!*"", from right outside my hollow, ""*Heeeelp!*"", ""*Heeeelp!*"", laughter, and random bits of conversation mimicking what the two girls had said to each other before danger had found them. It'd stalked and watched them for hours before night had fallen.

A foot. That was all that was left. A foot severed by powerful jaws.

When dawn finally rolled around, my sleepless body practically dragged itself out of its own accord. I don't fully remember what happened when I returned to the hotel, but they took care of me, and I did not tell them I found her cellphone.

And you know what? It's been five days, and I'm supposed to fly back to the States tomorrow night, but I happen to know I'll never make it. I sit in my hotel room and stew in my own nightmare. I can hear it calling from the deep of the night. It's out there mocking me still, waiting, because it knows I can't escape. All of those pictures were taken before they ever happened; all part of the horror in the jungle where time knows nothing of the strict structure of civilization. I only came out here because of that last picture, the only one that hasn't come true yet. How messed up is that?

So I sit here clutching the photo I printed out of that last picture, and I drink, and I take pills to try to knock myself out before it comes for me. I'm not killing myself. I just don't want to be awake when it happens. It's creeping closer now. The cruelest part of this is the clock on the wall. I *know* the exact moment as it ticks closer and closer second by second. Another swig, a few more pills. It's slithering up 'round the bottom of the clock now, the bottom of the basin, the bottom of my heart, numbing. He said it. I didn't listen.

*Jungle* wasn't the right word, but he straight up said it. He told me directly.

It eats people here.

6pcrry,0,2017-07-24,Quitting full-time tech job to join coding boot camp?,i_suckatjavascript,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6pcrry/quitting_fulltime_tech_job_to_join_coding_boot/,"I know this gets asked all the time, and I've been hesitating to ask it in fear of getting roasted on Reddit. So please bear with me. I've been thinking about it since graduating college in Spring 2016. Yes, I read the FAQ, but I need real opinions first.

I currently work for a Fortune 50 tech company (hint: it's  one of the Big 4s). It's been almost a year now since I've started working here. I work in their IT department as a contractor. The job pays okay (salary of within the range of $40k-$50k), but I got bored of the position and I really want a more fulfilling challenging career. The current position I'm in requires me to sit at the desk all day analyzing data. And to analyze data, I have to use a log analysis tool. I don't believe they will convert me to a permanent employee (basically permatemp, because I have a temp coworker who's been in that position forever since the beginning of time). So now I want a jump.

Some background of myself:
• Graduated from college with a double major in economics and communications
• Graduated with a 3.8 GPA magna cum laude
• Got this position around 3 months after graduating (pure luck, I guess)
• I have some background in HTML (learned it in high school)
• I edit the wiki on my free own time for fun writing templates and tinkering the CSS (this is on a Wikia fandom wiki)
• I troll my friends with fake information by going on a real website, opening source, changing a few variables and letterings, screenshoting it, and sending it to them
• Somewhat financially stable with no debt (living with parents)
• Lives in SF Bay Area 
• Always having a passion to learn tech

I developed an interest in programming starting when I was young. I played flash games and others that ran by Java. Then I got more interested when I played more games. Then hackers in MMOs came along. Then I edited the wiki since 2010. Afterwards, I was a volunteer assistant teaching kids in a STEM program on how to make their own games by coding (using drag-and-drop) in a program. Then the trolling at friends using screenshots came along.

The question is, should I change careers and join a bootcamp? Will I be successful the program? What about finding a job?

The only thing that's really holding me back from making the jump is dreadful thought of looking for a job. Every time I think about job searching, it instills a fear in me because I had a bad experience with job searching. The bad experience came from me searching for a job when I was a freshman in college. I tried to find an internship, but I was never successful. Every semester when there's a job fair at my school, I attend every single one. I never secured an internship, even when I was a senior.

I'm always worried about the job market so much that in the end, I get a lot of depression and sick thoughts. Just worried that if I quit my job and successfully completed bootcamp, will it be hard for me to secure a job? Is the market too competitive among applicants? I read on this subreddit of others saying it takes a long time to find a job.

Do people look down and frown upon bootcamps (as in, do employers and coworkers like it)? There's always at least one bootcamp advertisement whenever I open Facebook or open any article within Facebook. And I wasn't sure if the bootcamp is over exaggerating their stats. Is there really a demand for software engineers? Are there really too much software engineers looking for a job?

Please help. I really want to change my life. I'm still young (22) and I still believe I have time to change the course of anything. Will my previous experience help, if any, at all? I thank you very much for taking the time to read this and replying."

Why?",1nate146,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/6pczs5/iphone_se_headphone_jack_stopped_working_was/,"Hey all, I had very recently issue with my iPhone headphone jack. I was listening to Spotify while on Snapchat when I turn up the volume to listen to a Snapchat story, somehow my headphone sound got extremely noisy. I did the IT thing, of unplugging it and then plugging it in again and no sound came out.  

I first, made sure it was the jack and not the sound compatibility by using the speaker and it worked fine. Then I plug my headphone into my laptop to make sure that worked, and sure enough, it did. I then, swapped out my headphones with a different pair of headphone to confirmed that it was the jack, which the other headphone didn't work. Finally, I looked up the known solution and found resetting it helps. I did that and it works now (Thank the IT gods), but I don't understand why or what cause the issues.

For context, I have worked in IT for 2 years, and am currently working with IT Engineers for a Summer Internship. However even with my experience, it was never my first instinct to assume that was a software issue, rather I though it was hardware. 

So please someone explain to me why the hell my iPhone jack stop working and how a soft reset fixed it, my only guess is that the two sound output confused my iPhone and made the headphone jack shit itself but I want to make sure I understand exact what cause it. It was a very scary for me because I play music out of iPhone via Headphone for like 70% of my day.

I ""failed"" at what I wanted to do as my back up plan to being a clinical psychologist. That was makeup artistry. 
I was unable to build a clientele in a year which is normal, usually these things take years but I basically ""failed"" to keep this short. 
I failed due to a long list of things that are not going to change any time soon, including how superficial and saturated entertainment is.


I decided I would try to go back to school and get a degree that provides job security. Except, the only ones that do are nursing, engineering and accounting. 

None of which contain subjects I'm in ANY way good at, or passionate about, I find them boring. 

Only thing I've ever wanted to be and am good at is artistic and creative subjects, and anything psychology related. Since I knew I wanted to be a clinical psychologist since I was 11. But am not willing to get a phd and do internships without knowing it'll get me anywhere, that is IF I'm in the top percent of the people who are the exception to the rule. Especially when getting your phd, it's research and not application. Meaning I'd spend years in school researching to get a degree that contains no value in the job market, to THEN compete to shadow someone instead of actually fucking helping anyone, period. 

I've looked at all A.S, B.S, B.A degrees to see what I can research and see if I tolerate but even thinking of every day tasks to perform in them seem dull, I'm uninterested in going out to volunteer to see if I could like other things, studying, etc. Which makes going back to school bad because without a plan, I'll have no purpose or motivation to get any degree. I've convinced myself the thing I'm supposed to be doing is the arts or psych making everything else a ""waste"" of time. But without job security in either of those fields, I also think they're a waste of time. 

I've been thinking about all of this for years, and I don't know what to do. 

I don't want to be miserable or have another mental breakdown due to said misery. 



I waste time doing nothing and then I also waste I'm wasting time doing anything. 

What do I do?"

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I'm finishing up an internship were we got to play around with machine learning. I'm building this machine so that I can continue to train models and compete in Kaggle competitions. Since I'm getting some higher end GPUs I figure I ought to be able to game with this if I want to.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

I don't know. I don't really play games where the framerate matters anymore. I would hope for high performance on any modern titles I decided to play, but I don't know what that entails.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I would like to keep the whole computer, with a pair of monitors and a nice keyboard and mouse under $5000. So probably under $4000 for the computer.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States

I specifically chose these parts to support multiple GPUs, expanding up to 4 eventually. I chose the i7-6850K because it has 40 PCI lanes for GPU throughput and it was reasonably priced and recent. Someone suggested I think about waiting for a 10 core threadripper and its 64 PCI lanes for $450 more. I can see the appeal. Does that seem like a good idea? I'm worried about what extra I would have to pay for a compatible motherboard. Nobody on the internet even seems to have prices for such a thing publicly available.

The case is basically a stand-in. I haven't picked fans because I think I should pick a case first. I plan to overclock the GPUs but not the CPU. What sort of cooling should I have, and how does that inform what case I should get?

I picked the motherboard because PC Builder says that it works with a i7-6850K and it was reasonably rated/reviewed and supports 4 GPUs. I am open to CPU/Motherboard suggestions.

I understand that the power supply won't support 4 GPUs. Should I buy a better one now or when I add more GPUs? If I were to get one now, what should I get? This thing is going to hog a huge amount of power basically 24/7, so I probably want a titanium PS, right?

PC Builder says this ""Some Intel X99 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Broadwell-E CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions."" But the reviews on the motherboard don't mention this. Is this a problem?

Does anyone have monitor suggestions? I'd probably like one very good one and another that's simply acceptable.

I am worried that in my inexperience I am going to make a terrible mistake. Does anything here look glaringly wrong/should I reconsider these parts choices? If nobody thinks so I'll probably order the pieces in the next couple of days."

I am getting a tad frustrated trying to find an internship at any sort of big company (Lockheed Martin, Tesla, Boeing, etc) that doesn't require their EE interns to have taken higher-level CS courses. I'm talking about compiler courses or software engineering classes that at my school typically are courses that only CS majors take during their sophomore year or later. Even ECEs aren't required to take those courses. Even then where would they have time for them in their schedules if they did have these courses?

I'm starting to wonder if it's not worth doing EE and just doing CS considering there seems to be no internships for EEs that wouldn't require either some sort of super-student or someone in their senior year, who would be ineligible since they're required to have a semester of courses left. I've already interned at smaller companies and I want to graduate to interning at larger ones, but it seems as if I would have to totally reinvent my curriculum just to accommodate these requirements.

Anyone feeling similar? Any advice is greatly appreciated too if you have it for anyone who might be in the same boat."

6pf9hp,3,2017-07-25,Best time to apply for new grads?,anoncscareer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6pf9hp/best_time_to_apply_for_new_grads/,"tl;dr: Best time to apply appears to be in October, but I am not sure if it'll be okay applying in mid-August. 
I can also get a few referrals for large companies from friends. Does that override requirement to apply during peak job postings timeframe?

I graduated with CS bachelor's degree in Spring 2017 from top 10 (US) university.
My concern was that, I was not good at technical interviews. Sophomore internship was by luck, received offer without interview (well-known company but not top tier), and junior internship was from a company close to ""Big 5"". Junior year was tricky. It was my first year actually applying to companies. I had over 90% rejection rate after interviewing where, for all interviews with online coding challenges (except Amazon), I failed, with best results from on-campus interviews. I eventually received few offers, two notably from Amazon and Cisco. Both had typical ""easy leetcode questions"", and I turned them down eventually for another company. About 80% of the companies that I applied to, responded with interview requests. These offers were likely by luck as well. Note that I got a return offer from first internship, but for my last internship, none of the interns in my branch received return offers.
Popular posts regarding difficulty finding CS job do really scare me. Many posts refer to studying for months before applying/receiving offers. Also, posts suggest response rate from companies are very low. I applied for winter internship position during Senior year, and only Google and Microsoft responded (both unsuccessful).

Extra questions:
From my experience, I tend to get nervous and freeze up when interviewers seem uninterested or irritated (at all times before technical interviews even begin). Also, I seem to lose my thoughts when I talk out loud. I have to draw out problems to usually solve problems (yes I draw trees for recursions, etc.), and it feels extra awkward to keep silent during phone interviews. What should I do to improve these situations?
Also, does preference of a particular location over another lower chances with the company?

Thank you guys for reading !!! "

6ph779,13,2017-07-25,In my 20s and wanting to start a career and move out. Need advice for dealing with my parents,Garothdyn,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/6ph779/in_my_20s_and_wanting_to_start_a_career_and_move/,"Recently, I got accepted for a software development internship in a top company overseas. There's also the possibility of employment after the internship.

However, I've never been out of home for a longer period. I am my parents' only child, and they are practically obsessed with me. And yes, I am a bit spoiled (and recently came to realize it's a bad thing).

Now, to be fair, my parents are lovely people and I have many things to be grateful for, and I love them and want to do my best to make them proud, so I don't intend anything to be taken as if against them, as wonderful people who, albeit their weaknesses, do their best to make sure I am doing well. But the problems must be addressed, nonetheless.

Honestly, I don't think they are very emotionally/mentally stable, and I don't say this as if they were bad people or at fault for being who they are. I myself have my own problems, and I am trying to work on them. But, I mention it because they have great influence over me in my own mental health, and I often feel depressed when I spend a lot of time at home. I used to be much much more insecure in the past. I am still a bit of a coward when it comes to certain things, unlike others whose parents were not so controlling during the childhood years. And I am trying to change this, since it impairs my ability to function in this chaotic world where your very life's at stake.

Now back to the internship. It will last only 2 months, and there is still a lot of time till then, but my mum is so concerned about me that all she does everyday is talk to me about how would I get by on my own, what if this, what if that, whether I will have enough money, etc. I understand her concern. What I have problems with is that we talk about these things over and over again and she keeps being anxious about it while oftentimes expressing her disagreement about my going there mostly implicitly (sometimes even explicitly). To make it worse, she often goes like ""What will I do when you are not here? I will lose my appetite, I won't even cook, I will wait for you to return..."". Now this is getting even more difficult to bear. She often makes sure to stress how much she loves me. But it's really pressuring me. My dad is also not there to support me and encourage me, instead he also expresses his disagreement from time to time and is on mum's side. This is draining all my energy and enthusiasm.

When I wanted to study abroad, I was turned away exactly the same by my parents, telling me instead that I could look for a job abroad after graduating. Now here I am, still living with my parents, and they still have the same attitude to those things. Even though this is only an internship, and there is no guarantee whatsoever that I will be offered a full-time position, my parents find it pretty hard. Let alone if I should be offered a full-time position.

This time, I decided to not back off, since this is my life and this is very important to me, and I will pursue it. However, when I think of how they would feel if I were offered and accepted a full-time job there, I am very troubled and at pain to see whether they would be able to cope with it at all and what I am to do about it.

I don't think staying with them is a good idea imho; I think I will get a clearer head if I were to move out and start living independently. That's not to say I want to forget my parents, since I intend to visit them as much as I can and keep in contact often and let them know I still appreciate them, but I think it's in the best interest for all of us if I were to simply start my own life.

I sometimes feel like a bird in a cage. And whenever my parents express their wishes for me to be always next to them or how much they depend emotionally/mentally on me, I feel I will lose my mind if I don't leave.

Any advice/opinion/suggestion/comment would be much appreciated."
6phfqx,1,2017-07-25,[UK] Worried landlord will try and evict me,throwlegal1,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6phfqx/uk_worried_landlord_will_try_and_evict_me/,"I'm a male student doing an internship for a year, I moved into this new place on the 1st of July with 2 other male interns. I'm just gonna lay out a general overview, give an indication of how much of a weird attitude my landlord has had since we moved in, and then go into why I'm worried he'll evict me. 

NOTE: We're all from really well respected universities, doing good courses, and on placement at one of the most well known companies in the UK. We're good neighbours and definitely gave no bad impressions

- Theres 5 interns (all girls, split into 2 flats of 2 girls, and 1 of 1 girl) living in the same block. When we moved in he asked them all if they knew us, and if we were messy boys, straight away, didnt ask if the girls were messy, he already had an incredible bias towards us for no reason. 
- The property is a new renovated house split into flats, we were assured it would be 100% done, I visited months ago and there were loads of builders and work was almost done (now its obvious it was just a show to make us think it was almost done), the day we moved in things were JUST being finished. There was a GIANT hole in the back garden, with a huge fire going in it (they were burning plastic, EVERYTHING in it, bad smoke and fumes) for the first 2-3 days when we moved in, fire service had to be called to put it out.
- A key point is that the property was advertised with bike storage. I moved up, had my bike with him, and politely asked him if I could store it in the house untill the storage was up (I promised not to use it, keep front wheel off, literally just leave it in a corner of my room not resting against the wall) he was fine with it, have multiple witnesses of him agreeing to it. He also allowed me to move my desk in as theres no desk in my room (again loads of people saw it, and he saw me move it in)
- He's yet to give us a third key for a house of 3 people, I don't have a key and have to make sure someone is in or steal their key, after 3 weeks. 
- There's no bins (outside waste removal) so he told us to double bag and store waste inside untill bins arrived.


Okay so here’s what happened recently.

- He messaged us saying the key was done and he would drop it off tomorrow, this was last Thursday.
- He entered our place and carried a full inspection on the Friday (went into all our rooms), now I don't take saying he'll ""drop a key off' as a notice of inspection. (this was on a Friday, I work long hours from 7:30am to 6pm, my room is usually tidy, and this was the first time he’d inspected, everything else in the place was tidy)

This is what he complained about before saying he'd take it out of our deposits. 

- We had bin bags in the kitchen as we couldn’t take it outside or put in garden (its a messy worksite) so the place smelt abit, but was obviously under control. 
- My room had some plates in from the night before (no mould, literally had them from the night before) which he claimed were mouldy
- I had a pile of clothes in a bag in the corner to wash when I got home 
- There was a box of open muffins on the couch from breakfast that morning(yes he complained about that)
- I had a pile of packing (plastic wrapping) and some stuff had fallen out of my bin (a yoghurt pot) but no damage to anything, was empty. 
- The bike was in my room, not lent against the wall, obviously not used, front wheel off, clean as a whistle (he saw me move it in).

He told me to remove the bike immediately (even after advertising with bike storage, and allowing me it in the house until storage was ready), tidy up, and threatened to take our deposits. I spoke with my housemates and replied that he had no ground to take our deposits, and that I would be speaking to citizen’s advice bureau if he continued. He replied in a very threatening manner, and said things were getting serious now and I would be getting an email from him. 
I tidied up, there’s no damage to ANYTHING, I removed the bike (now have an £800 bike tied to a tree in the garden, love it). I sent him a message apologising, and that the place was tidy, he’s ignored my messages. He sent the group chat a message saying he’d drop the key off on Sunday (he didn’t) then he came in on Monday whilst we were at work (loads of signs he did) and didn’t drop key off or say anything. Another thing which is funny, my girlfriend is living in the 1bed flat upstairs, he told her not to come round or talk to “the boys”. 

Sorry this is messy, I’ll edit over time.

For example I completed a 1 year programming internship at a major Aerospace company during my CS degree. I added a lot of the professionals I met to my LinkedIn and added / followed a number of those on Facebook / Twitter.    
I'd consider myself to have built a lot of good professional and personal relationships during that time but I can't imagine a single one of those guys ever randomly calling me up like ""Hey lowerSecond my company needs a new developer you interested?"".

6pi6s8,3,2017-07-25,(27 male) Recent MBA grad - What do I tell recruiters on the reason I no longer work at previous job?,ThrowawayAskhere,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6pi6s8/27_male_recent_mba_grad_what_do_i_tell_recruiters/,"Hoping you guys could help me out as I struggled with trying to find a career I like (let alone be qualified for) since high school.

Background: -Bachelors - business management degree 2012. -MBA focused in Information Systems - December 2016 from an accredited University
Currently living in Cleveland Ohio.

Since I graduated from undergrad in 2012, I bounced around a lot in internships ranging from HR, marketing, Inventory, and data analyzing. None of those places would hire me full time as they said they had no money to offer me a salary position and they wanted someone with more experience (hence why I went for my masters). After my internships I worked as a personal banker for a year and a half.


March 2016 - June 2017 I was hired at a software company as an application support specialist.


Everything was going well so far, until my direct supervisor (team lead) got passed over for a promotion and he pretty much became a tyrant. I was eventually let go. There's a whole story behind it, but to keep it short, he said I was let go for poor performance, but I was actually let go because a time card issue I had where I was scheduled off for jury duty. I didn't come in to work as I was scheduled for Jury Duty and was still fired. Sounds fishy I know, but that's what happened. And as I was fired he told HR it was for my performance, but yea.


I brought that last part up because at the end of the day I was fired last June. So I'm not sure what to say when recruiters and hiring managers ask me why I am no longer working there. So that's my first question.
My second question is with my very general background, I'm not sure what career I should pursue. I'm not sure I could post my resume here, but I would love to, to give you guys an idea on the work I was doing at my last job.
The work at my last job was “entry level” (in quotes for a reason), so I was still learning a lot. I felt I was performing well and I was learning, but at the same time, the teamlead wasn't happy with my work.
So now I feel that maybe I'm not cut out for IT. But if not IT, I have no idea what jobs I would be qualified for nor do I have any idea on what I want to do.


And this is a problem because every job that I may have interest in, they are looking for someone with a lot of experience. Even entry level jobs. And Yes I am even searching for job out of state.
I get calls/ interviews for a lot of IT jobs. But they all tell me the same thing. They want someone with more experience. And I mean I had interviews with guys that were heads of their departments, so I get past the first/second interviews. They all tell me the same thing. They thought I interviewed fine, but they want/went with someone with more experience.

**TLDR:** Fired from last job after year/half, get interviews for other jobs, but get denied for lack of experience. Not sure where to go from here due to lack of experience. Also when recruiters ask me why I am no longer working at last job, not sure what to tell them."

I am graduating from a relatively low tier school so I'm not expecting to get a job at any of the big companies like Google or Microsoft or anything. (Although I will apply on the off chance they would give me a shot) 

Having said that, I have my resume together, I have a little experience between a 6 month internship and undergraduate research under one of my professors, and I have an idea of the location that I would like to live/work. The problem is that I am unsure about what sort of positions I would be best qualified for or what positions I would like to hold in general. I feel very uninformed about the industry side of this field and I find that terrifying since I'm about to enter it. 

I guess I would just appreciate any kind of advice on finding SE jobs in specific areas or any general advice or suggestions for starting my career in SE. 

Thanks in advance, I have already learned a lot just by scrolling through this sub and reading!

Edit: Also I'm thinking of trying to enroll in an online masters program while I job search. Then continue working through that once I get a job. Has anyone done this? Is it worth it or would you recommend it? "

After graduating university I worked as a Junior Developer for 3 years. By getting enormous bonuses (you really wouldn’t believe) and having a roommate I managed to save a lot of money. This allowed me to pursue a dream of opening my own shop. And I succeeded - it brought me steady profit and I provided 3 people with a good pay. Now I’m handing the business to my brother and after 2-3 months of travelling, I’m planning to get back to a CS career.

So I have 3 years experience and then 5 years of having my own CS-unrelated business. How do I put that in a CV? As my most recent position above my previous job and internship or where?

I’m also working to sharpen my coding skills. I haven’t been coding apart from a few small personal projects. So far I think I’m starting to getting back in shape. A lot of time on coding challenge websites, practising practical interview questions and reading books. What else should I be doing?

I have a bit of time and lots of savings so there’s no rush. I know it’s a bit unusual and frankly I’m lost, so that’s why I’m asking. Thanks for reading."

While this is my 6th internship and I also work part-time as a full stack dev for a consultancy, 5 of my internships were non-development (different engineering and automation roles in mechE, EE, robotics). 

I think I have a solid resume - I have good projects, 3 bachelors degrees, finishing my masters and a machine learning program, head TA for DS&amp;A, but I'm worried those non development internships may be seen as useless and that I need to put another big name on my resume. 

Edit: I've got a solid GitHub with ~5 small/med iOS projects, a few web apps, two games made in GML.
Resume was enough to garner attention from a few recruiters outside of applications. 

**Pros:** 

* Big name on resume

* More software development experience

* More time to practice for interviews

* Possibly offers up another internship opportunity (Summer 2018)


**Cons:**

* Delaying my graduation from May 2018 to Fall/Winter 2018, and 
have already done 5 years of college. 

* Might lose a sizable scholarship from my old company 

* Would have to find someone to sublease my apartment for the Fall.

* Would start looking for full time jobs at an awkward time (January 2019)

Honestly I wouldn't even really call it an internship anymore since I don't really learn anything now. I hope to be able to jump ship in the spring but I get to work from home about 80% of the time so it's a pretty sweet gig except for everything else. 

Lately (well more like the past year) I've been extremely annoyed at trying to communicate with my boss or any of the other handful of employees. I'll get an email asking me to give him a call with no information (usually at a specific time ... sometimes when I'm not working but he's stopped doing that so much so it's not a big issue anymore). Having some social anxiety I already hate talking on the phone (especially after working directly under another superior who was always extremely rude, called me at inappropriate times like Christmas Eve, and would say I was interrupting when I would call him back five minutes after he called me...I loved my internship before this and now it's caused me to be on edge and dread any sort of work related communication). With my boss it's more the fact that the vague email leaves me a little panicked (due to said anxiety) that it'll either be a conversation about something he expects me to know/be able to comment on(and I won't know) or it'll be a problem with something I've worked on. I'll call him at the requested time (usually a specific time but sometimes a time range). About 60% of the time he'll either not answer my calls (or my follow up email) or he'll say he's too busy to talk so I'm stuck playing phone tag trying to catch up with him. I find this extremely aggravating as making sure I keep trying to get ahold of him distracts me from being able to work effectively. My biggest issue though is that it's almost always a thirty second conversation with vague requests that could be sent in an email like ""add X to Y"" or ""please fix this tiny issue"". I find this extremely irritating since a simple email that's maybe a paragraph long would explain everything I needed to know but instead I'm stuck worrying or trying to play phone tag. I also am then delayed by several hours for whatever he needs me to do since he didn't include an details in his ""call me"" email. Am I being irrational by being annoyed? I understand sometimes a phone call is needed for complex tasks or something that might be miscommunication but 90% of the time it's a thirty second conversation. 

Basically my thought is ""Please stop having me call you for information that could be more efficiently be sent and received in an email instead of hours later over the phone."" "
6plitl,21,2017-07-25,Looking for an intern?,ecroow,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6plitl/looking_for_an_intern/,"Hello everyone!

I'll just get to the point: I'm 18 years old, I've just graduated from high-school and I'm looking to do an internship. I'm based in Bulgaria.

Here's what I've done in past:

1) I've started my first entrepreneurial adventure when I was 16. I bought iPhones with broken screen of off eBay, fixed them, and then sold them on the Bulgarian eBay.

The problem was that I bought several iPhones, I ran out of money, and had to wait several months before the new screens from China arrived and I could sell them. I made a little money off that, but it was way too slow.

2) Do you know that moment when you've had your headphones(earphones) for a few months, and then suddenly one of the earphones stops working? 

Well, I figured out how to fix that problem, and did that last summer.

3) In Bulgaria we don't have that many audiobooks and I decided to start my own e-commerce store (which runs on WordPress and WooCommerce), hire several people to record the audiobooks and start selling them.

I've managed to grow our email list from 0 to 1500 in 4 months with no paid advertising on Facebook or Google (Google Adwords doesn't work for audiobooks in Bulgaria, because no one is looking for them), but using influencer marketing.

I've also done some sales. I cold email or cold call authors and ask them if they'd be interested in getting their books in audiobooks.

I've already made a few sales.

However, our growth has slowed down and we're making around 400-600 lv ($200-$400)/month and I want to learn from someone who's already been there and done that.

What I've learnt: how to set up a WordPress site and WooCommerce store; a little sales; some email marketing; figuring stuff out; how to use Google; learn quickly; very little FB advertising; almost no Google Adwords.

If you think I might be a good fit for your company, send me a PM.

Thank you for your time!

Have a great day!

PS I forgot to add that I've graduated from high-school studying Micro-processing technology. What did I learn during that period? How to solder discrete elements on a PCB, how to use ICs, a little about how microprocessors work."

I have been thinking about what to do about my location after I graduate. Both my current location and my hometown (Pittsburgh) have decent opportunities in the IT field, where I plan on working in probably a more business side role (Something like analytics or Project Management). As I have thought more about it though, I realized that I don't like either my current location or my hometown and feel like I would be happier if I moved somewhere like Denver or Austin. Though at this point I intend to relocate at some point relatively soon after I graduate, I see benefits to immediate relocation, moving back home for 18 months - 2 years, and staying in my current city for the same time frame.


Current Location:

Positives: Easiest place to find a job between college's reputation and personal connections, fairly low cost of living, many friends will be staying in the area

Negatives: Could get basically trapped here if there are anything changes in my personal life, mild dislike of the city, would be saving much less money than if I lived at home

Hometown: 

Positives: Close to family, should not be too hard to find a job due to personal connections, will be able to save up the vast majority of my $ since family desperately wants me to move home, high school friends in area + probably some college friends

Negatives: Strong dislike of the city in general, bad home situation due to highly unstable mother, would need to find someone to cover my lease from January to July 2018, could get basically trapped here if there are anything changes in my personal life

Moving:

Positives: Probably happier, better opportunities for personal and professional advancement, much lower chance of me needing to move again later on

Negatives: Cost to move (between cost of new furniture + the actual move),  would need to find someone to cover my lease from January to July 2018, no personal or professional network in the city outside of college alums (might be able to be partially solved if I find an internship in whatever city I end up wanting to move to), risk of not being able to find a job so that I would be forced to live off of my personal finances until I could find somewhere

The job would entail setting up an ci/cd pipeline, working with AWS, and integration testing. And I'd be helping him with some of the backend work here and there. My question is,

What would employers like more a side project or something like this?

My thought is that the latter shows you know how to work in a team environment (although I have multiple internships under my belt),  though the former would be something I can claim myself from start to finish and I'd be able to choose the direction of the project. However I find that when I do side projects I usually don't maintain them and it seems that working with a startup, could keep me responsible and would require constant attention as opposed to one and done job.

I didn't have any expectations for pay since it was already beginning of June and the internship was unofficial. I've been working here for a month and a half and so far there has been no pressure for me to stay or meet any deadlines whatsoever. I can work completely at my own pace and choose whichever projects interest me. 

That being said, I actually feel like I learned a lot through the projects they've offered me. I developed skills such as learning SQL and conduct efficient SQL querying in python as well as working with RDBMS. I also learned about tree data structures and how to implement and traverse my own tree. I also became much better at object oriented programming and I gained more knowledge in how to better validate user input. Finally, I also learned communicating and interacting with other people including other programmers and QA guys. Recently, I've started reading about doing unpaid work and it seems that the general consensus is basically to never do it. However, I feel like I've learned a good bit and gained decent connections that can lead to things such as a good letter of recommendation. I feel like my experience has been worthwhile but I would like a second opinion. Was taking something on like this worth it or was it a mistake that I shouldn't make again?"

**Recommendations:**
No professors I knew well enough... Would potentially be the 2 supervisors from the roles above, plus maybe a coworker. Will it be a negative that my current supervisor lacks a CS education? He is more of a general IT manager, however, he has had an executive role before at a top non-tech company. 



How do you guys think this sort of application would do? Especially with the CS GPA being a bit under 3.0. It would be even lower if I included all the lower div classes that counted towards my major (Calculus, Chem, Physics, etc). I got mostly C's and B-'s in those too. CS at my school was only 108 units of the required 180, so I was able to take plenty of easy liberal arts type classes to help balance out the C grades. My transcript only shows the 3.05 overall GPA though.

I think my work experience should hold up okay. I've generally done pretty well and advanced from Junior to Mid-Level after 1 year. I'm just worried that when admissions really look at my transcript, they will see a decent amount of C and B- grades in STEM classes even though my overall is technically a 3.05.... Does it look like I have a pretty decent shot, or more of a toss up given my circumstances?"

The company I'm at uses it for code reviews, and while the first two weeks were rough in terms of the learning curve, I think all the mistakes I made really helped me understand git a whole lot better. 


Are code management services similar to IDEs in that no one really cares which one you use as long as you're familiar with the ""language"" of git (e.g. no one cares if you use Eclipse as long as you know Java)? Just wanted to get some clarification to avoid adding confusion to my resume.

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I'm finishing up an internship were we got to play around with machine learning. I'm building this machine so that I can continue to train models and compete in Kaggle competitions. Since I'm getting some higher end GPUs I figure I ought to be able to game with this if I want to.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

I don't know. I don't really play games where the framerate matters anymore. I would hope for high performance on any modern titles I decided to play, but I don't know what that entails.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I would like to keep the whole computer, with a pair of monitors and a nice keyboard and mouse under $5000. So probably under $4000 for the computer.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I specifically chose these parts to support multiple GPUs, expanding up to 4 eventually. I chose the i7-6850K because it has 40 PCI lanes for GPU throughput and it was reasonably priced and recent. Someone suggested I think about waiting for a 10 core threadripper and its 64 PCI lanes for $450 more. I can see the appeal. Does that seem like a good idea? I'm worried about what extra I would have to pay for a compatible motherboard. Nobody on the internet even seems to have prices for such a thing publicly available.

The case is basically a stand-in. I haven't picked fans because I think I should pick a case first. I plan to overclock the GPUs but not the CPU. What sort of cooling should I have, and how does that inform what case I should get?

I picked the motherboard because PC Builder says that it works with a i7-6850K and it was reasonably rated/reviewed and supports 4 GPUs. I am open to CPU/Motherboard suggestions.

I understand that the power supply won't support 4 GPUs. Should I buy a better one now or when I add more GPUs? If I were to get one now, what should I get? This thing is going to hog a huge amount of power basically 24/7, so I probably want a titanium PS, right?

PC Builder says this ""Some Intel X99 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Broadwell-E CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions."" But the reviews on the motherboard don't mention this. Is this a problem?

Does anyone have monitor suggestions? I'd probably like one very good one and another that's simply acceptable.

I am worried that in my inexperience I am going to make a terrible mistake. Does anything here look glaringly wrong/should I reconsider these parts choices? If nobody thinks so I'll probably order the pieces in the next couple of days."

Long story short I just graduated with my BA in English Lit and I have no idea where to go from here. I went into English because:

1) I was (at the time) convinced that I had a strong grasp on grammar and writing
2) I obviously love stories in all forms, what they mean, etc
3) I was encouraged to follow my passion

I had hoped to be an editor of some sort, dreaming to one day work at a publishing house or newspaper. It seemed alright at the time. However, sitting here two years later, I'm still unemployed, as every internship even remotely related to the field has rejected me and every job listing either requires experience or has also rejected me. Every piece of writing, creative or otherwise, I've ever submitted to a journal has been rejected.

I have explored the teaching route but I honestly do not think I have the people skills to be one - which is a shame because when it comes to things I enjoy and have interest in I *love* explaining them. I've bored people to death gushing about x character's motivation or why y event happened. Keyword there being ""bored"". This is of course in one on one situations with people I'm familiar with; I can't envision myself getting up in front of a class and doing the same thing.

So, after two years, I'm forced to move back in with my parents and I am ashamed beyond belief. As the date for my move-out draws closer it's becoming all I can think about. I don't have a bad relationship with my parents by any means but it makes me physically ill to think that I'm burdening them by failing to make it on my own when I should have already (I'm in my mid 20s). 

This experience has told me that, for one, I'm not as good with writing and editing as I thought I was. Two, it's an incredibly competitive field with shrinking demand. I've scoured websites looking for ""good English major jobs"" and it all basically comes back to ""teacher"" or ""work in education"".

Is that all there really is? Should I resign myself to being a shit teacher? Should I try and find a job outside of my field and cut my losses? I feel hopelessly lost and the looming reality of living with my parents again isn't helping."

A note is created by making frequencies and combining those frequencies leads to making songs.

2. MATLAB Photoshop Application 
Basic to intermediate features like saturation, size, crop, brightness, bits, etc.

3. Reddit But

I am planning to apply for OMSCS this year and I have a few questions regarding the details of the course and my acceptance chances.   

* I am planning on taking the Machine Learning specialization - so that means I have to take the 15 credits (5 courses) mentioned on the specialization webpage and the other 5 courses can be any course offered by the OMSCS program? (i.e does it matter whether it is a foundational or a non-foundational course?)
* So, we have to complete 10 courses (3 credits each) from [here](https://omscentral.com/reviews) to get the degree, correct?
* Is there a restriction (~~min~~ 1?, ~~max~~ 3 (I guess, from the FAQs)) to the number of courses I can take per semester? Also, is there a time period within which I have to complete my degree?
* omscentral.com has been immensely helpful in knowing more about the courses offered. Is there a similar portal where I can see what each student has chosen in a particular semester/what combinations are recommended etc.?
* Even though it is an online course, are there any restrictions as to when (spring, fall etc.,) a particular course is offered?   


* Finally, can the members of this subreddit please evaluate my profile? :)
    * UG in CS (B.E CSE; Very reputable univ) - GPA: 9/10 (Indian scale) - (not sure if I should convert to US-scale?)
    * Subjects:
        * Notable CS courses: C++, Java prog., Algo, DS, Networks, OS, Compilers, Graph Theory, Cloud Computing, AI; Most projects I've done are in Python.
        * Notable Math courses: Calculus (kinda difficult to mention subject wise because in my univ they are called Math1,2,3), Linear Alg and Number theory, Probability  
    * Research Internship in ML (3 months)
    * Lots of projects/MOOCs in CS and ML
    * No work experience
    * 1 National award
    * Open source contributions (lots of ML related projects on GitHub)
    * TOEFL 112 | GRE 323 (I read that GRE is not required - but will be helpful in any if I include it in my profile or is it definitely NOT considered?)
    * My LORs will be from my professors in my univ (1 strong;2 mod)

Also, I tried applying for On-campus MS in CS at GATech, but got rejected (it was 6 months back) - it was a generic 'we had xxxx applications but can only admit yyy students' email. Will this hurt my chances of getting an admit into OMSCS?

Thank you! "

I'm heading into grade 12 this coming year and am looking for some advice on how to beef up my skills/application to SE the coming year. 

List of strengths/achievements:

-ICS4U with a 5 in AP CS A

-Internship with TCS in India this summer, and a decent rec. letter from them

-TEJ4U (Computer engineering, microcontroller/arduino)


Shortcomings: 

-I have not taken a Euclid or CCC competition. As they are written after applications, I'm worried any I take in Grade 12 may not count.

-I have limited experience actually creating anything (I plan on creating basic apps and getting them on the playstore this summer but I am very inexperienced).

Other then a few minor other points I could toss on my application like Rep. Soccer, etc. I was wondering what you guys think would be the best for me to tighten up/attempt to do to try and get into SE. I'm honestly very intimidated by the program as I have several really smart friends who applied last year (96-97 averages with 5s in AP Comp Sci and Calc) get deferred to their secondary engineering choices.. 

I'll be applying likely with an average of about 93-94 (I've currently only completed two of my six courses, with an average of 93.5)

Any help would be much appreciated, thank you.

I graduated last year and then worked as an intern at a startup backed by a popular VC firm. 
I built a very good rapport with the founder/CEO of the company who actually hired me. 
My internship was supposed to be for 4 months and I was very much hopeful that it'd turn into a full-time role.

Unfortunately, 3 months in, said founder unexpectedly passed away. Company was in shambles, it is a very young startup, and I approached new interim CEO placed by the VC and suggested him I'd look for a long-term cooperation. While he extended my internship one month more, I could not get a full-time offer since the startup is just not in a position to make new hiring. 

I am one month out of the internship and have trouble explaining this to the recruiters. I feel as if I come off as either 'a guy who jumped off the ship when things turned sour' or 'company didn't want to hire this guy'. How do I prevent that? Any suggestions to craft a succinct and strong response when recruiters ask about this role?

This will be my second year, however, I will be formally admitted into my major once my summer class is credited to me.

As much as I have been trying to find information, I cannot find all of the sub-fields that CS has to offer. I have found threads on this sub, but it hasn't resolved my lack of information. Ideally, I would like to be well rounded in most areas when I graduate. I find the CS field to be very interesting, for more than just coding. While I know absolutely nothing about it, I love playing around with networks and the stuff that most people don't typically see. I find it very interesting to understand how all of it works. I hear about courses I will have to take and I have no idea what it is.

I feel lost in my major. I have messed around with code very little before college, but the first time I have actually done something with it was from my programming course. It feels like all of these other people as far into the degree as me are so much more capable. They understand a lot of the sub-fields whereas I can really only answer to two, they know more about programming whereas I only know very elementary C++. For example, I didn't even know what SQL was, I still don't really get it, but it feels like everyone else knows what they're doing.

I want to be able to code, develop software, work with security, work with networks, set up databases, understand and create algorithms, all of it, I just don't know how to focus on an area, let alone fully understand the areas so I can determine which I enjoy the most. I hope to be rounded in all of the areas because I am genuinely interested in all of it and I believe that is what will point me in the right direction, but by the time I get enough experience with all of it I feel that it will be too late to choose electives for which sub-field I want to verse myself in more of.

People recommend working on projects and finding internships. I couldn't find an internship this summer, nobody wants someone who can only code very basic C++ that will run on a console. As far as projects go, I don't know what I could possibly work on that could be used in resumes and such given how much knowledge I lack in this area as of now. People keep suggesting to learn code online in my free time, but I don't know what language to start with and I always eventually hit a road block early on that I can never figure out because the information is not as detailed as I need it to be, instead, when I get stuck on certain functions of the language, I get sent down this rabbit hole of information and all of it is overwhelming because I don't know the general information. I don't mean for it to sound like I cannot solve problems, what I mean is that I don't have all of the fundamental ideas, I still don't know what database structures are for example, so it complicates things when hitting those roadblocks.

I just need help, some advice to point me in the right direction. I need to know what to do or who to talk to because I want to become very skilled in this area. I am passionate about it because it interests me so much, I want to do the right things to benefit myself as much as possible. Thank you for the help."

I have only done tier 1 support [break-fix for laptops, desktops, printers, projectors, etc. and hardware and software troubleshooting] and I'm trying to move into a tier 2 position with more specialized troubleshooting for software and hardware problems.

This issue is, I suck at technical interviews. With all of my experience, I don't know if I'm psyching myself out or if I actually don't know what I'm doing as well as I thought I did.

The questions I've bombed on were simple, but software specific like,

""The user is unable to login to Outlook 365 client on their computer. How would you approach this issue.""

My answer would be something like this:

""Based on my past experiences, I'd ask them when they were last able to log in. Then find out if there have been any changes to their workspace [repairs, etc.]. I would also have them check to see if Outlook is in offline mode. Lastly, I would have them confirm they're using the correct password.""

That's not what they're looking for. Apparently, it's some kind of Exchange issue or authentication issue and I have completely missed the mark.

I have no server experience except for my home lab using Windows Server R2. In my internships, I've been told I that when I troubleshoot, I look for Zebras instead of horses, when I hear hooves.

How do I stop sucking at troubleshooting? In my previous positions, I have been able to use Google to look up what I don't know, but I can't prep for a technical interview in this way. Using forums and troubleshooting FAQs has not worked.

Any ideas?

BTW, I'm a 27 year-old AA female working in a large metro on the east coast [not NYC]. I've never made more than $13/hr [even though the norm for entry level is $15 - $22/hr] in IT and I would love to finally move into a better position.

I currently work for a job that is monotonous at best, and get paid 13 less than what I got paid working for this same company before.  The problem is I have no footing to stand on as this is a different department, and they don't really care about my references from the other department.  I've been looking for a job anywhere else that would put me into the 20/h mark, but not many seem to be accepting someone with a resume like me.  Even when I got hired for this current job they said someone with my skills should be at somewhere better, but you know, money is needed to survive.

The problem is my resume is widely spread out across fields.  I have engineering intern work, in which I worked internationally for a summer, I have military service, previous stints with this same company at higher positions, as well as teaching/tutoring in the side for extra income.  I've taught myself some programming and adapted other people's code for my own projects, but don't have my own portfolio, all this while going to school and just turning 21 in the next month.  It seems to me that a lot of these companies look at my resume and just assume I'm talking out of my ass, even though I have military records, multiple references and everything, or they think that I'm so young I won't fit into the work environment.

What is the best way to even go about getting what I feel i deserve, low 20s for pay.  How can I make employers realize I'm not some little kid who's lived off mummy and daddy and not had to work and amass his own skills to make it?

Tldr; I have what I presume is a great resume and skills, but no one really hires or believes what I'm putting down because of my age.  What do?"

Hey everyone I was hoping I could get some feedback from the MBA community about realistic expectations and courses of action moving forward. Thanks for any input in advance. 

Background:

•	Undergrad: Top 150 school in the United States (big state school)

•	Major/GPA: Chemistry with a Biochemistry concentration and Physics minor (3.55 GPA)

•	Graduate GPA: Currently enrolled in a top 25 engineering school doing a masters in Chemical Engineering (3.4 GPA), will write a thesis 

•	Extra curriculars: 4 year D1 athlete (men’s basketball), active in community service with special needs 
        kids throughout undergrad, member of a social fraternity (don’t know if this is even worth including?), 
        volunteer tutor to underprivileged children throughout college and graduate school 

•	Race/Nationality: White, American

•	Sex: Male

•	Work: Currently interning at a biomedical startup that has recently raised a few million from investors 
        and gotten a few million from the DOD (I’m developing wound care devices but also help with market 
        research, administrative and logistical roles for the company) [last 5 months]. In undergrad I had a part 
        time job senior year as a lab tech and have some research experience but otherwise do not have much 
        work experience because basketball was a year round full time job (required to be on campus taking 
        classes and working out all summer) with an unpredictable schedule.
 
Long story short going to college I had no idea what I wanted to do, I was just focused on playing D1 basketball. I studied Chemistry because it interested me and my father advised me to get a technical degree, saying it is easier to go from STEM to business than vice versa. Wanted to get the MS to see if I liked research (it is interesting but I know I don’t want to spend my life in a lab, I definitely want to be on the management side of a company). I’m also flirting with the idea of going into finance (on a whim when to a GS presentation and applied for an internship, had a few interviews with them but ultimately didn’t end up getting the internship).  Economics and finance has been an interest of mine, I took a few econ classes in undergrad and read books on economics and finance in my free time. 

I know an MBA early can be a potential deterrent to employers but I wanted to reach out and get some advice on what to do to get into a good MBA program down the road. I took the GRE to get into my MS program and had a 166 Q, 162 V and 4.5 on the essay, should I bother retaking the GMAT or use these scores? I think I could improve on these as I was rushed studying for the GRE between basketball and classes. 

Lastly I suspect the HBS 2+2 is very unlikely with my stats, should I bother with trying to do apply to something like that or the GBS program straight out of grad school (went straight for the MS so I am eligible for these programs)? I think I could weave a pretty good/unique story about a business idea I have (has to do with college technology licensing offices not capitalizing on a large number of discoveries (outside of top power house schools who have excellent technology licensing offices) due to the patent system/professor’s lack of interest/various other factors and many potentially exciting technologies fall by the wayside as a result. Anyways if that is outside of the realm of possibility what should I do moving forward if I want to get into a top program? I could stay the start-up I am at after I graduate or could move into a bigger more established company or try for a Wall Street firm. 

Sorry it’s a bit long winded but I appreciate any feedback!

I am in the middle of earning my bachelor's degree and continue to take an extra year or two to earn my Master's right after I graduate from my bachelor's program.

I have been interning at a company this past summer, and my internship ends tomorrow.

Seriously, if you need an evening or weekend job while you're still in school, we can offer you that. In the future, we'd love to have you back at the company. We are continuing to grow and can find a place for you.""

I'm not really sure if that was a solid job offer (although, I'd only be sure if I had a contract in my hands) or if he was just trying to be nice/was in a good mood. Would you say there's a good chance I'd be able to get a full-time job here after my Master's program? He is aware that I'm still in school and will continue to be for a few more years.

On top of that, they invited us to come back next summer as an intern. Of course, not an official offer or anything, but I'm wondering - should I return next summer if given the chance, or should I try interning somewhere else? While the work I did was tedious and mundane, it was actually very meaningful and contributed to the company's growth significantly. I love the company culture, the team, etc. and I'd seriously consider coming back here in the future. I'm sort of lost on whether I should  return as an intern next summer because I don't want to continue to work here only to not receive an official job offer after graduating. But if I am in the running for a full-time offer, I'd love  to continue to grow at the company, develop my connections with the people here, etc.

[EDIT:1] Our CRM system proposed a list of duplicate contacts after merging our data warehouse  with 5 other companies in one centralized system. the list assigned all records it thought was the same the same ID. Using that ID, I matched the records and used a weighted levenshtein algorithm to generate a percentage similarity. I used that percentage and the rules given by manager to determine which record remained the master record, and which ones were merged. i also merged everything above a certain threshold, removing 150,000 manual records to examine between two people, down to about 5000.

we knocked those out in an afternoon. 

think 1000 records a day from 5 people for an 8 hour shift ~ 5000 a day. this equates to about 30 work days of work, completed in one day because I wrote a program to throw out stupid cases that should have been merged automatically to begin with.

I am having the hardest time finding a first job. 

I have some issues:

I have been trying to find jobs in Chicago while living in NC. This is going to change in a week when I go to stay with family until I find a job. 

I don't have any professional experience using GIS.  I have what I learned in school; two GIS classes, some cart, remote sensing, the basics really. I am doing an online, teach yourself python class and am signed up for a advanced GIS class online in the fall. 

I've applied to countless jobs. It is tiring. My resume probably isn't the greatest but I am having it professional written on linked in. 

EVERYONE WANTS EXPERIENCE. I get it. But how does one get experience when no one will hire me?

I had an internship after grad, with the USDA. No GIS involved but did use maps and gps kind of stuff. 

I am in contact with a tech recruiter in Chicago who is keeping an eye out for me, but I'm not confident about that. 

I am looking for any kind of position that uses GIS that is entry level. I have had a few interviews here and there but none have worked out for me. 

I have tried to read all the other job posted here and on r/geography about how to secure that first job. My question for r/GIS is what else can I be doing now to get experience to use to get that first job or just things I can do to help get a job at all. Maybe some ideas of part time jobs or temporary jobs that would help get me a job using GIS later on?

I am at my wits end here. I am so discouraged and anxious about getting a job, I am starting to feel like I got a worthless degree.

However, we have never worked with interns before and I have no idea how to make this a win-win cooperation.

After talking with local founders, I was a bit upset... Many folks pointed out that local interns:

1. need a structural constant guidance (and it's faster to do task by yourself, then teaching interns)

2. don't know how to make desitions independently (so they always expect a solution, not trying to find answers. Note: that might be a thing with Ukrainian education system).

3. have no idea what does it mean to work in a startup (and have a fake expectation -&gt; quit later on).

I'm a recent CIS graduate who's taken an Internship at a local construction company (~300 employees). 
My title is technically ""Digital Media Intern"" and they explained they'd like me to help do IT work as well. 
Currently I have a relatively balanced amount of Social Media management/content creation work and IT work, but I imagine going forward the IT side of things will take up more of my time. 
My current IT duties include setting up and troubleshooting a lot of computers, phones and systems around the office as well as writing code for other employees or running reports in the system. On the Social Media side of things I keep things updated as well as creating content and working with the company on brand reviews and presentations. 

Before, all IT work had to be done through a ticketing system and have an out-of-state technician come in to fix things since there is no IT person on site, so I feel like I've been a really great help to people who previously had to wait a while to be assisted. 
My boss has told me since day 1 that she hopes she can keep me and has been saying recently I can take the Intern part off my title. I've asked if I need to sign any paperwork (benefits pls) and she's somewhat brushed it off and says we'll do it later. I don't think she's never going to get around to it but it does make me question things a bit. 

I have a meeting with HR today regarding other matters and am looking to speak with her about this. I'm currently making $17/h and would like to bring up salary but I'm not sure what salary range would be appropriate as I'm having difficult finding people on glassdoor or similar sites who do a mix of both IT and Social Media. 

Is it unreasonable to ask about salary and are they expecting me they'll keep me on the same pay rate? I really have no idea about transitioning to a full-time employee from an intern but I would hope that could come with a raise. It seems like the average salary range of both IT Support and Social Media people in my state (MA) are in the high 40s low 50s range, is this unreasonable to ask for? I have entry-level experience but I feel as if I do more than entry-level work. (I think? idk really?)

Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: TL;DR: Was intern - moving to full time, does this come with a raise &amp; how much is reasonable? "

But, this is more of a part-time internship, with possibly significantly lower pay than usual for the job title. I'll also be working weekends and sometimes overnight (while I have school) I also messed up when asked about salary - I said I earned around $25 and I thought that was too much, and said I was willing to negotiate and maybe take lower pay. (HUGE MISTAKE! I'M FACEPALMING SO HARD) Also, the commute is around 1hr 15 min.

My current Service Desk internship at a financial firm is great, I'm friends with all my coworkers, the work is great and I'm learning a lot. My supervisor is giving me a lot of challenges and also is giving me more and more opportunities to learn, including having elevated privileges and doing L2 tickets. Also, the pay is great. It's $25/hr! My supervisor said he's willing to extend my internship into the school year... Commute isn't as bad. more like 50 min.

Landed a full-time job June 26th. I'm making decent money and had hoped to stay at company for 1-2 years because the pay and benefits are good for entry-level, I'm learning a lot, and it fits nicely into stories for what I eventually want to do.

Earlier this week our CEO sent out an email that the company is cutting 10% of its workforce and that this will be done in two waves between now and September. First wave has already concluded with much of corporate and HR employees sent home. There are also rumors that this is being done in a bid to sell the company to a competitor.

I've had several coworkers and my family tell me that I need to start applying to other jobs to be prepared. I don't think I will be laid off because my department is important for state/federal regulations and contracts, but I don't want to rely on that thinking. Even if I'm not laid off, the company may still be going under and if sold I could be let go anyway. Am I right in that?

Honestly this is my first experience with this and I don't know what I should be doing. It was the only job offer I received after college, and I wanted to stick with it for 1-2 years to gain experience to be able to get a better job then. I have less than $300 in savings so can't relocate unless offered a relocation package. 

Should I go ahead and start applying to stuff just in case? What if they call my employer and tell them I'm job searching? Does it look bad that I'm trying to ""jump ship"" (it has been in some news, so it wouldn't be hard for them to google my company and find out what's going on). If asked why I'm job searching while employed do I tell them the truth or say something along the lines of I'm just looking for more responsibility and to learn more?

Family and coworkers who are also jumping ship are urging me to leave if offered a better position regardless of whether I am laid off or not, but I just feel so bad. I've only been there for a month and they were already worried I would jump ship if they hired me (also did an internship with them). Also, I don't want to leave just yet.

I finally have the time/courage to make it now and I'm a bit lost about where to start.

Basically, my problem is as follows: I want to make an app but I don't know with what tools I will be able to make it.

I have significant experience using Unity, making games in C#. But I don't think it's a good idea to develop a non-gaming app in Unity just because I ""know my way around it"". I have worked with WPF during an internship on an existing software and I actually started a few WPF projects on my own right now to know what it would feel like to develop my own app without any of the structure that the company had when I worked there. It turns out it's super intimidating for a beginner to start from scratch and I don't really see myself being able to bring my application to life with that any time soon. I feel it's a bit overkill for what I wanna do.

So here I am, having tried to look for other tools but I have no idea which one of them are actually realistic for my level of experience and appropriate for the simplicity of the app I have in mind.

What have you guys used to make your first desktop apps? Should I really just buckle up and learn WPF (I hear UWP is an option, but to me it's still intimidating) or are there alternatives out there that are as ""simple to learn"" as Unity in terms of data binding, dependencies and stuff. I'm in need of some advice here.

6q80xa,9,2017-07-28,The Dream that became Reality. Part I,BryanUguito,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6q80xa/the_dream_that_became_reality_part_i/,"Riley died almost three years ago now. I've always struggled to decide what to say he was in relation to me. He was my next-door neighbor, but he was more than that. The best term I can use is my little brother. I've known him since he was born, and we shared everything together, including more than our fair share of fights. But we never stayed mad more than 48 hours, as there was always something we had to talk to each other about, whether it was girls, parents, sports, whatever. He was small for his age, but was surprisingly strong, as he was the the one who gave me my 8th, and hopefully last, concussion (remember this number) on accident in a game of backyard football. 

He was two years younger than me, so it was hard on both of us when I left for college. We promised to visit each other often, as I was just going to the state school a little more than 2 hours from my house, but I wanted to try to branch out and meet new people at school without him. So when he texted me on October 16th asking if he could come visit the following day to drink and hangout, I ignored it. I remember the exact moment I got the text, as I was walking home from the gym with a new friend, who would soon become one of my best friends, Connor. I woke up the morning of October 18th, checked my phone, and instantly knew something was wrong. 10 missed calls from my mom, 7 from my dad, 5 from my best friend from home, John, along with a text from him saying ""call me. Very bad"". I sat in bed motionless for a minute, not wanting to know what I had a terrible feeling had happened. My mom called again, and I answered. In tears, she broke the news to me that Riley had died in a car crash the previous night, the night he wanted to visit me. The cause of the crash was never identified, besides the fact that the driver was inexperienced, must have somehow lost control of the car, and hit a tree. I blamed myself as I believe many in my situation would, but went through counseling and have slowly been able to move on. However, he's never left my mind. 

Fast forward to about a week ago. I was staying at my apartment at school as I was working at an internship much closer to school than my house. I live in a small 2 bedroom apartment with Connor, the same man who I was walking home from the gym with when I received the last text from Riley I ever got. I was laying in bed when he knocked on my door, I got up to open it and he asked me when I wanted to go to the gym. I gave him a quick answer and he turned to walk back to his room. I felt dizzy, a common sensation for me that happens often due to my many concussions and me trying to stand up too fast, so I turned to go back to my bed to sit down while it passed. I never made it back to my bed. The last thing I remember was the feeling of my knees buckling and expecting to feel the pain as I hit the ground, but it never came.

I woke up in a bed that was not my own. That is not entirely true, what I mean is I woke up in a bed that was no longer my own, or at least shouldn't have been. But I would recognize the uncomfortable feel and size of my freshman dorm room bed anywhere. At 6’3.5”, I was just a half inch too short to qualify for a longer bed, stupid university rules, but my feet still hung over the end considerably. As I looked around, I saw my freshman year roommate sleeping in the bed on the other side of the room, and my freshman year dorm room decorated just as it had been. I grabbed my phone and realized it was the iPhone5, not the iPhone6 I have now, and the date said October 3rd, 2014 at 8:03am. This had to be a delusion of some sort, I thought I must have slipped into a coma and was just imagining everything. But it felt so real. I made my mind up in an instant, I had a chance to see Riley again, and illusion or not I was going to take it. I called him, telling him I was sorry I ignored his text last night but would love for him to come visit that night. He agreed, and said he would leave after school was over. 

The next several hours seemed to last forever, as I explored the world of 2014 awaiting my lost friend's return. He finally arrived, and I hugged him much longer than he was comfortable with, protesting since I saw him ""less than 2 months ago"". For some reason I didn't want to tell him the truth, so I let go and we began our shenanigans. The night resulted in us going to a bar famous for letting in under aged kids (gotta love state colleges right?) with my freshman year girlfriend who I am still in love with to this day. We were having a great time until I locked eyes with the kid who lived across the hall from me and despised with a burning passion, Will. Will walked up to our group with an irritating swagger, bragging about how he was already being recruited by fraternities. I knew he would rush, and be denied by every fraternity on campus, so this comment didn't bother me much and I turned away. Annoyed by my lack of reaction, Will proceeded to slap my girlfriends ass, hoping he to get a spark out of me. He was successful and I turned around swinging, I landed a good one, but he got one right back. He then broke a beer bottle over a chair and began to threaten me and Riley, who had joined my side in battle. Unfortunately Will received backup as well, as one of his goons landed a blindside punch on the side of my head. I was going down, once again expecting pain upon contact with the floor, but once again it never came. 

I awoke to Connor gently slapping slapping my face telling me to wake up or he was calling an ambulance. When he realized my consciousness, he asked me what had happened. I attempted to tell him the story, but must have sounded crazy as he shrugged it off and told me to take the day off from the gym to rest up. I took his advice, but couldn't shake the dream or whatever I had from my mind, so I called my mom. She knew Riley very well, as he practically lived in our house much of my younger life, so I talked to her periodically about how much I miss him and my guilt from that night. I also thought I should tell her about my latest development with my head, to see if she believed if there was any cause for concern. Based off the look Connor gave me about my story, I decided to keep my dream quiet for now. My mom answered, as always, and after a short conversation about how I missed Riley, I told her about my fainting spell. As to be expected, she was concerned and said she would call the doctor, but she had heard of similar things happening and ""after all you have had 9 concussions"". ""No mom, I've only had 8, I thought by now you could keep that number straight."" ""No it's been 9, the one from (redacted)... and finally the one from that bar fight the night Riley was killed."" I froze. I didn't know how to respond, so I quickly said ""you're right, gotta go, love you"" and hung up. 

I opened my computer and went to the bookmark I had of Riley's obituary which described the car accident, however now it had a different story. The obituary went on to say how Riley had been involved in a bar fight at my school, and had been stabbed and killed by Will yelling a broken beer bottle. Will was now in prison. I couldn't believe my eyes, the dream was not a dream, it was reality. I had gone back in time and changed the past, but definitely not for the better.

6qa8ty,7,2017-07-29,They hate explaining what my job is,UseYourNameYo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6qa8ty/they_hate_explaining_what_my_job_is/,"So I've been to 3 internships so far and every single time I ended up in the same situation when the boss failed at giving me proper instructions on what my job is or what I'm supposed to be doing. More to that, coworkers often acted really cold and uninterested. Of course, I asked for work and they'd come up with something to get rid of me... But most of the time, the boss and his permanent employees were also too busy having loud discussions about unimportant things even though they saw I was standing right there waiting for them to tell me what to do. It's as if I could stand right in front of their faces all day but they will act like I'm not even there until I say something. I'm a shy person myself but if you see someone standing in front of you, aren't you supposed to at least notice that ? These people just go on chatting and laughing about stuff like I'm invisible.

In the last company that I quit after 2 days, the boss was absent for half of the day and I was just standing there not knowing what to do. When I asked for work several times, he had nothing to give me because they had no system. When we would finally begin doing something, he wouldn't let me do it alone as the place was a complete mess and only he knew what was where... Then his friends would show up and he would just ignore whatever we were in the middle of and proceed to chat with them for half an hour about completely irrelevant personal topics... So basically I got really sick of that attitude and left.

Is this something that is completely normal and I'm just being demanding or was it actually rude of them to act this way?"

6qc15e,3,2017-07-29,Regarding job scams,WalkingDown46,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6qc15e/regarding_job_scams/,"Hello Redditors, 

Hope your day is going well. As some of you, I am a recent college graduate, and having a hell of a time finding a career, especially in the area in which I live. That's beside the point, though. Here is the main point of this post:

I went to a school near Chicago and just graduated in May 2017. Good amount of great employers in the area, obviously. There are also ones that will contact you, even after they make you blow your top. Let me discuss two that I think are detrimental, and you can argue as to why you agree or disagree. Keep in mind the 1st one is mainly a Chicago-based company, while the second one is Satan's child. 

#1. Northwestern Mutual. 

I first came into contact with an employee of Northwestern Mutual in October 2014, as a result of an internship fair at the university I attended. Seemed like a nice person, and presented the information, very well. Things happened in my life that prevented me from taking an internship with the company, that coming summer. They understood completely. Sometimes, unexpected, uncontrollable events happen to people. I appreciated their understanding, and even kept in contact with the recruiter, who more so wanted to make sure I was doing ok. Great person. Come, I think October 2016, representatives of Northwestern Mutual kept contacting me. I understood this was because they saw on my LinkedIn I would be graduating in May. I was fine with it, as I was going to be in search of a job sooner or later. Fast forward to April 2016 and forward, it seemed constant. I began to see Northwestern Mutual and the insurance company form of Vector Marketing (if any of you are familiar with Vector Marketing, you should know that indirect punch.) Currently, I am still looking for a job, which is difficult due to where I live, but am probably relocating soon. Over the past several weeks, Northwestern Mutual has hounded me so many times to express interest and apply. Yet, most reviews on Glassdoor and other Internet sources literally destroy the Financial Advisor program that many college graduates take up as a job out of college. What is your experience with Northwestern Mutual? I am beginning to see them as negative, due to the experience I have had and the reviews I have read. 

#2. Comcast (Satan). 

So, as you know, you can post your resume to multiple websites and recruiters will browse them. It is a rarity for me to receive calls as a result of Indeed, Monster, etc., but when I do, I get a bit excited because it shows someone took the time to view my resume. Comcast (Satan) is one of those companies. At first, I thought I would take up a job with them, until my experience with their Internet. Shouldn't work for a company if you do not like their products, right? Comcast (Satan) hires an insane number of people to work as Field Sales Reps (aka door-to-door salesman.) They hawk resumes, with no restrictions. They contact (almost) anybody. At the beginning of this year, I was having Internet troubles. Called Comcast (Satan,) resolved it. Come a day or so later, got a call from Comcast (Satan) saying they needed Field Sales Reps. I told them I am not interested and to remove me from the talent system. They said they would do so. Very professional people (at least then.) Come Spring Break of this year, I was headed to Chicago for St. Paddy's Parade. They called me early that morning. I told them to please remove my name from their talent system. They said they would. Now, I was getting irritated, but at least I could drink at St. Paddy's and forget about Comcast (Satan) contacting me to work as a salesman. From April onward, even yesterday (7/28/17,) they have contacted me at least once, if not more times, during the day. I have ripped them new ones and said I would file a report if they did not remove my resume and name from their talent system, as I had been subjected to this torture for a little over 6 months. For those who have been in this situation, how have you succeeded in telling Comcast (Satan) to stop all communication regarding jobs with them? I have heard so many poor factual claims regarding the shit structure of their sales positions, and I said that to one of their recruiters, but didn't stop them from having another recruiter contact me to get me suckered into their trap. I would appreciate any advice in how to stop Comcast (Satan) to stop contacting me. Anything able to be contributed is free game. "

Hello there!

I am hoping to make the switch from marketing to public relations and I am looking for advice on what I should highlight and what I should downplay on my resume.

While I know many PR professionals consider PR to be the ""[the Red-Headed Stepchild of Marketing](http://www.ereleases.com/pr-fuel/pr-remains-red-headed-stepchild-marketing/)"", I have often heard marketing used as a dirty word in some PR circles. No matter your stance on the issue, I think a certain rivalry exists in the ""promotional/communications"" industry as a whole.

That said, I graduated from a fairly well known Division 1 size PR program that incorporates PR into their journalism curriculum. After graduation, I went to work for a medium/large municipality in the Midwest for a little over a year. In this capacity I did a mixture of marketing and communications work. I had little to no oversight, no clear goals and no mentor. I left that position both for the aforementioned reasons and to move closer to my wife to whom I had recently wed. Using my alumni connections, I networked into a job in my state's capital city. The position is a marketing position, with a very heavy emphasis on email marketing. I have been in this position for almost three years.

I want to leave this position with the goal of working for one of the many outstanding PR firms near me. I believe that both writing and strategy are my strong suits.

I am curious what I should highlight or remove from my resume to be attractive to a PR firm. Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.

I'm currently a grad student and have been working with an organization related to my field in an internship type role for a few months. Through some of my previous research I made a connection that works for this organization who offered me this job. At first it was a temporary summer thing, but the work was sparse and we decided to extend the contract for another 6 months, but just do less hours of work per week to allow for more projects to arise over time.  

I would really like to work for this organization in a full time role once I graduate in the next year or so. However, they haven't given much work for me to do so it's been hard to showcase my value. It's especially hard since we're in different states (although not too far, about a 8 hour drive away). They are very nice to me but are often busy and through this summer a lot of my main point people have been taking vacation so it's been hard to really get going with the work. I know I could add a lot to this company and really align with their values and goals - but I need some advice on how to go above and beyond and showcase my value to them and make a difference. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation and have any suggestions? "

6qd5ac,5,2017-07-29,"With the following situation, how reasonable is it to return to college to network and give new life to a stale programming career?",return2collegecs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6qd5ac/with_the_following_situation_how_reasonable_is_it/,"Read a few other recent topics on people wanting to get a CS degree but they're switching from different careers. Those got me inspired to write this.

I already have industry experience in software (mostly web development) but my 4-year degree is not in CS. I have been a software engineer for 10 years but usually in small companies and usually very underpaid. I don't have assets saved other than a few thousand in a checking account.

I'm thinking of returning to college in the fall for the following reasons:

- Fill the skills gaps I missed for not taking CS
- Much better than MOOC's for building a network, and can join academic clubs
- Earn opportunities for internships and/or co-ops at major corporations
- Held to less strict standards by major corps than mid-level programmers*

Here are the cons I know of for returning:

- Can't work 9-5 while in college. At worst I may have to take a ""McJob"" to help make ends meet
- I will accrue some debt from attending college
- Network quality might greatly depend on the college you attend

My current string of jobs usually don't have good job leads, programming practices, or employees is hurting me. It is difficult to build a good network from small, struggling companies. When I contact people in my network about jobs 9/10 times they don't hear about anything. I telecommute for work so there's not much to talk about as well.

Also, one of my career goals is to work in aerospace related software systems (not defense-related, but civilian). So I would really need a CS degree and a decent network for that.

**There's an ironic advantage that new CS graduates have in the job market- they are held to less strict hiring standards by large companies. As someone that is years into a career, I feel a strangeness in companies that hold all mid-level applicants to the same standards, even though the patterns of what mid-level programmers experienced (and the knowledge they missed) varies much more greatly than the patterns of new grads.*

Now you have an idea of my situation. So would it be a good idea to get back into school for a CS degree in a situation like mine? Has anyone here attempted it, and has it worked out?

6qed55,44,2017-07-29,I got into an m7 (Wharton) with a Pure sales background and now work in mBB. I wanted to share my experience,diekei2,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/6qed55/i_got_into_an_m7_wharton_with_a_pure_sales/,"I've seen a few posts on here discouraging others from pursuing a career in sales as it relates to MBA admissions. In particular, some have argued sales doesn't look great at M7 or t15 programs (and recruiters who go there) because it has a low barrier to entry, it's not a desirable job function for top undergrads, doesn't sell one as being an intellectual powerhouse, is viewed as a solitary profession as opposed to team based, etc. 

In fact, I saw someone saying it doesn't matter if you work at a brand name company as role is important - saying just because some works at JP Morgan doesn't mean they have a desirable MBA job if they work in the wrong job, such as a bank teller. To these people, ""sales"" is a similarly ""low-prestige"" profession to being a bank teller, even at a top company, and isn't a good feeder into top MBA programs.

However, my sales background didn't hinder me at all in my MBA application process. Remember that the top programs are focused on putting together diverse classes of high-performing professionals. Yes, bankers and consultants make up a portion of those classes every year but they're certainly not the only industries eligible for those top programs. (And the bankers and consultants are actually over-represented in the MBA applicant pool, often making it more challenging for them to differentiate themselves from the pack). My interviewers said I could bring a great element of diversity with a non-traditional pre-MBA career.

To be transparent, I worked in high-tech B2B sales at a top tech company (think Oracle, IBM, SAP, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, etc.), and had upward career trajectory with two promotions, which looks good at a f100 firm. 

Breaking into tech sales at a top firm is difficult, and most of my sales co workers went to top undergrad programs (Cornell, Duke, Georgetown, UC Berkeley, USC, UCLA, UMich, UVA, Boston College, UNC Chapel Hill, UCSB etc.), had legit majors (UCB Haas, UCB Econ, USC Marshall, UVA Econ, UMich Ross, and one person from Duke mechanical engineering with a 3.82 GPA!, although there were a lot of high-GPA liberal arts people too), had business internships, and had decent grades (we had a hard 3.2 minimum GPA requirement, and most had a 3.5+ college GPA). We 1000+ applicants for maybe around 100 spots every six months, and people who went to non prestigious schools or state schools, who didn't get good grades, etc., got cut. I know a lot of fellow UCB people who got cut from the interview process. 

Maybe sales in general doesn't have a high barrier to entry, but tech sales at a top brand-name famous f100 company definitely does. The products I sold (ERP, middleware) were very complex, and I had to learn a little bit of coding and spend quite a bit of time getting my technical knowledge up to par as a non-tech person. Due to this, what I was selling was intellectual stimulating. You have to have both book smarts (to understand and convey the complex tech products) and street smarts to pitch them to clients. The pay can be very high (80k+) for only 40 hours a week, so it was desirable for many fellow UC Berkeley grads (we had a TON of UCB people at my office, in fact most salespeople were from there and USC). Moreover, tech sales is very, very team based especially when you're dealing with strategic prospects (those with revenues exceed 2 billion/year).

I was always exceeding quota and was in the top 20-30% of my salesforce. 

What helped in my interviews and essays was showing at how my role as an Account Executive showcased how I'd driven the strategy and vision for a business unit vs. simply being a great salesman. During my last promotion, I directly managed a sales team as ""team lead."" Overall, I had 3.5 years of experience at said top tech company at time of application, and 4.5 years of WE at time of matriculation into Wharton. 

Interviewers said it was very impressive that not only did I get into a top tech firm right out of undergrad, that I had a few promotions along the way, which is difficult to accomplish at a f100 firm with all its red tape. Moreover, they praised my interviewing skills, saying not many people at top MBA programs have a sales background, and it'd be an asset to me since I'd have no problem in public speaking, making connections, building rapport with clients, etc. 

I had other things going for me - I graduated UC Berkeley as a History major, had a 3.81 GPA, and got a 750 on the GMAT (50Q). Plus a few good ECs here and there. On the other hand, I was a straight white male who was 28 years old, on the older side.

I used my good academic stats, plus key stories from my WE to address and overcome the stereotypes some business people had on my profession, to show people I was smart and had both academic chops in addition to people skills, and I ultimately succeeded with it. WE, while the most important factor, is only part of your application, and your GMAT score and GPA (as well as undergrad institution) play a huge part. As does your ability to write a coherent story -- I tied in very carefully how doing demos and solving clients' business problems made me enjoying the consulting parts of my job, and why I wanted to do management consulting full-time. ECs can put you over the top.

While I didn't work at Goldman Sachs or Bain, or worked in IBD or consulting, I never felt my sales background was a hindrance in the MBA application process or while applying to consulting roles at my MBA program. Good soft skills always helps, and you can spin things in your favor. I wouldn't characterize working in tech-sales, at say Oracle, as non-blue chip for example. Oracle (along with Salesforce, IBM, Google, Microsoft), etc. is a brand-name company and tech sales/BD is a solid and lucrative field. 

I was pulling in about $100k annually as a tech salesman prior to my MBA, for example, and the soft skills I gained from being in sales helped me immensely in building a network at my M7 program, securing the MBB interviews, being likable to others, rock all the behavioral interviews I ever did, become well-liked by peers who could give me references, and succeeded in recruitment (although you need the technical know how for the consulting case interviews of course).

While working as a used car salesman at a dealership probably won't look the best, if you work at a brand name company (top f100 firm), have a promotion or two, had some leadership experience, and were a top-performer, you can be very competitive for M7 or t16 MBA programs. For full disclosure, I got rejected from Harvard, Stanford, Tuck, and Sloan, but got into Wharton, Booth, Kellogg, and Columbia (I applied R1 for most of them). However, I did get interviews (ultimately denied) for Tuck and Sloan. Didn't use an admissions consultant, and I applied around four years ago. 

My ultimate goal is to do a tech startup after cutting my teeth a few years here in MBB. To be honest, management consulting wasn't all that it was made out to be, and I'm doing it to pay off my loans before jumping into entrepreneurship. However the experience here has been fantastic and I love my peers.

But I don't regret starting out my professional life in sales, and it's been invaluable as a consultant -- I've been able to edge out compared to some of my peers who are very book smart but lack social skills. I was a complete nerd in college, and sales helped me refine my emotional intelligence, which is imperative in business. And many CEOs come out of a sales background (virtually every IBM CEO has a sales background), so that'll help me in entrepreneurship.

I think sales is devalued in ""elite"" circles to people's detriment and that's a shame. But if it's something you're interested in pursuing, go for it, and you can get into a top MBA program (M7 or T16) if you're overall package is good. If you feel being a salesman is a good fit you for, don't disavow it merely because someone said it won't look good or ""prestigious"" for MBA apps."

I am finishing up calculus 3 over the summer. I took it as an online class, but had difficulties with the online program we were using. I realize I do better if I'm attending an in person class and can take down notes from the teacher and prepare for the tests they create, as opposed to an online generated test in which I didn't feel the homework assignments prepared me for well enough.

I know I can do better but I am nervous about how two C's in math will look when I apply for internships and jobs. I'm majoring in civil/environmental engineering.

Should I retake calculus 3 in the fall or keep moving along? (while making sure I do well in the rest of my classes of course)"
6qeh2a,15,2017-07-29,Taking a Quarter Break?,osu_cs_break,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/6qeh2a/taking_a_quarter_break/,"I'm using a throwaway because I'm so embarrassed. Apologies in advance if this is annoying and scattered. You can flame me if you want, because I've been doing it to myself for a few weeks now.

**TLDR: I'm a mediocre CS student and I feel my self-confidence and interest in the subject dwindling. Would a break help? How would you recommend I get back on track?**

I'm in my early 30s and have never really held a proper career with my first degree. Instead, I had a series of low-paying, menial jobs. My partner is doing well enough for the both of us and we live within our means, so we're not worried about money, but I was raised to be industrious and a ""breadwinner,"" and feel like CS is the only opportunity I have to meaningfully contribute. 

The problem is, I'm pretty sure I suck at it. Badly.

I'm sitting on a mid-3.x GPA and feel like I'm struggling to keep it from going into freefall. Every class feels more like a painful obstacle to be overcome instead of an opportunity to learn and grow. I'm intimidated by how much everyone else seems to know compared to me, and I hate going to Piazza to get help because I find so many students kicking ass on the next assignment while I'm having to pull long nights to get the current one done just in the nick of time. Granted, I'm not one of those Anonymous posts asking ""how should I start on this program?"" twelve hours before it's due, but I don't feel any better than them. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine that I'm somewhere in the lower third of our program's roster in terms of ability. If the worst case scenario is failing to finish the degree, the second worst case is finishing and having nothing come of it. The next worst case is ending up in a job and being like Big Head from Silicon Valley: a ""useless appendage"" that my team hates.

I have repeated this same ugly cycle ever term so far: 

* The first week or two is simple enough. I read and take notes on the lectures. 
* I approach the programming assignment. I read it over. It either looks simple enough that I underestimate it, or it terrifies me.    
* I try to work it out, comparing what I have in my notes to what's expected.
* I get stuck, either with a concept or the syntax, or with how to implement the solution with them,  and I get really frustrated.
* I visit Google dozens and dozens of times, trying to find out to do simple things, and get frustrated when StackOverflow gives only unnecessarily complicated and snarky answers.
* I'll frantically try different things until something works, either perfectly or just enough that I can hope for some partial credit.
* I repeat the last four steps and submit it just barely in time for an okay grade.
* Since the assignment burned up all the time I'd budgeted for studying the next concept, I repeat the last five steps, but more frantically. 
* I swear that next term, I'll get ahead on reading and the concepts.

I feel like I'm not really retaining anything after I'm done. I've revisited old Intro to CS programs and need time to figure out what they do. I doubt I could write them now if I tried. How dark is my future in this field if I have to revisit pointers before I do any work in C or C++, or if I keep forgetting how to do basic things like implement classes and have to visit Google for the particulars?

I hate how it feels like I'm making excuses, and I have resisted the idea despite some pretty damning evidence, but my partner and I are beginning to suspect I may have adult ADD. The catch-22 is I can't afford to have it diagnosed or treated until I get a job with health benefits, and I fear I won't be able to get said job with my lackluster GPA and scrawny GitHub portfolio. 

At this point, It's too late to back out of the program. I have a small handful of courses to look forward to before I'm finished, and I'm not looking forward to them or to finishing. Instead, I feel some serious anxiety at the thought of having a second degree that looks nice on paper but doesn't result in me getting a job. 

It's pretty clear I'm feeling burn-out. I've talked it over with my partner and we agreed I should consider taking the Fall off.

I want to believe I can spend those few months recovering, building up my GitHub and my language skills, and taking better care of myself. It's been weeks since I've gone outside except to run errands with my partner, and I almost always feel guilty that I'm not at my computer. I want to take on my last few classes feeling fresh and confident, and I want to believe I have the sort of knowledge and skill that reflects well on me, that I *deserve* this degree instead of feeling like I went through the motions and got it like a Cracker Jack prize.

My questions are: 

* Does this sound anything like your experience? Even a little?    
* If you took a break because you felt somewhat similarly, did taking a break help? 
* How badly does a break affect your financial aid situation?    
* At what point do you feel like you ""know"" enough to apply to internships?    

I can't be the only one who isn't a 3.7 student comfortable in a dozen languages, with a stack of personal projects and a previous STEM degree that made this whole course ""easy,"" right?"

I'm very excited about this as it is ranked among the best in the nation and I'm sure a degree from there will make things a lot easier for me, but my background of 2 years at CC has caused some complications. I transferred in as a junior, but only 81/90 credits transferred (need 180 to graduate with BS) so I am a little behind credits wise, and since people also get admitted into the program sophomore year and have access to the classes then, so I am also behind in the CS courses. I have also had an internship since almost the start of my Freshmen year (so almost 2 years there now) at a small-medium sized company, but I am going to be quitting once school starts up. I was contemplating taking Summer classes between my junior and senior year to make up for this and graduate on time while still having taken all of the classes that I want, instead of getting a new internship. How will this look to employers, not having an internship the most common time for most people in CS? I am also leaning to this because I have not taken an algo/data structures class yet (just briefly gone over all of them in our intro to CS clases), which would mean I will probably not get passed a technical interview anyway. What do you guys think? Any other advice, maybe from someone whose been in a similar situation? Thank you very much!"
6qewls,23,2017-07-29,Some Tips and Suggestions to the New Anteaters,dangimdz,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/6qewls/some_tips_and_suggestions_to_the_new_anteaters/,"I graduated this past year as a computer engineering major and I thought it'd be good to leave some tips that helped me get through my four years at UCI. 

* **When you get the syllabus, put all the assignment due dates and test dates into your calendar or planner.** This way you won't be surprised when you find out your paper is due in a day. You can plan when to start studying or see if any assignment due dates or test dates overlap.

* **Don't procrastinate!** I'm sure you're tired of hearing this, but seriously... would you rather pull an all-nighter for that paper or write a couple paragraphs/pages every day and be done earlier? Who knows? You might have another assignment due or test on the same date. You'll wish you started earlier and wish you didn't have that much stress on your shoulders.

* **Use your resources!** There are office hours with your professor or teaching assistants. They are people and they have been in your shoes before, so don't be afraid to communicate with them. Most are incredibly nice, helpful, and fun to talk to. There are also LARC tutors or tutoring sessions hosted by the department. Go to them if you're struggling. Hell, you have classmates around you to study with or bounce ideas off of! Talk to them, make friends, and  study together. 

 *One little hack that I had success doing a few times was looking for previous courses' test material to study, either from the class websites (if they weren't blocked) or from someone who has taken the course already.* 

* **Don't have a bad GPA.** Having a high GPA isn't as important as it was in high school unless you want to go to graduate school. Otherwise, maintain a decent GPA and you'll be good. Just don't have a bad GPA and get put into academic probation or even worse, get kicked out of UCI. 

* **Plan your schedule** Some courses are only offered in specific quarters of the year. It's good to know when they will be available and plan to take them when you can because you don't want to be set back a whole year from one course. Also, know your prerequisites and make sure you have everything you need to keep moving forward. Now obviously, you're not planning it down to the tee, but having an understanding will prevent any surprises screwing you over. 

* **You're in college, enjoy yourself and have fun!** Each individual find enjoyment in different things and more often then not, there are others who enjoy the same things. So go out and meet people, make friends, join a club, join Greek life. Do what interests you, but it also helps to have an open mind to try new things and have new experiences. College is probably the biggest opportunity to meet people. 

* **It's never too early to have a job.** Sure you might miss out on some hang outs, but building your resume is definitely a good thing! And having the pocket money to use whenever you want doesn't hurt. 

* **Do something productive in the summer!** You get 3 months off...take advantage of all that time! Get a job or internship. Take summer school courses to get ahead of schedule. Or travel with your friends and explore everything this world has to offer.

* **Lastly, go to the ARC.** The ARC is just one example of something that is paid for in your tuition, so go use it! Take a class, start weightlifting, or just maintain your health. But if you're already paying for it, might as well use it right?

* **Make some friends who have cars** If you don't have a car, this is key. The reason I added this is because a lot of the best food and hang out spots aren't within walking distance from campus. With a car, you can get to the rest of Orange County, where all the good stuff is. Now, don't freeload rides off of them. Offer to pay for a meal or chip in for gas when you can and show that you appreciate them driving you around. 

* **Take care of yourself** This includes your personal hygiene...shower and deodorant ffs. Take care of your mental health. If you're feeling down, talk to someone. You're not alone in this world. Don't forget about your physical health. Eat some vegetables and fruits. Exercise, it doesn't have to be anything crazy, but get your heart moving when you can. And take care of your liver. It's important to have fun, but it's also important to know when to stop! 

With all that said, I hope at least one piece of advise was helpful. I wish you well in your future at UCI! Cheers!

Edit: Added a few more tips that popped in my head."

6qfjmo,0,2017-07-30,Interested in starting the workshop: looking for engineers with industrial experience,eemamedo,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/6qfjmo/interested_in_starting_the_workshop_looking_for/,"Hello guys,

The first time I posted I got downvoted but I didn't explain what I was looking for and my post looked like a clickbait. Here are the details.

My idea is to start the workshop at the university. The workshop will prepare the students who are about to graduate or future interns who are about to start their first internship (co-op) for the industry.

My motivation to do so came from the personal experience. I graduated with good grades (Magna Cum Laude) but I was not adequately prepared for the industry. As I was working in the large companies, I had access to the training and therefore, I gathered enough material. Combining that training material with my experience, I was able to prepare course material that included what was relevant and omitted unnecessary information. I used that material and did a course at the local non-profit organization in my country. I had many requests for the second semester (1 semester is 12 weeks with 2-2.5 hours class once a week) but unfortunately, I could not do it as my job moved me to Italy and then, Singapore. 

What I am looking for: I am looking for graduate students in engineering who have industrial experience and can spend some time working. As I have experience with power engineering systems, I am looking for MechE, Civils, Chemicals and other disciplines. Ideally, you have had trainings and have materials that you can use to teach. The longer you have worked in the industry, the better. 

What is it in for you? Well, having that experience on your CV will increase your chances to get a full-time opportunity. Since you explain and teach the material to the group of students, any employer will assume that you understand the material and therefore, you will be able to jump in any project without extensive training.

What is it in for students? They will gain not just theoretical knowledge (University of Waterloo takes care of that) but practical knowledge as well. I also plan to teach industrial software (in my industry it is ETAP, SKM Power Tools). 

Is there any alternative or why would students want to take this course instead of others: As always, it comes down to the price. Those kinds of training are very expensive and they are not widespread (usually 1 or 2 companies take care of the trainings and they send their engineers to the clients). "

I disliked both my internships and now I feel like I wasted any opportunities to explore other companies.

First internship was at Qualcomm. I didn't really like it. They had good pay, nice benefits, and all that. But my entire team was at least 45, I'm not super excited about what they do, and people didn't seem passionate about their work. They care about their families, children, etc. and I'm 22, so those aren't priorities in my life right now.

Second internship was SpaceX. I thought I was going to love it but I don't think it's for me. I feel like there is so much pressure and stress, and a slight feeling of ""We're the best and brightest so this work is to be expected."" People on all the teams I've been on say this job is significantly tougher than their previous work at NASA, Big 4, etc. which might have been words of motivation but I find discouraging. I like to do cool things and not burnout in the process.

I'd like to hear about CS and Aerospace companies that are less demanding than SpaceX, do interesting things, and have fun cultures. What does it mean to have a good worklife balance? What are good benefits? Do you work for the entirety of your 8 hour days or are chunks of that devoted to ""goofing off""? Do most people care about their product or are they just at the company for a job?"

I'm struggling with the biggest decision of my life so far.

I've been interning with the national lab for the last 2 years. I have a chance to return back to lab, after 8 months of virtual work back at my home institution to finish and defend my phd thesis, and interview for a postdoc position. Something I've wanted for a long time.

Now I also have an offer for a senior analyst position at a very prestigious company. The compensation between the analyst position and potential postdoc is relatively the same.

After defending my thesis, I'm quickly becoming aware that my family has been struggling for a while now. I guess they didn't want me too concerned and add more stress to my already stressful phd experience. We are struggling very badly and the family needs all the help it can get. More importantly, the kids need a lot of support as it's affecting their schoolings and social life.

Here's the thing: the postdoc is very far away. The job is only 2 hours away. Do I decide to move away and go back to the internship so I can apply and interview for the postdoc or do I just accept the offer from the company and remain close to my family so I can help out?

**Some background info:**

I graduated last year from a relatively mid level university in the UK with a 2:1 grade, I was content with my grade considering the effort I put into the course. Initially I felt a bit burnt out and pushed away from computer science as a career, this was due to me not feeling like I'd learnt much or finding an area of computer science that I wanted to focus on. 

Since then I've been on a 4 month internship in Prague where I joined a digital marketing company and mainly worked on solo JavaScript projects and client websites, the experience felt worthwhile as a whole however since I had no co workers working on anything remotely similar to what I was doing I still felt like I wasn't learning much and just working independently. 

Since the internship I've been back in the UK for a couple of months just working at my bar job that I had while I was at University purely for money and while I try to figure out what I want to do. 

I've applied to a few different jobs related to Java and web development, but only had a couple of callbacks from consultancy firms which after a bit of research I don't think are for me just yet. In my spare time I've been going through some online courses for Java programming just to make sure I understand the fundamentals and to identify any weak areas, doing this has made me feel a little more confident.

My main issues are that I lack portfolio work that I'm proud of, out of all my University projects there's only maybe 1 or 2 I'd just barely feel proud enough to show. I haven't made any projects in my spare time and have no idea where to start but I'd definitely like to do more of this.

Another concern is not knowing which area of computer science I want to focus on. While I've focused more on Java and Web Dev recently, I feel like the reasoning behind this is that I found it easier than the other areas my course touched upon. So I'd be willing to look into careers that involve other languages and types of development.

I've been looking at entry level jobs which often ask for 1-2 years of experience along with more expertise in their respective fields than I feel like I have so I feel a bit dissuaded from applying to them.


Just after any advice for these concerns, thanks.

They will allow me to continue working part time as an intern during my last year in college ONLY if I accept a full time offer with them for when I graduate.

He replied and said that he added my info to their system and recommended that I ""email him when [I] apply so [he] can make sure [my] application is reviewed"".

I wasn't expecting a job offer or anything but his reply seems like a polite rejection. I'm not sure what to make of this. Is this typical practice for recruiters? In any case, what should I do to make the most out of this situation?

Also, on a different note, which companies won't throw my application in the trash when they see that I'm a freshman applying for a summer SWE internship? "
6qk6jf,1,2017-07-30,Advice on Fall Internship,Gilkanese,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6qk6jf/advice_on_fall_internship/,"Hello all, I'm a student going into my Sophomore year of college. I've been working a QA Internship this summer, and they were happy enough with my performance to offer me a part-time position for during the school year. I really need advice on whether this is worth doing, though. 

The hours would be fairly inflexible, they're open only ten hours a day M-F and they'd require me to work 20 hours a week. It was impossible for me to get any free days in my class schedule, so I'd have work and school every day. I also don't really need the money, I have enough saved to cover the rest of my education without loans.

On the other hand, I'm terrified of being unable to get an internship next summer, but I'm not sure how true that fear is. While I have enough money for school, I'd have to live an incredibly meager lifestyle if I got no more internships, and this subreddit has me scared about my prospects if I don't graduate with good experience.

I'd appreciate any advice either way, thank you."

6qkwnz,1,2017-07-30,I need to Vent about my life,Epic_Blake17,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/6qkwnz/i_need_to_vent_about_my_life/,"I've been having an issue for over few months now and I've hit my breaking point. I can't talk to anyone about this, so why not rant about it on Reddit. Maybe some feedback from outside of my circle would help.

I've been in a relationship for well over a year and I'm deeply in love with my girlfriend. I never been so happy before in my life. However, for the past few months the only one not happy with my relationship is my mother. I love my mother too and we have a fairly good relationship, but everyone must leave their home eventually. Back in February I moved out of her house and into my dad's  (My parents are divorced btw) because she has been belittling me about how much time I spent away from home.

She never considered that 1: I hate her boyfriend. Seemingly over night he moved into our house, which barley fit 4 adults anyways, and lets her drunk almost every weekend. They have come back home drunk at 2am and have loud sex. This has caused some sleepless nights where I'm up at 5:30 on a Sunday morning. So staying at my girlfriend's house has become a second home.
2: I'm heavily involved in my college's radio station. I was station manager, paid postion, own small office, nightshow, and had to drive over an hour to commute to school. I spent 2 hours a day driving to and from school. So I spent long days at school where I would leave at 7:30 and not return home until 6 or later. Sometimes when I got done super earlier I would hang out with my girlfriend. No one was home so I figured why not
3: I would do all the chores. Ik this may sound petty but let me explain. I would get home and spend 2-3 hours doing dishes, stacking firewood, keeping a fire going, as that is our main source of heat, clean the cat box, clean the dishes after dinner, and vacuum the whole house. By the end of it I was beat. I would spend the rest of my evening on the phone with my girlfriend if she was not working.
4: My girlfriend actually cared about my feelings and took my mental health seriously.

So after all of this I decided enough was enough and left. I moved in with my dad ans everything ran smooth. My dad didn't mind my GF, I did the right amount of chores, shorter commute to school, and spent more time with my dad and family in my dad's side. This seemed to be going good.

Now in July (Almost August), my mom is trying to get rid of my gf because ""I never see her anymore"" and I ""Choose some girl over her everytime""

I've had a busy summer between work, my internship, parties for family, preparing to transfer to my new 4 year school, and trying seeing my gf and family. It has not worked out the way it has that is all I can say. I have spent many sleepless nights deciding who to see and which events to attend and when I can see my gf again. It hasn't been as fun of a summer as I planned it. 

Now my mom is trying to convince family members that my gf is a bad influence on me and that she is trying to drive a wedge between my family and I. I never intended for this to happen. There was some cases where I should of gone to see family, I will admit that. But there where some cases where I would of have rather stayed home then be with anyone because all I seem to do is upset my mother, no matter who I hang out with.

I wish there was a happy medium but the ways things have been going there isn't. I love my gf with all my heart, I believe she is the one. My gf has grow to resent my mom and sees the toxin my mom spews. This has caused some awkward family events. 

I feel trapped in the middle and today,  I just lost it. I went to visit my mother after spend the day with my gf. My mom sat me down and told me how much of a wedge my gf is driving between me and my family. My mom has been known to lie and manipulate people before. But that did not matter. I spent my hour drive home crying and upset. I've hit the wall and I feel broke. I'm hoping I'm not over reacting, that's why I spilled my guts in hopes that someone can point something out that I may have over looked.  I'm planning on getting extra help but until then, I needed to vent."

I came into school as a business major and haven't been getting as much out of the business courses than I would've hoped for. I've always had a passion for programming and computers but was always so focused on my current studies to think about other options in college. After doing some research and meeting with an advisor, I learned about this possibility of double majoring in CS/BA. This is a really exciting prospect for me but there's a couple of concerns/questions that have risen because of it.

1. In order to graduate with the degree I'll have to take two summer courses in 2018, and take an extra semester in the Fall of 2019.

2. My biggest concern isn't the extra money that'll have to get spent, I'm more concerned over how big of an issue it'll be over not having a summer internship this upcoming summer. I've heard that it's crucial to have one, but taking these summer courses will prohibit me from doing so. 

Main question is: How big of a detriment would it be towards my career to not have a summer internship next summer? Is there anything else I can do to boost my resume prior to next summer?

Tl;dr
I'm changing majors to CS/BA but will have to take two summer courses next summer in order to do so. How detrimental would it be to my career if I don't have a summer internship next summer?

I am a Freshman at MIT who will be studying computer science. 

I know python and have built a handful of larger projects with it and the same for JavaScript, but I know it less well. I also have built a few websites

I also have some work experience in the corporate world. I don't know if this matters.

I was wondering if it is possible for me to get an internship at a tech firm or as a developer, even though I don't have any specialties. 

I will be taking a 2-3  CS classes as a freshman, since I have a bunch of general requirements but only one of these will be in the fall. So I will not gain so many skills before interviews.

What advice would you give me for landing a internship?

I feel like I would do terribly at a technically interview since I don't code on a daily bases.

How would I land and intership at Facebook, Google, etc.?

Thanks.

6qlyt5,3,2017-07-30,Internship Offer Predicament,throwaways07e03,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6qlyt5/internship_offer_predicament/,"So I'm currently interning at company A. This is my first internship with Company A, and my second one overall. The internship before this one was in an industry I thought I'd like but didn't. I really like company A, it has a good culture, but the workforce is abnormally young for the industry since they're trying to help get ready for the upcoming retirement wave. I didn't really get to do the job I was expecting to or planning to (got transferred to a different department when I got there). So what I've been doing this summer is kind of lame, however, I'm pretty tight with the supervisor of the department I'd want to be in. He's basically said that I can work for him if I get an offer to come back.

My term will be over in a few weeks, and with the exit interview process according to another intern, they say whether or not they'd like you to come back, based off of recommendations. With this, I feel like I have a strong chance of getting a return offer to go work for the supervisor I'm close to in the department I want. However according to an intern I know, they basically give you a very short time period to accept the offer. I think the intern said it was something like a week or two (they want to try to lock you down, obviously). 

My career fair wouldn't be for another 3 weeks after my end-date, and interviews with other companies after that. I really like company A, but with the work I've done, I really feel as if I have a strong chance to work for some of the industry's titans (several companies in the Fortune 50 or Fortune 25). Company A does pay quite competitively, but I feel opportunities for advancement are somewhat limited since they run very lean. This is on top of the fact that they're hiring a lot of new graduates, and this would make pushing ahead of the pack for promotions very competitive. The ""industry titans"" probably would pay about 15-20% more on base salary and would be an easier name to shop around or rise in the ranks. Honestly given the chance, I'd really like to work for some of these companies. They're all in the exact same industry pretty much.

If you haven't figured it out, basically I'm trying to figure out what I should do. The way I see it I have 2 options:

* **Option 1:** Accept the likely offer to come back next summer for company A. This would mean that I don't have to do any recruiting work this fall, and honestly with 2 internships under my belt would most likely mean a full time offer when I graduate next year. 

* **Option 2:** Try to ask for more time to consider Company A's offer. This is pretty much an unveiled attempt at me saying ""I want to look at other companies"". I don't really know how to ask for this, and I'm kind of scared of just having the offer get pulled and I'd be without a safety net. 

Pretty much I feel like if I don't take an opportunity to get my foot in the door with an internship, it'll be hard to get into one of the Fortune 25 companies later than if I were to stay where I am.  But I'm afraid of leaping without a safety net (the standing offer from company A). 

Last little thoughts, I also kind of wanted to try out a third industry. I really, really like what I'm doing right now (the second industry I've had an internship in), but I did also kind of want the chance to try out another one (semiconductors) with companies like NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, TI, or a few others. 

TLDR: Expecting a return offer from Company A with a short acceptance period. I feel like I'd be a strong candidate for bigger and better-paying companies based off of my work with Company A, and I want to try to work for one of them, while not burning this bridge. Also, I might want to try out another industry (industry B), and either I find that I really like the work, or I find I really like what I'm already doing more instead.

We've 1300 data points for property ""success"" that we're trying to model with a mix of variables and random forest methodology. When we use 90% of the data to train and 10% to validate the model, the best we can do is an Rsquare of .7 with 30 variables, but if I use the whole data set in building the model I can get an RSquare of .97 using only 10 variables. 

My intuition as an amateur is that it's difficult to overfit a model this size when there is only 10 input variables, but there might be something about the random forest methodology that has a tendency to overfitt more than methodology I'm familiar with. 

Our desired output is to have a bellwether for where we should invest future development efforts--we don't need an exact answer.

What would the concerns and risks be with choosing to use the 10 variable model over the 30? Would it be reasonable to average the outputs between the two?"

28, have an IT degree and created my own (game centric) software company where I had some fun doing management and some coding for 3 years. However, personal and financial issues with partners led to me go job hunting last year. I travelled around Europe looking for jobs (haven't had much luck in my own country even after one year of more or less actively looking). Spent 3 months at one company, 6 months at another and I'm doing remote work now.


I've found that each time I start a new job I get less and less motivated from the onset. I am perfectly aware I'm technically not settling for less every time I jump ship (more pay, projects closer to what I would prefer working on), but there's a huge wave of cynicism that constantly washes over me and I find it harder and harder to do my job. I never found hard programming questions interesting and hated programming contests. I was always more of an engineer, I always enjoyed carefully placing parts in optimal ways rather than complex mathematical calculations and optimizing something to run in .8 seconds rather than .85 for purely academical reasons. I'm the type of guy that thinks making things feel fast is better than actually making them run faster (I hope you understand that this doesn't mean I'll put ""spinners"" on a modal window rather than fix a bunch of O( n^n ) loops).


**The problem**

Nowadays, my mind is constantly wondering and I'm constantly trying to force myself to get things done to no avail. I've tried everything: rest, coffee, taking walks, short breaks, long breaks, working abroad, moving back with my partner. Nothing seems to work. I sort of enjoy programming and the occasional new challenge interests me (mostly from the integration and UX perspective) but it's like my passion for coding is nearly completely dead now. In my last few jobs I kept noticing I was the only person enjoying long meetings and I gladly took up tasks like writing documentation or even kitchen work that would give me some reprieve from the torture that programming was turning out to be. 


Honestly, it's driving me nuts. I've applied for internships for things more along the lines of production, management or software design but I constantly get turned down for lack of experience. My parents say I shouldn't expect to get ""promoted into management"" before putting in a few years at a company but constantly seeing younger people with less experience get the jobs I'm aiming for isn't helping.

I'm mostly wondering if someone's been in a similar situation or has some insight on what course of action I should take. My deteriorating mental health isn't making me any wiser.

I have 2 months really until I will probably start applying and want to make my CV as good as possible so am thinking about learning a new language and doing a little project in that time. However, I am not very creative and have no idea what to do. If anyone has any tips on what kinds of languages/projects would be most appealing or anything else for that matter it would be greatly appreciated thanks!"

Yeah, right!",PL_buildapc,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6qpldt/workplace_wants_me_to_install_a_watercooled/,"So we're getting a new intern, and he is getting a top-o'-the-line machine for our architectural office. It's an HP Z240 with a Xeon E3-1240 v5 (3.50 GHz), 32 GB RAM, and an installed Nvidia Quadro K620.

However, bosses have big things planned for this intern (while the rest of us are lugging around 5+year-old workstations), so they also sent an MSI **Geforce 1070 Sea Hawk EK X** and said ""hey you, install this.""

Now I'm a confident guy who got to where he is by Googling and Redditing things, so *of course* I can install it, but this card is (A) huge, and (B) requires an additional water-cooling system. Also (C) Newegg won't take it back, and (D) this business-class case is *very* small inside and (E) only has one outlet for one exhaust fan. So I'm (F)d. They want me to install it anyway. Uh, sure. 

In any case, I don't want to have to maintain a water-cooling loop every 6 months just for this new guy to be on Reddit all the time like I am. If I can just bodge up some hoses to an external radiator, will that be good enough? Like I care what it looks like, it's the office! I just want the most trouble-free water-cooling system I can get. 

Or, is there a reputable exchange for me to swap this fully-wrapped never-touched waterblock graphics card for an air-cooled Geforce 1070, and I'll just never tell my administrators and they'll never look? 

Any outrageous advice is welcome, there's no time constraint and who knows if this guy will just get fired or whatever anyway, he starts tomorrow and I will do my best to make this *his* problem. I hope he knows how to Google!"

Long story I'll try to shorten as much as possible or make skimmable since the future is really the only important part:

**The Past**: I studied economics with a minor in computer science at a very low tier school with a subpar GPA. The GPA was because I was obsessed with working and extra curriculars and while I wish I had made it higher, my career has seriously worked out and I'm happy to have spent so much time on my internships. 

**The Present**: I work a nice job and am very fairly compensated, but I can see the ceiling approaching without having a graduate degree (I work as a product manager at a bank). I am 25 and would rather get it done now than spend the next 40 years regretting. I enrolled in a small local college at the undergraduate level to take computer science coursework to show that I can score well now. My work experience is very, very impressive for someone of my age and I undoubtedly ran into a large degree of luck. I also run a ""popular"" blog on fintech and am on the advisory board for a NJ based university. 

**The Future**: I'd rather have a technical degree to ""check the box"" of having a masters but with something that will give me general, applicable knowledge (computer science). However, I'd really like to go to a ""name brand"" school for masters to make up for my undergraduate no-name school. Specifically, I'd cut off a foot to go to Cornell Tech. 

My question is, would it make sense to apply to a less popular program, such as ""information engineering"", in order to be less competitive?

Additionally, any advice on how to improve my odds? I will obviously apply elsewhere as well, but I'd like for this to be my stretch school which I have about a year to prepare for."

I'm currently working as an intern at a startup company, where I work on software infrastructure. While the pay is amazing and the culture can't really get any better, I find it hard to focus on the work simply because I'm inherently not interested in it.

Back in HS, I wanted to become a mechanical engineer. I started 3D modeling and programming at a young age in primary school, and made some (shitty) video games as a hobby. 

I joined the robotics team in HS because I wanted to use those skills in a less artistic and more applied field. I learnt a lot of CAD, CAM, CNC, and other hands-on fabrication/mech design skills, but the fact that I had 3 software-related internships in high school convinced me to study CS instead. 

But now that I'm in university and I'm learning about what a lot of 'robotics' type fields ACTUALLY entail, I'm finding out that my CS curriculum isn't necessarily applicable to the things I'm interested in until I start taking 400 level classes. I've been toying with the idea of switching to a major like Applied Math, Physics, or even Electrical Engineering.

For those of you who do work in a career fields like computer graphics, robotics, computer vision, or any other related fields, do you think it's a good idea to make this switch? Or should I just plan on pursuing a masters later on to specialize?"

I'm going to be a senior this fall and applying to colleges. Some of the colleges on my list are: Stanford, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, UMichigan, UT Austin, UIllinois Urbana Champaign, UWashington, etc.

Ever since I was a kid I have always been into technology and computer science. I knew I wanted a job in this area. So I built my passion and interests around it. I've done a couple internships in this field, done community service around this field, published 12 apps on the iOS App Store in 5 years and a bunch of my high school accomplishments are around this field of technology too.

Eventually, during my junior year in high school I took AP Computer Science at my school. I've known Java for the last 3 years of my life. But the teacher turned out to be a jerk (long story) and basically ended up failing me both semesters (D in 1st Semester, F in 2nd Semester). Of course this killed my GPA, but my passion never stopped and I still continue to have more achievements in high school related to technology after these incidents on my transcript. 

Of course, I won't be asking him for a letter of rec anymore. But when I'm applying to colleges now (my list does have a bunch of selective schools), considering my passion in Computer Science, but because of that bad grade on my transcript IN COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT I WANT TO MAJOR IN, would you guys still recommend me to apply as a major in Computer Science or apply undecided to the colleges?

That's what I want to work on for multiple years and study more about"". They've all been exciting for awhile, been cool experiences, and cemented that I want to work in a research field, but have not made me passionate about any of them. 

I've also tried working in different research groups in different fields to see if I developed a passion for something other than astrophysics. Biophysics and bioinformatics have been interesting as well, and it would be cool to work on something that directly helps people, unlike astrophysics that is at best a couple steps away from improving people's lives. But again, nothing that ignites enough passion that its something I want to spend years studying and pushing the boundaries on. 

If I could, I would love to go to a PhD program and just study all of astrophysics, but most seem to want you to start specializing in a subfield pretty quickly, at least if you want to get done in a reasonable amount of time. 

I'm just not sure what to do. I want to do research, I like programming, simulations, data analysis for huge sets of data, but also would like to work with my hands if possible, developing and creating hardware to go along with the software that I write. Galaxy evolution and supernovae, as well as gravitational waves, are all really interesting areas of study, but I'm not sure I would want to focus on just one, I would rather work with all of them. Ideally, I don't want to be in front of a computer all the time just programming either, getting out and about is important for me as well. Any ideas of what to do? "

6qs0f2,10,2017-07-31,I Got This Shipment of Weird Medicine Cabinets (Part 1),TheDiZBiZ,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6qs0f2/i_got_this_shipment_of_weird_medicine_cabinets/,"So I intern at this non-profit organization that gets donations of medical equipment from hospitals and random donors. It’s a big warehouse full of equipment that we test and fix, then package to send them off to third world countries after assessing their needs. I’m a biomed intern so I deal with lots of troubleshooting and broken equipment. 

Today a shipment of 8 McKesson medicine containers came in, basically huge medicine cabinets that are electronically locked. I’ve tested a few of these before and they usually require a User ID and password, and for some reason the hospitals don’t think to give us the info with the cabinets so we can check them out and give them the A-Ok, so I usually just have to make a call and get the credentials. I figured today would be the same. Boy, was I wrong. 

These are usually pretty average weight and don’t take much to move since they’re on wheels, but these must have been packed to the brim with something, because I had to get a few other interns to help move them into my workspace. That was weird to me since they’re usually empty and the only reason we have to open them up is quite frankly, to check if they open. Weird, but I didn’t pay much mind.

I plugged one in to bring up the screen and the monitor flashed a lovely Windows Vista start up screen. Lovely. I check the side and see that a small green tag indicates that it was last serviced back in 2007. Great. It asked me for the usual User ID and password so I got the phone number of the donor from my supervisor and called them up. 

The beginning of the call was pretty standard, the receptionist at the hospital grabbed the doctor that signed the donor form and when I asked for a User ID and password, he got quiet and gave me a phone number. Then asked me to call him at this number, his personal cell, after I hung up. So I did that and he picked up immediately. The difference this time was that he had a shushed voice and seemed to be in a hurry. 

“Why do you need the User ID and password?” he hissed at me. 

“Well sir, I need to open these cabinets up to make sure everything works fine, and if so I just package them and send them off,” I replied. All I heard was his heavy breathing on the other side. “Sir?”

“Look, I don’t know if you’ve noticed but those are really old. At one point when that guy donated them to us, I actually wanted to use these myself around the hospital but never got around to it. But weird stuff happens when you mess with these cabinets,” he says. “They probably don’t even work anymore, can’t you just throw them out?”

I frown. That seemed really off, he didn’t mark down on his donation form that these were donated to him. We have that option there so that we can avoid having to make multiple phone calls to donors. Cuts down on time. He also suggested throwing them out. Why go through the trouble of the donation process if that’s something you wanted to do? Then there was the last part of what he had said that bugged me. 

“What weird stuff?” I inquire. 

There was silence. I considered hanging up at this point but I needed to get the phone number of the previous owner so that I could get some sort of feasible info off of them. So I changed topics and asked for a phone number of the guy that donated to him. 

“I can’t give you a phone number,” he whispered. “But I can give you an address. It’s at [address redacted]. The guy said that if anything happened with the cabinets to visit him and talk to him about it.”

Super weird, I thought. I jotted down the address though and didn’t pay any mind to it though, I just wanted to be done with this task since there’s a shipment going out to Africa later this week and I needed this to be finished so I can do other things. I thanked the doctor and hung up, and that was when it hit me. A sickly aroma that had been wafting around my workspace for the last hour or so. More specifically, around when I wheeled these containers into the room. I had initially thought that it was just the ventilation acting all funny again, it is a warehouse and it is the middle of summer. But the smell grew stronger and stronger as time went on, by the time I finished up the call. An office intern was walking through and I asked him if he smelled that, too. He gave me a weird look and shook his head. 

At this point the smell started giving me a headache, and I was positive it was coming from those cabinets. I was reluctant at first to drive down to this guy’s place to find a User ID and password, but now I was really curious. I stepped outside of my space because the smell was really getting to me. It really confused me as to why no one else smelled it. 

Let me describe it to you. It smelled like someone was spraying a lot of perfume to mask a horrid stench, and as time went on it kept growing stronger. I have a hard time dealing with pungent smells like that so I had to step out. As soon as I did, I heard a loud crashing noise from inside my workspace so I ran back in and saw that one of the cabinets had been rolled quite possibly at full speed towards my workshelf and it absolutely demolished the whole shelf. All my tools, assorted items for equipment testing, all either busted or strewn about. There was a freaked out office intern just standing there holding his head in his hands and I asked him what happened, quite aggressively might I add. It took me a while to organize this workspace to my liking. 

He looked at me and said, “I don’t know! I just barely touched it and it went careening into the wall!” 

He seemed clearly distressed so I just asked him to help me move this container back since they were so heavy. Plus, now that I think about it, he was as scrawny as a twig, there was no way he’d have pushed this hard enough to crash into my stuff. I do believe that at this point, it is pertinent to mention that the sickly smell was also gone. It was as if I had just imagined that earlier. Cleaning up the place took the rest of my shift, which was really annoying since I had planned on using the latter half of my shift to see the previous owner of the containers. 

I signed out of the system and headed to my car when suddenly my phone blared, I was getting a call from the doctor I spoke with earlier today. I picked up the phone, kind of odd that he’d call me, but perhaps he had some follow-up info about the containers or some master key he wanted to drop off tomorrow. I was still very much weirded out by everything that happened, but I’m not a very big believer of the supernatural so I just put the weird occurrences at the back of my mind so that I could focus on the task at hand. 

So when he started blabbering after I answered his call I was really confused. 

“Sir, can you slow down? I can’t understand you.”

“The smell, the smell is back!” he yelled frantically. 

Almost on cue, my nose picked up the same sickly smell from earlier. I started getting really weirded out at this point, and my headache returned with the doctor on the phone yelling and the smell penetrating my senses. 

Before I could say anything, I heard a loud crash from inside the warehouse and screaming. I hang up the phone and run back inside to see that the lift we use to transfer equipment from the dock to the upstairs area to prepare for shipping had broken and fell cleanly in half, and the same office intern that helped me clean up my workspace was pinned under the broken lift and the equipment he was transferring to the second floor. There was a sickly spray of blood on the wall from where his lower half instantly got crushed, and he was continually bleeding out profusely. 

My supervisor was on the phone with 911 and the other interns were frantically trying to free him from under the lift and the equipment that had him pinned down. I was in shock, so I just stood there kind of uselessly as I watched the life drain out of this kid, no older than me. After a few minutes I ran up to the kid and attempted to help move stuff and unpin him, but to no avail. By the time the ambulance and rescue workers came, he was already dead. 

I was asked to stay behind as were all the interns so that the police could take our statements. Afterwards I just sort of sat in my car for a bit before I headed home. First thing I did was hop on this subreddit and type all this out because I figured maybe someone would be able to help me figure out what happened. I don’t really believe in anything supernatural but today changed that, what with the two freak accidents and the weird containers. The sickly smell that came and went and the doctor that mentioned weird happenings, it’s all starting to change my beliefs on this. I can’t believe either of these freak accidents are just that, since I know for a fact that the container couldn’t just roll away at a single touch, and the lift was inspected on Friday last week with the technician giving it the all clear. 

I’m at a complete loss, guys. I called the doctor back but it said the number was out of service, which was really weird. All I have left is to visit this address that I was given, which I’ll do tomorrow. So for now, I guess I have to turn to you guys. Any idea what’s going on? 

I'll update you guys tomorrow on what happened at the previous owner's place."

How can I best prepare for this kid to not waste our time?

Hi there, 

I'm currently a Data Analyst at a startup and I've got a college Senior looking to do ML at my company. He's only got 6 weeks with us and I want to give him an ML project that could at least validate whether we continue investing in ML after he is gone. 

My experience: I know the basics. I've completed the Coursera's ML course and I'm brushing up on my stats and python before getting more in depth with algorithms.

His experience: Python + stats. No ML.

I'm worried that it'll be the blind leading the blind, but I figure it could be good experience in directing an ML project and at least teach him about some of the basics to start his portfolio. I'm hoping I could point him in the right direction and he can at least get something started:

1. Crash course into ML 
 - Review logistic regression and recommender systems.
 - Get comfortable with scikit + other libraries.
2. Review feature set and algorithms to test
 - Start drafting the necessary feature set to look at 
 - Review the algorithms we'd like to test and get started asap
3. Building up the algorithms 
 - Leave time for the actual engineering and proper testing in between.
4. Analyze and tweak algorithms
 - Review the results of the algorithm and where they'll fit. 
5. Leave time for more analysis OR work on k-means implementation of the algorithm.  

Is this a good plan? How can I improve it?"
6qsac9,5,2017-07-31,Just came back from a job interview-how I survived it having SA :0,fadingaway321,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/6qsac9/just_came_back_from_a_job_interviewhow_i_survived/,"Hey to all my fellow online friends living with SA. I decided to make this little post about a job interview I had today, and how I got through it as someone who lives with SA! To be clear, this interview was for an internship at a big bank in Manhattan. I'm a college student, attending a big university in NYC (which has undoubtedly intensified my SA these past 2 years).

 I started off the day feeling confident, going over my answers to questions the guy would probably ask, even practicing facial expressions and body language; It is practically impossible for me to have an easy flowing, smooth conversation with someone unless they are a really good friend (which I have only a few of!) so I tend to over-think my speech pacing and basically every little detail that goes into having a conversation with a stranger. I felt pretty good up until I got off the train, the time for the interview slowly approaching like a ticking time bomb. 

My confidence began to melt from me like a popsicle in summer heat, drip by drip. I desperately wanted to make it to the interview with at least a little left intact. I started worrying about my appearance, about the kind of vibes I would give off, if they would be able to see that I was ""awkward."" 

I got to the bank, checked in at the front desk-speaking to the receptionist in a rather shaky voice and proceeded to the marble hallway of elevators. My own personal one came for me and took me straight to my floor. I was trying to focus less on my pounding heart and more so on reminding myself to smile and wipe that resting bitch face off that often resulted from insecurity as opposed to boredom. 

I told the young girl in the office my name and she let me know she'd call my interviewer up in around 10 minutes since I was early. We exchanged smiles and I sat down, silencing my phone and shoving it in my briefcase, focusing instead on the CNBC channel playing on the small tv and on my favorite John Mayer song-comforting things. 

A terribly unfortunate symptom of my SA is the overproduction of saliva in my mouth, and the need to swallow when I get overwhelmed from my own thoughts. I think about it and mentally punish myself for it which only makes it worse. I could tell my face was tinged with blush and my heart was still beating when a young woman around my age came to get me. 

A friendly face, the young woman guided me to my interviewer's office and I couldn't help but feel as if I were being led into a lion's den. He stood up and we shook hands-I remembered to smile, look friendly. He shut the door and we sat down. He asked for a resume which I thankfully had with me. He was young and informed me had just moved into this office, apologizing for the lack of AC or decor. Appearing to be reading the piece of paper for the first time he asked me about my current internship.

My throat had partially closed up but I fought through and began to speed through my somewhat rehearsed answer, aware that I was speaking fast and silently hating the fact that he was so calm and collected. Having him stare right into my eyes as I spoke only intensified the situation but I was able to say most of what I had to say before pausing-to swallow saliva. I laughed nervously and he laughed as well, probably to show me that he was aware that I was nervous and that it was okay. 

I felt relief when it was his turn to talk. It was hard to swallow since he maintained pretty consistent eye contact. Every now and then he would glance to his computer screen and I would take the opportunity to gulp as quietly as possible. I nodded and consciously struggled to maintain a relaxed face but could feel the muscles were tight and strained-uncomfortable. 

He was kind, and informative and we maintained a good dialogue. He told me the pay structure, asked my availability, and even told me I was at the ""forefront"" of people he has already interviewed and will be interviewing. He did however tell me it was a competitive position and that if I didn't get chosen they would still be able to provide me with professional contacts. I didn't feel too good about these comments, but tried to remain positive. 

He gave me an exact date of when I could expect to hear from him. Overall, he laughed and smiled often throughout the interview and seemed to really be listening to me. He didn't seem distracted or disinterested at all and even got off topic a few times, discussing private matters and even politics. 

We shook hands and he smiled again. Living with SA, I obviously felt I could have said a lot more and chastised myself internally for it. I don't know what to expect or make of this interview but I know that even if I didn't perform my best, I went out there and tried and that's enough for me. 

So to conclude, living with SA- I understand...the interview process completely sucks! You're trapped in a small room with a stranger who will be staring at you the whole time-Enough to make you want to jump in a black hole huh? But the most important thing to remember in these situations is that you have to maintain control, do your best to mask how you feel and try to present a caricature of yourself-one that is professional and confident and easy-going. You simply can't turn beet red and shake like a leaf even when the temptation to do so is intense. Remember that it's only for a little while, and that if you get through it there are potentially amazing opportunities that await you! 

I hope my little story helped some of you out there and can help give you the courage to go out there and fight for something you want! You will want to be anywhere else while it's happening, but at the end you'll be proud of yourself for trying."
6qshh7,5,2017-07-31,How damaging would it be to my future by not having a summer internship after my junior year?,Mofongo96,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6qshh7/how_damaging_would_it_be_to_my_future_by_not/,"I am a rising junior currently majoring in business at the University of Southern California. I came into school as a business major and haven't been getting as much out of the business courses than I would've hoped for. I've always had a passion for programming and computers but was always so focused on my current studies to think about other options in college. After doing some research and meeting with an advisor, I learned about this possibility of double majoring in CS/BA. This is a really exciting prospect for me but there's a couple of concerns/questions that have risen because of it.

1. In order to graduate with the degree I'll have to take two summer courses in 2018, and take an extra semester in the Fall of 2019.
2. My biggest concern isn't the extra money that'll have to get spent, I'm more concerned over how big of an issue it'll be over not having a summer internship this upcoming summer. I've heard that it's crucial to have one, but taking these summer courses will prohibit me from doing so.

Main question is: How big of a detriment would it be towards my career to not have a summer internship next summer? Is there anything else I can do to boost my resume prior to next summer?

**Tl;dr:** I'm changing majors to CS/BA but will have to take two summer courses next summer in order to do so. How detrimental would it be to my career if I don't have a summer internship next summer?

Any other feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks so much!"

My academic performance wasn’t outstanding, but not abysmal at the same time. Since I decided that I wanted to go into finance at the end of my junior year I was too late to get a summer internship. Then during senior year of classes I was swamped with all my finance specific courses leaving me without enough time for a job or internship on the side. I wish I would have tried anyways because now I virtually have 0 experience. I have some hands on organizational finance experience but it seems like companies are looking more for internship experience. 

The only employers that seem to want to take me in are ones that are heavily based on sales containing a 100% commission. Since I have loans to pay down I would not be comfortable with taking up a position that is that heavily based on commission. A lot of positions I have applied to have been financial analyst positions but I am starting to give that up that since the competition seems to be off the charts. I have also applied to many other positions different from financial analyst but still haven’t seen much success. I heard many people suggest that I become a teller and try to work my way up in the banking system. I get the feeling that a teller position might be undercutting my degree, and I have no idea how long it would take to get promoted. 

To other finance majors, what exactly did you do with your degrees especially those without experience? Am I doomed with an average GPA and almost 0 experience?
