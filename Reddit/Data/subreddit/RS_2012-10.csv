Every internship position that I've seen is for summer of 2013. I want it right NAO. I'd like to go have a career in CS field eventually. However, I don't have much hands on experience that employers look for. I don't even have degree in CS, although I've had programming classes and what not. As of now, I'm learning programming languages by myself but that won't matter when employers look at my degree/experience. Halp."

I'm an American who graduated in June after studying Computer Science and Business, and a six-month study abroad in Germany. I have internship experience in software development (consisting of programming, testing, and technical writing) and know my way around Java and Javascript, and am familiar with C and C#. I'm trying to teach myself SQL, Python, and web design. Other job experiences have included leading social justice groups, managing support crews for large tennis tournaments, and working with audio/video equipment.

I'm looking for full time work or internships in quality assurance, business analytics/intelligence, software development, technical consulting, social media, or technical writing though I'm always open to challenging myself and learning something new. I'm currently located in Berlin, Germany, though I'm willing to travel and/or relocate, or work remotely.

Here's my background:  graduated with an A.A.S. in Computer Information Systems in Networking/Server 2003 back in December 2007.  I applied to multiple companies back then, but this was when the economy tanked.  I am about 2 classes away from having a second degree in Database Admin.  I have never had an IT job, though I had about 1 month of internship at a library which I worked at for 3 years.  I have been an EMT for the last 1.5 years.  Unfortunately, I am 30 years old, and quite frankly, being an EMT isn't exactly a career.  What are the chances of me landing a job, and if so, what kind of job could I get?  Thanks."

I hear engineering majors, finance majors, liberal arts majors and others frequently discussing how hard it is to find a job in the current market.

It could just be my area (midwest), but myself and 5/6 of my close friends had full time jobs before we graduated.  The other guy found a job in 3 weeks.  Only one of us had prior contact with the company and that was through an internship, so this wasn't a situation where friends or parents got us jobs.  Looking on facebook it doesn't really look like our classmates have had much trouble either.

Was my group of friends really lucky, or have you guys seen a similar trend?"

Companies don't seem to be too interested in engineers (which I'm not) and IT professionals (which I'm not). I have a degree in business administration, but my concentration is soft of a halfway house between computer science and IT (as in, I can do both, but nothing too in-depth with either). My skills are best suited to an analyst role and/or consulting role but nobody is looking for anyone in that field apparently. I've tried everything I can think of to break through- applying as a CS guy, an IT professional, an intern, an analyst... nothing. I've been networking as best as I can within my means, yet nothing has turned up. I've tried going through many recruiters. I've tried cold-calling but was rewarded with a cold trail. To date since graduation I've applied for nearly 150 positions and I've had a grand total of 6 interviews- none of which went anywhere. More often than not I'll get a dreaded ""we appreciate you applying but we picked someone we like better"" email (and during from one of the interviews I confirmed that the company had not in fact found anyone for the position and it is still open to this day), or I just never hear from someone again.

I didn't get any internships or things like that in college because I wanted to ""get in and out"" ASAP to hit the workforce and nobody told me that was a bad idea. My grades weren't stellar, but then again nobody ever even asks because apparently I don't even make it pass the screening phase most of the time (I've never even had someone bring up my GPA during an interview). My resume is fine. My interview skills are amazing, according to my university's career center, my peers, and the recruiters that I have worked with to get feedback about my appearance and whatnot. My peers, past supervisors, and professors all say that I am a good candidate. While being interviewed I don't notice any signs of dislike or anything like that from the interviewers. I follow up with everyone I talk to as soon as possible. When I'm turned down I ask for feedback (haven't gotten any yet). I honestly have no idea where I'm making mistakes and I am now severely regretting going to college, but I'm too proud/confident/arrogant to just give up and settle for a job I didn't even need to college for as I currently have.

Is the lack of relevant experience from college what's preventing me from getting even an entry-level job (which I was pretty sure the whole ""entry level"" bit meant that my schooling should have been enough)? Is it the college I went to? My degree choice? Am I ugly? Is it race/height/weight/financial or marital status/gender/place of origin? Is it because I don't have a 4.0 GPA to boast about? Was everyone I prepared for this day with just lying to me about how well I interview and sell myself? Am I unable to network efficiently? Was I simply born at the wrong place at the wrong time to the wrong family? How do I find out why I'm being pushed aside so I can fix it? I know it's not good to appear as desperate but I'm beginning to fear that my frustration and desperation may begin to effect my performance- this is the only thing that has managed to stress me out to this point in my life!

**Tl;dr- What am I doing wrong and how do I fix it? Am I just doomed?**

**UPDATE**
So what I'm seeing from the responses is that some didn't really read much (including the Tl;dr); the people I used to evaluate my resume building and interview skills probably lied to me; and that I'm just unlucky. Where do I go from here?"
10vc7k,1,2012-10-03,"A student on their way to an InfoSys degree suddenly considers switching to CompSci, and wants your thoughts.",Gaisoujou,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/10vc7k/a_student_on_their_way_to_an_infosys_degree/,"Long story incoming. Beware.

So I'm a 23 year old student currently getting ready to transfer from my community college to a particular 4 year university by fall of next year. I'm currently going to school part time for Business Administration, and when I transfer, I'll be able to use these credits to enter the school's Information Systems program. I plan on taking classes at the university full time, so ideally, I should be able to recieve my bachelors in 2 years. At the CC, I've mostly taken the gen ed courses, along with some business/economics courses. I still have to take precalc/applied calculus, a couple sciences, and a literature and history course before I have my credit requirement for the Business Administration Associates. I'm currently in the precalc, Biology, and literature, and I think I'll take physics as my other science course.

My dilemma is that from a lot of recent research and reading that I've done, an Information Systems degree may not exactly be the best of options. Mixing business and technology courses is certainly an interesting path, and I can see how it could prove useful in the field, but I've seen many claim that such a degree really just takes a little bit of many different subjects, and doesn't delve deep enough into anything to really get much experience from it.

I'm considering changing degree paths to Computer Science. I'm aware that this degree is generally said to be more rigorous, and possibly more theoretical. I also know that most 4 year schools (including the one that I'm most interested in) treats Computer Science as a part of their engineering program, so this path would require a lot more for science and math along with going more in depth with languages. (In comparision, the IS degree at the school has you taking only 2-3 programming classes, along with other business classes, database management, etc.) But in exchange, it's generally seen as a more preferable degree for someone that's interested in programming, and would probably lead to a wider variety of oppertunities.

The big issue is that while this path seems to be the tougher, but more rewarding path, it would also require me to almost start from scratch. Being a part of a different school in the university, and just being a different degree in general, I wouldn't be able to transfer a good deal of my credits (only a couple maths, my english courses, my bio course and possibly another science if I choose one that both degrees qualify for, such as chem/phys 101). This means that I would have to stay in school an extra semester or so to catch up. I'm also somewhat worried about the different classes, and being able to stick with the new, harder, workload.

I find the development field to be fascinating, and I would like to learn more. I've done a lot of reading up on the field and different aspects of it, and I've also started doing some self studying/practicing to try to get a feel for the basics and see if this is something that's worth pursuing. Unfortunetly, it's been difficult to get some of this self study time in between my current classes and working, but I'd like to do a lot more before the year is out. I know that its far from impossible to get a job in this field with an IS degree, but it can be harder to get initial interviews and to prove ones competence to a potential employer. I would have to make significant strides in my self studies to be able to feel more confident in my skills and be able to compete against other applicants.

Considering the different pros and cons of each path, what do you guys think would be the decision to look at? Are there any aspects to the situation that I appear to be missing/misunderstanding? I know that no matter how I decide to approach things, getting experience is vital for this field, so that's another goal that I need to try to do. It would be excellent to eventually start putting my own little (naive?) ideas of programs to action, and possibly join up in an open source project. Getting an internship in my area would be even better!

**TL;DR, A student well on their way to an InfoSys degree suddenly considers switching to CompSci, and would like opinions and thoughts about it all.**"
10v3r9,7,2012-10-03,Can I forget about C++?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10v3r9/can_i_forget_about_c/,"I've taken several C++ programming classes, and this will be my final semester using the language in Data Structures class. I've always hated C++ for being so damn complicated. In nearly all my assignments I've struggled with figuring out proper syntax instead of working on the problem at hand.

On the other hand, I'm breezing through a Java programming class. The language is incredibly easy to implement, so I can focus on the solving a problem and not worrying about some syntax. I truly enjoy working with Java.

I'm just concerned if having a mediocre C++ knowledge will hurt me in terms of getting internships, which I plan to look for next summer. I'd like to expand my knowledge in Java, Python, and whatever else I can get my hands on.

10v1gd,2,2012-10-03,Slowly getting tired of looking for a job. Companies waste my time. Need some words of advice. ,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10v1gd/slowly_getting_tired_of_looking_for_a_job/,"I'll begin by saying that I got laid off at the most recent job due to company funds at the beginning of July.

I thought to myself -- I want to become a top notch SE, so I decided to take a month/two to work on my own projects/blogs and put em on github. 

I think due to these, I was contacted by Amazon for an interview. I spent about a whole month preparing/nailing phone interviews. They flew me out for the onsite interviews where I screwed up  and didn't get the offer. I banked on this job and I failed. 

The positive side is that due to this month, I am now on top of my algorithms/data structures. I am the best developer I've ever been. I continue working and coding every day on new projects, learning new languages and spending my time on freenode, as well as applying to companies. If I seriously had the money, I wouldn't even look for a company to work for but just go to starbucks and code for fun indefinitely.

I know I am a very competent developer (at least for being 1 year out of college), and am probably more competent than most of the people that have interviewed me. 

Companies literally waste my time. It's disrespectful and embarrassing, while also demeaning. I'll talk to companies that have ""recruiting coordinators"" that send me to talk to ""company recruiters"" that waste my time with mindless questions and then I don't even get a chance at a technical phone screen about 30% of the time because of the incompetency of these people. At one point, I solved a pretty tough puzzle given by this one company (""to get my resume to the top of the stack"") and was contacted by some recruiter (I HATE recruiters at this point). I spent an hour talking to him while he read off questions that he was supposed to ask me and I never heard back from them, meanwhile on the phone he was talking about all these ""company values."" At least have the decency to send me an email letting me know what's going on.

The actual technical phone screens are usually conducted by some people only a few years older than I am that have no clue on how to interview people. I've read countless articles by top notch programmers(i.e Yogge) about the way to interview people and nobody follows these guidelines. The only interview I've felt that wasn't a complete waste of my time was at Amazon where I could tell I was talking to smart people that knew how to engage me. 

My passion for CS has been amazing the past several months given how depressing this whole process is, but every time I send my resume out, I feel like I am just wasting precious Joules. I am seriously considering changing careers at this point just due to this string of bad luck I've been getting into. I think I do much better with the large competitive companies than with the shitty startups that I interview with. The problem with the competitive companies is that they receive thousands of resumes a day and my resume thrown into that pile is just another piece of paper.

The worst part is -- the longer I've been out of work the worse it looks on my resume. I am in NY and I am legitimately exhausted from these companies. 

Maybe I am just extremely stupid and severely suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect. The only thing that keeps me from fully believing this, is that the two guys I usually paired up and worked on projects with at my University went on to work at awesome companies like Apple. I admit I slightly screwed up in school (in terms of not looking for an internship at a reputable company), but I know I am just as competent as those guys.

10us4p,37,2012-10-02,On job searching while employed,Mikeavelli,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/10us4p/on_job_searching_while_employed/,"Hello!  

I'm in my first job out of college as an Electrical Engineer.  It's currently an ""internship"" where I do the job of a full-time employee for around the low end of what a still-in-school intern should be expecting ($16/hr).

I signed up for this because the job market is tough, it's *exactly* what I want to be doing as an EE, and I was told this would be an ""introductory"" period, and to expect it to last 3-5 months.

At around the 4 month mark, I got an answer of ""the company isn't doing too well, we're strictly budgeting, and in a bit of a hiring freeze, we might be able to hire you on as a full time employee sometime early next year.  Keep up the good work.""  

In talking with fellow employees, I've found out the majority of fresh-out-of-school hires went through a similar 9-12 month internship period; and since I'm invited to quarterly economic review meetings, I'm aware of how this company is not in dire economic straits.  Rather, they seem to be taking advantage of the relatively poor job market in my area.

------------------------------

Suffice it to say, I've been passing my resume around, and have gotten a few bites, and I've come to a question I don't know a good answer for.

""Is it okay for us to contact your current employer?""

I've done good work, and have no doubt my co-workers would speak highly of me.  My supervisor is aware that I'm unhappy with his answer on the whole 'full time employee' conversation, but I haven't told him, or anyone at work, that I'm looking around.

- Does telling prospective employers ""no, don't contact them."" hurt my chances of landing a new job?

- How and when should I inform my current employers that I'm looking?  Right now?  After I already have an offer in hand?

- I'm financially stable, no student loans thanks to the G.I. Bill, no dependents, and have enough saved to live for several months in the event of a worst-case scenario.  As well, since it appears to be corporate policy to take advantage of employees, I've decided my current employer is not a good long-term decision.

- Any other advice on topics I haven't thought of yet?"

10yocw,3,2012-10-04,How do you weigh the value of experience vs salary?,deyur,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10yocw/how_do_you_weigh_the_value_of_experience_vs_salary/,"I'm due to finish my Masters degree (Comp Sci) early next year, and am in the process of looking for jobs. I received a pretty low offer today, lower than what I'm really willing to accept, but it got me thinking. The company offering is pretty well-established, and have a graduate program which would allow for rotating through a number of different teams, getting a range of experience before choosing where I would want to work for them.

That sort of experience seems really valuable to me, and may pay off long-term. So now I'm starting to wonder - is it worth it to accept a lower salary in order to improve your chances of getting more relevant experience, so that you can command better positions in the future? How do people weigh the importance of experience over the salary which they're asking for? I imagine internships help fulfill this role, but if you haven't interned throughout your degree, is it worth working for cheap just to buff up your resume a bit?

I'm trying to negotiate a salary with them right now, but am expecting that they'll tell me that the offer they gave me is their standard grad rate and to take it or leave it. At that point I'm not really sure whether I should just suck it up for a couple of years, in the interests of having a stronger career five years from now."

[What? No he can't. The Pooh costume is much too big around to show the performer's breasts.  Timon, on the other hand... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hpwha?context=5)|Well it was a joke around the time i worked there.  if you lift up poohs shirt you can tell.  poohs big around his stomach but not as much around the chest.
[What is your favorite part about being a character performer?  (Also, aren't the costumes supposed to be ridiculously hot?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hbmdc?context=5)|My favorite part of being a character performer was seeing the guests face when they finally get to see you.  Most kids had this sense of awe in their faces and it was absolutely priceless.  I also loved goofing around with elderly people and making them feel young again, even if it was just for a minute. Best of all, I loved seeing the Make a Wish Foundation kids.  Disney allowed us to spend extra time with these kids so that we could create ""magical moments"" for them.  It was very special being a part of these kid's wishes.
[My friend was at Disney World and he told a story of when he was there was his daughter an older, big ole biker came walked up to one of the characters, I can't recall which one, and took a picture with the character, then went into some story about how hard his life was and how he was only happiest during the moments in his childhood where he escaped the abuse and retreated into the imagination of Disney and what not. He didn't hear all of it, but needless to say he said he could hear the performer inside the costume crying but still playing it all off very professionally.  The biker guy did apologize and said ""I understand you're just doing your job, and I'm sorry for venting, but I just had to."" and he walked away, teary eyed.  I wonder, have you ever had a similar situation like that occur? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hkgvd?context=5)|I have not.  thats a tough situation for both the guest and the character.

What's backstage like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hynbl?context=5)|The shifts were anywhere from 5-10 hours.  mine were typically 6 or 8.  but the characters are not on set the whole time.  if it was extremely hot outside the amount of outdoor set time would get reduced.  yes we did come from the tunnel doors.  they are all over the park.  backstage is not very exciting.  they are basically just tunnels with break rooms, cafeteria, bathrooms etc.  sometimes you'll see a character roaming around.  people always think the tunnels are some crazy underground city.  they arent lol.
[Proof? And what was the weirdest thing a kid/parent did that you saw/ did to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hasfl?context=5)|The weirdest/creepiest thing that ever happened to me was coming in contact with a child molester.  I noticed he seemed out of place being in line to visit chip and dale all by himself, with no camera or autograph book.  When it was finally his turn he just came up to me and petted my head and nose and didn't say a word.  I had a bad feeling about him and so did my attendant.  After visiting the chipmunks he went to see Pluto.  According to the girl who was ""friends with"" Pluto, he picked up Pluto's ear and literally whispered ""I'm a child molester.""  Obviously Pluto got off stage and told the manager.  Disney security was on him in an instant and his background check came back saying he was recently charged with child molestation.

[What kind of training is there to get a job like that?  And what kind of career can it lead to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6havtn?context=5)|The auditioning process is the hardest part.  It involves a ton of people and resembles what you would see on american idol.  If you are lucky enough to make it training isn't that hard, in fact, I thought it was fun.  It was about a week long for me and involved getting comfortable in the costume and working on nonverbal communication skills.  Disney also spends a lot of time going over their character integrity, even down to having their performers master their character's handwriting (which is way more difficult with chipmunk hands)  I'm not 100% sure what kind of careers it could lead to.  I would imagine and performing career would look positively upon having Disney on your resume.  Personally, I am now in the field of clinical psychology so this job was just a fun experience for me.

The performers get trained in multiple characters.  My favorite characters are the chipmunks.  Chip and dale's character is supposed to mischievous and playful.  I always got away with doing funny little things that weren't always disney approved.  But since it was part of the chipmunk character they didn't mind and the guests always loved it.  The length of the set was determined based on how hot it was outside and what location you were working.  A typical set was about 30 minutes long but sets indoors and character dining shifts were usually longer.  
[Would you say the job was generally an enjoyable one? Or was it just cool for a week and then hot and tiring and a grind like a normal job? I guess the real question is did it ever get boring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdk6n?context=5)|In general, the job was very enjoyable.  like any job, sometimes it got tiring, especially in the heat.  but not one day went by where i didn't have one guest that made my whole day worthwhile.  when days started to get tiring i just reminded myself where i was and what i was doing and i always cheered up.  i would be lying if i said the job never got routine, but anything you do for 40 plus hours a week will get this way.  it was still the most fun job i have ever had.

Have you ever gotten tips from parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hd5uc?context=5)|No, I was never accused of inappropriately touching a kid.  Disney does a great job in training the performers how to avoid putting yourself in a situation in which you could be accused, especially during pictures.  The character attendant does all the guest verbal interactions since we can't talk.  I accidentally talked once, but luckily no one heard me.  I said god bless you when a guest sneezed!  oops.  Parents don't typically give us tips besides warning us that their child is shy or scared.  
[How about tips as in cash?  Have you ever seen horrible parenting or overprotective parenting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdlu8?context=5)|We were never allowed to receive tips, but people also didn't really offer.  parents that bring their kids to disney typically want them to have fun so i didn't really see too much over protection.  i did, however, see some kids on leashes.  as a chipmunk i always had fun with those.  ;)
[Child leashes are probably the stupidest thing ever invented.

[What was the auditioning process like? Can you explain what questions they asked or what they required you to do? Did they have any prerequisites? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hc88q?context=5)|No problem!  The audition process was intense.  There were a lot of people auditioning.  Everyone gets there early to get their audition number and warm up.  The audition involved two parts: dance and animation.  The dance part was basically an instructor teaching the room a dance.  She went very fast so having experience picking up choreography is definitely helpful.  After being taught the dance we had to perform it in front of a panel in groups of 5.  Then we went to animation.  Here they basically gave us a scenario and we had to animate it (non verbally of course) to the panel.  After all of this they basically called numbers and either told you a yes, no or that you were in the pool of maybes.  Anyone can audition, however you will probably have a rough time with no prior dance experience.
[I have to ask - those suits must be hot. How often are you allowed breaks to cool off? What happens if you get sick in your suit? How long are you typically at a meet and greet before you're able to take a break?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hbjmo?context=5)|They are VERY hot and do not believe the rumors you may hear that the costumes have air conditioning because it is very untrue.  The length of the meet and greet depends on how hot it is outside. On extremely hot days I had meet and greets as short as 20 minutes long.  Typically, they run about 30-40 min per set.  It is frowned upon to get sick in costume.  If the performer feels they are getting sick they are allowed to run off set in the middle of a greet.  People have gotten sick in their costume and it involves extensive cleaning by other disney employees.

It is cool to walk around under the magic kingdom, but in all honestly, they are literally just tunnels.  There's dressing rooms, storage rooms, break rooms and a cafeteria down there.  The most interesting place has to be the costuming room.  Without going into too much detail, it is shocking to walk into a room full of your favorite disney characters just hanging on hangers.  You can spend a lot of time just walking around, looking at all the different characters.  Also, if you spend some time near costuming you will most likely see some half costumed characters roaming around, which is always a funny sight.  
[Goofy is hitting on sleeping beauty wtf!?!  I could totally see this happening :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdwnn?context=5)|There was never a dull moment around costuming :p.

They place you as characters according to your height.  Chip and dale must be between about 5'1 and 5'4.  You can get scheduled and trained to be any character within your height range.  The face characters (princesses for example) are a little different.  You audition specifically for face characters.

Do the two groups hang out, or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdfnl?context=5)|This is true.  My internship was 7 months long and I think that it was a perfect amount of time to be there.  It does get draining being out in the heat every day and the pay isn't good enough to continue for a long period.  Every job at disney is different but most of them do involve being out in the heat.  As far as benefits and wages for college program employees, the jobs are pretty much equal.  I believe character performers, photopass, and life guards get paid the highest, but not by much.  Hours vary a lot within jobs.  I know merchandising cast members always had crazy hours.  The performers typically had good hours since they are only working when the park is open.  All college program cast members hung out all the time, and I believe the regular cast members did as well.  
[Are there any repercussions for taking off a piece of your costume while in the park?

The repercussion for taking off a piece of your costume would be immediate termination from the company.  There may even be some legal repercussions, but don't take my word on that.  Disney is extremely strict with their character integrity and if you did anything to tarnish it you will be fired without question.

[I seen a Disney commercial a few months ago for an app the you can use in the park.  They said something along the lines of it showing you where your favorite characters are.  Any idea how that works?

If they roamed around this way now the character would get swamped and surrounded by guests in two seconds.  It was actually scary how people would run at us as soon as we walked on stage.  Because of this, the characters now how exact spots to be in at exact times.  Often, there are lines waiting for the character before they even get on set.  The app just tells you where the characters will be and at what time.

I assume there are multiple costumes of the same character though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hjcrg?context=5)|They wash the costumes after every single use.  they don't smell at all.  they are a few sets of each character working on each shift, so that the characters can take a break.  but there is only one of that character in the park at a single moment.  part of the disney magic is the idea that there is only one of each character.  there are many costumes of each character tho.
[The last time I was at Disneyland, I ran into (I think\) Pilot Mickey in California Adventure... we then walked directly from there to Mickey's house, to find him hanging out there.

I looked down and saw that they were casually trying to hide a person who was on the ground and in need of medical attention.

So all the nodes start coming online except for one. It's beeping about 3 sticks of dead RAM. We swap out all the extra RAM we have available, it's not working. These are new i7 Xeons so of course, the memory controller is in the CPU. Eventually we rip the CPU out and sure enough, several bent pins, supposedly straight from the factory, we usually go straight from box to rack so its doubtful an intern was giving himself a hardware lesson. In any case, we tell the Director what's going on and he'll have none of it. Get it fixed. So we gutted the box there on the datacenter floor, stretched out across the floor and went to it bending the pins back into their correct position. It took over an hour but sure enough, we powered it on, prayed to our various sky Gods and saved the rollout date.

Last year I interviewed with IBM and Verizon ...and it didn't go so great :(. They asked me very technical questions in the IBM interview, which I couldn't answer (although now I can). And in the Verizon interview they only asked me about personal experiences, and nothing technical... I never heard from them again.

I am graduating in December. I currently have a part time job that could *potentially* become full time after I graduate.

I just got offered a part time internship that also offered *potential* full time for when I graduate (at least full time hours, but honestly the pay isn't fantastic for full time).

First job is great, love the people I work with, but it isn't really in a field I want to be in (basically support desk right now). Have been offered to move to another department in the company if I am able to go full time (positive vibes, but not definite). The other department would provide extremely specialized training, and basically jobs I would be qualified for after that are limited based on that training... although obviously could go into another field, just a little more difficult.

Second job seems great, and will provide me with experience that I really want (training and technical writing). In the interview process, he said that many of their interns go full time and it would be a definite possibility for salary. Pays less than other job.

My original intention: I intend on trying to move away from my current location in about a year. The area I'm in is okay, but it's my college town and while it has a neat culture, it's just not quite where I want to live forever. I was going to work full time hours between both jobs (they both have said they can keep me on part time indefinitely).

Problem: My mom is pushing me to go full time somewhere so I can get benefits. The thing is, I can still qualify for health insurance under her so I don't see much point in this. She doesn't want me to go off her plan unless I get benefits through a company, although I would be more than willing to go on my own personal plan. I won't pay for the plan she has me on currently as it costs wayyy too much for what I  need, plus I have a feelings it's being affected by her pricing due to her having had cancer (survivor woo!) and muscular dystrophy.

I can get a 401k plan with matching through the first company (become eligible at the end of this month), so I will start contributing to that.

So, my options:

1. Keep my current plan.

2. Go full time at one of the jobs, I would likely go with the first one due to it paying more. However, I want experience from the second one. I would likely just fight that battle when I get there. What I hate however about this option is my intent to move soon. I simply want to save up money before I move somewhere else.

3. Keep looking for full time positions while working both jobs part time. Again, this seems silly to me because of my intent to move and by the time I found a full time for December, I would only likely be at it for a year at the most.~~

Edit:

**TL;DR**: Is it more worthwhile to get a full time job for benefits, or work full time hours at two different jobs to get experience that I want?"

Finally she gets the deets on it.  ""Looks like the (internship companies) aren't going to be paying anything this year to the interns."" - Fucking worthless advisor.  GOD DAMN IT!!!!!  This isn't how this was supposed to work.  I'm at my fucking tipping point.  Nobody else gives a shit because they all are getting money from the fucking school but my wife, who is near the top of her program with grades, projects and all the other bullshit they put her through isn't getting shit.  Why? Who the fuck knows, but she is the only one who isn't there with god damn balloons for everyones birthdays, kissing ass to all the fucking professors.

What the fuck happened to getting rewarded based on merit? Reward those who know their shit and give those who slack a reason to get their asses going.  Apparently thats not how Universities work these days.

I am struggling so much with all this bull shit.  I get so angry. I don't understand my math class and the only time that I feel like I can manage to actually study is on the weekend when the math center isn't open. I have another test Tuesday and I'm going to bomb it like I did the first one.  I am trying so hard but it doesn't even fucking matter. Why the fuck can't I just be content being a lousy *** like I used to be.  Why the fuck am I even trying to go back to school.  

I can't handle this shit anymore.  I am so tired. Damnit."
117xxx,0,2012-10-09,Should I Pursue Employment In Male-Dominated Industries?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/117xxx/should_i_pursue_employment_in_maledominated/,"Hello Reddit!  I wanted some advice on whether it would be in my best interest to pursue traditionally male-dominated industries in my job hunt.

Quick rundown of my job hunting situation:

- I am looking for marketing related work, ideally promotion, communications or consumer insight.  No sales!

- In May 2012 I graduated from one of the top #25 MBA programs in North America.

- I went straight to my MBA program out of undergrad.  I chose to do this because I started a successful online business my senior year of high school.  I ran that business for 4+ years while getting my undergraduate degree.

- I had 3 valuable internships during grad school, including significant social media experience.

- Over the summer my job hunt was restricted geographically, and I didn’t have many interviews.

- Interviewing picked up towards the end of August.  I’ve had 8 interviews since then (2 were second round) but no offers.

- I’m currently doing an unpaid internship to avoid having a huge gap of unemployment on my resume.  It’s nothing special but they’re very flexible, which is perfect for me right now.

I recently decided that I am no longer restricting myself geographically, so I am now focusing on companies I am personally interested in.  And where I get back to my original question, I’ve always had a little tomboyish-geek streak, and I want to know if this could be to my advantage. 

**As a woman, would I have a better or worse chance finding a marketing position in male-dominated industries?** (I’m currently considering video gaming, professional sports, beer.)  Would companies in these industries actually be interested in female employees who are passionate about their products and services?

Thanks for any advice!"
11861m,3,2012-10-09,"Dream opportunity, but complications with temporary visa, UK/USA &gt; Canada -- Please help",Iemaj,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/11861m/dream_opportunity_but_complications_with/,"Hi guys,

Senior undergrad in the U.S. -- I was born and raised in England, but moved to the U.S. and have a green card.

I was offered a paid internship for 4.5 months from spring to end of summer in Toronto, Canada.

Here's a detailed explanation of where I stand currently:

I looked into traveling abroad in terms of owning a US Green Card as a UK citizen. This will not be an issue as it will be for 4.5 months, and I will still be making payments on my car, through my U.S. bank account, and I will still be registered at my university with plans to return in the fall. More than enough to certify this is my permanent residence for re-entry to the U.S.

http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-how.asp#step2[1] 

This is the step by step on getting a temporary work visa. It tells us:
Before you fill out the application, you will need:

a written job offer from your employer

proof that you meet the requirements of the job (for example, proof of certain education or work experience) and

the positive labour market opinion on your job offer from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), if one is required. If you are applying for a work permit for a job that requires a Labour Market Opinion (LMO), you must now include the valid LMO with your application. We are no longer accepting work permit applications without valid LMOs. If you need an HRSDC opinion, it is up to your employer to get it and send it to you. For more information about HRSDC opinions, see Frequently asked questions.

In following this, I emailed my potential employer, for the internship, asking for an official job offer in PDF, along with a HRSDC opinion document, if they needed to provide one, and if not, acknowledging that in the job offer. Unfortunately, I have received this reply:

""... [our company] is not able to assist you in obtaining a work permit. Your offer of an internship is only an offer once you have already obtained your work permit... [our company] can not hire a foreigner for this job unless we prove to the Canadian government that we can not find a Canadian to do the job, (the HRSDC #)... I would suggest that you look into the SWAP program...""

I originally tried to go through SWAP, but they said that they wouldn't help me with my particular situation, and so I contacted my schools International Student Services Organization, which haven't been any help so far. They have been emailing people looking for advice but without any luck as of yet.

This was the embassy I was planning on going through. Note my permanent residence is Massachusetts.

http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/offices/missions/new-york.asp[2]

With all this in consideration, should I just apply for the temporary work permit for canada without the certain employment letter in NYC and hope I get the visa?

Another thought I had was that since I have a UK passport, I know I can travel freely in Canada for up to 6 months without a visa. Would I be able to do the internship if I were not being paid? This would involve renting an apartment there etc. Though I believe this will be illegal, being an Unpaid Internship.

This could mean potentially getting a great job in the field vs being unemployed for a large amount of time after graduation. If any of you have any advice, tips, knowledge, or anything that might be of assistance to me I will be very grateful, unfortunately this is the perfect internship for my field, and so I really don't want to let it go.

tl;dr -- I am a UK citizen with a green card in the U.S. offered a paid internship in toronto canada -- How do I get a work permit without the companies confirmation during application process?"
118594,10,2012-10-09,"Most important decision of my academic/professional life: Master of Public Affairs, MBA, or PhD?",MPAorMBAorPHD,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/118594/most_important_decision_of_my/,"American 26-year-old male here, happily married and gainfully employed, but heavily in debt and *lost* career-wise.

For various reasons 3 years ago I made a choice to get an M.Phil. in Religious Dialogue from a major European University.  I got good grades, made great connections -- it was the best experience of my life and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

My American public school humanities BA was also funded with debt, and lots of it.  But the debt never seemed like a problem because I was always good at building websites.  I am employed at present in a role which borders on web development and marketing, making a salary which (barely) can support my wife and myself, while she goes back to professional graduate school in the health sciences.  I have worked since my college internship in the same small company, and I could see myself leaving in a year to try to build a career in either client management or internet marketing... if I weren't so bored with it.

Long story short, I have always been interested in religious dialogue and conflict.  (In my mind, this is the most important question of our age.)  For years I assumed I would get a **PhD**, but the jobs for religious studies professors are few and far between, and tenure-track positions seem to be incredibly rare.  Plus, a PhD is a 6-year process probably.  My wife and I are close to our family, and after graduation I don't want us to end up in a tiny college in the middle of nowhere, where I'm lucky to have an adjunct position.  Even still, this admissions cycle I have reached out to a number of top-tier religious studies programs and professors in the US, and they seem interested in my proposed thesis topic.

In recent months though I've had the idea to pursue another Masters, this time in a **Master of Public Affairs**, focusing on International Affairs.  This way I could study international geopolitical (and religious) conflicts throughout the world, perhaps focusing on Eastern European/Caucasian conflict centers.  I'm very excited about 2 years of studying such a topic, but very anxious about the career placement.  MPAs by definition usually get jobs in government, and again, my wife and I want to remain relatively local, and aren't thrilled about moving to DC forever.  Some MPAs do find work in the private sector, but I'm not sure if they do so in international affairs.  And if I'm just going to get a job in marketing, I might as well continue as an internet marketer, without going back to school!

Finally, there's the **MBA**, which offers a chance to stay local in my city of choice, studying in a couple of ranked national programs; both provide a part-time option, which might allow us to pay for it as I go.  The financial benefits are obvious, but it seems completely contrary to my childhood dreams of being involved in religious studies, or my adult dreams of working towards achieving religious dialogue.  BUT, if I got my MBA in International Business, maybe I could jump on board with a multinational company and focus on international development, or work as a consultant with expertise in European conflict zones, etc.  Sure -- but how many MBAs are in it for the altruism?  I can't pretend to kid myself that I *also* would be doing it for the money.

What degree, if any, should I pursue?  It's already October and I'm falling apart.

**tl;dr: I love religious dialogue and have a major interest in international geopolitical conflict zones, but I need a lucrative career because of debt load, my wife and I don't want to move permanently for work, and I want to make an impact on the world.  I can't decide whether a PhD, MPA or MBA is right for me.**"

While setting up the forms for the sidewalk, it was noticed that all the water service boxes (or curb stops) that were on the radius of a street, were placed too close and were encroaching into the sidewalk.  They were placed up to 2 feet too close to the centerline in some cases. Note that along the straightaways there were installed correctly. [Shotty diagram for visual](http://i.imgur.com/qMzzK.png)

The locations were staked using gps technology. I do not believe the issue to be Builder damage because of the trend of all faulty location occurring at street radii.

I heard that sometimes when staking locations, the surveyor must look up from the trench and get a misleading idea of where to place the stake (or something to that effect). I was only an intern and have not seen the execution of this phase of development.

Any information would be great, Thanks.

TLDR; why were water boxes on straightaways ok but water boxes where the road turns were off location, which were all originally staked via gps?"

I have roughly 1.5 years of internship experience in Marketing roles. The first was working on an online/print catalog for a local electrical distributor and another working in an Audience Research role for a pretty major media outlet (known nationally). Prior to that I worked in a retail setting for nearly 3 years (gained lots of selling experience and some management). Before that as a Customer Service Tech for a broadband internet company.

I've mainly been searching for roles in Market Research which is a long shot since I know most of these roles prefer to have people with a Masters degree. To my own surprise I managed to get two phone interviews. I've since expanded my search to general marketing roles.

**Here comes the question:**

Is there a huge disadvantage not living where the job is being offered? I'm mainly applying for positions in Chicago and Seattle but I'm currently living and volunteering in North Dakota (I really have no choice to live in work here for the next several months).

There is a chance I'm just not that great of candidate (see resume below).

Thanks for the help in advance.

My ultimate objective is to be a data scientist, but I also enjoy software engineering / architecture.

Architecture and Data Structures course, it is not over yet. I've self-studied (through coursera and on my own) algorithms, design patterns, compilers (wrote a lexer and grammar generator), played with some AI, and automota theory. My professors are always amazed at the work I come up with and the graders call my code pro.

My 1st degree was in Economics, and I have done 3 graduate courses in Statistics (Applied Stats, ANOVA, and Regression). I know SAS and Java really well; C fairly well. I have in various degrees programmed or learned bash, awk, R, Haskell, vb.NET. I know Linux and its command line decently as a user.

So I think I have something of worth. But I am not sure what companies are the leading data analytics companies to intern at. I really want something that challenges me and will get me deeper into the data science as practiced in industry aspect of things.

Recently I've pondered about studying abroad for a semester (or two), and I wanted to know how my chances are, if I wanted to study in America. I've visited the country twice: First time I toured the East Coast, highlights of the journey including New York City, Washington and a day in Canada (the Falls). The other time, I went with my school, visiting New York City as part of a project organized by our government and the school I went to.

I find the American culture most intriguing and everything about seems just so exciting! 

I've been thinking about settling down in Portland, as it seems like quite a ""Big City"" which is the place I'd like to live, if I gained to opportunity to move there: A really big city, with lots of ""life"". 

But tell me, realistically speaking: How hard is it to study in the US, in comparison to Denmark? One of the things that I'm quite worried about is also the cost of living: will adapting to the American economy be too overwhelming? 

Alternatively to studying, I was thinking about taking up an internship as part of my bachelor project (I'm still in the 1st semester of the degree and the project doesn't start until the beginning of the 6th out of total 7 semesters) - I'm taking a bachelors in IT Engineering.

[The craziest story ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m43fi?context=5)|Well, near the beginning of my career as a front office manager, I had gotten a call to help calm down an irate woman. Her beef was that she was convinced she was confirmed at a $49 rate. Our rates at the time were running at $129. I tried to talk her through it, and we eventually came to a a point where she agreed to go out to her car for the confirmation letter. I breathed a short-lived sigh of relief. Something in writing almost always solved my problems, one way or another. Except, there was no confirmation letter. Instead, she loaded in to her Suburban, threw it in to drive, and floored it... Right in to the side of the building. She calmly got out of her smoking vehicle, strode up to the front desk with a smile and said, ""I think I'll take that $129 rate.""
 |You know, watching the FBI run a sting in my parking lot to pick up some guy from another state who had murdered his family was pretty crazy, too. When the FBI shows up with a court order for information, you know it's about to get crazy. 
[Did you call the cops? Did she get arrested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4pw3?context=5)|I carefully told her that she absolutely could not stay there, and I called the cops. She melted down in to a fit of rage and they had to lift her up and carry her to their car.
[What was her reason for doing this? I'm so confused.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m50fc?context=5)|My guess? Rage issues.

I think walking in one one couple literally hanging from the gym equipment having sex was a bizarre one for me. It was compounded by the man begging me for ""just 30 extra seconds"" so he could finish.  I offered my sympathies to his lady friend and told him he had 2 minutes to be clothed and out.  
[You seem to be a great person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6mbyma?context=5)|My primary rules: Always do the right thing, and don't be a dick. :)

 |Make sure you join the chain's loyalty program (HHonors, Marriott Rewards, etc). You get instant free things that way. Generally you can easily get wifi, room upgrades, and food or drink coupons.  
 |Make nice with the front desk folks. They generally want people to have a great time and they have a slew of freebies they can give away. Make up a special occasion... Even if it is something silly. Tell a story and get some buy-in. 
 |Don't ever threaten, yell, or try to belittle. You get put on the ""no freebie"" list. 
[If you have a special occasion, should you just come out and mention it and then just wait for them to offer some free stuff? Isn't that bad form?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6mesil?context=5)|Here's the honest answer: just come out and say it.
 |As a guest I know it feels weird, though. When we went on our honeymoon I had found all of these cool stories about one of the resorts we stayed at. They did all kinds of fun things for honeymooners. Did I once mention we were honeymooning? No. I silently sulked.

As a girl, I got the offers all the time, but they were definitely not good offers. Not that I didn't think really hard about it a few times... But it's way more fun to have romps at someone else's hotel.

[OK this brings up a question I have.  What would you suggest as being a good approach to asking out a hotel staffer?  Is there a policy to never go out with a guest during off hours?  What if that guest lives in town? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m8u2z?context=5)|There is a policy that everyone ignores. I had an associate marry a man she met while he was a guest.
 |It has to be done carefully because it might not be easy to tell if the person is in to you or just being super nice because that is their personality. If you can talk to them away from coworkers, try starting by asking if you can bring them a cup of coffee or something. (Most of us are rampant coffee drinkers.) The reaction is a good gauge. Then just come up with something fun to do, and ask.
 |I never appreciated the creepers that would literally just invite me up to their rooms. That's lame. Nobody really bites on that trick.

She's a tiny little lady that could barely see over the front desk counter, but would come down early in the morning to visit with me. She is hysterically funny, full of energy, and very smart. Upon leaving, she grabbed my hands and in her very thick drawl exclaimed, ""You're going to have GREAT sex for the rest of your life!""
 |I did also watch Sting get chased through the restaurant by a mob of middle-aged women.
 |BB King was another good one. He wandered around every day telling jokes and giving away guitar picks.
 |Oh! And I did also have Wee Man help himself to the kitchen. He pretty much just went wherever he wanted. Super funny.

She'd been expecting company and hadn't realized that she couldn't answer the door or the phone. By the time we got there to do a wellness check on her she had peed all over the place. I asked her what she was thinking and sheepishly answered that she thought it would be a sexy surprise. Failed.

An assistant and I went up to the room to start packing and inventorying his belongings. He was clearly OCD, and had neatly arranged a ton of soap bottles all around the room. After getting a good laugh out of his organizational systems, we grabbed the first duffel bag. It was full of weed.  So was the closet, the drawers, and a number of other duffel bags. He had some large bags that we expected to be full of video equipment.  Nope.  Weed.  It was all packed down very tightly and stashed everywhere that he could manage. Overall, the cops told us that he had nearly 20 pounds. It was an incredible amount.

[How did you handle drunk loud people in the lobby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m54ia?context=5)|Most of the time I treat drunk people in the lobby like kids in a daycare. They're obnoxious and completely irrational. I usually make them laugh, entertain them for a moment, and then convince them that sleeping in their room is going to be way better than jail. I rarely have bigger problems. I give them one chance to behave. Sometimes fist fights have broken out and I won't tolerate those. I instantly call the cops.
[Ever had to evict a guest due to complaints from other guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m54ia?context=5)|Yes, I've had to evict people.

I can't speak for those that still use bedspreads now, but my experience before was that they got washed at least weekly or as needed.
 |We shampoo the carpets in each room once a month. Every time there is a party, smoking, or anything gross like vomit we'll do it immediately.
 |The philosophy on cleaning a room is that it should seem as if nobody else has ever stayed in that room... Every single time they clean it. We also do something called a PM that is a super detailed check done on a rotation. We will redo little things like caulking, calcium removal on the shower heads, cleaning window sills, tightening screws, etc.

[How do you get the lowest hotel prices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m3xk9?context=5)|Unfortunately it really is opaque websites like Priceline. There are tricks to figuring out which hotel you will get. Otherwise, use the advance purchase rates. Those are a good discount. Some hotel chains are really loose with their Friends and Family rates. You often don't even have to prove you know someone. Those discounts can be 50% or more. 
[*There are tricks to figuring out which hotel you will get.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m9jjn?context=5)|Do a bit of research. Find out where you want to stay and if there is anything unique about the hotel. I recommend Tripadvisor. So, you notice that this is the only 4-star hotel in the downtown area that has both a pool and free wifi.
[Go on...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m9jjn?context=5)|When you make your Priceline selections, be sure to check those amenity boxes, bid on a 4-star hotel downtown, and there you go. You'll get that hotel.

They usually sell for more, but are easy to get as a free upgrade. Make a casual reference to how great it would be... I think the best rooms are the odd rooms. We have a few that used to be some kind of Junior Suite but don't quite currently make the cut. They're bigger, but sell for the exact price of a standard room. I always ask about stuff like that. I don't know about worst. It almost always pertains to noise, though. We do have one room that tilts a tiny bit.  We call it the vertigo room... It's so bizarre. Another one vibrates ever so slightly.  Hah! Loyalty programs are the easiest way for an upgrade.  Second easiest way? Ask. Super nicely. Be cheesy if necessary. Front desk folks love to feel like they've done something really meaningful. Non-peak times are super easy. So what's the $20 trick? I'm curious.

Keep trash in the trash cans, throw your dirty towels in a pile on the floor, and be careful about leaving your electronics on the beds. Some hotels will move them and pick up after you, others won't even make your bed.
 |Just remember, always tip your housekeeper! They've got the hardest job there.

Doctors were telling him a valve that had been replaced was failing. He said he was going for a second opinion after the meeting. I disagreed as wholeheartedly as I could, trying to get him to go immediately. No luck. He laughed and insisted he was doing the right thing. I called him to see how things were going while he was gone. We talked briefly and he said he was in the workout room to go for quick run before dinner. Just like that, and I never spoke to him again.
 |The family could not do a memorial service that our staff and community members could attend. He was from another state so they moved him. So, I held a funeral service for him in our restaurant. I wrote an delivered a eulogy for him. He was very young (mid-30s) and an absolutely incredible GM. He was loved by many, so there was a huge crowd.
 |I couldn't have imagined what a tragedy it really is for the staff to lose their leader. It was the hardest thing I've had to do so far. And the saddest. 
[Are the bed sheets ever ""dirty""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m5di1?context=5)|Shouldn't be. If my executive housekeeper suspects anything, she will backlight the room herself. She'll even mark sheets with invisible ink to make sure all beds have been changed. 
[Do hotels care if you have more people staying in the hotel room than what's been reserved?

It not only lends credibility to any endeavors in a market where the recruiters don't know the validity of your experience, but you're likely to learn something, too. It's not a bad idea.
[I wanted to go to school for Hotel Management since I graduated from High School, but I'm wondering if that's a good route to go now.  I talk to people locally and they say that experience is more beneficial than a degree.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m65qk?context=5)|On the flip side of that, I have never declined a qualified and ready internal candidate based on a lack of formal education. The work you demonstrate speaks volumes. I would try to move to a few more day shifts. Night auditors have a hard time receiving the recognition they deserve. It's hard to evaluate their performance and promote accordingly.
[Would you recommend going back to school for the degree, possibly taking classes online, or stick with working full time and using experience as a leverage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m65qk?context=5)|I usually feel that after 3 years someone should be up for promotion if they're performing well.

I had a guest once insist that I move the two queen sized beds out of his room and bring in two kings, instead. I tried every trick in my bag to make him happy in a way that did not include dismantling the beds that were attached to the walls... He fought me for hours. Days! Every time he saw me he got aggressive. He complained about the river not being high enough, the bushes being too green, the windows being too small. He was making me crazy. So, when he'd call needing something like towels or something... I was never in a big hurry.

The idea is that for every dollar you spend at one of their hotels, they'll reward you with ""points"", or in some cases airline miles. Those points can later be redeemed for free night stays, free stuff, or vacations. That varies a bit by loyalty program, but they all operate on roughly the same premise. The programs are always completely free to join, and the more loyal you are, the more goodies you get. You'll move up levels and get more perks (free upgrades, free drink/breakfast vouchers, free newspaper delivered to your door, free wifi, etc). If you're a person who frequently needs late check-outs, they're really valuable. That's a fairly universal perk offered to almost all levels. There's no reason not to join, honestly.

It takes some luck, honestly. Here's what you need: 
 |Experience demonstrating some HR functions like recruiting or training. Ask your manager if you can help with hiring. Offer an idea for training. 
 |Good instincts. Feel free to start sharing your insight on any situations you may be involved in. 
 |Always act with 100% integrity. Inspire your coworkers to follow suit. Never get caught being a gossip or bitching about work conditions. 
 |Volunteer somewhere. Talk to the ladies at the YWCA about job hunting, do something with your local university or college, or offer your time at a GED program helping with resumes. 
 |Accept an intro position if there is one as an HR coordinator or intern.

Like I said I have two offers.  Job A would be doing embedded system development for a company that makes handheld devices.  I interned with them last summer so I know the people are very good to work with and would be helpful and patient with an entry level developer.  Job B is with a company that provides web-based solutions related to health care, basically working with Java and databases and MVC frameworks.  I have lots of experience doing the kind of work that Job B would require and none, outside of my internship, that has prepared me for Job A.  My natural inclination is to go with Job B, but I don't want to rule out Job A simply because I have never done that kind of low level work before.  It could be interesting.  Since I'm open to both kinds of work, I guess what I would like to know is what kind of development would be best for my future career?  Embedded systems development or server side applications and MVC development?  What sorts of skills would be valued in the next 10+ years.  Web seems like the way to go since everything has moved to the web, but it also seems like there will always be a need for embedded systems developers."

I knew how to handle federal paperwork, write loan authorizations, do independent audits, prepare loan files for review, handle client disputes, and could tell whether or not a business was going to make it by the time I was 15.  I was also tech support for about 30 of my dad's clients, and made a good bit of money on the side doing it.

I also ran a horse/goat breeding farm almost singlehandedly since I was 13, so I've dealt with heavy amounts of research, marketing and sales.

Now I'm 21, in college, looking for something part time around my area.  I'm a technical communication (art and science of communicating an idea) and international studies double major.  None of my experience is in retail, or any traditional student job.

I've had four different places in two months say that I was overqualified, I guess because they thought I'd ask for too much money.  I freelance in social media, which is ok money, but I'd really like to find a good part time marketing/social media/writing position around here.  Four people I know who are completely inexperienced were hired for those positions over me.  They all worked at Walmart in electronics.

Several said that part of the problem was me taking two years off after a semester of college when I had to come back home and help run the family business/farm full time.  I had two years of work experience, they were looking for almost none.

I am also having a hell of a time with internships.  I've already had one this summer that was paid.  Now I'm looking for something next summer (yes, some are already open, but I'm mostly asking around random areas of the country, want to get out of my geographical area).  I've probably sent out 30 emails, about 20 of those were returned, and about 15 said no because I had too much experience.  The other 5 said to contact them in December.

I'm at a loss.  I thought experience was a good thing?  Am I just looking in all the wrong places?  My resume plays up my experience at a college radio station (I've been chief engineer and music director), instead of the places they claim I'm overqualified in. (Can post it if anyone is interested in looking)

One was today, another will happen on Wednesday.

The interview today went *okay*. I was given a fairly straightforward algorithm question related to strings, and I got the most time efficient algorithm immediately, which I could tell the interviewer liked. Made a couple stupid mistakes due to nerves (i.e. != null instead of == null) but generally everything was good on that one. PROBLEM: she asked me, after I wrote that, to make it more *space* efficient. I totally blanked and she had to move on to the next question. :( It was so easy, and of course the solution occurred to me right after the interview but it's too late now.

The 2nd question was related to OO design, and I struggled with that one initially because of all the variables in the problem (it turned out to be the interviewer's work a month prior) and didn't actually finish it due to running out of time, but she said she ""saw where I was going with it, and it was good"" or something along those lines.

So yeah. Mixed feelings overall. I don't feel I totally failed but I'm unsure about it overall. Has anyone had an interview like this for an internship at Amazon and then went on to kill the 2nd interview and get the job? Any tips to share?

11ivrq,8,2012-10-15,Positive response from Google but low GPA. Looking for advice.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11ivrq/positive_response_from_google_but_low_gpa_looking/,"First, thank you for reading. I think that my problem is specific enough to warrant a new thread, I couldn't find anything too similar when I searched atleast. 


Here's my situation:

Google arranged an Internship Interview Workshop (obviously to also recruit) for 14 students where I live (Stockholm, Sweden) and they came to our school to urge us to apply.

I sent in my CV (resume) and waited.

I got a response where they said that unfortunately they could not invite me to the workshop, they referenced the fact that the competition was strong and that there were a lot of applicants.

But they also told me that they were impressed with the quality of my application and they asked me to apply at their website (I hope this response wasn't automated). So far so good.


The problem is that I only submitted my CV which contained information on previous employment and personal projects but I did not list my GPA which is around 2.6-2.9.

So what of these should I do?:

* Should I avoid the GPA question at all costs until a potential interview? Though in the link below you will see that there is a field for GPA. 

* Should I write a carefully worded cover letter that explains how I have focused on my projects rather than on getting high grades in my courses? (As university is free I can more easily defend my belief that I should spend my time both learning in school and learning by doing.)

* Should I skip the cover letter altogether? I think I've read a blog post by Steve Yegge regarding this.  

* Something else?


Additionally: This is my second year studying computer science, since I have only completed courses from my first year there was only one programming course, the rest were math and general engineering subjects (Perhaps it's too early to apply?). Even though my grades are low I am very confident in my ability and knowledge.

(On the off chance that anyone replying is from Sweden: how much have your grades mattered when looking for jobs? Currently there isn't even a proper conversion table for GPA, is grade averages ever talked about outside of foreign companies?)


This is what their application site looks like for interns: [Long link](http://www.google.com/jobs/application/application_student?loc=us&amp;action=add&amp;job=2013%20Software%20Engineer%20Intern%20-%20Multiple%20European%20Locations%20Available)

As you can see, they would also like a transcript, though it is optional.


Thanks again for your input. (I do realise that my GPA might hinder me terribly but I'll atleast give this a try.)"

1- people rarely talk to each other for help so i feel like a nagging person if i keep asking question. 
2- im an electrical engineer not a programmer and its my first internship, so i thought it would be normal for me to be slow
3- when i was programming, i knew i was slow but i was afraid to bother them with a quick question  and i thought that , since im an intern, they would monitor my work and regularly tell me to speed up. But i guess i was wrong and this is the real world and i need to act as an adult now. 

Also, my friends got jobs too but not as programmers. They waste their time sitting in front of a PC. Was I lucky to get this job or did they hire the wrong person . I mean,  did they want a computer science or software guy?

I dont want to sound like i dont like the job. I love it ! But i want to know how should i feel about this situation? Right now i feel confused but ill still do anything to speed up."
11hls0,1,2012-10-14,"Fired from internship, read/been given conflicting advice on how to handle at future interviews. Please advise.",temp6202,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/11hls0/fired_from_internship_readbeen_given_conflicting/,"Second post on this topic in this throwaway account. Fired last week from my first job out of college, a paid internship originally set for 6 months. I made some mistakes, tried to work on my weak spots, but didn't figure it out fast enough, and was let go somewhat unexpectedly. I'm not sure how to go about explaining this (or if I even should) to future employers. I've applied for lots of jobs over the last week, and I've found one that fits exactly what I want to do with a company I interviewed with before I took the internship I was terminated from (turned them down because a) they wanted an in-person interview and I wasn't relocated yet as I was finishing school and b) it was for a temp spot that was even shorter than the 6 months my internship was supposed to be). It's seriously the perfect position for me, and I have tons of experience in that area and have reached out to the woman who interviewed me before, so I want to make sure that if I'm given a shot, I don't mess it up.

Here's some of the advice I've been given so far, some Reddit-sourced, some from the web, some from friends:
-say it was an internship, and it ended.
-say I was let go, I learned from my mistakes and hope for the best.
-if they don't ask, don't say anything (what I'm hoping for)
-I have another PT position in another field entirely and I start in a few weeks, but it's not enough to pay the bills/fill my time. Some have suggested saying I currently am employed with that, and not mentioning the internship except for on my resume
-taking it off my resume entirely (which doesn't work: a simple google of my name pulls up EVERYTHING I did for that internship, and it's the FIRST result. Plus I did some good work there and I want to use it)

I've also heard not to worry about future employers calling my old job about references because they have to stay within certain legal parameters and usually only confirm job title and dates of employment. Others have said they can ask about termination. I'd love to hear from a lawyer/HR manager about which is the truth/other possibilities (I'm in cali, for legal reference).

Reddit, I'm not a mistake-prone person and this is all foreign to me. I'm pretty lost in all of this and go back and forth between thinking everything will be ok to moments of incredible doubt about my skills and which jobs I'm actually qualified for now that I've been terminated. I've never been fired from anything before. In fact, I was promoted in my on-campus job during college three times, until I was top dog. I've received glowing rec's everywhere I've been/worked/interned before. I know I really fucked this one up and I'm really disappointed in myself. I just want, to put it metaphorically and dramatically, rise from the ashes and come back swinging.

TLDR; Fired from my internship, applying for new jobs in the same field, need advice on how to handle interviews/the depression&amp;disappointment that comes with being fired, particularly from an internship.

**EDIT:** I was fired the same week I signed a 1-year lease on an apartment with my BF. Level of shittyness: expert.

***EDIT 2*** I found a job! Thanks for everyone that provided advice. I'm super grateful for it. Happy to say, the ""why I left my last job"" question never came up (probably to do that handy little ""intern"" in my previous title. I've been working for a week at my two new jobs, both in my field, and I'm loving every minute! I'm definitely not religious, but I think karma works outside of Reddit too. If I hadn't of been fired, I wouldn't have found these two fantastic jobs (doing the same thing, for two different people) where I'm not only paid more, I enjoy it more. I definitely learned from the experience and I'm humbled to say it's made me a better employee. I know that mistakes can happen, and that they WILL happen at some point (nobody is perfect, especially me), but that I will give 110%, even when I don't want to, to try to prevent any mistakes. Things are really looking up :]

I live on a border town in Mexico, so I've grown up ""living"" in Mex/USA. Even tough I was born in the US, I've lived all my life in Mexico and I've never worked in the US before. My college degree is Mexican too (Computer Science)

Graduated on Dec '11. After a really bad internship and social work (required by the school) I set out to get a job. To my surprise it took me 9 months (Aug '12) to get an internship (not even a real job!) at a big-name company here in Mexico. Whenever I looked up jobs in the US I only came up with retail or jobs that required experience or knowledge I didn't have. 

Fast-forward today, my internship is almost done (Nov 1st) and my supervisor just told me that I might get a one month extension on my internship, but couldn't tell me if I would get a full time position after that. Today, my boyfriend also told me that I could get an entry-job on the place he is working at,  doing high school level coding. It's also holiday season, so I know getting a job (USA) in retail wouldn't (shouldn't!) be that hard.

My question is:

1) Should I ditch the big-name company or stay with them one more month hoping to get a full-time position? The full-time positions are well payed, and have tons of benefits. 

2) Should I take the entry-level job with the company my boyfriend works at? I would make a little more than what I'm making right now, it's closer than big-name company and supposedly there's a chance to get a better payed position in the future. 

or

3) Cross the border every day and get a job at retail (USA) to make it trough the holidays. I would make more money than the average manager in Mexico and might get some cash to get a car (which might help me get jobs in the US)

Other info: Live with parents, have some monthly payments (phone, internet, gym bills)

I typed this up in Notepad and copy+pasted it over.  Didn't have internet access when I type this up!)	

Hi guys. Been a long time lurker and finally decided to jump in.  Lots of posts I read really help me out, and I appreciate all you guys
	around here and giving the younger folk some good wisdom.

	Perhaps this may be one of the many ""help im an engineering student and i feel like i failz""  
	But currently, things seem dark to me and I can't help but think this way.

	I am an EE major in a school reputable for their internship program.  I finished my Freshman year on June 2012 and am currently attending
	my internship job.  My freshman year was pretty shitty, and I feel like I did less than mediocore.  I know (or do I?) I could've done better... but my
	high-school habits have finally revealed it's ugly and destructive effects.   I really discovered 
	my personality and characterstics.  I learned I'm horrible at realizing what's important and what's not.  For instance, it's Monday night
	and you have an exam on Wednesday.  I would've somehow found myself at a friends house being completely unproductive.  ANd come exam-time,
	I'll be cursing myself and promising myself I'll never make a similar mistake, only I'll repeat the same habit over and over again.

	Another huge topic focuses on being an EE major.  ONe of my freshman projects involved using the LEGO NXT Kit and creating a robot with
	the lego parts, programming it (using the Lego Nxt specific compiler), and hoping your robot follows at least half the tasks the prompt
	asks you to do.  I saw many outstanding EE students, somehow hacking their way and using C++ to program the robot to perform tasks much
	more complicated than what the Lego NXT compiler can actually do.  OUtside of that, I see EE students involved with other projects,
	using resistors to OP amps like second nature, where I barely understood Ohm's Law.

	It was not only the Lego NXT project, but various others that led me to believe, ""Did I choose the wrong major?""  Surely I'm interested,
	and I've learned the basic-of-the-basics, but I just feel so underprepared, and so unworthy of all the other EE students out there
	who entered the major with loads more of background information, history, and projects.  I just feel like I can't keep up some how.

	========

	My internship I'm currently in also seems very very dark and hopeless for me.  I was ecstatic that they hired me, because it was my first choice
	place I wanted to intern at. They do projects involving motor control to actuators, to programming them, and producing magic. I love being in the environment
	everyday, yet I feel extremely ashamed as the days go by.  The longer I stay, the more I feel like I'm being revealed, that somehow I over exagerrated during my interviews
	and now my boss really knows the unknowledgeable person I really am.  Somehow I fooled my boss and now I'm sure he regrets the choice.
	Personally I'm an extremely shy and unconfident person, (except around friends/family) so 
	being the absolute useless noob makes me believe I'm just not cut out to be the engineer I'm aspiring to be.  It just mkes me feel worse and worse overall.

	I'm scared to lift my head to the other engineers around my lab and ask some questions in fear that I'll be revealed even more.

	I know I know.  I'm just a Freshman. But still, an EE student should still have decent abilities, like reading a schematic, and making sure a circuit works.


	I have no belief in myself. I'm also taking an online Math class because I dropped out of Multi.Var.Calc during my Freshman year and now I have to make it up. That SINGLe
	class itself is leaving my struggling.  I just don't know how to juggle it all... 
	
	Not afraid for harsh criticm. I""m just seeking some truth and wisdom...
	Thanks for any future feedback guys. Glad to finally join the boat.

I am currently working as a software analyst as part of an internship.  Due to some odd circumstance, being my yearly limit of allowable hours as an intern being reached, all of my credentials had to be deleted and then were rebuilt when I started work again a week later.  The software I work on is behind some serious security features so building an account like this takes coordination between several teams and involves a lot of small steps.  

I was starting to get frustrated because I still don't have some of my credentials/rights/permissions set up, even though I've been back for four months.  Just two days ago I get an email from my boss stating that IT had contacted him to let him know that their mail filter tosses out all emails with ""RE:"" in the title.  This means that every time a tech contacted me over four months to ask if the problems were resolved, my response was trashed by their filter.

TL;DR -- My IT department set up the silliest filter I've ever seen."

My dad built my computer a little over 3 years ago. I've noticed that the game I've really gotten into (Vindictus) lags a bunch even on mid-highest settings (I refuse to turn them down). I know I'm due for some sort of an upgrade but he won't supply me with the money to build a whole new computer and I'm already busy with school and an internship and can't juggle a job on top. I'm guessing that he'd be up for paying about $300 per part but the catch is that I can only get each part 1 at a time. So maybe a new graphics card now, a new CPU some other day, etc. He says he would have to buy them all at once because everything is so out dated that none of it would be compatible. If I'm able, I'd like to keep the new parts compatible with old parts so I can upgrade one item at a time otherwise anything I'd be able to get would be way below my current specs because he likes to be a cheapass.

It is unfortunately sitting directly in front of a heater which I can't change (no room for my desk or the computer anywhere else in the room... unfortunately placed windows) so it will have to stay like this.

I'm happy with my monitors, mouse and keyboard so I guess the only things I really would have to change would be CPU, GPU and... motherboard? I don't know, I don't know much about this stuff, just what I picked up from him when he was building it. I hope this is the right place to post this. "

I am currently a CS major, projected to graduate in Fall of 2013, and I'm a bit broke, so I'm looking for work during the semester.

I happen to attend a university with a great career center for their technical majors.  They host a large job fair twice a year, and e-mail us almost weekly with at least one position at a local company targeted for students in technical majors from our university.

**Company A**: I have worked a summer internship with company A for the past 4 summers.  I really like company A.  I know everyone there, they pay well, and they want to hire me when I graduate.  Unfortunately, company A is an hour and 20 minute drive away from where I live, and I've been subletting an apartment every summer to work there.  This is why I want to find something during the semester, and *possibly* during the summer in the city where I do live.

**The Problem**: While there are many job offers for companies in the city I live in, most companies are looking for interns during the semester, who can then slide right into a full time position upon graduating a semester or two later.  My suspicion is that they see 4 years with one company on my resume, and they assume I'm not a candidate for hire upon graduation.  And to be honest, they're probably right.

It's not even that I'll definitely go with company A, it's that I want to spend a significant amount of time checking out all of my options when I graduate.  I have more experience than most of my peers, so I'm not going to waste that by just going with the company whom I happen to have worked for most recently.

**The Actual Question**: My question, I guess, is how do I convince these people to hire me for a mid-semester internship without giving off the idea that I'm going to cut and run as soon as something better comes along?  Because I most definitely will do that.

EDIT: The quote from the title is from an actual job description at a local company."
11mp4y,0,2012-10-17,Does anyone have input about interning with large vs. small companies? (x-post from r/EngineeringStudents),[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/11mp4y/does_anyone_have_input_about_interning_with_large/,"I am considering offers from two companies (A and B), and would like to hear what anyone has to say about working with large or small companies. That's the primary difference between them, because:

* They do the same type of work (related to national security)

* They are located in the same area

* I don't want to choose based on money unless it's really dead even otherwise (company fit is more important.) That said, the large company (Company B) did offer about $6/hour more and a week of vacation.

For what it's worth, the small company (Company A) is ~30 people, has been very successful thus far, and is growing quickly. The large company is &gt;1000 people and is a subsidiary of a &gt;100,000 person company.

Other information influencing my decision:

* I visited Company A and it seemed like a great fit (but B could be as well for all I know - I interviewed with the guy I whose team I would join and he seemed like a good person to work for.)

* About 20 out of the 30 people from Company A came from Company B because they had issues with its growth and acquisition by the super large company. That said, most also joined when Company B was 100 people, so they are 'small-company people.'

* Company B could provide opportunity to move geographically in the future if I end up with them.

* Company A would provide stock options if I end up with them.

It's hard to ignore the money difference since it adds up to &gt;$2000 for the summer and I'm paying for school through scholarships, my own savings, and loans. However I don't want to decide based on that. Is it kosher to try to negotiate with Company A to see if they could raise their offer? Also, what else should I take into account while deciding?
Thanks for reading and for any input!

**TL;DR:** Should I intern with a tiny company or a large one? I'm torn and have seven days to decide.

EDIT: I've decided to go with the small company! It's hard to turn down an extra several dollars per hour, but I was leaning toward the small company before money became an issue, and I don't want to let that sway my decision. Thanks for all the input!"

Statistics, computer building samples and extrapolating data itself, stuff like that.)

To the question!

I've been told I should try to get an internship with Google (and Microsoft, and the other big names - but mostly Google), and I really like the idea (it seems *entirely* consistent with what I support!), but I don't even have a resume. I've *never* built a resume of *any* sort. There are also no resources for computer science majors on my campus; from all I've heard, the careers desk doesn't know a thing about helping our type.

I also don't have any money. My parents have no financial stability, and the only thing they can offer me is a place to sleep. I max out my federal loans and pay a little more out of pocket just to cover tuition. I don't own a car. I cannot feasibly visit the Googleplex until I save up a goodly amount of my workstudy funds, or *maybe* if I ask my half-grandfather for money, but there are a few medical problems with that idea.

First I'll introduce myself. I'm from Barcelona, 30, and will be -again- unemployed at the end of this current month (october). You probably know how things are fucked up here and since I've always had an adventurer spirit, I'd like to go abroad to see if I can build up some kind of ""future"" for myself, as ""future"" itself has become an unbearable thing to plan here where I live.

I have a degree (media =&gt; TV &amp; cinema) and years of experience in many fields. When I was a high school and uni student I worked as a waiter, warehouse worker, clerk, intern, computer repairing... When I got my degree I have been working in a TV station as a 'guy for everything' (such as CCU control, autocue operator, video editor), then as cameraman, photographer, web developer, motion graphic designer and a lot of many temporary works that take long time as it's usual on this field. CON: I'm not fully experienced on anything. PRO: Fast learning, hard work and good results on any subject.

My last work on the last six months has being as a check-in agent in Barcelona Airport. I've been able to save about €2000 for my chance abroad. (That's about £1500, yay, tight budget).

I've read lots of others' experiences on the UK. How to get a NIN, how to open a bank account, how to find somewhere to live, etcetera. But it's the experience of others and things take other directions when you try by yourself. I really don't want to go abroad as I'm sticked too mcuh to my country but the situation forced me to: no opportunities. No chance, no future. Then let's try elsewhere. Now what to do?

· I've read lots of people commenting and saying London is an expensive place to go. Some buddies told me to try Scotland. My own life experiences bring me to Bristol and Bath (got an ex-bf there). What about Midlands? Scotland? Wales? Pros and cons are more than welcome.

· I know I have to start from zero. Not a big deal, just a bit afraid from rolling dice. I'm able to adapt on any field, but I'd like to work on something my degree can help. Anyway I'll be happy cleaning dishes for a while whilst I find something that suits more my profile.

· I know as well this question may be asked thousands of times but I'd really like to hear some opinions, backup, anything. 

Well, I'd like to hear some comments about this. 

Cheers.

**TL;DR:** Spaniard graduated 2 years ago. No luck, just non skilled or unpaid jobs. Want to try going abroad. UK is my target. Have some HTML, CSS, PHP notions. Some graphic design notions as well. I can handle pro-grade cameras, editing in RT and NLE platforms and do some motion graphics. Any chance?"

Long story short, I chose to major in political science against my own desires because of my parents wishes. They wanted me to become a lawyer, and told me I should major in political science in order to go to law school. I was the first person in my family to go to college (parents were immigrants who didn't complete high school), and so I didn't have any mentors or people who could give me advice on majors or career fields. It wasn't what I wanted to do, but I stuck with it. My senior year though, I finished the major courses early so I took other classes I felt were fun such as CS courses. I had taken the LSAT and gotten ready to apply to law school, but I decided that it just wasn't prudent to bring myself further into debt for a career that I knew I was going to hate. I fought with my parents, and got them to see things my way. Except now I was stuck with a degree that had no utility for the kind of work I wanted to do. Most of my internships and experience were political science related. 

I'm having a hard time finding a job, so I've started to slowly teach myself more programming through various online resources in my spare time. But I talked to a friend, and he suggested that I just take a few courses at a local community college and apply for a Masters program in CS. It seems like a good idea, but I wanted to get more people's opinion. Is it common/possible for someone like me with a minimal background in CS to obtain a MS in CS?

As would be expected after an evening of such excess,  my mind found itself slowly reassembling the night’s events with terrible difficulty.   I decided to start at the beginning because my memory was draped in the heavy fog  of a mountaintop sunrise.
 
Yesterday began as so many days do, with an alarm, a tap of the snooze button, a warm morning cuddle with my sweet man, Ryan, and finally, a reluctant ramble to the shower to wash away the last of lingering sleep.   As I stepped over the clawfoot tub to reach for a towel, Ryan came into the bathroom, grabbed me, pressed my body, face first, into the wall and began to rub his crowing cock against my hind end.  This was an unusually gruff gesture on his part, but we had not seen much of one another lately;  the time we did spend together was dedicated almost entirely to sleeping or studying.  We are both interns in our third year of residency, and our sex life had consequently suffered.  I was late but also much too physically unrequited to stop him.  His mouth pressed to my neck and, my hands groping at the wall, we fell into rhythm with one another.  I gasped, moaned and found myself exploding with pleasure in moments.  As my eyes refocused I saw that my legs and the basin of the tub were decorated with carmine rivulets of blood  but abstained from commenting;  we were long overdue and I was not going to stop a much needed fix simply because my period had arrived at a most inopportune moment.

“You’re bleeding.”

Ryan rasped with a tinge of excitement and his thrusting grew in urgency.  I began to ache in my lower abdomen until sharp pains began to accompany each inward stroke.  I wanted him to finish and tried to stick it out.  His hand was pushing my head into the wall and downward, I could see that  his movements were so  harsh that the blood began to spatter in grotesque protest against the wall and the shower curtain.  The measure of Ryan’s breathing changed, deepened and slowed in awkward  and unexpected juxtaposition to his evermore frantic and quickening  plunges.  His elbow was now jabbing my spine and my cheekbone was smacking against the wall each time he pressed against me.  I began to feel fear.  My eyes wetted and I could not make myself want him anymore.

“Ryan. You’re hurting me, please stop for a second…”

“You’re bleeding.”

Only this time the words were spoken in an ominous tone and, strangely, echoed.  Ryan’s voice was heavy and inhuman – too deep to come from a man’s lungs and voicebox – those vibrations just don’t happen without a more resonant instrument.  His left hand moved to my neck.  I instinctively arched away from his tracheal compression and my neck found itself in his mouth.  

“Ryan…”  

It was a plea delivered as a hoarse squeak.  He bit my trapezius as if tearing into a steak when ravenously hungry and I knew from the sudden rush of heat that he had cleaved the skin.  I was becoming disoriented and oxygen deprived, my vision became filled with the bright floating lights of brain death.  I could no longer hold myself up, much less struggle against him.  Just before my asphyxiated body succumbed to sleep, he turned me toward him, allowing me to gasp.  My throat felt jagged and the intake of air was painful, as if each molecule were slicing my windpipe.  The lights on my eyelids danced away, jubilant to escape I am sure, and I saw him.  His mouth was rimmed in blood.  MY blood. His lips were set in a malignant smile.  His skin was so pale he appeared dead and his eyes were no longer the gray blue peepers that reminded of beach days in Maine but instead, vacuous caves, wet, too large and greedy.  He breathed on my mouth and I realized I was tasting the smell of my own flesh.  He grasped me by the throat again and I blacked out with a mind void of any thought except acknowledgement that my death was imminent. 
 
And now it’s tomorrow.

I am taking a year off of college because I got a shoplifting charge (monumental lack of judgement; case is settled; spent a week in jail) and my parents told me either take a year off and deal with myself or pay for college myself. After working a bad job for the summer and living in a flooding, mold-infested apartment alone, I developed a bit of a drinking problem for 2 months, but I have been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist to help deal with it as well as being sober since mid-August. I am currently not drinking. I was also recently diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and I have been dealing with depression for the past 4 years. Two weekends ago, I told my mother I would drink 1 beer at a wedding we were attending (stupid, I knew I would drink more but was planning on doing it surreptitiously) and got caught having a rum and coke (Drink #2). The weekend after, I had a panic attack in a large group of people and I took 3 hits off a bowl to calm down (didn't really work). She caught the smell on me when I came home. Tonight, she patted my pockets down because she said I looked high (was stone cold sober) and found two Vyvance I had in my pocket from a friend. I am driving 6 hours to go camping on Saturday and need help staying awake; a friend offered to give me two for free so I didn't have to spend more money on caffeine (I'm very broke.) I have an internship that starts in a month at a medical school (I am studying computer science) so it's not like I have no ambition or am not trying to better myself. Now they are threatening to kick me out of the house and cut me off permanently, Reddit, what should I do?

**TL;DR:** Had a slight drinking problem but am getting help. Parents caught me with 2 vyvance tonight, last weekend I told them I smoked once, had 2 drinks at a wedding where I told them I would only have one, now my parents are either going to send me to rehab or cut me off permanently. Help!"

I don't love it.  

I'm seriously considering trying to get a spring or summer programming-related internship.  This is somewhat complicated by the fact that unlike with my present internship, I'd be likely to face an applicant pool significantly larger than one, and not only do I not have much coding experience, I'm not even a CS major, and it's too late to change that.  

What I have is a planned stats major/CS minor, two R-heavy stats courses, and one intro Java course under my belt.  That, and a few months of evenings/weekends.  Right now, I've got a personal project in the form of a stats calculator in the works that I hope to turn into an android app.  Besides that, what should I look into in terms of making myself marketable as an intern?

If you haven't read any of Alan's story, the first part can be found [here](http://redd.it/11fshn) and the second part is [here](http://redd.it/11lxnr).

I walked into Alan's room late yesterday night, since he's the last patient I see when i make my final rounds, to discover him already asleep. That's very not like him, as you all know; not only does he talk to me a lot, but he also can't effectively sleep without medication. I checked the machines, and sure enough, the meds had been administered. Three hours early. I shook my head and sighed; the intern we had recently hired must have messed up. Again. He didn't do anything right, but he was new, and he started only about a week ago, so I was willing to cut him some slack. His name is Eric, for our purposes here.

Well, I cleaned up the room; there were a couple of things on the ground, when I noticed something rather odd. A rubber glove, a blue rubber glove. That's odd, I thought. We must have gotten a new stock of gloves or something; the ones we use are the stereotypical white ones. I picked up the glove, and gasped.

Blood.

My mind reeled back to what Alan had been talking about. ""...he was fired for stealing used medical supplies"" sticks out the most. Gloves. Oh god. He's been in Alan's room. I looked at my desk, which had this laptop on it but the desk is no longer here; it was taken as evidence. Now, don't get me wrong; I still put no stock in hypnosis, but this one seemed to calm Alan down a bit, plus the relation was a bit uncanny. So yeah, maybe it had worked.

There were small blood droplets leading from the glove to my desk. How had I not seen those earlier today? I tentatively walked over and opened the drawer, and lost it.

There was a finger in my desk. On top of a small note, that read:
""Remember Dennis?""

I'd like to say it ended there, but no. Under that piece of paper was another, with the same handwriting. The only reason the police even showed it to me was because it had my name on it. I wish he hadn't showed it to me. I really do. It was a simple note, like its companion, but far, far worse.

""Alan never told you, did he? I used to work with his father, Alyssa. And now I work with you.""

I immediately told them everything I knew about Eric. Everything. it had to be him, how could it not be him? He never visited Alan when he was awake. Never spoke to him. But was always there during Alan's chemically induced sleep. Cleaning up, paying careful attention, but screwing things up; misplacing things, which I assume he was actually just plain stealing, forgetting when certain medications were administered, things like that. But he paid careful care to Alan, above his other patients.

But why didn't he kill him?
Or me?

Maybe that's the point, I tell myself. Maybe he doesn't feel it's time yet. Maybe he really doesn't want to kill. Wants more long-term effects. Surely he got what he wanted, then, with regard to Alan. But if I'm next, well...

I'm not too sure why I decided to come to work today. My boss told me I could have a few days off, because of what happened. I guess I just don't want to spend any of my time alone. He also said that Eric was fired. Big surprise there.

I had a hard time sleeping yesterday, if you can believe that. He mentioned me specifically, but why? Am I next? Is there a next? No, no. He's just trying to freak me out, I tell myself. He doesn't even know where I live. How could he? Has he been following me? I haven't been paying close attention to that.

Of course, I know better than to doubt that.

I also haven't told Alan. I don't think I will, either. I don't want to worry him, worsen his condition if it would come to that. I also don't know what I would tell him. I can't do it.

I won't sleep for a while, I know that much. But I'm ready to defend myself, I just don't think it would be enough."

Any tips?",Kreeker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11q18a/electrical_engineer_with_goal_to_get_a_job_at/,"I'm currently a Quality Engineer at large A/V &amp; automation company. I like the company &amp; the people I work with, but I'm looking for something more challenging, and interesting. This leads me to want to work for a company like Google, but I need some information on how to get there.

Some history about myself:

* Went with EE over CE because I was under the impression that there were no jobs for CE's due to outsourcing &amp; other factors. The problem is every field is having trouble, so I should have just went with CE...

* Graduated Magna Cum Laude from non-ivy school with EE degree in 2011

* Did 0 internships during school (was under the impression that my good grades would carry me to victory. Boy was I wrong; get internships kids)* 

* Started applying for jobs (specifically in the defense industry) ***AFTER*** I graduated in 2011. I only received 1 response, but really didn't spam out resumes too hard.

* Ended up taking an off the books job with a local old guy doing IT Support work &amp; work around his house

* Almost a year after graduating, a recruiter from my current company contacted me after seeing my resume on careerbuilder. Went for my ***FIRST*** interview ever, and got an offer the next day. I only make 50k, but it's a lot more than I was making before

Basically the bottom line is enjoy CS/CE concepts (programming, hardware), a lot more than EE concepts. So my goal is to shift into a developer role. The problem is I don't have much programming experience (some c++ &amp; vhdl) at all during college, so I'm looking to figure out how I can make this transition smoothly &amp; efficiently.

Some of the questions I'm looking to get answered:

* What can I do on my own time to make this happen?

* What books / instructional material should I invest in?

* What should I get my Masters in? CE? CS? SE?

* What do I need to do to make myself look good for Google, Intel, etc.?

* Should I give up on trying for these high-end companies? Am I already too far behind?

* Any other career choices? Maybe Network Administrator? Hardware Engineer?


Any other tips, suggestions you guys have I would really appreciate!

[What's the real process for getting yourself on the map to make films like this? Your movie looks like the ones I want to make and I wonder about the inception of this kind of career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0rf9?context=5)|Okay, so what I did can be totally repeated.  If anyone out there aspires to make these kinds of films, I cannot stress enough, IT IS POSSIBLE.  I'm proof of that.
 |I went to film school, here in Southern California.  Spent way too much money on my senior film.  It played zero film festivals.
 |When I graduated, I had a normal desk job.  But continued to make short films on nights and weekends.  How I worked it-- I knew people in the theatre program at my school.  If any actor came to me with even the smallest budget (even $50), I would write and direct something for them to put on their reel.
 |I made a lot of very mediocre short films that way, but I was working constantly.  No lie-- I probably made about 25-30 short films after college.
 |Some of my collaborators and I decided we wanted to make a feature.  That it was time.  This rich real estate guy from Arizona had contacted us-- he was going to pay for a horror film.  We wrote and wrote and wrote and eventually came up with a script we really liked.
 |For my job, I was in Utah at a screenwriting workshop (I made copies, and made the coffee), and I was in the back of the room when Stewart Stern spoke.  He wrote Rebel Without A Cause.
 |I remember him very clearly, he said that filmmaking is a real gift.  It's a gift to you and a gift to your audience.  Make sure you have something to say.
 |In that moment I realized that all the work I had created up to that point were merely filmaking exercises.  They weren't ""me.""
 |So when I got back, I told my collaborators this, we threw out the script, and decided that we'd rather make something for no money, than make the wrong movie.  We looked at the resources around us, and on nights and weekends slowly cobbled together our first film.  We shot all the scenes that were ""free"" first, and then raised the little bit of money we needed to finish the film through a generous friend of a friend (30K).
 |In the end, I got very lucky in that the film was accepted into Sundance.  We did a small self-release of the film, and it played other festivals.  I learned a ton.
 |At that point I got involved with Save the Date.  I had read an early draft of the script to Save the Date years earlier, simply because I was a huge huge fan of one of the writers, Jeffrey Brown (you might know him for his graphic novels, including his latest one ""Darth Vader and Son""). I had heard that the director had dropped out, so I just sent a cold email to the producer telling him how huge of a fan I was.
 |Jordan was at Sundance that year with the film The Kids Are All Right. We met up and hit it off, and they all gave me permission to go run with the script.
 |At the time, I had a day job making video content for a record label.  They started giving me actual videos, and so I was able to work on a slightly bigger scale.  All the while writing Save the Date.
 |That job ended (apparently people download music illegally off the internet?) and I then went home to my parents' house in rural Massachusetts, and devoted all my time to working on the script. I had nothing else going on. I vowed to not return to Los Angeles until the script was done. My parents don't have wi-fi, which does wonders for productivity!
 |A few weeks later, I had a decent draft in hand.  But my feature didn't speak to the abilities that I had learned through music videos.  I then made a really low budget short film, was lucky enough to return to Sundance with that.  At the time, The Kids Are All Right had had been nominated for Oscars. Now that the script was done, the timing simply couldn't have been better.
 |So based on that, we were able to get the momentum to get the script in the hands of these actors, some other producers jumped on board, and the money showed up shortly thereafter.
 |The key to all of this is to Just Keep Working.  Don't worry about any of the industry stuff.  They'll eventually chase you.  Opportunities will open up.  But more importantly-- keep it personal.  If any of these films didn't find an audience, I'll sleep well at night knowing that I made them for all the right reasons.
 |But lord knows, if I can do this, you can do it too.
[Are any of these shorts available online?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1sfl?context=5)|The shorts are not, but my first feature can be streamed [for free on hulu](http://www.hulu.com/onetoomanymornings).
[Hi. Thanks for doing an AMA. I just watched the trailer and this film feels like a throwback to indie romantic comedies from 10 maybe even 15 years ago (which is not a bad thing\). Was this intentional? How are you facing the challenge of marketing a movie like this without some sort of ""high concept?"" Is it leaning more heavily on your cast? Was this an obstacle you faced in just getting the movie made at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1am5?context=5)|Absolutely.  To me, I think most modern romantic comedies are so dumb.  They feature characters I can't relate to doing things I'd never do.  And the guys always look like the kinds of guys that would beat me up in high school.
 |So while we weren't trying to make a ""throwback"" film, we definitely wanted the film to have the same honesty as films like Singles or Reality Bites.
 |As for marketing the film, my hope is that this honesty will come through, and the word of mouth will carry it.  And these actors!  I mean, even if I didn't direct this movie, I would kill to see a movie with all five of these people as the leads.  They are SO GOOD in the film too.
 |Surprisingly though, we didn't have any huge challenges in getting the movie made, but I also was very lucky to have such good producers at the helm.  They really protected it to make sure we could make the film we wanted to make.
[I swear this is true story. I went to a high school in LA and you crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton\). You ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanne. You didn't call her afterwards. She cried a lot. Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you been so knee deep in hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip? /I'm not kidding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2pxl?context=5)|This is the most incredible question I have ever been asked in my entire life.
 |A. I grew up in Massachusetts, so there's no chance I was at your prom afterparty.
 |B. Even then, I did not go to my prom, but instead went to the mall movie theatre to see the movie DEEP IMPACT with the rest of the nerds.
 |Thank you for your interest in Save The Date.
[This is a joke. That was a question asked to Woody Harrelson during his AMA. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p3tid?context=5)|Whoosh.
[If there was a zombie outbreak, what would be your zombie plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1drs?context=5)|I am a wuss.  I would not only join the zombies as fast as possible, I would try to find a zombie baby who doesn't have quite fully developed teeth yet, so the bite wouldn't hurt as much.
[Can you tell NBC to quit being so fucking stupid and let community come back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2800?context=5)|SERIOUSLY.
[*Alison Brie.*  To the frontage you go! On a more serious note, what is your favorite type of scene to direct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0w9o?context=5)|To me, there's nothing more satisfying than showing two people fall in love, or two people fall out of love.  I can't get enough of that.  Seriously.  Anything where the actors have to be as vulnerable as possible.
[How do you film sex scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1foj?context=5)|Lots and lots of booze.  Just kidding--
 |First thing's first-- you have to make sure that the actors are super comfortable with each other.
 |With Save the Date, I always wanted Mark Webber to play the role he plays.  But I didn't want to cast that role until I knew Lizzy was in.  Just because I wanted her to have a say in it.
 |When we finally met, one of the first things Lizzy said was ""Who's playing this one character, and have you considered Mark Webber?""  I knew then we wouldn't have a problem.
 |For a short I did the year prior there was a really intense sex scene, and I actually had brought the actress I cast into the auditions with all the male candidates.  That way she could weigh in on it, and help make that decision with us.
 |Then, prior to shooting, you have to have a real nuts and bolts chat with the actors beforehand.  With the short film, I went into detail ""we will be doing two shots where we see your left nipple"" etc.  That way everyone knows.  There are no surprises.  And everyone can trust each other.
 |Then in rehearsal, I think it's almost akin to choreographing a dance.  Just showing where each person is going to be.  And with shooting-- honestly, usually the first take is right on the money.  Sometimes a thrust might not be obvious enough, so you have to make them thrust a little bit more exaggeratedly, so it reads on camera.
[That's really interesting. How these guys do not get erections when having fake sex with half naked beautiful actresses is the real question... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p237z?context=5)|Because they're surrounded by dudes.  All of which are staring at them.
[Where did you get your start filmmaking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0su7?context=5)|When I was in college, I went to a school called Chapman University, down in Orange County. They would do a lot of test screenings of films down there, because it was a little bit further out, and there'd be less ""industry types"" there.
 |I was walking around school and got an invitation to see a test screening of a film called Super Troopers. Now, nobody had ever heard of this film and based on the title, it sounded like something from ABBA. Or a kids film.
 |I went home and saw that it had played Sundance, and that Fox Searchlight was releasing it, so I decided to go. I had no industry connections at the time, and really needed an internship. Searchlight was kind of the perfect place to be because they were releasing the kinds of films I had hoped to eventually make.
 |So I got to the theatre early, hoping that I'd be able to talk to someone about applying for an internship. Maybe I could get into one of their focus groups. No luck.
 |The film played, it was hilarious, and on my way out they handed out flyers that said ""if you have any more comments about Super Troopers, email them to so and so.""
 |I now had an email address, so I stayed up all night writing like this massive massive email to this random person at Fox all about how great the film was, and how it could be better, and how they should release it. I was like super confident in the email even though I had no idea what the fuck I was saying.
 |Oddly enough, one of the things I suggested was to have them re-shoot the ending to bring back Geoffrey Arend's character (he's the guy at the beginning that famously says ""the snozzberries taste like snozzberries"").
 |At the bottom of the email I wrote, ""...And by the way, I'm a film student who snuck into your screening, and it is in your best interest to call me tomorrow to offer me an internship.""
 |I went off to class (this was 2000, so I didn't have a cell phone), and when I got home, my roommate was like ""Dude, three people from Fox called you today."" I couldn't believe it.
 |Three weeks later I found myself wandering around the Fox lot. An executive had just started a new program to make short films and put them on the internet (pre-YouTube). Two weeks later, I had a job as her assistant, and I made the commute from Orange County to Los Angeles three days a week until I graduated and it turned full time.
 |Super Troopers came out (with a different ending), and many years later I found myself on set with Geoffrey Arend directing him in Save the Date.
[I love this! I hope you have a lot of success. I'm planning to go into movies too (acting, though, not directing\). How was working with these famous people when you are pretty much unknown (I hope that doesn't sound bad\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1k97?context=5)|Honestly, there is really no difference between working with an unknown actor and a known actor.  The known actor might have more experience, and therefore their instrument might be more fine-tuned.  But it's all the same: motivations, actions, goals.  The same language.
[Where/when can I see it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0x4q?context=5)|Right!  The film comes out on VOD November 8th, and in theatres on December 14th.
[When can we see it in Europe ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p74cj?context=5)|For people outside the US-- we are still in the process of presenting the movies to international distributors.  We do know the film will definitely be coming out in Australia and New Zealand, but do not have a date.
 |This is totally random, but if anyone lives in Wroclaw Poland-- I'll be there showing it there at the American Film Festival in just a few weeks.
[What is it like to premier a film? What goes through your head as the lights dim and the film fills out the screen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0wsn?context=5)|Nothing compares to it.  It is seriously seriously nerve-wracking.  In fact, the Sundance Channel followed me around before the premiere of Save the Date.  You can see me rehearsing what I was going to say in this little video here: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8TK8veYf7g)
 |Really, it's not until I hear the audience audibly laugh that I'm able to relax.  I don't know how directors of serious dramas do it.  Just wondering if people are having the correct emotional response.  At least for films with comedy, if you hear them laugh, you know the film's working.
[Do you have any hilarious stories you can share from the set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p15th?context=5)|So there was one night where we are shooting this really tender, sensitive slow dance scene between Geoffrey and Lizzy.  Just an all out romantic moment between the two of them.
 |We were shooting in a loft space in Downtown LA, which apparently was directly next door to a crack addict.  There were no doors or locks to this place, and he kept just wandering around set yelling ""IT'S GONNA GET LOUD.""
 |Eventually we're halfway through shooting the scene, and we start hearing some of the WORST SOUNDING electric guitar noise from the other side of the wall.  He had moved an amp right up against the adjoining wall, and basically made it his mission to ruin our scene.
 |One of our producers, Jordan Horowitz, just wanted to go over there and punch the guy in the face.  Figured with one good punch he could knock him out.  Instead, one of the other producers, Michael Roiff, went over there and talked calmly to the guy.  He of course wanted money that we did not have, but while Michael talked to him, we would shoot as much as possible.
 |At one point the man said that he wanted $500.  But that if someone got him a beer, it would go down to $400.  Michael offered to get him a full six pack.
 |Long story short, we got the scene.
[Awesome story! Not sure if it was asked (also, not sure if this is taboo to ask...\), but what was the budget for the film? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p496u?context=5)|Not taboo to ask, but I could get in trouble for saying.  What I will say is that we made it for a fraction of what you think it probably cost.
[What was it like working with Jeffrey Brown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p13fq?context=5)|So there's an amazing totally true story about working with Jeffrey Brown.
 |So back when I was getting married, I was looking to get the perfect wedding gift for my wife.  So I just wrote to the email address on the back cover of Jeffrey Brown's books.  I didn't know him at the time, but hoped he might draw something of us.  I had no idea if he'd even write back.
 |But he did!  And he drew something that was just super touching.  A moment from the middle of my wife and I's relationship.
 |Cut to the night before our wedding.  The rehearsal dinner.  I was SO excited to give my wife this gift.  And I noticed that her gift to me was the exact same size.
 |And we started opening our gifts-- it was crazy.  I saw Jeffrey's trademark black-on-white drawing peeking out from under the paper.  This is when we realized: the two of us, independent of each other, wrote to an artist WE DID NOT KNOW to commission him to draw us.
 |Her piece to me was from our first date.  So we called Jeffrey on our honeymoon, and he thought we might have been playing a prank on him.  But that since we paid him, he knew it wasn't.  We then asked him to draw a third work of us-- a meta piece-- documenting the moment where we were opening our gifts to each other.
 |But working with Jeffrey was amazing.  He's an amazing artist and an even better human being.  I have learned so much from our collaboration.
[If you could work with any actor/actress, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1dh4?context=5)|Honestly.  There are five: Lizzy Caplan, Alison Brie, Martin Starr, Geoffrey Arend, and Mark Webber.
 |Okay, maybe six: Dustin Hoffman.
[So tell me what are the biggest difficulty's a typical ""indie"" director has working with big blockbuster actors? with this i mean to ask if they don't take you as serious as they take a director that works or is associated with a big company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1ec5?context=5)|There was absolutely none.  Especially with these actors, I cannot stress enough how sweet they all are.  Also, I did have a lot of experience directing actors before-- I wasn't a first timer, and the language is exactly the same.
 |My biggest challenge was in my head.  I'm used to working on projects where everybody does a little bit of everything.  On my first film, there were moments where I'd be pushing the dolly and holding the boom mic at the same time.
 |So here, I remember in pre-production, I was asking my AD if I needed to go pick up bottled water for the crew.  She was like ""You don't do that anymore.  You just need to focus on directing.""
[Could you name a couple of your favorite films? Particularly those that  may have inspired your movie (and in what way\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0z6z?context=5)|For this particular film, Nicole Holofcener's WALKING AND TALKING was a huge influence.  Because it's not your typical romantic comedy, it's about people that actually feel like people.
 |REALITY BITES was another one.  Call me crazy, but I think that film totally holds up.  The characters actually feel like they're friends.
 |But visually, the film is shot in this super old school way.  A lot of scenes that are done in one shot.  ANNIE HALL was a big inspiration here too.
[What is it actually like to be a director of a film? Is it terrifying? Exciting? What does it involve and what parts of the process do you enjoy or hate the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1h9z?context=5)|I could write a book on this.  Is it terrifying?  Yes.  Is it exciting?  Absolutely.  It involves everything.
 |My line producer Nate Kelly said it best.  The production of a film is like a giant storm, but the director is in the eye of it.
 |I enjoy working with actors the most though.  That's really where it comes alive. 
[Were you always a director since your days at Chapman? Or did you dabble at first?  How did you fall into the hobby of filmmaking? Was it something you knew you wanted to do from the moment people started pressuring you to 'think of your future,' or did you try a few other things/hobbies out first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2fcy?context=5)|Always wanted to be a director, but when I was an undergrad, I learned all the various facets of filmmaking-- editing, shooting, sound design.  There are many days I wish that I did have some other desire, but this is all I can do.
[My apologies for what may seem like intimidating interest on my part. I'm a film production major hoping to get into NYU by next fall and I can't help wanting to learn from your experiences. =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2fcy?context=5)|As for the wife.  She's the most understanding woman on the planet.  Always there to bounce ideas off of, or to root me on.  She also has the exact same taste as me in movies, so that helps too.
[Who are some of the directors that inspire you?  What is a film genre you would like to delve into on a future project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p25ke?context=5)|I'm most inspired by the directors who tell stories that are personal to them, but who can still work in other genres.  Richard Linklater is a perfect example of this.  The fact he can make Before Sunrise and Dazed &amp; Confused, but then still bring a sense of heart to films like School of Rock.  That's exactly what I'm going for.
[Any release/event for LA in Decemeber? Would love to attend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p17ln?context=5)|We are still figuring this out, but if there is I will let you know!

[While this isn't necessarily your area of expertise, I'm hoping from being in the industry you can offer some advice. Would you say that it is harder to break out as a filmmaker or as an actor? I have been acting since I was a kid, and there is nothing I love more in life but it's never really gone anywhere. And now I'm at this point in my life where I have to decide what I want to do, and everything people have told me completely discourages me from being an actor. So do you think from what you've seen in the industry that this is probably true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1ex0?context=5)|I think acting is the hardest job on the planet.  It's hard work.  And it's even harder to get the work.  At least for me, I can direct whatever I want, whenever I want.  With a budget, or without a budget.
 |I have two pieces of advice for actors working today, and that's that you've really got to create your own work.  Get yourself a camera, even if it's a crappy one.  Learn iMovie, or whatever video editing software that came with your computer.  And start casting yourself in your own movies.  Put them on the internet.  Create the tools that allow people to discover you.
 |The second piece of advice is to involve yourself at the UCB Theatre.  In my opinion, I don't think there's a bigger and better hotbed of new talent than the people involved there. 
[Can you please pass onto Alison Brie that the whole internet wants her to do an AMA? Also, I personally would like to see one from Lizzy Caplan too, I'm a big fan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|I was talking to my producers today-- given the response today (I had no idea!) we are definitely going to approach all of our actors to see if they'd like to do AMA's.
[1\) Save The Date seems to have good reviews listed in the trailer, but only a 4.8 rating on IMDB. What do you think/feel about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|Bad reviews of any kind suck.  I honestly didn't expect the film to be as polarizing as it is.  The people who love it REALLY love it.  And the people who hate it seem to want me to crawl under a rock forever.  The film is what it is, and whenever I'm feeling down about it, [I read this review right here](http://badassdigest.com/2012/04/26/diff-movie-review-save-the-date-is-something-special/) and I feel totally better.
[2\) Were you at all inspired by 500 Days of Summer? That's the kind of vibe I got from the trailer, the kind of heartbreaking, untraditional but quirkily funny love story kinda thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|I really like 500 Days of Summer, specifically Geoffrey Arend's performance in that movie.  But it's totally different.  Our film is not at all quirky, it's actually quite grounded, and the style is more traditional.  But I do really enjoy that film.
[I'm not gonna go see your movie because the trailer made me want to cry because it reminds me of my ex haha, but it does look interesting, so good luck with it! I hope you make millions of dollars from it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|I hope I make millions of dollars too, but honestly, even if I made $10 that would still buy me a really sweet burrito and I would be happy.
[Are you the same guy that made the short film ""Salt""? Met you once through a mutual friend.  Congrats on the film, looks awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p4pr3?context=5)|WHOA.  ""Salt""?!?  You've seen SALT?
 |For people who don't know-- my very very very first film in film school was a documentary about salt.  That turned into an action film.  About a guy who was half man-half tripod.  It only exists on two vhs copies.  The fact that someone on here has even heard of it is mind-blowing.
[Hi, Michael. CONGRATS on getting your feature made with multiple ways of distribution!! Fellow SoCal indie vilmmaker here. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|For Save the Date, we shot on the Arri Alexa.  Primarily with a 25-250mm Angenieux (there are a lot of zooms in the movie), though we did use Ultra Primes for one day.
[Could you give any insight on the equipment you used for your feature? Full frame DSLR? Shot on Red? Film? Lenses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|I have no idea what our sound mixers used, but I'm pretty sure it was solid state.
[For audio do you/your sound recorders/mixers use solid state recorders or something different? Mix in ProTools?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|When I worked on the script-- I had Martin Starr in mind for that one role, but for the others, I wasn't thinking about specific actors.  Eventually I saw Party Down the same way most everyone saw it (in one long binge on Netflix) and was like-- Lizzy's it.
[Did you write with Lizzy in mind? If not, how did casting her come about if you didn't hold auditions? Was it a matter of someone who knows someone who knows Lizzy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|We were able to reach out to Lizzy through her agent and then through her manager.  There was actually one girl who was particularly helpful at her management company, who had been a fan of mine, and she's the one who really stood up for us by vouching for me.  And then we just met for beers and talked about the script.
[Last question - With much easier access these days to editing/post production and special effects programs (After Effects, Premiere, 3D Studio Max, etc\), how much, in your opinion, of an education do you think a modern day independent filmmaker needs to know about these types of programs, as opposed to hiring a freelancer or studio to do this kind of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|As for your last question, I think it is important for every filmmaker to know how to shoot and how to edit.  Save the Date was actually the first film in a long time that I didn't edit myself.  And if you're coming up in the no or low budget world, knowing how to edit is so clutch, just because you can make things happen faster.  You don't have to wait on someone else's schedule to put your movie together.  Most of my first feature film was edited at 2 in the morning in my bedroom-- it got done.
[Thanks for taking the time; I look forward to seeing Save the Date. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|Similarly, then when you start working with collaborators-- I think having a deeper understanding for their craft really helps you be able to communicate with them in a better way.  I remember working with our awesome sound guys on this (at House Blend sound-- seriously if you ever need post sound work-- use these guys!), and just talking about the ways in which we wanted to EQ the music to sound like it was actually coming out of the club speakers... it was great to be able to talk about it in a more specific way.
[What can you tell us about the soundtrack? All this talk about Singles has piqued my interest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1t9c?context=5)|Wilco, Minus the Bear, Daniel Hart, Giorgio Moroder, Houses, Charles Bradley, Nick Waterhouse, Arum Rae, Class Actress, The One AM Radio, The Dears, The Blue Hearts, Mika Miko, Friends.

[Hey! Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. As an aspiring director who just submitted his debut feature documentary to Sundance. In the obscenely unlikely scenario that we are selected, is there anything you would've done differently at you first Sundance premiere? Any big regrets? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p7dy1?context=5)|When my first film played Sundance, we had decided going in to the festival to self-release our film.  We had looked at all the other films that were made on our scale (30K with unknown faces) in recent years, and none of them had really come out.  So we built a website where people could buy the movie, we sold dvds, we did everything we could so that Sundance would be our big press push.
 |Looking back, I'll never know if this was the right decision.  Part of me thinks we should have waited until the end of the festival just to see if there was any interest from distributors.  Because ultimately, just putting the Sundance logo on your dvd cover doesn't necessarily mean that people are going to instantly buy it.  But given that it was a black and white comedic drama about a young alcoholic -nothing against the film- but the audience for that kind of film is also only so big.
[1.\) Do I need to move to LA to properly shop these?  2.\) Is it really a ""miracle"" that your movie got made? After watching a documentary on the guy who made ""Broken Kingdom"" showcase how difficult it was to make his movie, do you feel that you're part of some impossible to imagine project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1ygc?context=5)|As for whether or not you need to move to LA-- I can only speak from my own experience.  I moved here, and it worked out.  I don't think I'd have had the same opportunities anywhere else.  But that's not to say it's impossible.
 |I don't think it's a ""miracle"" that it got made.  That's a bit hyperbolic.  What I did, pretty much any human being can do-- it just takes time and energy and hard work and luck.
[So how did you end up working with Alison Brie? Have you seen her on community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1s63?context=5)|Absolutely.  Alison was the last person to come on board, simply because we needed to make sure Lizzy was locked in before finding someone that somewhat resembled them.  It all happened quite traditionally, we sent her the script-- I then skyped with her while she was in Michigan shooting Five Year Engagement.  And we really lucked out that our shoot was exactly between when Five Year wrapped, and when Community started.  There was this two week period that was free, that our shoot happened to coincide with.
[Two weeks to shoot a feature?? Did I read that correctly? Or was that all Allison was needed for?  Also, the trailer looks awesome - love Martin Starr &amp; Allison Brie. Congrats! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p47el?context=5)|We shot the whole film over 20 days.  But weaved our actors in and out depending on their schedules.  We lucked out with Geoffrey too, as he started work on the following season of Body Of Proof halfway through our shoot as well.  It was a puzzle, but the pieces fit miraculously perfectly.
[Do you work closely with the editor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p12v4?context=5)|The editor of the film, also a friend from college.  Christian Masini.  He actually makes a living as a trailer editor-- working on campaigns for Avatar and Green Lantern and such.
 |But for the five weeks we had to work on this thing, he and I would just sit next to each other in his apartment, and just keep going through the scenes over and over again.  Pretty much everyone on the crew was a personal friend of mine, and I think that makes it easier.
[Why did I feel so depressed after watching the trailer? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1x8d?context=5)|Because you have to wait three more weeks before the film comes out?  :)
[Thanks for doing this. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to be involved in films, and recently I've decided that I would like to pursue a career in film production. But I really have no idea how to break into the film industry. Any advice for someone aspiring to get involved? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1u6r?context=5)|I listed up above some of the stories from when I first started.  I think the best thing you can do is to just stop thinking about making movies and just Start Making Movies.  If you don't have an awesome camera-- that's totally fine.  Shoot on a flip cam if you have to.  Just start doing it.
[Do the archetypal ""casting couches"" exist in Hollywood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1bx0?context=5)|For the five leads, we didn't even audition them.  There was no need to.  You look at any of the performances these actors give in their prior films, and it's so full of nuance.
 |Lizzy and Alison especially.  Yeah, I know that most people are like ""what was it like working with two hotties"", but they are ACTORS with a capital A.  All of the characters they've created, from Mean Girls to Party Down to Community to Mad Men-- it's all so mannered, and they make such precise decisions.  It was really just so wonderful being able to work with such talented artists.
[Haha actually this isn't Joel, it's his roommate, but I loved the film and can't wait to see what you do next! In fact, do you have anything in the works? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p261d?context=5)|Thanks so much man.  Yes, I do, but I can't quite speak of it yet.

There is a school near my called Capitol College (http://www.capitol-college.edu/).  They seem to have a pretty cool Astro program as they are partnered with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Institute, which is only a few miles away.  The majority of their Astro students seem to intern there.

Price isn't an issue as my tuition will be 100% covered by the GI Bill and the Yellow Ribbon Program.  

This school only has 400 undergrads spread across 12 different majors and another 350 Grad students for a total of about 750 students.  The small class sizes will be a big plus, but I feel that a school of this size might not be able to offer some of the opportunities that larger schools can offer.  University of Maryland is only a few more miles down the road and has a very large engineering department.  

Thoughts?

What college courses should I consider?,edthefreak,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11s3u2/considering_a_job_in_game_audio_what_college/,"I'm currently in my fall semester of my sophomore year, majoring in Sound Recording. The course is aimed at working in the studio and is actually a very good program. I'm not sure in what direction of audio I want to go in yet, though I've been considering game audio. Does anyone have any info on game audio and what the job entails? I've ordered some books on it that I'm going to read and took a seminar on sound design. It just seems hard to find information about. What kind of classes should I be adding into my schedule to benefit me for the career? I'd have to double check our audio electives though I believe one of them is sound synthesis. I'm also highly considering taking programming, which I figure would be helpful no matter what field I decide on. Also, is there maybe a language or something I should take?

EDIT 1:
Ignoring my gen. eds and general music courses, I take these sound courses:

* Intro to Recording
* Critical Listening
* Acoustics &amp; Psychoacoustics
* Recording Production
* Video Production
* Audio Theory
* Fundamentals of Sound Recording
* The Recording Industry
* Recording Studio Repair &amp; Maintenance
* Multitrack Production
* Computer Science for Sound Recording Applications
* Sound Recording Internship

Other sound recording(and music) classes that become options are:

* Sound Synthesis 1
* Sound Synthesis 2
* Advanced Multitrack Production
* Arranging

We also have a ton of computer science courses to take and the languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and Cambodian. I think they used to offer Japanese but I don't know what happened to it.

A lot of the questions were on algorithms and data structures, and I had a much harder time answering them than I would have liked.

I have taken a class on data structures, so some of those questions I felt I was able to answer, but most of the algorithm questions I did not know what the different algorithms were or which one was the best.

The coding questions were pretty straightforward, but again I feel like my implementation was the ""obvious"" way to solve the problem and not the ""most efficient"".

This is concerning for me because I feel as though I am making myself look ""bad"" and that my skills are not being properly reflected. I am by no means an incredible programmer, but I also feel like I am better than average.

Is there a way to combat this? Should I be practicing and trying algorithm problems on my own? Are there any books I should read? Any advice would be appreciated.

11urlt,167,2012-10-21,I guess I'll just take a longer commute.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11urlt/i_guess_ill_just_take_a_longer_commute/,"I'd been trying to move closer to my work for ages.  Any one of you who lives in a city knows the frustration:  If slummin' it isn't your style, you either you pay through the nose to live in a safe apartment building, or you go with an hour-long commute.

I'm a newbie secretary, so I had to go with option 2. But in January my lease was up, and I had recently been vomited on during my commute, so I was browsing for a superior living situation. My friend had a friend who was in a similar situation, and hooked us up.

We got along ok, she was some kind of intern for HR, and she told me she wanted to live in this place, like a 10 min bus ride from my work!
I feel like crying when I remember how cheerful I was that day. 

The place was okay. It's just a common room with a kitchen and two bedrooms to the right. Thin walls, but my bedroom is nice and quiet. My roommate was quiet and spent most of her time out.. though she was a bit of a food thief. The landlord gives us tea from time to time, and it always disappears immediately.

But things are just a little off.

First of all, my roommate?  I stayed off one day sick, lying in the common room, watching TV and wishing I could fall asleep. I saw her go in her room after breakfast. 11 Hours later she comes back in... through the front door.  What?  Her room doesn't even have windows! It's pretty clear to me that she doesn't work 'in hr'. Her hours are truly weird and she dresses more 'casual' than 'business'. 

The room next door.. people go in and out all the time. But I think it must be super-soundproofed. I never hear them. Ever.

The people who go in are a diverse cast. They are all, however, wearing suspiciously nice clothing. Like I can tell nice suites, and most of them are definitely horse-hair handmade.

People are shuffling just massive boxes in and out all the time, moving them up from the basement and back down again.

Then one day I'm taking a late-day, walking past the elevator. It starts to open and someone sees me, yells 'fuck' and forces the doors to close. 
But I saw what was in the elevator.
It looked like an operating table.

My roommmate is waiting for me when I get home after work that day.

""Tell the truth but say you didn't see anything, and that you liked the sweet tea.""

I'm like, what? But before I can react she's shutting herself in her room. Five minutes later, the landlord is at my door.

""Sorry to bother you dearie, but we had a bit of trouble this morning and I need to ask a couple questions.""

""Okay.""  I smile my secretary smile. My landlord is a fat southern gentleman type. He's okay.

""Somethin got stolen this morning, a big somethin. Wouldn'ta fit down the stairs. Your dollface roommate told me that you mighta been in the building when the thieves were in - I really hope you can help us out. 11am, the elevator? See anyone in the elevator?""

He sounds so sweet, but all I can think about is the strangeness my roommate just exhibited. 

""Oh, wow, sir. Yeah. I was walking passed the elevator, and it started to open, but my back was turned! I only even looked cuz I heard someone yell, but the doors were closing. I couldn't see anything.""

""Oh hell sweetie, might notta been them. Don't worry. I'll see you soon.""

""Thanks, sir. Oh.. and thanks for the sweet tea. It was good.""

The expression on his face makes my stomach plummet. Just a smile. A tiny smug little smile and eyes just staring me straight through. Fucking glad I'd heeded my roommate. ""Well I'll drop more off tomorrow, doll.""

My roommate comes out only 5 minutes later. At first she doesn't say anything, just pacing. But then she turns and just stares at me. She looks so tired. So, completely wiped.

""Leave.  Leave tonight.""

""What?""

""Do it or I'm going to fuck you up. I'm going to fuck you to hell."" Holy shit, she's going for the knives.  And holy shit, you better believe I left.

I spent the week with my parents 4 hours away, using up all my sick time.

When I finally told them my story when my sick time was up and I needed to return, they immediately told me that I couldn't go back. I was like, my stuff is still there.  So we went together.

The building.  The building, it was abandoned.

Reddit, the building was abandoned.  Locked and barred and not opened for YEARS. We checked the adress 3 times. Drove down side-streets. But no, there is the bakery I always went to!  There's my bus stop!  That's my building!

My parents look shocked, I'm stammering.  I ask a passing woman what that building is.

""Oh honey, everyone knows the Gran Ol Red.  Haunted, they say.  You know, it was shut down when they found out the landlord was running a prostitution ring out of it.  Oh, not just any ol sex for your money! No, they say that some of the men payed for the girl's lives.. if you know what I mean.""

I was in the car before she finished the story.

My parents let me live with them now.

It's okay.  The drive to the therapist is only 10 minutes, and they don't mind taking me."

Now the System is old , Uncommented code , they don't use Entity Framework or Sql Data source , They have overridden every control (both Asp.net and Telerik)with different names and Abbreviation , Telerik the old version always  fuck things up , Now I have spend 6 work days not including vacations (which come to total 10 days ), we had to disable 5 projects to let the site run because of ton of zombie and uncomplete code .

The wanted feature that they wanted to implement (Which I tried through Telerik demos , Samples , documentation and Apress Telerik book ) doesn't work on the system , even it worked on demo project I created at home easily in less than 30 min , I even called the one of the senior to see what I did wrong and fix it , He couldn't implement this feature  and suggesting an alternative to rewrite some old code that they use it only in one page (Because of unexplained reason they override  every control out there) or using Jquery and Webservice they flat-out refused  .


I don't feel that I'm learning anything new , and I experiencing Stress that I never felt before and the future doesn't look so bright

I'm one out of three interns Who didn't finish their tasks either because of  previous reasons.


What Should I do ? I don't want to be quitter  at the same time I don't want to stay there to get fired or work on outdated technology while I could spend my time learning more and be more competent at my next job"

Little background... I work at a business continuity company that does back ups of entire servers both onsite and offsite to our data center. If a server fails, you can spin up a VM from an appliance we provide or spin up a cloud VM from our data center.


This being my first job and being a rather new tier 1 intern to part timer, I had my first official walk through with a customer over the phone on how to spin up a test VM to verify it works should anything happens. Unfortunately, the appliance didn't want to spin up a VM correctly, so I'm on the phone with this customer for a good hour and a half trying to get this done while working with other engineers fixing all these issues. Near the two hour mark on the phone, everything seems fixed and only thing left to do was to do a firmware upgrade and everything would have worked out.


Customer decides it was a good time to be persistent on asking if they can test the VM over and over and I kept telling him to let the firmware upgrade first before touching anything. Then he asks if he could test it while an upgrade was in process. At that point I muted my phone and started my rant... Problem was... my phone wasn't on mute and customer heard everything... He hung up on the spot and I felt like total shit for what just happened. 


I immediately called back and apologized like crazy and customer accepted it saying something on the lines of ""It happens to everyone, don't sweat it. I know how stressful it gets some days..""

Boss understood that it was an accident and to never do it again... but I feared for my job that day....

**TL,DR : Never rant about customers until phone is completely off!**"

It's the best I can afford, but there aren't any opportunities for real lab work and there isn't much in the way of internship prospects until at least my Jr. year. Even then, this school is pretty hit or miss on getting people internships. Some people I know that are coming up on graduation have not had a single internship. 

A friend has been working for an electronics business in town, a local Ipod repair shop. The mostly do screen placements but there is some board work being done that they want to expand on. I love circuits work and, ideally, want a job doing that and or embedded systems after college. There wouldn't be much of that at the job, but it would be the most technical job I've ever had. It also sounds like a lot of fun. It wouldn't be full time, so I could still manage decent grades, but probably not the As I've been pulling. 

So does anyone have any advice on whether or not this would look good on a resume? Is this something that would make you want to hire a fresh graduate a little more than their gpa? Thanks in advance!

I'm a 20-year old EE undergrad graduating in spring 2013. I recently just took the general GRE, and got a 319 (157 v and 162 q). Not very satisfied, but I guess it's decent. I'm very much interested in applying for a Masters degree in top US grad schools. The problem is, I'm not a shining star when it comes to academia. My GPA's around 72%, and I have a couple of backlogs. I don't have research experience or great referrals either, I'll be relying on a few EE professors from my no-name college for the recommendation. I'm planning to write the IELTS soon, and I'm pretty sure I can score well in that.

My question is, though my academic stats look bad, I have a couple of years' software development experience and a decent skillset that I've gathered through my own time spent writing code. I have a lot of projects that I've done on my own, covering C, python web dev and even android dev, plus I've taken a remote internship with Google (Summer of Code) successfully. I also have some FOSS development experience.

That said, is it worth applying to top schools relying on my programming experience and my GRE scores, since my GPA and previous research experience is lacking? I'm interested in courses related to AI, especially in courses which blend programming and cognition. I have a couple of small projects and a few blog posts that demonstrate my fascination with pattern recognition, Music in AI and the like, will those help?

I'm doing my best to try and aggregate information that would help me make a decision, so any general advice, such as courses that would be a good fit, schools which have a great AI base and where I stand a good chance, application advice, advice on contacting professors etc, would be great.

Thanks!"

I wasn't doing anything particularly bitchy at the time... but he's right. I am a bitch. He calls bitch, cunt, and everything remotely related a lot. I tell myself it's abusive and to ignore it, but he's right.

I yell at him and call him a dick a lot too. I tell myself at the time that it's because he's being one, but I realize that it's just my way of manipulating him. I manipulate a lot of people, including myself. I tell little lies (or sometimes big ones) to get people to like me more, to get my way, to get out of problems. I use my emotions to control the emotions of others. I lie to myself to the point that I believe the lies. It's my first time admitting this to anyone.

I act like I'm a great person, but this morning I realized I'm not. After he said that I started looking over my life and I realized I've never done anything for anyone when there wasn't some substantial benefit to me. I'm not even capable of maintaining friendships because I just don't feel like they benefit me. I have like 2 casual friends (both who I lie to constantly, one who I'm abandoning because trying to be friends is just too much work) and that's it.  I did my first ""noble"" thing this morning when I decided not to jump off the building I was sitting on the roof of because the street below was too populated and it wouldn't be fair to the people who had to watch it.

I don't really contribute to society and never will. I've been in college for almost 7 years due to money trouble, but even still I'm a mediocre student. I've interviewed at a ton of places for jobs and internships, but most places didn't even bother to call me back to reject me. To be quite honest I don't think I'll ever find a job, and I just don't care enough to. I don't even like what I'm doing in school. I wanted to drop out a few years ago but my husband pushed me to continue because he thought that I would have more opportunities with a degree than without. On top of that, I don't volunteer and I don't donate. I actually run a student organization that does a lot of volunteering, but I don't do any of the volunteer work myself. Instead I just use the position as a chance to meet more companies.

On top of that I'm fat and ugly. While I don't necessarily look like a whale, I weigh in the whale category somewhere at somewhere around 34% body fat. My doctor says I'm in generally good health, and as long as I keep exercising I have bigger things to worry about (he calls what I have a pre-eating disorder - I'll not eat for over a week and then binge). I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. I tried to dress nice and make myself feel like it would be ok, but stores don't carry things in my size and the things that do fit are just to... showy. I feel like everyone is staring at my fat rolls. Along with some other issues from my past, poor body image means that my husband almost never gets sex, and the few times he does we have to quit because it's usually really painful for me because I just can't bring myself to like it. I hate that I can't even do one thing for the only person who might actually care about me because I'm so self absorbed, but that doesn't change the fact that I don't do it.

It doesn't help that I started broken. A family member tried to kill me when I was younger. Several times. When he couldn't get to me to kill me, he would threaten to kill himself. He would scare away all my friends and generally just made me feel much safer alone. I would cry going to school. As a first grader I was already forcing myself to throw up and otherwise faking sick to get out of it. I was a good student, but my teachers were constantly hounding me about how I wasn't as good as my older siblings. My parents were never home, and they were (to be perfectly honest) really shitty parents anyway. At the age of 11 I met my first and only (to this day) best friend. They told me she was a horrible person, and when she moved away 2 years later they essentially took away all forms of contacting her. At the age of 15 I met someone really awesome who tried to help me improve my life. They made me cut off all contact and start seeing a therapist. The therapist was one of the sorts who thought that God would handle everything. He doesn't. At 16 I got a job at a place where I didn't have friends necessarily, but I felt needed. At 17 I chose to work instead of going to my senior prom, and was sexually assaulted that night by a co-worker there. I quit shortly after. I took another job, where another co-worker who I confided in sexually assaulted/raped me me multiple times (30+) over a several month span until I could finally find a new job and get out. I saw a psychiatrist but he just didn't get it. My doctor doesn't get it either, but he at least goes along with it. My husband at least acknowledges that he never will understand. 

No matter how hard I try I can't come up with a single good thing I've done with my life. I'm a horrible person who contributes nothing and never will. I'm not even sure I'm emotionally capable of it. I just make the lives of people around me worse. I don't enjoy life, and people would probably be a lot happier without me. I just don't see the point anymore.

In the past, I have worked with several non-profit organizations as both an intern and as a consultant. While working for these non-profits, I also provided useful information pertaining to environmental science in regards to sustainable technologies, resources, and techniques. I have also provided expertise in building websites, marketing, HTML and SEO; which is critical for start-ups. While working for these companies I have been required to develop unique lesson plans to teach inner-city children about environmental sciences; I also created hands on educational programs regarding sustainable technologies which helped secure a $300,000 grant program which was geared towards helping children learn about the sciences and provided useful program research; I also carried out all necessary office functions. All of this work was done along with a full work and class schedule.

I have a couple of questions regarding the search for job opportunities.  

It seems the area I live in doesn't have very many opportunities in the field of software development. Recently, I've been looking at a lot of county jobs and I'm having trouble understanding whether or not I should even attempt to apply for them.

For instance, one listing says ""Programmer Analyst I"", so I assume the ""I"" makes it an entry level job, then I read further and see that they want two years worth of related experience, which I don't have. On top of that they post things like ""the ideal candidate will have 5 years experience in..."", basically invalidating even their two year requirement.

Anyway, here are my questions:

1. If all jobs I've stumbled across have similar time requirements, how do I find an entry level one, or should I just apply to these anyway?

2. I've looked on DICE and LinkedIn and basically everything I see has basically the same requirements for these level one positions, is there any place out there designed specifically for entry level positions.

Anyway, I am a university student currently studying abroad. Last semester, after a bit of a struggle to find housing, I finally found a spot in one of the better on-campus apartments. Since I've lived in a ""normal"" dorm for the past few years (i.e., one with a large communal bathroom and no kitchen), I was really looking forward to one of the biggest perks of being an upperclassman -- apartment life.

No longer would I be condemned to buy overpriced, crap food from the cafeteria; instead, I would have kitchen access, which would allow me to cook my own food. It would be cheaper, healthier, and, of course, more delicious.

This girl informed me last spring that she would be studying abroad during the spring semester, so she needed someone to fill her spot. Naturally, I agreed.

Now, in freaking October, she tells me she doesn't want to study abroad anymore, and that I'll have a to find housing elsewhere. THANKS A LOT BITCH. 

She apparently got some internship at the UN, which is ""the opportunity of a lifetime"" as she posts on Facebook fifteen thousand times a day. The worst part is that my university is eating it all up. They don't realize that this girl, though hard-working and socially gifted, is a jerk. Also, I'll most likely be living in some old, underclassman dorm next semester while she gets to live in a nice apartment. 

Next time I make a housing agreement, I am making people sign an agreement in blood. Or something.

I constantly feel like I'm not as capable as other interns. Somebody asks me to do something I've never done, and I fail miserably while the others seems confident and get things done. I see younger intern then me with more responsibility and knowledge.

But this also affect most aspects of my life. I'm supposed to subscribe to an insurance for my new apartment, and I have no idea what to do. How to chose the best insurance company, how to know wich program suits me best etc...

I feel like I'm not evolving as fast as life is and it's really bringing me down. I'm trying my best not to let myself overwhelmed by this feeling, I try to be more proactive, but I feel that the more I do, the more I realize how far behind I am.

Has anybody dealt with this? Have you ever pulled through?"

My parents divorced right after his birth( a year and seven days after my birth!) i have a half sister as a result of an affair(my sperm donor's). i have another half sister(the product of my dad remarrying) and another half sister on the way now(mom cheated on my amazing stepdad and is preggo) when it was just my mother and i, she never did or said anything unusual to me that i remember. i was often lkeft with random babysitters so she could go ""be young"". never had health insurance or anything and men were in and out of my life quite frequently. my biodad beat his wives and i saw it but it never happened to me. my mother kinda ignored me and would randomly say things to me like ""burden"" ""too much"" ""ungratefful"" etc. i was very small and only tried harder to help out. we were very poor and lived in section 8 housing(welfare homes) i never had new school clothes or anything but that didn't matter because i was happy just being outside or talking to my dolls and furniture. when mom married my step dad it was the greatest thing. she started to notice me gaining weight and picked at me for being fat(i wasn't actually fat) but my stepdad stood up for me. my biodad also has a bunch of random kids that he seeded and never took care of. so anyways.. my stepdad jason is a great guy. slowly but surely he started noticing my mom saying things that were weird to me. personal injuries and such. she left him and ended up with ray. ray called me sexy at 12. he pinched me, pulled my hair, hit me, grounded me, and eventually went on to beat her. she never listened to any of the things i told her about him until he finally hit her. then she went back to jason. things were ok until we moved. she started doing her graduate work at a pretty good university. then the real trouble started. she would tell my friends' moms that they were on drugs, thus alienating me from my peers. she smoked weed but grounded me for not making my bed. she hit me kicked me whipped me and all that lovely stuff. she would tell everyone else that i hated her because i was a bad kid, or that i wouldn't listen to her. i told her i was sexually assaulted and she asked me how i could have let that happen. i got into a car wreck(i was a passenger and the only one hurtin a drunk driving wreck) and the whole time we were at the hospital in icu (2 mnonths) i couldnt eat and she would bring delicious food in and eat it in front of me. she complained about having to be in memphis for so long, and what was i going to do about the immense doctor bills that were to come. i was fifteen. my jaw was wired shut and she had plans for xmas dinner so she didnt want me there i guess. she sent me for a visit with bio dad. after telling me how much i looked like my mom and acted like her, he proceeded to get really drunk on xmas eve and hit me in my broken wired shut jaw. i ran into my baby half sister's room, locked the door, and held her sooo close until his wife came home and sent him away. i called my mom and she said she was entertaining guests and couldnt come get me. 2 teeth were broken in the back(molars) and she told me we didnt have money for it. however she did have money to rent a house from the man she was cheating on jason with at the time. i knew and she told me if i said anything she would leave me and jason. at seventeen i was a huge party kid, because the everyday fighting beatings and mental/verbal abuse sucked. drugs were my answer. there was one day i hid from her and she came running through the house and picked me up off my floor by my upper arms and asked me what the fuck was wrong with me. i had been crying because of usual boy girl breakup stuff. she slapped me until i stopped crying and told me she wished she could just leave us or just me. i decided then to move out. i left, finished high school and applied to college. little did i know that she got my vanderbilt acceptance letter in the mail and threw it away. so i went to another super shitty school. i dropped out because i got the shit beat out of me by a boyfriend and was trapped and beaten for three days before i tricked him into going to a friend's house where my best guy friend was waiting for him. i moved back home only to discover the car that had been stolen from my house while i was in college was sitting in her driveway. she told me about the vandervbilt thing and the car thieving. she told me that because of having me at seventeen she didnt have a good chance. she asked me why i deserved a better chance than she had. i ended up moving back in with her and jason because my job fell through and i became broke. she charged me three hundred dollars a month to sleep in the living room. i had to buy my own things but i was just happy to have a chance to start over. i knew she was still cheating on jason. she told me i was a fucked up drughead(i was) and that she wouldn't take any of it. weed only. i said ok. she then kicked me out because i was cramping her space. i moved in with a friend and began paying bills. she told me that me and my druggie friends would get caught(no more drugs for me after i moved out mind you) so i was sober and she called the cops on me. so finally i had enough of her shit. then it happened. i got uninvited to xmas dinner this past year because she got caught by jason with one of her fuck buddies. a different fuck buddy told jason about the situation. she left jason and asked me to move in with her to help her pay bills. i said yes because i desparately needed her approval and i still wish she would love me.i moved in and found out she was pregnant. mny teeth started hurting from all the wreck damage and i asked her to help me pay for it or at least sign a loan with me so i could pay it myself. she said that she was done providing me with a security blanket(i have paid rent in my house since i began working at age fourteen). she said that i was an adult and if i wanted a hand out i should just go get pregnant. she told me that the sexual assault, beatings, car wreck and being born were my fault. i have inconveinenced her for too long and now its time to move on. iam now over 200,000 dollars in debt because she never took care of the wreck insurance things. i am 21 now. this is six years later and she says that because she didnt handle it then i have to deal with it now. she took out a loan for my physical and mental therapy sessions in my name when i was fifteen and thats another 4000. my dental work lefftover from the wreck is another 5600. so now i am young, poor and deeply in debt at the very beginning of my adult life. she seems to be jealous of my opportunities and every time something hapens(good or bad) she somehow uses it to exploit me. she has never told me she loved me, never initiated hugs or kisses. just so cold and unfeeling. i dunno if i mentioned it but i am a rapid cycling bipolar type 2 sufferer and all the drugs i did to make me feel better also made me kinda crazy. mom said i don't need medication because it doesn't work.
 i am scared of losing my bipolar because the mania helps me work and be creative. i work 20 hours everyday at two jobs and only make 80 buck every two weeks because i am in this unpaid internship. poverty sucks when you have no one to help around you
i just wish i had a family that calle or gave a shit or did anything besides birth me abuse me and abandon me.
i wish i could scream loud enough for them to hear"

I now work at a company and am in dire need of assistance.  CEO gave me the go-ahead for an intern.  Getting resumes but conflicting with my boss on how to test them.

Boss' testing mechanism: add a new site to our monitoring server.  We sit down with the candidate, find the Nagios configs, copy an existing one, edit it to monitor your favorite site.  

This was the same test I took during my interview for a full-time position.  For SysAdmins, I feel it tests your knowledge of the linux fs, command-line abilities and understanding of services and how not to break them.  I don't expect interns to be on that level and would prefer an understanding of how many linux tools they know (grep, package manager(s), chmod, chown, wget, curl... and so on).

My test (admittedly, taken from my own intern interview): install something from source.  Go out on the web, find software x, download its source and install.  You have n minutes and I will not hold your hand.

To me this shows much more about the intern's abilities to work independently, how much they are going to poke me with questions and what tools they know/can pick up in an hour.

We interviewed one kid yesterday, he got through the test but we helped him.  I got an understanding of what he knows but I have no idea if he could figure it out on his own.

So, my question to you is, which one sounds better or do you have an even better method?  Any students out there, which one would you feel more comfortable doing?"

During the year and a half i worked there, i kept a very friendly relationship with everyone around the office. Also, as the sole software developer, i had some perks like flex hours,  occasional telecommuting etc.  

My first project with the Customer Service department was a success by all means. The application was developed and deployed well under the deadline and was well received by the staff.  

Next, i was assigned to a project with the HR department. The development went smoothly and everyone was pleased. We had weekly meetings to review milestones, check the functionality of the application and discuss new features. Within a month of finishing the project, everyone around the office started gossiping about poor financial results and potential layoffs throughout the office. I wasn't really worried since upper management was already discussing moving me to a different department to begin a new project.  

I finished the project with one week left under the deadline, the final meeting went smoothly and everyone was pleased with the results. The next day i was informed that i was going to be laid off by the end of the week.  

The news hit me really hard but i decided to keep a positive attitude. I devoted the remaining days to deploy the web app into the server and perform some additional tests. My last day at the office was uneventful, we finished our work relationship on a positive note.  

Last week i got an email and a phone call from my boss; apparently, she presented the project to the CEO and he had some suggestions for new features (without knowing that i wasn't working there anymore) Now she wants me to work for free to add those features arguing that she was ""surprised"" that those features didn't already exist and since i finished the project a week early, i shouldn't have been paid for the last week. Obviously, i politely declined and offered to return temporarily as an outside consultant.  

Today i received another email with a harsher tone. This time, she also says that she's ""honestly surprised"" with my attitude since the company provided me with many perks and benefits and i wasn't reciprocating. She also stated a veiled threat about not providing letters of recommendations for future employers.  

How do i proceed now? Those extra features would take about a week's worth of work and I definitely don't feel like working for free, specially since my financial situation is a bit weak right now but i also don't want to hurt my chances of future employment by not having their letters of recommendation. Take into account that this was my first ""real"" job besides internships and freelancing.  

**TL;DR: My past employer is trying to guilt-trip me into working for free. What should i do?**"

Or should your projects be really unique and which hasn't been done before or which uniquely stands out which the recruiter feel is worth a project ?

In a little over a week I have a job interview at a company for a position that I really, really want. It's a two year (entry-level, Java dev) program with almost guaranteed advancement afterward. Four friends of mine (from my college) either work there or have accepted an offer which is also a plus. I believe I've shown a good level of interest, having applied for an internship last summer, and attending two events at my school by them so far this year. I was just wondering if anyone had some tips to help me nail the interview. 

* Anything I should try to do at a semi-informal dinner the night before, aside from be myself?

* I have to give a 5 minute presentation on a project displaying my technical skills. I have chosen my topic and realize that it's probably a device to display my communication skills and condense a large topic into a short period. Anything I should do or avoid? 

* There is a ""group project."" I'd guess trying to be a leader is advisable, but not sure what to expect.

* Any other advice for the individual interview/in general?

Thanks in advance! I'm really excited and nervous because I feel like this is an amazing opportunity for me.

edit: I didn't get the internship at the company as there was only one spot and I believe by the time I applied they had already hired a friend of mine (who just recently received a full-time offer). I did have an internship elsewhere, but it was more in Config Management (working with installers (WiX), VMs, and Subversion) "

I started off helping make a website and then kind of transitioned into answering tech calls, being a tech support guy.  Now I'm pushing myself back into a software development role and my bosses are wanting me to sign a non-compete agreement.  They haven't gotten anything written up; it was just mentioned.  My bosses are awesome.  Great to work with, very trustworthy and I love them to death, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot.  I'm a very self-motivated person.  I know I can do whatever I want to do.  I just want to make sure I don't sign anything that is unreasonable and really it takes experience to know what is reasonable.

Here are my thoughts on the subject.  Anything beyond two years is unacceptable for any terms or agreements.  Inside of those two years I find it acceptable for them to restrict me from doing anything near them as long as they agree to pay for my relocation to a job in another area.  If they are unwilling to do that then the terms need to be very relaxed and only includes things such as:

- I can't take code I wrote for them, put it on a flash drive and then use it at a new company.
- I can't start my own business and take any of their clients.  However, if I'm employed at a new company they can steal clients as long as I never have any contact with the client during the period we agree upon.

Am I on the right track?  Is the industry standard more strict than this?  Will I hurt myself looking for a job in the future if I give up this much?  They don't pay me all that much in relation to what I do for them, but they are giving me a crazy good amount of experience and free reign to learn stuff I want to learn.  I want to stay with them, but I also don't want to hurt myself and others by being lax and accepting things that hurt employees.

Thanks for any input and please explain your experience level in your comments.  I want to avoid taking advice from somebody who is overly idealistic and never had a job in software, but please don't be discouraged from giving me advice no matter who you are.  I love hearing opinions that come from all different spectra of thought!"

Here is the post:

*The presidential race shouldn't be this close. This is the most important election in the history of our country by far. This is a lengthy post, but it's 100% fact and scary to think about.

Obama has racked up $6 trillion in debt through failed bailouts, run away spending, and Obamacare. Just to put this into perspective he has outspent George W. Bush in 3 years over Bush's 8. He has racked up mo
re debt than the 1st-42nd president COMBINED.

Proclaimed to Vladmir Putin's aide that he would have more ""freedom"" after the election.

Has reduced America's nuclear missile count from 5,000 to 1,500, and plans on 0 nukes his second term. When Russia has 1,500 nukes, China 600, North Korea 90, and Iran is building nukes as this is written. Nukes are detrimental to deterring our enemies, and there are many of them compared to how many allies we have. Not to mention how much these enemies would love to wipe the United States off the map.

He also plans to cut our military spending in half. He's not doing this to save money, but to disarm the most powerful military in the world.

Obama doesn't care about our only ally in the middle east. He wouldn't care if Israel was taken over by the Islamic countries in that area. The state of the middle east is deteriorating fast.

Obama praises Muslims and has always recognized their holidays while acknowledging 0 Christian holidays, and yet he still proclaims himself Christian. It was a tactic to not scare the votes in 2008 and people still believe him to be Christian.

He has been mentored by a terrorist, Communists, and Socialists. Never by anyone who has/had a love for America.

He wants Americans to be dependent on the government. That's already working in a way. He has gotten many voters on his side because they don't want to lose their government benefits. This is absolutely ridiculous!

He's going to raise taxes to their highest levels in decades.

Unemployment is the highest it's been since the Great Depression.

The American dollar has lost 40% of its value while inflation has raised most prices on EVERYTHING by 2x their value. Gas prices have doubled.

Obama has gotten rid of NASA. One of Americas most iconic programs. NASA invents a lot of technology and learning more about space and our planet only helps us as Americans and as a species. I'd say this was an extremely anti-American move.

Romney is leading in the polls by about 6 points, but the election shouldn't be this close. If Americans were still true to their values that once made this country so great this should be a landslide election with no contest.

I can't believe about 46-47% of all Americans who are likely to vote for Obama are this ignorant. Can other people not see this? Do almost half of all Americans really hate their country? Do they want to see it fall like the Roman empire, British empire and Greece once had?

Obama is anti-American and does not love America. We let a traitor take seat in the greatest country in the world. We need to vote him out before he does this country anymore harm.

Above all, Obama wants to turn America into a 3rd world country ruled by Communists or Socialists, and so far nothing is stopping him. The good thing is, is that we have a choice come November 6th. We can continue on this route to Socialism/Communism or go back to the American values that once made this country truly great.*








**This was going to be my response:**

*Broadening view by sections of your post. (Each empty line separates sections.)
Section 1) Your opinion, no need to state mine.

Section 2) Spending on capital goods boosts the economy and increases the real GDP in the long run.

Section 3&amp;4) Every country would have more freedom in a world without militaries. It would allow us to allocate more resources to production instead of destruction. Unfortunately as the human race we aren’t at that point yet. In the cold-war era the US created more than 70,000 warheads. The nuclear count has been decreasing regularly since then.

Section 5) Cutting our military spending in half would save approx. $300 billion (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2009-BUD/pdf/BUDGET-2009-BUD-11.pdf) and leave us at over 2 times the spending of the next closes military spender. (http://defense.aol.com/2012/03/16/the-military-imbalance-how-the-u-s-outspends-the-world/ )

Section 6,7,8 &amp; 9) Not sure where these came from or if it is just opinion.

Section 10) Raising taxes is always associated with being bad. Taxing the upper class may lower their disposable incomes slightly, but the money gained from doing so has the potential to help the US in many ways… and that income is only their disposable income.

Sections 11) Bureau of Labor Statistics seems to disagree. http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000 

Section 12) Gas prices are lower now than what they were 4 years ago near the election period. http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx 

Section 13) NASA is not gone. They are actually looking for interns right now. https://intern.nasa.gov/solar/web/public/main/index.cfm?solarAction=view&amp;subAction=content&amp;contentCode=HOME_PAGE_INTERNSHIPS. They have just changed somewhat. 

Section 14,15,16,&amp;17) Your opinion. Not going to try and change it.

Just trying to show other ways of looking at things.

129d08,0,2012-10-29,Is transferring the best decision for me?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/129d08/is_transferring_the_best_decision_for_me/,"I'm thinking of transferring colleges. I made a list of pros and cons:

My Current College's Pros:

1. It's an academic powerhouse.
2. It has excellent networking.
3. I'm familiar with the campus and the people.
4. The campus itself is beautiful, along with the surrounding area.
5. I like the closeness of the community.
6. Both of my majors have strong programs.
7. There are a lot of on-campus activities and clubs.

My Current College's Cons:

1. I should have gone to my potential transfer college initially, due to health reasons.
2. Academically, it's much harder than it should be, and it's a high-stress environment.
3. My major programs are limited, including not much class selection. (It's a smaller school.)
4. I hate being sick when I'm so far away from home. (I was recently diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia.)
5. I hate the lack of dorms that I can choose from, including no singles until Senior year.
6. I just don't love the school. I dread having to be there.
7. I'm really bored there, and I have almost no social life. (It's really cliquey.)
8. I don't have any close friends, or people that I can rely on, give or take one or two.
9. I will be absolutely miserable after graduation if I stay. I know I will be mentally and physically drained.
10. I prefer my hometown and city to where my college is located.
11. Being away from home stresses my parents out and creates more of a rift in their marriage.
12. My GPA is far lower than it could or should be.
13. Your undergraduate college doesn't really matter when it comes to salaries for jobs.
14. I can't get around my college's area well without a car. I'm constantly spending money on taxis.
15. I spend a lot of money at my current college just trying to get by. ($300.00 or more a month, for food, dorm supplies, etc.)
16. The administration is evil.
17. It's expensive to go to the school to begin with. (I would save about $10,000.00 by going to my potential transfer college, which I could use towards grad school, rent for when I move, etc.)

My Potential Transfer College Pros:

1. It's a fresh start.
2. The academics are much easier.
3. There are more clubs to join because it's a larger school.
4. I can go to the doctor's or physical therapy when I need to because I would be close by. (I can only go once every other month or so while at college.)
5. They still have good networking because of their size.
6. My parents would do my grocery shopping for me, meaning less money spent on food.
7. It's an up and coming school academically.
8. My best friend would be there, along with her college friends, who already like me, so I would already have an established group to join.
9. Their computer science program is fantastic, so if I worked with computers after graduation, (which I am considering), the name would be recognized.
10. There are more people, so I would make more friends.
11. I would have my best friend and her friends to work out with, and I would generally be healthier.
12. There is MUCH better housing, and I would almost be guaranteed a single.
13. There is better food there, and more gluten-free options. (I have Celiac's Disease.)
14. I would be near a large city, so I could go clubbing on the weekends, or out exploring the city. Also, internships would be more readily available.
15. I would still be independent because I would live on campus.
16. My parents would be much less stressed and could work on repairing their marriage. (They're currently going through a rocky point of their marriage.)
17. My GPA would sky rocket.
18. My parents TEND to be right on these sort of things, so I feel like I would regret not listening to them.
19. I would be far less tense and stressed.
20. I would save money, and I could make money by working for my grandfather, since he would be nearby. ($70.00 a week for just doing his laundry.)
21. My parents wouldn't move from my childhood home if I went to my potential transfer college.
22. I could come home easily if I needed to.
23. I would have a car.
24. There are more class opportunities.

My Potential Transfer College Cons:

1. Their psychology and sociology programs aren't quite as strong. (I'm double majoring.)
2. If I decided to go to grad school, it's reputation is less than my current college's reputation. 
3. I would have to go to community college next semester, and possibly during the summer, since my transfer credits are iffy.
4. I really love my current college's surrounding area, their traditions, and the animal shelter that I volunteer at that's near my college campus. I would really miss all of that.

I'm heavily leaning towards transferring because I think I would be SO much happier. At the same time, people would KILL to be at the college I am right now, and I feel almost stupid giving the spot up. Yet, I'm absolutely miserable when I'm there. Does transferring sound like the right decision?

**Tl;dr:** I hate my current college, yet it is renowned in the U.S. I want to transfer to an academically average college, but one that will make me MUCH happier. What should I do?

I did an internship at a power plant last summer and while I didn't mind the work, I didn't feel like it was particularly what I wanted to do with my career, and am now thinking I'd rather do something in the consumer electronics field, or possibly research.

Will you please critique my cover letter? ,absolutelyzero,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/12d7r4/i_am_a_senior_applying_for_my_first_internship_in/,"I have no experience with writing cover letters. I was able to get my resume critiqued but I don't have anyone to give me feedback for the letter. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks gang :)

Dear (contact),


I am writing to express my interest in the account services intern position at (Company). (Company)’s innovative and engaging approach to marketing drew my attention to the company and fostered my initial interest. The way your company uses an integrated digital strategy to reach client’s target audience stands out as being uniquely interactive and results-oriented. I feel that my unique background and enthusiastic desire to learn more about the account services side of the marketing field make me an ideal candidate for the Spring 2013 internship.


I am currently a senior at (University) majoring in Sociology. The courses I have completed within my major have cultivated my interest in understanding how people relate to one another and the world around them. Within these courses I have gained research, writing, and presentational skills while critically examining social phenomena in the real world. Most importantly, my sociology background lends itself to the ability to view the world from different individual perspectives. I feel like this skill will prove to be a vital asset in helping the marketing team evaluate brand strategy through the critical eye of the consumer. 


In addition to my academic background, I hold two leadership positions in (my sorority), which has allowed me to gain experience in project coordination and event planning. These experiences have helped me develop my critical thinking and strategic planning skills while exercising creativity, working with a team, and meeting deadlines. These traits will help me assist the company in coordinating client projects and completing day-to-day work. 


Finally, my past professional experience at (Retail-ish company) emphasized working one-on-one with clients. Through on-the-job experience I gained skills in listening to individual needs and providing excellent customer service. I feel that these experiences will translate well into building strong relationship with clients and consumers in the marketing world


I believe that these experiences combined with my motivation to learn more about account services and the marketing field will make me a great addition to the (Company) team. Thank you in advance for reviewing my resume and I look forward to hearing more from you in the future. 


Sincerely,
(Me)

And now i've come to grips with it, I was really confused when I first got it having used Windows all my life. 

Anyway, during my job, i'm learning loads and loads, and i'm loving it, but I wanna get better and I'm looking for something that I can learn in my spare time. Only started programming 2 years ago when I started Uni. 

Main/only languages I know are Java, C#, a little, little bit of C++, done a bit of HTML, PHP, MySQL. Dabbled in a bit of Unix too.

But yeah, i'm looking forward to something new with my Mac. I was thinking something to do with the terminal since I have it available? lol.

Maybe Python or something similar? Perhaps go low level like assembly or C? Maybe make an app in Objective-C?

Suggestions guys?"
12d045,8,2012-10-30,Chemistry course question from bioinformatics undergrad.,[deleted],bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/12d045/chemistry_course_question_from_bioinformatics/,"**EDIT:** Everyone seems to agree that I should take a full year of o-chem in order to later take biochemistry electives. So, I'll do that.

**One more question:** I'm not planning on taking any of the laboratories that go along with the chem courses. Is that okay?  

**Original post:**
Sorry if this is slightly off topic for this subreddit. I'm planning my courses for next semester and am having troubles deciding how much chemistry to take.  

I’m doing undergrad bioinformatics and am only required to take one semester of organic chemistry. My college has two version of o-chem. One version is two semesters long. Another lower level version is one semester long and more of a broad overview. 

Four things:

* Would a graduate schools for bioinformatics/computational biology look down on me for taking only the lower level course? 

* If I took the lower level course or one semester of the two semester course, I wouldn’t be able to take any biochemistry courses later on. How important would it be for me to take biochemistry as an undergraduate? 

* Would future genetics/biology courses be more difficult without organic chemistry? 

* I don’t really like chemistry.

My question is, which course should I take? If it's the two semester course, should I take both semesters? 




One more question. I've been working in a wet-lab for about a year now. Should I start looking for an internship specifically in bioinformatics or wait until I have programming and computer science experience (which would be next year)? I only sort of know python at the moment. 

Thanks for any input. "
12bwcm,0,2012-10-30,"Reddit, Help! A month ago I took up an amazing job offer, but now I realise I really hate my new job. What do I do??",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12bwcm/reddit_help_a_month_ago_i_took_up_an_amazing_job/,"Hi reddit, I need your help.  This is really really long but I need to know what is the right thing to do. 

During my final year university studies I got offered an internship at a local newspaper. I was studying a Bachelor of Arts majoring in journalism and public relations. I took on the internship, then that turned into a casual job, which after 3 months, turned into a full time job as a junior journo who helps out the other seniors journalists on the paper. After one month, and still during uni, I was offered a full time senior journalist position. I was worried it would be too much to handle, as it was my first job as a journalist, but I thought I could do it. Now I have to look after an entire paper by myself (i write about 9 stories every 3 days). I graduated in absentia, and have been working as the full time senior reporter for about a month now.

And I hate it. I hate it so much. It is too much stress, it makes me depressed, and I hate waking up in the morning and I hate the terrible knot in my stomach I get everyday. I wake up at 5am to work on stories and go to bed at 12am. I think I was given too much responsibility in such a short amount of time. I know i should be really really lucky and grateful, but reddit, i can't handle it! I don't know what to do. I can't tell anyone at work. Why? Because when I applied for the full time position (as the junior journalist) they thought I couldn't handle it and I told them I wanted it really bad and would do my best. After working as the junior journo for one month, they were impressed and gave me my own paper.

But I am already burnt out. I have lost my passion. I don't want to work on hard news stories. I'd rather work in PR, or write light hearted stories, or work for a magazine. I wish I could do PR for a con, or expo, or gaming company. 

I have a beautiful amazing boyfriend and he gives me so much support, but I still burst out crying every day and he knows how much I hate it. He told me to look for another job, but I can't. I will let everyone down. They will think of me as ungrateful. Especially after convincing them how much I want it. But reddit, I have never had a break from schooling or working. After high school, I went straight to uni, then straight to work. I have never been overseas. I have lost all my friends because I work too much. (For your info - I am a 21 year old female)

If I quit, I don't think I will be ever able to work in the media industry again. I can't ask to be demoted, because the casual job and junior journo role have already been filled. 

I have two weeks holidays in December. I can't afford to go overseas because I recently moved out of home. I even have to technically work part time during those two weeks so we can still put out papers over christmas and new years.

So reddit, what do I do?

I am currently a senior at Virginia Tech, majoring in Computer Science. I wanted some advice on which schools would be a good fit for me, based on my interests and credentials. I want to apply to schools that provide some sort of funding for graduate school so I won't be paying for the whole thing. I am interested in Systems and Networking and that's what I hope to do research in. 

Here is some more info about me:

3.87 GPA

GRE: 162 Verbal (89%) 163 Math (88%) 4.5 Writing

2 internships, one at Qualcomm, one at IBM (I will be at at Amazon next summer)

2 undergraduate research projects

2 letters of recommendation from the professors I did research with (hoping they will be good) and 1 from my manager at IBM (will be good).

I'm graduating in 3 years.

Here are the schools I am thinking of applying to:

Reach: Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, Columbia

Good fit: UIUC, UCSD, Georgia Tech

Safety: Virginia Tech, UMD


Obviously this is a long list of school, so I don't want to apply everywhere. Where do you guys think I will most likely get into? Is there any schools on this I should avoid? Are there any schools that are not on this list that should be?

I accepted the offer and I am really excited for the opportunity. I originally applied for a summer internship but told them I was also open to co-op opportunities, just wanting to get any sort of experience I could get.

If you aren't familiar with the way ""alternating term"" co-ops work versus educational co-ops: I will work 3 non-consecutive semesters with Dow over the course of two whole school years. I start this coming summer, I will return the following spring, and then I will return the fall after that. Each of these stints will be paid, so effectively I am getting a years worth of work experience (and money) with Dow before I graduate college.

The questions I have are:
&gt;Do you think the opportunity of the co-op is worth postponing my graduation by a year?
&gt;
&gt;If you worked a similar co-op, did you receive a job offer effective after you gradated?
&gt;
&gt;Does a co-op look better on resumes than a few summer internships?
&gt;
&gt;If you worked a similar co-op, can you tell me about what you did and what experiences you had?

I'm not trying to change my mind about accepting the co-op. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity, Dow was at the top of my list with companies I interviewed with. I'm just looking for some perspective from people who are familiar with the prospects of a co-op.

I went through Unit 5 of CS 101 on Udacity, am currently going through Learn Python the Hard Way, and am currently enrolled in edX's CS50X (though I'm not sure if I will continue).

I want to do a side project to put stuff into practice but don't know where to start. For example, I'd love to create a really basic version of Tumblr with Python with an option for reblogging, liking, and a an infinite scrolling timeline. I've looked on places like GitHub for ""timeline"" and ""social networking"", but I honestly have no idea what I'm looking at when I find interesting projects or what's happening.

I looked at the reddit GitHub account and it's sort of the same thing - I don't know how to navigate these files or how they're all interconnected. 

So my questions are these:

1. Where should I go to learn how to create this basic Tumblr?
2. Although it all seems a bit above my head, I'd love to learn how to navigate through GitHub and be able to understand these neat projects that people post up. How would I learn how to do that?
3. Am I even on the right path? How would you guide me from this point? (I have no Django experience either and would love to know how to set it up)
4. I eventually want to get a job at a startup someday (either as an intern or as an actual dev if I get enough experience). Would tackling this project successfully and learning from it be an awesome portfolio builder or is it simply a waste of time (I know it's not, but in your eyes at least).
