There are jobs that I am EXACTLY qualified for but I still don't get them. The company doesnt even bother telling me I'm out of the interview phase. I have a 2.91 gpa but my technical gpa is 3.23. So how many of you are getting screwed over AND at the same time being pissed at this ""volunteer to get a job"" bullshit? Come on! you know it's true that volunteering looks bad also ( hey they didnt pay you so you weren't technically working! har har har!)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT:  OK a lot of you say I dont deserve the 60k starting that I aimed for but you dont realize that the average nationwide for ENTRY level e engineering is right about that. I am not the only the one looking for this number and if you read other reddits posts regarding employment you you agree. Also, according to BLS this is accurate.

Reddit trends I noticed:
1) The comments go with one trend and it usually follows the guy with the top votes. The reason for this post was to let put frustration that it's not as easy as ""volunteering"". Most of the comments say it doesnt even matter. Then what the hell does?

2) When something is acceptable in one thread it goes the complete opposite in the other. Many reddit posts say that they DONT even work as much as they anticipated and hence reddit during work( I'm not in today ). A lot of other redditors say the gpa doesn't even matter and that experience does. From what i'm reading in the replies, a good number of you think the opposite. Some guy said it's average for people to have internships ( multiple at fortune 500). 

3) From the comments:  Low gpa is bad, High gpa doesn't matter as much. No experience is bad, 4 internships are average. Basically anything you do is useless ( all according to what I've read so far). I'm not winning this one.

Okay I wont argue with anyone over the internet. Thanks to those who gave me good information.I'm sorry if I came off as an asshole ( it was never my intention to piss anyone off )"

I am not really a ""recent' college grad anymore, as applying for jobs since last December (2009) hasn't turned up anything. I'm at a total loss right now. I don't know what direction to go in. I didn't know where to go for advice so I figured here I could get some help.

There's very few Project Manager jobs around for entry level, and my internship, while helpful, isn't enough. Most Project Manager job offers around here may as well be internal postings with the requirements for previous experience in the company or crazy requirements I could never fill without at least two other Project Manager jobs.

I don't know what I should be focusing on to help my cause, or if I should be going for certifications (though they don't look like anything practical in a real world experience.)

Please, if anyone even reads this, no insults on my part for not being able to find a real job. I feel bad enough. I may not have been trying my extreme hardest, but I've been trying pretty hard. It's not easy to look at a job list full of door to door salesmen offers, go to backdoor interviews for going door to door selling cable packages on cold contact, and phone calls that go nowhere, and placement companies that sabotage you for no explainable reason.

I just want some help. Or some direction. Please?"

My girlfriend was right behind me, wanting me to succeed and knowing that the two of us would be seeing a lot less of one another because I worked from 8pm-4am (sometimes 8am) and had to sleep during the day.

It's been almost a month of me working and I've seen her as much as I can (maybe 8 times in the past month? So 2 times a week) and she has started getting angry when I say I can't see her because I need to sleep due to working that night. She just doesn't understand that seeing her means I have to sacrifice my sleep and stay up for 22+ hours in a day, then go to work on little to no sleep. On top of it, she has become increasingly clingy and I've noticed myself getting short tempered with her because of it.

I want to take a break from each other but I found out after her last ex broke up with her (she wasn't even devoted to the relationship at the end of it because he broke up with her for drugs) she stepped infront of a bus and tried to kill herself. She is head-over-heals in love with me, but I think some space might be good, I'm just afraid she will try to hurt herself and I'm not sure how to go about doing it. Clearly my attitude has changed towards her since I haven't really talked with her much in the last two weeks.

Reddit, what should I do?

TL;DR: New job that forces me to work nights. Seeing my girlfriend means I don't get sleep. She is becoming a little overwhelming. Should I end it with her?"
hpr9e,1,2011-06-02,"Hi Reddit, it's not often I ask for help, but I feel this is a good place to ask.",situational412,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hpr9e/hi_reddit_its_not_often_i_ask_for_help_but_i_feel/,"The recent negative threads about job searching and the like has, as I know with perhaps many others, hit home with me. Right now my thoughts on what to do, where to go, how to do it, in my life are jumbled and all over the place, and even my thoughts as of at the moment are scattered as I struggle to make this post coherent to have some semblance of flow to it.

I graduated last year from the University of California, San Diego (yay, go Tritons, I suppose) with a B.S in Physiology and Neuroscience. It was supposed to be a stepping stone to medical school. Coming from a decently traditional Asian background, my entire life I had the concept of ""YOU are an Asian male, you are going to be either an engineer or a doctor"" drilled into me. It wasn't something I ever particularly enjoyed doing - I would take my courses to graduate on time just because I had to do it. At the time, I didn't even consider other opportunities. And these classes were especially difficult. Compounding with the fact that I didn't really care or have a passion for the material I was learning, I was content with getting by with average grades (overall 3.04 GPA), and just going to class and immediately going back to my apartment if it was possible. 

I graduated, studied to take the MCAT (30R), and at some point afterwards, I simply said ""Fuck it."" Fuck me for spending my college education doing something not for me, but for others. How can I even consider going to medical school when I don't have the academics to get my foot in the door in the first place? I was angry mostly at myself that I had been blindly trying to fulfill not my own ambitions and goals, but someone else's. 

But what do I do now, then? I didn't take the time to take courses of my choosing during college; I never got to find out what I would really enjoy doing for a career. 

Morale and self-confidence was/is at an all-time low; I couldn't find a job for the past year - I got about two interviews total. I am living at home with my parents with no income to call my own.

I have several random options that I have considered at the moment. I have no idea what they'll turn into or how I'm going to reach those goals, but I'll try to lay it out the best I can. 

1) I lied to you earlier. I actually did find the time to take a year of Japanese language my final year in college, and I had very much enjoyed it, being it the only non-science courses I've taken in years. I applied to JET this past year, but I didn't make it to the interview stage. I plan to reapply this year, so I was looking for ways to see whether or not I liked to actually teach, as I had never really done it before. I began volunteering once a week for an ESL position. Turns out, I love it. I was given several students to work with week after week; these ladies, several of whom had never had a formal education in their entire lives, could eventually read simple stories, write simple sentences, and converse with me in English. It's a great thing to be able to see where your work and effort become in the progress of others. I really hope I get accepted into JET this coming year. Unfortunately, I don't know what would become of me if I get in, go abroad, and come back after a year or two.

2) As mentioned in the prior paragraph, I discovered I really enjoy working closely with several individuals, and seeing my efforts through their progress. I did a little research and I came to the decision that perhaps physical therapy would be best suited for someone of my nature, with it involving science as a plus, since I had graduated with a similar degree. Also, it seems like a more viable career path than going abroad for a couple years (which, to be honest, is a farfetched idea. I don't think I'm qualified at all). I immediately ran into issues.

There was no way I was going to be able to apply on time this year. I have to volunteer about 150 hours minimum with hands on experience, three letters of recommendation from physical therapists, and I have to go back to school to take even more courses. On top of that, coincidentally, because of my degree, I had already completed a good portion of the courses (with the low grades), so I have a bunch of courses I cannot retake for a higher grade, putting my prerequisite GPA at about a 3.0, whereas most applicants get in with a 3.5+. To top things off, if everything went completely smoothly (yeah, right) with no problems, the earliest I could expect to enter the program would be 2013 - two years from now. At the earliest. While I did manage to be accepted into a good hospital internship, I don't know if my efforts will yield results in the end - everything seems to go wrong for me at some point or another. 

I don't know what else to say. I have no idea where I'll end up, no idea what I'll end up doing, and I feel I keep backtracking because I am afraid that more failures would set me back even more years - I feel awful that I wasted a year doing pretty much nothing. I just feel that others out there are/were perhaps in the same position as me, and have found a way to make themselves happy and successful in their lives. I would appreciate any input anyone has to offer.

TLDR: I fail at life, need advice."

A lot of this I attribute to studying my ass off up until middle school, giving me the tools to basically blow off my high school and college courses so far with little effort, using logic and common sense to bullshit my way through hw, tests, essays, etc. . . However, throughout this time, I have had little direction and have have no dreams or aspirations, and honestly, after everything, I really don't know that much since I just blew through everything. Now, I'm getting into the real world and I can't just blow shit off and be highly regarded. I started a tech / major related internship this summer and it has really hit me-- I am lazy, don't enjoy my work, and most of all, I'm woefully incompetent in my field, leading to great levels of anxiety. I'm at a point where I honestly feel I could be fired at any point (pretty sure my blood pressure is rising too lol). I can't understand or even remember my bosses tech briefs and I feel like I am just not in the right place.

Its not like I never saw this coming either--In the back of my head, I always knew something like this would happen. Through my years of laziness and isolation, I have developed none of the skills necessary to succeed. Sure, I've dealt with depression and drug use, but I don't think those are the sole factors in my aimless disposition. I've always expected to eventually become successful and happy, but I never really lived life. . .

Right now, I'd rather just drop out of everything and get some mindless job that requires no effort then continue to punch myself every day. Why bust my ass working all day on something I hate and is causing me to feel so feel stupid. It isn't that I don't want to be good at whatever I do. I would love to have an easy job and kill the hell out of it every day than have a hard job and struggle everyday and end up doing a mediocre job that disappoints others. On the other hand, I fear if I go that route, I'll feel forever ashamed and guilty of being a worthless pos.

I know I'm not the only lazy asshole out there, so does anyone else have similar experiences or advice? Sorry this was long, but thanks for any replies! (Throwaway account)

I also have all sorts of orientation that I'll need to take off for, and I'll probably end up leaving early for marching band.

I've spent the last two years helping senior citizens in my town with computer problems, and I'd ideally like to get something related to IT work; I'd find an internship helping someone administer computers interesting. However, looking at craigslist, everyone's either looking for college students or is stationed over 45 minutes from my house. 

My question is, perhaps is there some other place that's better for looking for jobs? Should I put out something like an ad in the local papers asking for an internship, or would that get me nowhere?"

I had planned on using my netbook despite it being somewhat inconvenient. However, the networking software required caused my system to hang on login, and no amount of changing the startup options would help. While I could borrow a laptop on a daily basis from my employer, I am also considering putting together a cheap system with a larger display. 

The advantages for work would be a larger display for multiple documents, which would be very nice, as well as a snappier system overall. However, since this a fair amount of money I also intend to get more out of this system after this internship is over. In that vein, I would like to have the system convert into a lan party case or a server. I would also be able to run dual monitors on my main system.

I'm planning on graduating in December, and have been debating all year whether I should go for a PhD or not.  I've heard many times that a PhD would probably preclude me from many kinds of jobs in industry, and I don't think I want to go into academia (for now at least).  However, I do enjoy doing research.  I'd also like to be done with school by my late 20's.  I like learning new things, getting to work with all sorts of expensive equipment and tools that I could never afford, and my lab mates are great.

I never got an internship or co-op in industry during my undergrad unfortunately; all my relevant work experience has been in the lab.  That, and I got a CS minor in my undergrad so I try to program and toy with computers in my spare time.

I've been dating a wonderful guy for the past year; he's smart, funny, and absolutely one of the best human beings I know. The problem is that I am convinced he has serious depression and so far has not received help for it.

The story: He was seemed like a normal enough happy guy when I met him a year ago, but sometimes he'd get pessimistic and sad out of the blue and start saying things like ""Why does everyone think life is worth living and has a point?"" He's a philosophy major, so at first I just thought this was hypothetical discourse and talked about it academically. This kept on happening on and off a couple of months after we started dating until one day we went out to the local pizza place and I guess it was a bad day, he started sobbing in the car and told me about the time when he was in high school and he was all set up in his fathers garage to kill himself but somehow couldn't bring himself to do it. We both cried and he agreed to go to the campus psych center and get some counseling. He went and the psychologist tried to tell him he has A.D.D. (which may or may not be true, but it wasn't really the issue he was there to seek out help for). So he stopped going but it was soon pretty clear that this wasn't some passing event. I think it might have been in his childhood too. I asked him why he never did more activities as a kid and he said that he didn't want to bother his parents and make them have to take time to come to practices or games or anything like that (and I know his parents and sisters and they are not negligent or mean parents).

Sometimes when I spent the night at his place, he bolts up in the middle of the night in a panic. I don't mean like whiny, attention-seeking behavior, I'm talking real mental distress. After a party once, with his friend crashing on the couch outside his bedroom, I made a silly joke about death as we were dozing off and he freaked out and bolted out of bed to the front yard and it took a good fifteen minutes to calm him down and convince him to go back inside. That's happened twice since I've known him, but generally he doesn't talk about his depression or his thoughts (to 'not worry me') and I thought it might have calmed down until he graduated a few weeks ago. He applied to a fellowship and a teach-English-in-China program. The fellowship rejected him and he told me plainly that he doesn't want to go to China, but 'what else can he do'? His friends are slowly leaving town for their own careers and he's convinced he will never do anything with his degree because he has no interests or passion for anything. He tried going back to the clinic once more after that but they seem to be going in the wrong direction and counseling him on 'changing his negative thoughts' but I don't think he even told them the full extent of his depression.

He's a smart, wonderful man but he's plagued by these feelings that it's too late for him, he's squandered all his opportunities, and he won't ever do anything with his life but worry me and he wants better than that for me. It breaks my heart to see him like this and I stay up at night worrying about him. I can't do much in person right now because I'm 300 miles away on a research internship until August but I desperately need to find help for him. I don't even know what I'd do if he hurt himself or worse. His parents and friends don't know, I don't think, but I don't want to tell them. Counseling isn't helping him and he's been getting more and more depressed since graduation in May. I asked him when the last time he thought about suicide was a couple of days ago and he said 'yesterday'.

I'll do my best to remember and regurgitate it onto nosleep for you fine folks.  Actually, no sleep is the reason I'm posting this.  Reading through a number of posts made me think about what experiences I had been privy to.  Then like a brick to the face I remembered November of 2006.  I remember the month and year exactly because the game F.E.A.R had just come out and I was playing it quite frequently at work after hours.

Some background first.  I had just graduated college that year with a totally useless BFA.  And now I was interning at an office (I'm leaving some pertinent details out on purpose) back in my home town.  The office building isn't your typical brick and mortar stack.  They had renovated an old church which was originally built in the 20's.  Again, not a typical church by any means.  The main rotunda where most of the cubicles are is gigantic, with a diameter of about 125-150 feet.  I'm not exaggerating on the math, the area is gigantic.  All over are sections of Herman Miller cubicles.  On one wall is a two story tall 5000 pipe organ which the owners had fixed and hooked up to a computer.  Anything midi would play through the massive pipes and fill the room with incredibly robust organ music.  It was really quite impressive the first few times I heard it play.  It did the opening to 'Light My Fire' really well, and 'Stairway to Heaven' was also really cool to hear.  They mostly turned it on when clients came for a tour.

Around the second story of the organ, is a balcony which surrounds the entire rotunda, wrapping around the edges.  In the back is an ascending set of pews that was originally used to seat the choir, but now functions as a lecture area for visiting classes of students.  The ceiling, which is very detailed with little plaster inlays and the like, had chandeliers which provided next to no light.  The chandeliers were easily 40 feet off the ground, and attached to the ceiling which sloped from the outside of the rotunda inward into an oculus.  The oculus was roughly 60 feet off the ground level where everyone worked.  It has a sky painted on it and is lit by lights positioned behind a ledge around it.  I had been up there a few times through an 'attic' access.  The only other lighting was this really annoying 'emergency' lighting that was installed to provide adequate lighting.  But they were these hideous white florescent fixtures that were attached to various spots, and pointing up, because the ceiling was too high to mount anything reasonable.  

My apologizes for the long winded description, but I can't help but feel like it helps me to delay writing the whole point of this post.

At the time, I lived in an apartment complex less than six blocks from the office.  So getting to and from work was a casual walk past shops, a few bars and a fair number of pedestrians.  But when I walked the last block around the bend to the office, it was always very desolate.  There were people once in a while, but it's on an off street and didn't have a lot of foot traffic.  So the area adjacent to the building was always dark at night, other than the landscape and building lighting.

Now, getting to the point, I can't help but hesitate as I type knowing in my rational mind that what happened couldn't have possibly happened outside of my own active imagination.  But it doesn't really take away the feeling that I had, and still have when I recall the details.

When I started working there, I was hired as an IT intern, which didn't really consist of much work other than troubleshooting and menial tasks.  I did get my own cubicle though, which was on the far corner of the main rotunda, with my back to the two story organ.

The head of IT was in the cubicle next to mine so he could easily call for me and give me things to do.  I was lucky to have a very fast workstation, which when paired with a spare video card I had, made for an excellent gaming rig.  In fact it was better than my home computer by a long stretch.  I had free reign to stay as long as I wanted after work as long as I didn't log billable hours when not actually doing any work.  So I often stayed till 8-9 at night playing games, skyping, and taking advantage of their insane internet connection.  I also had to make sure before I left that nobody else was there when I set the alarm.  

They often had people working on projects very late, and took their security very seriously.  Each entrance had RFID locks, and within the building itself there were doors everywhere that had RFID locks on them to prevent wandering clients from entering confidential areas.  They also had cameras outside looking over the parking lot and at each doorway.  Even my security code for the alarm was tied to my social security number.  So if I locked the place, they knew it was me who did it, in addition to the security footage of me leaving.  The whole place was designed to passively secure.  Not iron bars everywhere, but rather ways to track who did what, where and when.
So I made sure to check each level of the building before I left at night.  First using the intercom, then if there was no answer to the extension I broadcasted, walking to each level to double check.

From where I sat at my desk, I could hear every sound from the rotunda, and the hallway that wrapped around the outside of it.  So doors opening, etc, I could hear very clearly.  I was always freaked out when I heard the main employee door opening and shutting late at night.  All the double doors facing outside were metal and made a loud clunking noise when the maglock was release and when opened and closed.  On the inside between departments were solid glass doors, which also made the clunking noise when unlocked with a wave of an RFID card.  So whenever I heard that familiar clunk I knew somebody was unlocking the door and either leaving or entering.

One afternoon I got the game F.E.A.R in the mail at work.  I had everything sent there as my apartment didn't have a mailroom and it was just easier.  I had heard a lot about the game, and I was giddy with excitement to play a paranormal fps.  It seemed like such a cool idea at the time.  I also loved being scared by choice.  Not shocked like hostel or saw or the bullshit omen remake.  I hate the kind of gay shit where the screen flashes to a demon head accompanied by a 1000 decibel screeching which startles you more than frightens you.  What I always loved were the spine tingling experiences, Alien and Aliens, The Thing, etc.  Dark corners containing who knows what, in an isolated foreign environment.  Hell yeah.

I started playing F.E.A.R (for sake of typing, refered to as FEAR henceforth my good sirs) the moment the head of IT left for the day around 4.  Nobody ever passed by my corner of the room, so I could do whatever I wanted really.  I was playing with headphones on and got really immersed in the game.  I hadn't even noticed the hours tick by until the lights went off.  I stared up at the ceiling, paused my game and muttered ""Fuck, every god damn time"" under my breath.  But I knew that when the lights went off, it was past 9.  They always blink 10 minutes before they shut off at 9.  It wasn't pitch black by any means.  All the annoying ground level florescent lights still lit the room decently enough, but in a very pale way.  I knew I wasn't done with the game so I got up and walked to the end of the rotunda to press a little button which override the light timer for an hour, and the lights in the rotunda flickered back to life.  As I walked past the giant pipe organ I heard a very loud banging sound from the balcony area.  I stopped in my tracks for a second and then breathed a sigh of relief when I remember that the building still had the original vents for heating around the perimeter of the balcony by the two story tall windows the encircled the rotunda.  It was the heat kicking on and it occasionally caused the old vents to shudder.

I sat back down at my desk, unpaused the game and put my headphones on.  This part, I remember very vividly, it still makes me a little uneasy thinking back on it.  About a minute after I started playing again, my character was walking down an empty hall when I heard very distant children's singing.  I took my hands off the keyboard and sat there with my headphones on, not sure if it was coming from the game or not.  I took my headphones off and the singing stopped.  I put the headphones on again but didn't hear the singing.  This really spooked me, a person who doesn't mind playing a game like fear alone in an office that's decidedly creepy at night.

I took the headphones off again and held them in my hands, listening to my own breathing with what I'm sure was a very skeptical look on my face.  I actually shook my head, thinking how silly I was being.  As I started to lift my hands to put my headphones back on, I heard the child singing again, clear as a bell.  I literally froze in place, staring at my computer screen.  The voice was again, very distant, but was clearly coming from within the room.  There was no mistake about it.  I couldn't make out the words being said, and to be honest, the chills I get now thinking about it pale in comparison to the bone numbing chill I had going through my body at the time.  I sat there for what couldn't have been longer than 10 seconds, listening to that voice for what felt like an eternity.  I could not fucking believe what I was hearing.

As abruptly as it started, it stopped, and I couldn't move an inch, my breathing halted and I listened carefully.  Sitting there for a solid minute I decided it was time to call it a night.  My first thought was to book it for the door as fast as I could manage, and sprint home.  But I knew I was probably just imagining the voice, a result of playing a horror genre game for hours after a full day of work.  I was scared regardless, and quickly closed out fear and put my computer to sleep.  As I was gathering my things into my bag, I heard the familiar maglock by the employee entrance unlocking with a clunk and the door opening and shutting.  The relief that washed over me was intense, a veritable wave of happiness coursed through my body.  I very casually threw the last of my items into my bag as I heard footsteps coming from the front door.  I made my way to the hallway to greet my savior before I left.  Just as I opened the side door near my cubicle and saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I glance over my right shoulder at the pipe organ with it's plethora of exposed pipes and stopped for a moment to scan the pipes.  I saw a feint shadow that seemed out of place on the far end, on the second story of the pipes.  It looked like a different color shadow, like it was being cast through an opaque sheet of glass.  Then it moved.  Not a trees shadow kind of movement, but a very deliberate movement away from the organ.  I know this because it grew in size like it was moving towards a light source.  My entire body was instantly covered with goosebumps and my eyes opened wide before I said, ""Fuck that"" to myself and walked quickly through the door into the hallway.  I heard the glass door around the corner unlock with that same clunk, and almost ran in that direction to at least feel the presence of a familiar person.  As I rounded the corner, I pushed on the glass door just before it closed and found myself alone in the front reception area.  I called very meekly down hallway opposite the reception area across from me.  My heart quite literally sank, knowing that I had just heard the outside door unlock, footsteps enter, walk down this hallway and my grip was on the handle of a clear door which had just been walked through.

To be quite honest, at that point I thought I had to be hallucinating.  I heard those doors open all the time, and playing that game was making my imagination run wild.  I walked to the employee door facing the parking lot, entered my security code and walked out of the building.  I should also mention that the head IT guy was a huge fan of lost, and made the alarm countdown sound, which played throughout the intercom system, the same as the hatch countdown sound.  That made me feel oddly relieved hearing that sound.

Please don't read this section if you haven't finished the story, some spoilers kinda.  You've been warned.

Edit:  I still keep in touch with the head of IT there, so I'm going to try to get in there next weekend and take some pictures of the locations I'm talking about.  I think they'll give you a better idea of how the space felt to stand in.  I'll just post them in this thread.  And thanks for the kind words from everybody.

Edit 2: I think it would be better to shoot a video of my steps in addition to the photos.  That should give a good sense of the space and exactly how everything is oriented.  It's a bit tough to explain the floor plan of the place with words, it's very complex.

Edit 3 Update: I spoke with the head of IT guy today, he still works there thankfully.  He wrote me that it wouldn't be a problem, he said this weekend was going to be busy for them and I could just buzz my way in.  He said he'd make a key so I could get access to the server room to take a snapshot of it.  It's kind of his baby and he's proud of how organized it is, so I think he was pleased as punch that I want to take a photo of it.  I don't know who's working this weekend or if I know them, but I'll head over there Saturday afternoon.  And I'm taking a friend with me because the thought of going through that corridor still gives me the creeps.  There's a 100% chance of this video going up, I'm not going to pull some bullshit where I stop responding a day beforehand to pretend like the ghost killed me for returning or something fucktarded like that.  I'll do my best to give a walking tour.  Should be interesting, I haven't been back there since."

hsj0l,1,2011-06-05,Do any Redditors ride their bikes to work?,Say_Hey,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hsj0l/do_any_redditors_ride_their_bikes_to_work/,"I've been thinking about riding my bike to work a couple of times a week.  my job is between 8-10 miles from my house depending in which route I take.  The area I live in, Central New Jersey (USA), is fairly pedestrian friendly.  There are lots of sidewalks/crosswalks.  However, New Jersey definitely has an over abundance of asshole drivers.

I did a mini test run today (rode about halfway there) and it seems ok.  I did run into a creeper, but I just crossed to the other side of the street.  I'm not so much worried about the time it takes to get there.  I'll just leave an hour early for work.

Positives of doing this:

-Save money on gas
-Get/stay in shape.  I love to run, however I work two jobs and I'm doing an internship, so that doesn't leave as much time to run and jog as much as I would like.  So riding my bike would be a nice way to exercise
-I would get to enjoy the nice summer weather
-Riding a bike is just a lot of fun

Negatives:
-Asshole NJ drivers
-May be a bit dangerous in the areas with heavier traffic
-I would have to adjust my schedule accordingly.
-Creepers

So does anyone else ride their bikes to work?  Do you enjoy it and is it something you would recommend?"
htsd3,1,2011-06-07,Reddit: Am I Naive? (Employment help),braiker,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htsd3/reddit_am_i_naive_employment_help/,"Reddit, I need your help.  I don't know what I should be doing with my life.  I know I shouldn't have to ask the hivemind for guidance like this, but it seems as though I'm either naive or biased and I can't ignore my feelings.  

First, a little background: I graduated HS in 2000, top 10% of my class.  I went to Univ. of Maryland and failed out and then I came home to go to community college and ultimately graduated college with a Bachelor's Degree (BA) in Accounting with a 2.8 GPA.  It took me almost 10 years to graduate college, although I did skip semesters here and there.  All the while, I was working as a bartender in various restaurants to be able to live comfortably, and pay rent, car payments, car insurance, etc.
While in school I read an article regarding adult ADHD, which almost described my personality exactly and decided to see a shrink for it.  I was prescribed ritalin and immediately saw an improvement in my note taking abilities and retention and I used it until I graduated.

When I graduated, I had a very difficult time finding work.  Most jobs I applied to were looking for someone with office experience or internships of which I had zero on my resume.  Finally, I was able to get an internship at a non-profit in accounts payable which ultimately landed me a job in a family owned real estate business earning 40K with benefits as a property manager.  Unfortunately, the boss in the business was a shady person and asked me if I could cook his books so he could jack up rents in renovated apartments in a recently purchased building (he kicked the previous tenants out after purchase).  While I was property manager, I continued to work as a bartender on the weekends and worked 6 days/week for the better part of a year.  
When the boss asked me to commit fraud, I quit the property management job.  I still had my bartending job and I really wanted to spend the winter skiing.  Since I had some extra funds, I picked up a goPro.  I loved editing the [movies](http://www.youtube.com/supertreegeek) I made with my goPro. I had asperations of becoming a film editor, but I wasn't interested in going back to school so I kept the filmmaking to a hobby.  

Now, I've picked up homebrewing, and I know I can make good beer ( my friends love it) and I'm torn because I have a good idea for a brewery, but my local area is lacking a homebrew supply store and I know the perfect location, which I want to turn into a homebrew supply store/brew your own beer store (a place where people can brew beer without having to make a mess in their homes).  The problem is, I do not have much capital.  I know I can make this dream happen!   

I was explaining my situation to my girlfriend the other day and I need to get a second job, because while bartending is paying the bills, I'm living paycheck to paycheck, I need to start saving more money.  

Here's my dilemma:
I'm the type of person that learns by doing more than anything else.  I learned to become a bartender by watching other bartenders and making drinks.  I am a great bartender and I usually make between $1000-$1500/week bartending (I only work friday, saturday and sunday).  But I am good at my job because I have a solid work ethic and I genuinely like to make people happy (and get them drunk).  
I know it seems that bartending is the only thing I know, but it is not.  I have ~1 year of office experience and I am well-versed in Word and Excel (I can create all sorts of spreadsheets, I know many of the formulas, etc.).  I am also good with photoshop, illustrator, imovie and I can learn most computer programs rather quickly.  
I am also mechanically inclined.  I love to work with my hands and build and take apart items, and tinker with them.  I fixed the dryer in our house by cannibalizing parts from another dryer.  I had no manual, nor did I look online for instructions.  I just figured it out. 

**How can I convey my ability to learn-by-doing and good work ethic to prospective employers without them dismissing me (and my cover letter and resume) immediately because of my lack of experience?**

TL;DR: I'm all over the place, and I don't know how to get myself grounded somewhere.

htr0c,1,2011-06-07,Really feeling like there's no way out right now...,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htr0c/really_feeling_like_theres_no_way_out_right_now/,"This is probably going to end up being a bit lengthy, so bear with me.

So back in March I moved out of my previous housing and into a house with some friends, thinking my cost of living would go down.  I went from living with one other person paying $350 a month to living with four others, paying closer to $400 a month.  This happened because the house they were living in is built so horribly that, to keep our house around 60 degress F our gas bill was around $300 a month.  So add that onto a $240 rent, and other bills and I was paying through the ass for this place.  So while I was living there March and April, I chose to pay bills and buy food instead of rent because I wasn't on the lease and they weren't being forced to pay it at the time.  Also, since January I only go out with my friends once a week and I barely spend anything, so it's not like all my money is going to a bar.  I was thinking of moving back home with my parent's, but I don't really know if I can A) Ditch my friends like that or B) because my dad turned my bedroom into his office and my sister's old room I don't think would do.  Also, my girlfriend and I would really have nowhere to go because she's stuck at her dad's place until she finds a job (just graduated; job search going bad).  We're barely see each other as is and with that arrangement it'd be non-existent.  

On top of the $960.00 I need for rent until I move out in August, my allergies are making it extremely hard to work my two jobs.  They're so severe that I've been reprimanded and work for blowing my nose and putting in eye drops so often.  I don't do it for pleasure or to get out of working - it's necessary (I work at a presitigious burger joint in the area as a server).  I want to get to the doctor, but I work so damn often and just can't afford it right now.  I have one day off a week and I normally spend it with the girlfriend.  To spend that time at the doctor would mean even less time with her.  I'm getting little to no sleep due to allergies also.  Last night I got home from Job A at 1.00am and had to be up at 6.00am to make it to Job B by 7.00am.  I fell asleep at 1.30am, awoke at 2.00am, and didn't fall asleep again until 5.15-5.30 am.  I woke up at 6.00am, and have felt like absolute SHIT so far not to mention, on top of working Job B until 3.30pm today I work Job A again from 5.00 until 10.00 tonight.

What I'm getting at is that I've never felt so low.  I feel like every time I climb a little higher out of this hole, I slip and fall further into it.  I need to get to the doctor, but what needs to be done to control this allergies isn't going to be cheap.  I'm already late for this month's rent so I can't really spend too much at the doctor's getting shots (in the past we've tried every medication to no avail).  For the past month I've only been able to eat one meal a day that consists of either ramen noodles or one footlong at Subway (6 inch for lunch and 6inch for dinner).  Also, I go out once a week with my girlfriend's friends (it lets me relax only a little and she used to work at the bar we go to so we get cheap, if not free, drinks.  Most I've spent there is $15 and that was after about five hours of drinking).  I haven't had the money for rent so I'm trying to spend as little as possible until i have that covered.  Once that's covered I'm hoping to go shopping so I have grocieries (if bills aren't a shit ton).

On top of working around 50 hours a week, getting no sleep, and barely eating, I need to be studying to take my CCENT and CCNA tests this summer so I can possibly get a job/internship to supplement classes and another job for this fall.  I barely get to study because I'm always too fatigued to focus.  I don't want to do the server job during the school year because it'd be way too much on top of school and the extra curriculars I participate in.  I'd rather it be an internship and my office job, but chances are I'll end up serving because there are no internships available around my area.

I know there are people worse off than me, but I don't know what I'm going to do.  I was hoping to save a bit of money to get a more fuel efficient car to save money on gas, but I don't see that happening.  I was hoping to take a small trip with the girlfriend at the end of summer, but don't see that happening.  I was thinking of selling some stuff to help put a dent in what I owe/will owe, but the only things I have of value are my PS3 and computer.  The computer can't go because I need it for school (I'm a CIS/Networking Major) and the PS3 can't go because it's the only form of entertainment I have.  I don't play games, I just watch movies on my parent's Netflix (I actually don't have any games).  The only things I could sell are a broken XBox 360 I have, old laptop parts from a Dell Inspiron, or my old fish tank.  I think altogether that would net me like, $120 (on the high end).  I think I'm going to try throwing that stuff on eBay this weekend.

I don't really expect help, honestly I don't.  I just needed to vent.  I tried talking to my dad this morning, but he just sweeps everything away and offers no real advice.  My mom is about the same - no words of wisdom, just sweepage.  I try to stay positive for the girlfriend also because she's under a bit of stress as well with finishing her capstone and spending hours a day job searching and resume sending.  It's getting extremely difficult to keep this charade of positivity going for her sake, but I don't want to freak her out.   


tl;dr - Deep in a hole and can't get out - pun not intended."
htja7,1,2011-06-07,"My lil bro is a wow-addict, meth abuser, theif, failing student and cutter.",airchair-kid,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htja7/my_lil_bro_is_a_wowaddict_meth_abuser_theif/,"I want my brother to stop cutting, stop stealing, stop doing drugs, to play in moderation, and to go to college / vo-tech.

My brother is failing highschool, does drugs during school. He also plays wow all day and steals when he is unable to play. If he cannot play, he will cut himself, threaten to kill his family, strike his parents, damage household items, and then run away from home or get arrested. He hates his family (me, mom, dad)

I'm the exact opposite. attending a top ivy, interned at great companies, and for the most part, on my way to a stable life. I'm never home and currently on the sidelines, but I really want to do something about this, since I know he'll end up on the streets if I don't do something. I would give up the internships I slaved away years for, my girlfriend I've been dating several years, and even drop out of college!

My parents won't be able to help much. they are both disabled - one mentally, the other one physically. Thus my family is very poor.



I believe WoW is central to the problem, although not the only problem. However, I feel getting him over WoW would be a significant step up and can build momentum to attack other things (confidence, schooling). The main reason being that he last said he hated me for blocking WoW and returned to drugs because of that. He also mentioned how happy he was, and how he didn't need drugs for the times he did play. He might just be trying to guilt me though - his words are hard to trust, except i actually believe this.


I know for a fact bribing him with rewards doesn't work with anyone with such a huge lifestyle change. He refuses to do anything except play/eat/hang out with friends/shower/listen to music/spend hours dressing up and ruining my work clothes (ugh). So here are some ideas I've come up with. extremely rough.



Play with him a little and build relationship with him so I have stronger influence over his decisions. Do other activities he likes with him. This may be the only way to communicate with him without being in a heated situation.

Let him play, but ask him to play at home instead of running away. He can invite friends over. Will use a lot of positive reinforcement when he doesn't play.

Let him play, but force him to play when he doesn't want to. Maybe he'll get sick of playing this way eventually.

Travel with him. Try to accomplish a goal we have in common to build a relationship with him. The travel can also give him new hobbies.

Get a pet dog in the house, to at least get him off the game. He'll have to take care of the dog. eventually get him to run with the dog etc.

This one is crazy lol. Get hot girls to talk to him and encourage him to do other things. Use hotgirls to reinforce when he does more positive things with his life. crazy I know... but sex is one of the most basic drives. This will probably hurt him and make things even worse though.


Anyone have any tips?"
htiz4,3,2011-06-07,Intentionally ambiguous working hours are killing me. Suggestions for how to get a more regular schedule?,badboss69,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htiz4/intentionally_ambiguous_working_hours_are_killing/,"Hi Reddit--
I'm an engineer at a relatively small software company. I work very hard (read: NO reddit at work) and often don't take lunch breaks so I can continue working. I like to think I have a steady output of code that is of at least medium quality. 

Anyhow, when I started the job, the boss said something like ""come in whenever you like, but generally around 9 or so""--standard cs job protocol. Because I take the train to work, and I am at the mercy of its schedule, for me this initially meant coming in at 9:30. For a while, I was an intern, and because the boss explicitly said ""we can't afford to pay you overtime"", as often as I could be, I was out of the office by 5:30 flat. 

I recently transitioned into being a full employee, and got a small raise to signify this. Because I was used to it, I continued to arrive at work around 9:30, but started to leave later, generally around 6:30. Many days, I would be there before my coworkers, but either way, I always left after them. Also, because I still didn't take lunch breaks, and my coworkers took at least an hour, I continued to actually work 1-2 more hours per day than my coworkers. 

Well one day, the assing train got held up for 45 minutes, and I was late to a supposedly important meeting. Boss was super pissed, gave me a massive tongue lashing, etc. etc. At the end of his rant, he mentioned ""you always come in late anyhow, the least you could do would be to arrive earlier!"" 

I sent him a pointed email that night assuring him that I would now be arriving at work at 8:30 every day from now on, and not leaving until at least 6. I informed him that I didn't realize the hours were a problem...Well, this resulted in an awkward meeting the next day in which he said he wished we could all be ""Flexible"" with hour hours. He assured me ""I've got friends who don't leave work until midnight, you're really got it made here!"", etc. etc. 

The thing is, after this meeting, I've really come to realize what he means by ""flexible"". He has become tyrannical in his enforcement of hours. Though I now arrive at 8:30 every day (mind you, he often gets in at 11, and ""works from home"" 1-2 days a week), I now find that I am completely unable to leave before he does without an excuse. And because he gets in at 11, he tends to work much later. I have had to resort to inventing scenarios whereby I ""have to"" leave in the evenings--when i'm leaving at 7:30 after having been at work for 11 hours straight.  As if needing to stop working because I have been doing it for 11 hours already, and more importantly, needing to EAT, are not ""excuses"" enough to leave. 

My boss has the train schedule posted above his desk, and here is his worst, most psychological trick: He knows which train I have been taking home, and if I leave at any other time than when I usually do, he will ask ""which train are you taking again?"" in the most probing, insincere, ""how dare you leave my workplace after only working 10.5 hours"" kind of way. Most of the time, I am leaving at this other time because I am taking the train in the opposite direction (to see my brother for dinner, for instance), and it has a different schedule.

But the supreme consequence of all of this is that I feel completely trapped at work. I must either wait until the boss leaves, which can be a while because he arrives at work 1.5 hours later than I do, or I must be prepared to ""Explain"" why I am heading out. 

I've found myself working from 8:30 until 7:30, without a lunch break, almost every day since this ""incident"". It is draining me in every possible way. 

A further complication is that it actually may be illegal for me to be working these hours. Though I am a salaried employee, my salary is below the cutoff for overtime pay exemption. This is a whole different matter, but something I often wonder about...

And one final issue, I do have a coworker, who is for some reason unnecessarily competitive. I have been working these hours not by choice, but out of a feeling of desperation...but he takes all of this as a sign of competitiveness, and he has taken to trying to ""beat"" my hours by coming in earlier and leaving later. He hates it too, I know it, but he has dramatically misunderstood the situation. Interestingly, I have the feeling that my boss wishes to encourage this ""competition"" (which I honestly would like to have no part whatsoever in), because it means his worker bees work more and he reaps the benefits...

Tomorrow I am meeting for my 9 month review, and I desperately want to tell my boss how much I despise my 11 hour days...the intentionally ambiguous hours-setting that leaves me overworked and under-motivated...the unnecessary scrutiny I receive for simply wishing to go home at the end of the day and eat dinner...the inherent hypocrisy of my boss, who works *at least* 15 fewer hours per week than I do, enforcing such stringent regulations.

But I have no idea how to approach the issue. After the last meeting, I am scared to say anything at all. If I do, I am positive that his response will once again be that I should remain ""flexible"". I hate this word more than any he has ever said. I hate this idea that work hours can be ""flexible"", that my boss can have maximal power over my time and my life.

I'm sorry this is so long, I am just rambling on over the internet because I have no idea what else I can do at this point. If anyone has any advice, or has been in such a ""flexible"" situation before, please let me know what you have done to keep things manageable. 

INB4 ""quit ur job lol"", I get this all the time but it really isn't practical. It is hard enough to find a job these days, you've got to take what you can get...

TL;DR: jerky boss won't let me leave in the evenings, expects 11 hour days but only works 4 days a week himself..."

I'm a Dutch student from Holland and plan on starting my graduation internship in Melbourne. At the moment I am trying to figure out where I should look to find cheap and simple student rooms in Melbourne.

I already found a couple of student accomodation company's but the prices are a bit too high for my monthly budget. The pricerange I am looking for is around $480 a month. Is it even possible to find a student room around this price in Melbourne, or am is it just wishfull thinking?

If you have any tips or advice on where I should look, like websites, or organisations, then please let me know. I would really appreciate that.

Thank's for your time!

hunxi,3,2011-06-08,"Reddit, around $15,000+/- was stolen from my mothers house..what else do we need to do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hunxi/reddit_around_15000_was_stolen_from_my_mothers/,"I'm just a lurker but the time has come and I may need some advice.

First I would like to apologize if this ends up being rather long, but I would like to cover as much info as I can.  Also I am sorry for any typos or confusion, my mind has been racing since this happened and I am furious.  I am sure I missed some parts of the story as all of this has been very frustrating.

**Background info:**  My mothers house was robbed on Saturday 6/4, did not find out until Monday 6/6.  Police were notified and are conducting a investigation.

**The Incident:**  My entire family was at a wedding reception (6/4) and sometime between 4:30pm and 8:30pm our house was robbed.  The worst part of it is it was my cousin, a drug addict (heroin and crack).  She has not been around the family for ~1 year and while everyone was away at the reception she had two friends drive her to the house.  I had spoken with one of the individuals who was in the vehicle with her and his side of the story was that my cousin asked for a ride to her fathers house to get money from an insurance claim from her vehicle that was stolen and wrecked (drug deal related).  He claims that they dropped her off on the side of the road up past our house (we live in the country).  After she was done doing gathering up the valuables she called one of the two individuals in the vehicle and said to come back down the road and that she was ready. They picked her up in front of the house and he said she came out with two large bags and two shoe boxes.  He claims he did not know what was in them and that he wasn't involved (obviously doesn't want in trouble). After that he claims they gave her a ride into town, which is where she pawned off roughly 6k worth of my mothers jewelery.

Fast forward to Monday.  My mother could not find her laptop and thought she misplaced it (she is very forgetful).  I am away during the week doing my internship and I was on the phone with her, I mentioned that I could not find the shoebox which contained my xbox 360 (I recently moved back from college and a majority of my belongings were still in boxes in one of our rooms).  I suspected that something was fishy and that it was a good idea to go double check a few places for the laptop and xbox.  She had called me back later, already in tears, as she realized we had been robbed.  She  checked places where she had valuable items hidden (jewelry) and that was the giveaway.  Police were notified, came out and took our information and tried gathering some prints which came up with nothing.  We had suspected it was my cousin, as she has been on drugs for the past year and isn't welcome around the family for numerous reasons (several minor thefts of many family members) and that the time of the reception would have been an excellent window for her to commit the crime.  The police said they would work with what information they had.  Supposedly they check pawn stores/jewelry shops for events like this, however they only do it once a month, which of course everything would be gone by then.  Soon as the cop leaves my mom rushes into town to check some shops.  The second jewelry store she went had a majority of jewelry, therefore my mother had called the cops.  This was a huge sigh of relief, as they keep records of everyone they buy from and had a copy of her identification, as well as pictures of all the jewelry she sold to them. By this time the mall was already closing and we would have to wait until the following day to do anything else.

The next day a police officer went to the mall and acquired the jewelry.  My mother and I went around to several other places looking for more jewelry as well as the laptops and xbox, which came up with nothing.  After some personal investigation and several phone calls later, we found out she had been staying at a hotel for the previous two days where she was smoking crack with some other people.  By the time the police had arrived they had already checked out, the room was in her ex-boyfriends name.

Later in the evening, my mother went back to the mall to look for my items, she had found some watches at one of the jewelry stores, but the owner was rather rude, he already yelled at my mom for calling the cops and said she should have left them out of it.  He told her if she paid $1600 he would have gave her everything back. She called the police again, but they would not send anyone out because the officer dealing with the case was off-duty.

A second jewelry store, which the female driver of the vehicle just so happens to work at, may have had some items as well, that the female had sold to the store herself (it was in their books). It was dated prior to the incident, however I suspect she wrote a prior date to save her ass.  The story was that she came in with her father to sell the jewelry, however my uncle is really good friends with her father and had talked to him and he said that she was lying and he was never with her. She barely stays at home and her dad said he knows she does drugs already.  The owner was also rather rude to my mother and said there is nothing she can do, as he already shipped the jewelry away to be melted.

This is where I am looking for any advice, it has been a stressful last two days, and I think we handled everything properly although you never know.  We already contacted our home owners insurance and opened a claim.  We are still busy trying to identify which items are missing and making a detailed list for both the police and insurance company.  We are not worried about the remaining items as insurance will cover it, however what we want to make sure is done is justice to be served.  There has been a huge drug problem in the county for years now (Indiana, Pennsylvania).  It seems every time an arrest is made, charges never stick and people are let go or given very minor charges.  I wouldn't be surprised if the other two individuals who gave her a ride are not charged with anything.  Supposedly the one girl, who owned the vehicle already spoke with the police earlier this morning and said she did not know the items that my cousin came out with were stolen. I had personally spoke with the other individual that was along for the ride in the car and he said he knew it was suspicious but didn't want to know what was in the bag or whom it belonged to, however he does know our house so I am sure it was just a line of bull as he does not want to get in trouble.  He also has a history of crimes and drug use.  Is there anyway they can charge the individuals in the vehicle with any type of crime, such as being an accomplice even though they claim they had nothing to do with it? I mean they gave her a ride for a insurance check, yet she came back with 15,000 worth of stolen items.  

**TL;DR** Mothers house was robbed by drug addict cousin (roughly 15k worth of items) It seems like very little is being done, and we wouldn't have even recovered the items we did or gained information if it wasnt for our own personal investigation, which we relayed all information to the police."

hw7nx,7,2011-06-10,My father seems to be giving up.,worriedson42,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hw7nx/my_father_seems_to_be_giving_up/,"I received a phone call today from my uncle (aunt's second husband who happens to be a doctor) about my diabetic father.  He was reaching out to me because, as he put it, he couldn't stand by and not reach out to me and my siblings while my dad allowed his health to deteriorate to the point that he could hurt himself of die.

According to to my uncle, my 58 year old father has consciously not been taking his insulin, he's dropped a bunch of weight, and is most likely suffering from some kind of clinical depression.  My uncle has also told me that my father has been lying about taking his insulin and that when finally caught in the lie, expressed that his reason for not taking his medication is that he no longer wants to live.

The depression thing isn't really something out of the blue, my dad checked himself into a psychiatric hospital shortly after leaving (some would say abandoning) my mother and me and my brother and sister.  I didn't actually find out about this psychiatric episode until years later.  My sister and I happened to be in college at the time, but my brother was 15 and still finishing high school.  Our house ended up getting foreclosed on and things were pretty tough for a while there.  I'm pretty sure he's been on some regiment of anti-depressants, zoloft, prozac, etc. since.

My mother thinks that my father may suffer from undiagnosed bi-polar disorder and talks about how he would have these manic phases followed by, as she put it, ""hitting rock bottom"".

A little context would help here, I think.  My dad founded and owned a very successful home building company in the 80's.  At one point, he was a millionaire, had a company jet, nice cars, etc.  My mom refers that that as the ""Gatsby days"".  Apparently there was some kind of scandal between him and a young intern at the company and he was forced out of the company that he founded with his brother.  Things seemed ok for a while, from the perspective of an 10 year old anyway.

As I got older, I noticed that we stopped going on vacation, my mom had to get a job substitute teaching so that we had healthcare for my younger brother who had asthma since my dad was technically self-employed (he was a real estate developer), things stopped getting fixed around the house, etc. and then my dad had an episode with his health where he went into a diabetic coma and from that point forward, he was a diabetic, making getting health insurance even more difficult.

Flash forward to my sophomore year in college and my father is having to go out of state to find work as a building contractor and one day just isn't answering calls and we find out that my mom and brother have to be out of the house we grew up in because it is being foreclosed.

Eventually my dad divorced my mom, which is really strange since she probably had more of a reason to divorce than he did and she still wanted to work things out.

To say that the relationship between my father and his kids was strained would be an understatement. From the age of 20 until about 28, I probably spoke to my father less than 10 times.  We were all still reeling from our family, as we knew it, being torn apart when he left, although my younger sister and brother seemed to reach out to him earlier than I did.

They say time heals all wounds and eventually we all began having a somewhat ""normal"" relationship with our dad, to the point that we keep up with each other on a pretty consistent basis, which can be difficult since everyone in my immediate family live in different cities (although in the same region).  He happens to be a pretty fun, funny, intelligent guy to hang out with, now that we're all adults.

So the most current status is that he has been living in my aunt and uncle's second house, rent free, for the past 2 years, I believe he was living with his mother before that, and had remarried and then divorced before that.  He has been having a hard time finding work.  He works as a contractor and the economy hasn't been so hot in the housing sector, in case you hadn't heard.  I've also come to discover that he's having legal trouble, the nature of which I hope to discover when I go visit him this weekend with my brother.  He's supposed to be going to the doctor tomorrow to get a check up and get back on insulin, as well as get his head scanned.  Part of the new found focus seems to be from that fact that my sister is pregnant again after miscarrying her first pregnancy, although I hope this is more than just trying to prevent himself from dying before her first child is born so as not to stress out my sister and put the pregnancy in jeopardy.  I hope he has a genuine intrest in seeing his first grandchild born and grow up.

I feel like my dad's life has seen a lot of great success, only to be punctuated by great loss.  He lost a fortune, for a time, his family, and now he can't find consistent work, is most likely being sued, and is bumming a place to stay off his brother-in-law.  He's always had a veneer of contentment and happiness, although lately it seems like most of the conversations I've been having with him are rote and pretty superficial.  He doesn't really want to share anything real about how he's doing, just that he hasn't been ""handling things very well"" and that he doesn't want to burden us.  He's also always been a proud, if not completely honest, man.

I and my siblings do love him very much and I don't want to see him give up and maim himself or die because life is hard.  This whole thing seems really passive aggressive.  He doesn't seem happy and when I pressed him about trying to turn things around with his health and with his life, there was an aire of uncertainty about the whole thing that was very disconcerting.

I know that we have to be supportive and let him know that the people in his life love and care what happens to him.  I don't think he's a lost cause.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text.  I needed to get that off my chest.

Thanks."

I trudged through a bachelors in Finance and did slightly mediocre due to my lack of interest.

For the past year I did a marketing internship and now being a consultant for a startup company. I currently have a part time job that pays very well for the most part on weekends and no qualms of that.

Recently I took a trip to the west coast and met some people who were willing to help me with a job offer either there or in another state in the east coast. I thought this was awesome, finally able to pursue my career into something I might enjoy. I arrived back and told my parents.

At first there was nothing said. They didn't seem to think I was serious. As I constantly kept mentioning to them I guess started to hit them that I might want to live out of the state.

I'm at work and I get a call from my mom just a few minutes ago what the starting salary would be. I told her that I really don't know since I haven't even applied yet...may be around 55-65k just to be safe. She starts freaking out telling that if the starting salary is that low she wont accept me going there? WTF?

Her argument is that if it take a starting salary like that, then when I apply for other jobs in the future they wont want to offer me anything more than that. I always thought the more experience you have will always get you a better starting salary at your next job depending on how much they want you.

I'm so tired of this. I feel hindered by everything they expect me to do. I respect them as my parents and listen to them whenever I feel their advice is sound but this is just ridiculous. This my career, this is something I want to enjoy and they expect me to be some top tier guy making 100k a year as a starting salary. 

I start boiling up with so much anger its unberable. I feel so fucking chained to this situation and no matter how much I try to politely explain it to them they never listen. They're stubborn, they don't think i know anything of what I'm talking about when the fact is I went through the education system here and they did not.

What do I do? I don't know who else to turn to anymore. I feel like my life is going to be completely ruined and just feel a horrible sense of stress and anxiety.

I have one more semester left, and then I am supposed to go to a 4 year university, and finish up anything needed to get a bachelors degree in business. My dad wants me to go to a state school, I don't really want to, but I do not see much of an option. I know I'll go through college, and get my bachelors, but I'm not confident about it. I have worked small jobs, and through my community college worked at Disneyworld. They really embellished it, and I did have fun, but it was not a real internship, as I learned little to do with my major.

So the most I have ever been paid in a job is 7.65 an hour. People are telling me I am going to be able to get a job, right out of college, and that I can earn a lot of money, but it's all of the people who want me to go to college, or teach the courses.

Right now, I feel like no one wants to hire a kid out of college at any respectable salary, when the last job they worked was for 7.65 an hour. I do not feel like my degree will be respected at all. I feel like college is just pointless for me.

I want to focus on international business. Travel from country to country, speak different languages, and be successful. I feel like Ill just end up being nothing like what I wanted. I dream of studying abroad, and I hope it can happen.

I would love to live on my own in an apartment, but I really do not see that happening. 

Has anyone ever felt like this before, or have any advice as to what I should do, and knows what they are talking about? Give me some confidence please."

hzq7e,4,2011-06-14,How much will choice of college affect me after graduation? (CS degree),YouAreTheBallLickers,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hzq7e/how_much_will_choice_of_college_affect_me_after/,"I just completed my first year at UIC. UIC has a top notch CS and Engineering department, as well as lots of internship and career assistance. However, the commute is killing me and my schedule sucks. 

I'm considering transferring to Northeastern Illinois University. It's *almost* like a community college, but I can receive a bachelor's degree. It is right in my neighborhood, cheaper, and they cater for commuters and people with jobs. There is no doubt that Northeastern will be easier (some people call this school Northeasy) and hopefully I could finish my degree faster. 

So what do you think, Reddit? Will I regret transferring to an easier school? Or is it what I do in college that matters, not where I go?"

hyzjv,7,2011-06-13,"Comp for my Bro, could really use some help.",EMTsNightmare,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/hyzjv/comp_for_my_bro_could_really_use_some_help/,"My brother, who is currently going to grad school for Architecture, has finally had his 6-year-old MacBook Pro crap out on him.  Since his grad school and summer internship both use PC's, he's looking to get a new PC.  He's got a $1500 budget, and while he would prefer a laptop (for the mobility) he'd also go with a desktop if it provided enough benefits.  The catch is that the desktop would have to include a monitor, keyboard, and Windows 7 in the price.

The primary use of the PC will be to run AutoCAD, 3DMax and other graphic programs, not games.  Though I'm sure he'll play some, it should not be a priority for the build.

The catch is, that he's in California, I'm on the East Coast, and he doesn't know how to build a PC (having had a mac for years....).  So ideally I'm looking for a laptop or desktop that's either completely assembled or mostly assembled and he can figure out on his own how to get it finalized.

I'm stuck and don't really know where to start, or where to focus my attention since I've mostly focused on gaming rigs.  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks!"
hyzbi,0,2011-06-13,I am a twenty year old who just got braces. They are really painful and I feel really depressed about my appearance. Will they affect me chances of getting a job from an interview?,Dental-plan-man,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hyzbi/i_am_a_twenty_year_old_who_just_got_braces_they/,"Someone cheer me up please?

I got braces when I was younger; unfortunately the retainer was fitted incorrectly and my teeth went completely back to their normal state with wisdom teeth and some other complications.

Because of this, I have had to get braces again. I just started two new jobs programming, and I've overheard new co-workers comment on how ridiculous I look already. I'm fighting with my girlfriend of 4 years and it's compounded by the braces, I am working 12 hours a day and have no time to do anything I enjoy...I feel a little bit lost right now, and it's all being compounded by these gargantuan hunks of metal on my face, that are keeping me from my beloved comfort eating.

Is it worth it? I am considering just having them removed, they hurt to much to deal with right now, and the orthodontist left the little metal bit that digs into your skin sticking out the side and I cannot go to get this fixed for five weeks...I think I will just get them removed and examine my situation from there.

As part of my college course we do an internship also, will having braces affect how I am seen by my interviewers? I have already noticed people being more condescending/assuming I am younger than I am."
hyz3d,1,2011-06-13,"Reddit, what is your best/craziest ""wait, what just happened"" or ""how did that just work"" story???",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hyz3d/reddit_what_is_your_bestcraziest_wait_what_just/,"A few years back, my cousin was making an increasingly rare visit to see me and other family. After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

After I hastily semi-dry myself, I proceed to the closet to pick out some clothes. As I try to decide what to throw on, my mind is also racing trying to figure out what sort of explanation I am going to give as to my tardiness. Bingo. Got 'em coach.

When I arrive at the entrance of the office, I take a deep breath and put on a California afternoon smile. As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda or something like that. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking (Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated, and my friend mentioned that his company was hiring. Damn it, I'm going to punch my cousin.), the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

tl;dr:

   1. Drank like a fish
   2. Woke up late and threw on a suit
   3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting
   4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""
   5. got a raise

Also, granite countertops apparently look more comfortable than pillow-top mattresses when you are piss-drunk."

I have severely limited knowledge of Finance as I discovered my interest in it very recently and only have basic level of Accounting/Finance knowledge and basic Excel skills. I will probably be working with a team that would be involved in live projects involving M&amp;As etc. advising banks and will be involved in valuations. I really want to work hard and do well in this internship and have the chance of landing a job with them when I graduate (although right now it seems I might just go into their offices and be the least knowledgeable intern/employee)

What are some things I should do this week to overcome this handicap?

1. What books can I read that give me a basic level of knowledge needed for this profession?
2. What are some Excel tutorials I could use to acquire the skills needed for Financial Modeling? My friend has some Lynda and Total Training advanced videos of Excel and I'm planning to go through those. Are there any better Financial Modeling specific Excel tutorials?
3. What are some other software/concepts I might be using and should try to get myself familiar with?

And finally,

4. What are some other sites/forums on the internet which are essential for Finance Professional and where these questions may yield better solutions?

Any tips/advice from you guys would be welcome. Thanks!"

i018p,2,2011-06-15,I think my parents are in a loveless relationship... What can I do to help?,ParentsNotInLove,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i018p/i_think_my_parents_are_in_a_loveless_relationship/,"Hi Reddit, this is a throwaway and my first time posting but I really don't know who else to turn to for advice. 

I feel that my parents are in a loveless or depressed relationship.Their unhappiness can be felt overbearingly. I came home this summer to camp out at the house for an internship that happens to be close by. Initially, everything seems happy upfront, but gradually I felt that they are not happy with their lives...

A few observation:

-During the night, they barely interact with each other. With one either watching TV and the other playing computer games. 

-Their communication usually consist of ""what needs to be done.""

-They complain to me about each other on numerous occasions. 

-They rarely ever smile. 

Now here's the ugly part. My father doesn't have a job, he's been out for almost 2 years now, he does some counseling work part-time (generally about a couple session a week). I've observed the majority of time he watches TV and play computer games. He hasn't been interested in taking much responsibilities and does not like to make decisions. He also has a tendency to cave to avoid conflicts in all costs. His outlook in life has become more cynical over the years. He is 53.

He used to be such a pleasant fellow and very encouraging. This isn't like what he used to be at all.

My mother on the other hand is very goal driven. She is your exact definition of type A personality. She feels like she needs to take charge in almost everything. She is stressed out a lot. Currently, she is the bread winner of the house. She is 52.

They've been married for 12 years and both have been divorced before. 

Now as you can see the dynamics are pretty awkward. My mother would push, push, push and my father would just retreat, retreat, retreat. It just isn't going anywhere and it is really painful to watch. My gut tells me that they are very frustrated with each other. If things continue the way it is, I predict that things are going to end up pretty ugly. 

As a son, I don't want to over step my bounds and neither of my parents takes criticisms very well. Reddit, can you help me or give me an idea on how to approach this? I love my parents very much and I really want to help them live a happier life. 

TL:DR - Parents in a loveless marriage, would like advice on how to help them as a son. "

Some courses at the university built a database/desktop application/website for signing up campers and managing the information. It's a camp for the mentally disabled, so there is a lot of information that needs to be managed. What exists already is... okay... but it definitely needs improvement. In it's current state, it is very confusing for the users, and I've been trying to fix this. The website is built in .NET and the database is MSAccess.

The problem is that, as far as I know, there is no one who works for the camp who is especially tech savvy, and no one has considered the issue of where this will be hosted. I will probably need to help them find a way to suitably host this project, while also trying to move everything to the web. Unfortunately, I don't know a lot about hosting, so if anyone has ideas and tips I'd love to hear them."

(this would take no additional effort on the companies behalf)

Make no mistake, however, that is not why I am looking for a job. I am looking for one to start a career.

I also want to mention that I am open to just about anywhere in the US. Since I'm fresh out of college (and not planning on staying around here) I am looking to relocate.

i26x6,33,2011-06-17,how do you go from a novice programmer to the next level?,KAS_Esquire,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i26x6/how_do_you_go_from_a_novice_programmer_to_the/,"Programmers of Reddit, I'm hoping you can offer me advice and that this thread may be useful to others in the same scenario.

As a professional programmer I find I've reached a point where my skills are just below the level I want to be, and I'm having difficulty finding the best way to move them up.

I've gotten a Computer Engineering degree, I've worked professionally as a web developer building LAMP(HP) web apps for several years (some during school), I've created db-driven web apps used by &gt; 1 million users, I did an internship at one of the major tech companies where I did a lot of Java work. I have the basic language skills (C/C++, Java, PHP, along with some HDLs), lots of db experience, along with architecture patterns like MVC and REST.

I've interviewed 3 rounds at Google, but at the end they said my knowledge wasn't quite there. Same as at some ambitious start-ups attempting to do Google-scale stuff. Basically I'm looking for advice to become a programmer on that level. I'm hoping to move on from basic MVC LAMP web apps to highly-scalable, distributed systems, high-performance back-end (C++ maybe), working with massive amounts of data, concurrency issues, scalability issues, ranking, search, artificial intelligence. All the things that separate novice-level from expert-level.

My current approach:

Utilizing Stanford iTunesU and other free resources every day (1 a day) to ensure I'm constantly learning

Reading

Debating going back for a Masters in Comp Sci, as many of the jobs I apply for say Masters or PhD preferred.

And working of course, but I seem to get the same kind of work I've always done, just marginally bigger every time.

... that's it really

So, to the experts, how did you make the jump from novice to expert? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

If so, how?",acct987654321,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i3w0b/have_you_ever_intentionally_screwed_up_someones/,"Sometimes, we do things that inadvertently have a negative impact on someone's life. Hell, on the other hand, sometimes people do something that will greatly benefit someone.

We've had a lot of threads about those kinds of things happening. What I'm curious about is if any of you have deliberately done something to screw someone over.

Several years ago, I screwed over an ex. We'd recently broken up, mostly because I found out she was screwing her friend's husband.

I didn't key her car, harm her pets, or do anything else destructive to her property.

Instead, when I learned that she had spent a few days with one a friend messing around with various drugs, I decided to give the place where she did her internship a call and suggest they perform a ""random"" drug test on her, because she had recently taken part in extensive drug use.

She was doing an internship for her masters, working with troubled kids at one of those facilities that they send children to when they have drug, gang, and other such problems. They had a very strict drug policy for the staff, and I knew that she'd taken a drug test at the start of the internship. She and I weren't drug users; I'm still not. I don't have any issue with them, but the facility's policy allowed me to do this.

Well, they tested her. She ended up learning her internship, which had been a key step in acquiring her license/Master's degree. The way she lost her internship put her in a bad spot with her college, and she spent the next couple of years trying to get things sorted out, with no success.

The best part is, I also informed her part-time job (where she worked with children and was responsible for coordinating schedules) and she was suspended for drug use from there as well.

She ended up having to work shitty part-time jobs for three years, before finally getting herself halfway back on track.

TL;DR - Ex fucked her friend's husband, did drugs, I tipped people off and set her career back several years. "

I've heard plenty of bad stories about Target and retail jobs in general, but I worked retail for a short time in college and didn't mind it. I liked being active and on my feet at work and being able to help customers.

i45q0,6,2011-06-20,I just don't know what to do anymore...,PuckThis,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i45q0/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Hey, Reddit.

I'm going to try not to get TOO tl;dr here. But I will start by saying that I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and clinical depression, when I was younger, so this is really nothing new, unfortunately. I cannot afford the medication I need. I used to smoke weed, and it really, really helped, but I had a falling out with my guy and can't get it anymore. 

I'm not going to lie, I have been thinking about killing myself a lot over the last year or so. I don't have a plan or a note or anything. But it's a thought that doesn't go away, especially when I am alone, at work. Especially at work, but not exclusively. But over the last week or so, it's something I can't get off my mind. 

Basically, I have no idea what to do anymore. I've been working for going on 4 years at a dead end job at a gas station since I was in college. I'm not going to get in to the work situation, but I can't request more hours because we have ""set hours"" and we all work solo shifts. So what I make now, I'm stuck making until I can find something else. My art degree is completely useless here. I am interested in illustration, character design, that kind of stuff, I loathe graphic design. I had an internship at the museum here drawing dinosaurs and shit, I LOVED it. I applied to work for them when they had an opening, but they turned me down on the grounds that ""why would we hire you to do what you already did for free?"" Not to mention at other art jobs I've applied for, they have no idea what my degree is (""Associates in Specialized Technology with a Focus on Visual Design""). I'm scraping by paying for a student loan for a useless degree. What a wasted two years of my life going to a piece of shit school, I wish someone warned me before I went. 

I don't go out anymore, I don't have friends here anymore. I cut ties with my only two friends after they fucked me over. I work three days a week at said shitty gas station, getting ignored all day unless someone wants something, getting bitched at for this or that, pretty much getting treated like a robot. After a while, I start to believe I should be treated that way. 

I have a girlfriend, she lives across the country. I've realized over the last few months that I love her, but I'm not...""in love"" with her. We have so many things in common, we have a wonderful time when we're together, but I can't help how I feel. I do think about her a lot, it's not a one sided relationship by any means. She said to me today that she feels like she has a best friend moreso than a girlfriend, and I guess I have been treating her that way. When she was here, we went on dates, we made sexy times, all that couple-y stuff. I do feel a very strong attachment to her, but I'm not sure if I'd call them romantic feelings. Even that being said, I am not thinking of leaving her or breaking up with her anytime soon, she makes me happy, and she's completely in love with me. My feelings aside, she is the best relationship I've ever been in, and I don't want to throw it away. 

Recently, she decided she's moving out, and she wants me to move in with her, across the country. This is something I want VERY badly, and have my entire life. I feel like I could be happier out there. I've lived in the same area my entire life, and I hate it. There is nothing for me here. I'm pretty much stuck here, working at a job I hate and browsing the internet, until she says ""hey, okay, I got the place, you can move here now!"" I hate it, I hate how dependent I am on it. I would LOVE to just be able to do this myself, but I simply cannot afford to. I don't have the credit, or the money to be able to get my own apartment across the country, I am not in a position to just pick up and move unless I have a place to go. I have talked to my parents about this move, and my mom has agreed to help me when the time comes, it's the only way I'm able to afford it. My mom agrees that the change would be really good for me. (She has no idea that we're dating. I was kind of kicked out/left when she found out I was with my first girlfriend, so we just don't talk about it anymore. Being gay is the least of my problems, it's one of the few things I am comfortable with about myself.) The job market here is shit, I can't even tell you how many other shitty retail jobs I've applied to just to have some more cash flow, but to no avail. Even after I called back, went to interviews, the whole lead on for a month thinking I have another job. 

Where my gf lives has so much more opportunity for me. I can (hopefully!) get an art job there, as those are much more available in that area. I am completely content in settling for something shitty until I can get a ""real"" job there. I just want out of here, and I want us to be happy. 

But since I've realized my feelings about her, I don't know if I should go through with it. I do love her, very much, but that ""in love"" feeling that I've had before, just isn't there. Sometimes, I really, really do think it's the depression. When I was ""in love"" before, I was in a much happier place in my life. I keep telling myself I'll move out there and see how I feel, but with moving out comes so much money, that I don't have, and lease agreements, etc. What if my feelings don't change when/if I'm happier? Who says moving at all is going to change anything? If I can't find a job with my degree, it changes the place, but not the situation. I was very happy when she visited me a few months ago, I did feel a lot better when she was around, that's why I'm hoping things will change, and I remember those feelings when I get down about things. I think it's the distance that is making me feel the way I do, and my mundane day to day hating everything. My job has made me hate the general public so much that I don't want to leave the house on my days off.  But I'm so worried about being stuck 3,000 miles away from anything I know, hating everything even more. 

I really just want to give up. There is nothing for me here. As excited as I am about the move, I just don't know if I can do this to my girlfriend. What if I get there and realize I really don't love her, or we can't stand each other in a living situation? I know these are chances that need to be taken, but I simply don't have the money to be taking chances. For once, someone wants to help me do something, and I fuck it up, by feelings I can't help. I don't want it to come off as that I'm ""using"" her, because those are not my intentions. I do genuinely care for her. Like I said, we had a wonderful time together when she was here. We've been friends for many years before we started dating, so it's not like I didn't know her at all before this started. 

Everything is just a fucking mess right now. I feel like no matter what I do I just fuck up, what's the point in trying anymore. 


It felt really good to write all that down...I seriously have no one to talk to about any of this. Even if you don't reply, thank you, Reddit. 

Edit: If I don't reply it means I went to bed. I just wanted to get all of this out before another shitty day at work tomorrow..."

Since then, we've kept in touch and decided to try moving in together once we graduated college. After telling her that I would be up for rooming together, we've been talking about it almost non stop. She just got laid off from her job, which means the move in process can start sooner. 
However, when she came to visit for a few days I started having second thoughts. When we knew each other during the internship, she was very humble, slightly chubby, and open to new things. When visiting this week, she was overly confident, talked mostly about herself or her boyfriend, and acted very judgmental towards me and my family. She's lost 40 pounds since the internship, and now gives me dieting and exercise advice constantly (I'm not on a diet). She's the master of back handed compliments, congratulating me for getting a job while also saying that they're such a big company they can afford to hire anyone. 
This experience has made me seriously doubt and slightly dread moving in together. We haven't signed a lease because I won't know my work location until late August/early September. I'm becoming more and more anxious as the days pass! Should I move in with her because I made the commitment? Should I jeopardize our friendship by telling her I don't want to move in together? Or should I find a way to discourage her from moving in with me so I don't hurt her feelings? If you'd like further description of my situation, please ask. "

The updated information is they admitted her to the hospital, and she has an actual room now, and may be there 4-7 days.

A little info I forgot to include in the other post: She usually lives about 30-45 min away from me, depending on traffic. She actually was just visiting this past weekend, as she has an internship 4 hours away, where her parents live.

I hope this doesn't sound selfish, but right now I seem to be having trouble figuring out what *I* am supposed to be doing. She wants me to come visit her, and I feel bad since she has no one else here. I know she was finally calling both her parents (they don't live together) tonight after I talked to her, but I'm not sure if they're coming or anything.

First of all, I'm not sure me being there is a good thing. At some point I'd think she will go from thinking I'm this great guy she's in love with, to thinking about how she's there because I called 911. She already said today she wished I had just come myself, and taken her to the E.R. so she would be there voluntarily. I told her maybe it's a good thing they are keeping her there. The Craigslist post was incredibly fucked up, and so was reading the notes.

Sorry for rambling, but I guess the advice is, what can I do for her, and what can I do for myself? I do not have any desire to get back together with her, but I'm pretty sure she still does. Another reason I'm not sure if her seeing me is good or not. I did promise her I would bring her some stuff from her apartment, so I am going to see her at least one more time, unless there's an unexpected twist."

i7c9q,2,2011-06-23,"Reddit, what is your best/craziest ""wait, what just happened"" or ""how did that just work"" story??? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i7c9q/reddit_what_is_your_bestcraziest_wait_what_just/,"A few years back, my cousin was making an increasingly rare visit to see me and other family. After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

After I hastily semi-dry myself, I proceed to the closet to pick out some clothes. As I try to decide what to throw on, my mind is also racing trying to figure out what sort of explanation I am going to give as to my tardiness. 

When I arrive at the entrance of the office, I take a deep breath and put on a California afternoon smile. As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB (Big Boss) as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking:

1. Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated
2. My friend mentioned that his company was hiring
3. Damn it, I'm going to beat the snot out of my cousin

the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

**tl;dr:**

   **1. Drank like a fish**

   **2. Woke up late and threw on a suit**

   **3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting**

   **4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""**

   **5. got a raise**

**Also, granite countertops apparently look more comfortable than pillow-top mattresses when you are piss-drunk.**

I have no intention of getting back together with him, nor do I have any qualms about whether us breaking up was the best thing or not. I'd just like to see your opinion on this. At the end of the day, it would be nice to hear, ""He is hurt and trying to get over you,"" rather than ""He chose this girl over you because she is better than you."" I know this isn't 100% rational, but I'm sure everyone that has been through a breakup knows what I'm talking about. Certain thoughts keep playing through your head and it's nice to have an arsenal of nicer thoughts to replace them with. [Here is my post where I go into some details about what happened.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i6eza/i_have_never_been_so_pissed_ever/)

Some details that make me think it might be:

* Before he broke up with me, he was very emotionally distraught for a week or so. He couldn't really sleep or eat. He was really upset.
* He has called this girl a ""butterface"" on numerous occasions.
* She pursued him at a bar and was very forward about asking him to go back to her room with her. She made it very clear that she was interested and would sleep with him.
* He asked her on a date on Monday, and they were ""in a relationship"" by Wednesday.
* We were together for 3 years, but he's in a new relationship within 3 weeks. He's been talking to her the whole time.
* She is here for the summer only, for an internship. They work together. She lives a state away.
* We are about to enter our senior year in college.
* I was his first girlfriend and he was a virgin.
* He seems to be going out of his way to try to upset me. Sending me an e-mail titled, ""You're going to be mad but..."" or refusing to return a book that he said he would. It seems like he's doing things to ""get even"" with me, even though he ended it."

I interviewed at a position for a large bay area software company today, and got a phone call tonight regarding background checks/compensation.  I'd be hired on to write VBA scripts (contract), and would be full time during the summer and part time while I'm at school in the fall.
I was told to let them know tomorrow what a ""reasonable wage"" would be.

i7rxr,3,2011-06-23,Why work in the United States?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i7rxr/why_work_in_the_united_states/,"From what I understand there are a lot more reasons to work in Europe compared to the US. I can't really see many advantages to working in the US vs Europe. For example, it is my understanding that a lot of countries in Europe have more MANDATORY vacation days. I understand a lot of places don't work many hours on Friday, or if on Friday at all. With all of these benefits (including even better healthcare in some countries) and nearly the same salary if not more, why would anyone choose to work in the US versus Europe.

I probably don't know much about the subject, any enlightening would be appreciated. I am 22 (graduating college in December) and trying to decide if I should venture out to work in another country. I have worked for 2 fortune 100 companies already (in IT at corporate as an intern) so I won't be going over there to do mediocre jobs, they would be for large international companies FYI."

I've worked at Best Buy for the past two years as a seasonal/ocassional.  In other words I come in and work over the summers and during my breaks when I'm home, I'm a college student and I go to school over an hour away.  It's been nice for extra spending money and what not.  So this summer I have a great internship where I'm working 40 hours a week, making double what I make at BB, and have way better working conditions.  I've also been working weekends at BB 8 hours on both Saturday and Sunday, it's quite a bit of work but I really like having money so it is worth it to me.  But after today I think I'm fed up.  I sell computers, which I absolutely love, I enjoy finding great deals for people on stuff they actually need.  I'll spend hours with a customer if they are friendly and willing to learn.  Today I didn't sell a single computer which I don't really care I'm not on commission and I sold other things but I missed out on getting 5 different customers the computers that they wanted because of the incompetence of the system at BB.  On top of working with an incompetent system I'm always over worked my shift is always understaffed.  I can count the number of 15 minute breaks I've had while at best buy using 2 fingers.  The reason my shift is always understaffed is because I sell more and help more customers than anyone else.  In other words they count me as two workers.  I also have proof for this because they recently started tracking sales and out of a 12 person department I make up 17% of the revenue.  I've never received a raise, even after asking 2 separate ocassions, because I'm ""seasonal/ocassional and don't qualify for the same raises everyone else does"". 

So I've never quit a job before what should I say?  I have to be in to work in 7 hours and I have my complete and total pick of managers to go talk to.  I probably won't get too many responses so late and with so little time but hey I figured somebody would have a great way for me to go out without being a complete douche.  

TLDR  I can't stand my 2 year old job where I'm under appreciated and I don't really need.  In what way do I leave."
ialds,1,2011-06-27,Employers (and perhaps the employed) of reddit--is it possible to fabricate non-technical work experience on a resume?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ialds/employers_and_perhaps_the_employed_of_redditis_it/,"So basically, as a recent college grad who can't find a job despite going to a good school and getting a relatively marketable degree (finance) with a decent GPA, I'm left with the conclusion that I'm being boxed out because I lack internship experience (not for lack of trying--I simply could never get hired). Anyways, I've heard employers rarely check up to make sure work experience is 'legit' (particularly when apps don't require references), and even so, it may be possible to reference a small company that has gone under, or has a website I put up, or I give my friend's phone number, etc etc.

If I commit a solid effort toward being able to 'describe my experience', would I be able to get away with something like this? Obviously no technical experience could be faked, but I'm pretty sure a lot of internships (non-engineering/CS anyways) don't teach you anything you can't learn in a week on the job + google. I realize of course this would overall be called a bad idea, but I'm getting tired of rejection despite feeling qualified for the entry level jobs to which I'm applying.

I interned at a law firm last summer, a paid internship by the way, and learned about all the nitty gritty details of how a firm works.  I spent 8 hours a day 6 days a week filing, entering info into the computer, running the mail room, helping attorneys with random tasks, etc. for an entire summer.  This summer, I signed up for a program my university puts on in which a coordinator set me up at an unpaid internship in Washington, D.C.  The program is pretty expensive, and I signed up believing I'd have this invaluable experience and come out with some solid rec letters and knowledge about what lawyers actually do.  As it turns out, the firm has never had an intern and truly has no idea what to do with me.  I'm leaning absolutely nothing and doing absolutely nothing.  They occassionally give me tasks but from what I can tell those tasks are unnecessary and of no help whatsoever to the employees (e.g. writing down all the files in an office even though the firm already has a list detailing which files are in which office).  It's more like they feel bad and just want to give me something to do so I don't just sit in a corner all day.  I talked to my supervisor who said she'd try to find me some projects to get started on, but it's been three weeks and I've still done/learned nothing.  At this point, I'd even be happy just to file papers.  I'm trying very hard to stay positive, but I've now spent a month sitting at a desk counting the seconds until six o'clock hits.  I ask if anyone in the office needs help with anything pretty often (I try to restrain myself from asking too much because I don't want to be that annoying intern), but everyone keeps telling me they don't have anything for me to do.  I'm at a loss here reddit, and I need your help.

So does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this miserable experience into a positive one?  Nothing I've tried has worked, so I really am open to anything..."

For example, in engineering companies the gender ratio is very distorted with men making up the majority of the workforce. I imagine this is because more men *want* to be engineers and hence go to university to study engineering. This means that there are more men to choose from and therefore, the quality of the top tier graduates will be significantly higher than the quality of the top tier female graduates. This is not to say that women are not good at engineering or not as skilled so please don't take offence.

As companies will logically employ the best people, the majority of the engineering company should be male, and rightly so. But in order to appear non-sexist (which it already is not), it discriminates against men in order to attempt to equalize the gender ratio. Presented with an equally skilled male and female graduate, I think that engineering companies would prefer to hire the female graduate. I have no actual proof of this except anecdotal evidence during my internship at ARUP, where I found seven women in an office of thirty people, two of which were receptionists. Is this fair? Has society gone to too great a length to ensure there is no discrimination within the workforce that we have to discriminate against those who had not been discriminated against before?

So tada :D  
  
Hello:  
  
My name is Christopher Woodall. You killed my father. Just kidding :D, unless you did. Then prepare to die. I saw that you had a few job openings, but I am unsure where I would fit in. Because of this I have [attached my resume](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/resume/) and will give you a brief run-down about my self.  
  
First I take it you would like to know some of my past work experience. Well, I got into the wrong major in college, Criminal Justice; thought I'd end up as a Game Warden or... well really don't know what I was thinking. I started out as an electronics sales person at AAFES, a retail outlet on military bases. This wasn't taking me exactly where I wanted so I moved to Italy and worked as a house keeper in a hotel. This was nice but the cost of living was just too much thusly moved back to the US. Keep in mind, all the while attending and trying to pay for college. I ended up in Tennessee working as a horticulturist in a small family-owned-and-operated green house until school started back that fall. My last job was as an intern at the local District Attorney's Office working on murder and theft cases; interviewing witnesses, police officers, ect.  
  
There was still something eating at me. My love for computers and technology; one day I hope to be assimilated into the borg. Because of this I decided to teach my self to program. I started with [Python](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/gmail.py), moved to [PHP](http://yourfaceonatshirt.com), then [Javascript](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/map ""Only works in firefox, needs refactoring.""). Still don't know as much as I'd like but I am getting close. I was always interested in computer security so I worked my ass off to get into Google Corporate Hall of Fame for application security; check it out, I'm in there!
  
What I am really asking for is a steady paycheck and a place to grow. Shoot, I'd be happy working as a janitor solving problems on a chalk board if someone would hire me. I am a self starter and motivated to do something with this short time I have. 23 now, take it I'll live to about 60, so I am already a third of the way through life! If you give me a chance it will not be wasted.  
  
Respectfully submitted,

It's kind of bugging me a lot, but given my situation, there's plenty of reasoning for both sides.

So I'm living in this guy's house, let's name him Joe. I moved in mid May and am staying until August. I contacted him late, but he said he would put me in the last room available in his house. So I'm sleeping on a futon for the entire summer... And the room is basically an office; Joe has his computer there.

So because of the computer, Joe comes into my room to do stuff. How often? I have no clue. It's probably at least twice a week. And this is irritating me, because as someone paying him money to stay in his house, I feel like I should have my own privacy in my room. My stuff is all over the floor because he didn't clean out my closet, so half my floor space is taken up. Granted, his computer is there, but he made the decision to put me in that same room, without any warning to me. 

Would you consider it invading someone's privacy if someone goes into your room without notice? 

**EDIT**: I never signed a contract, as it never seemed necessary. This was kind of setup through our company where he is a full-time and I'm a summer intern. He lives in the house all year long and has interns move in during the summer. So there are 2 with nice big rooms with a closet, and me in a smaller room. My closet is full so I have to leave my room and go to a separate closet. Something that seems important to mention: Joe did tack off $100 from a $500 rent, so I probably won't ask for him to lower it again."

Then, I decided to take a few programming courses and BAM... fell in love.  

Because it took me time to discover what I wanted to pursue, I was not able to take as many computer science courses as I potentially could have if I had jumped into it from day 1.

I don't want my summer to go to waste.  Perhaps my technical qualifications are not as shiny and fantastic as many other students applying for internships and opportunities, but the passion I have for what I am learning is something I can't let collect dust over summer.  
What sets me apart from other students in my field are my qualifications as a worker and not solely as a programmer. I love to meet new people, try new things, and network. 

And so I ask you... what advice do you have for me this summer?  How can I use my outgoing personality to my advantage when looking for an opportunity?"

idal1,5,2011-06-30,Job searching goes great but put me in awkward situation. Advice?,Papshmire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/idal1/job_searching_goes_great_but_put_me_in_awkward/,"Currently, I work two part-time jobs.  One of those jobs was for an ecommerce store that I worked as my college job and went full-time right after.  However, it was not really a professional job and didn't provide any benefits.  So, I decided to take an internship with a marketing department thanks to a friend who works there.  She promises that it would become a full-time job right after the internship.  


Well, year comes and goes, they have me stick around but I never got asked to go full-time and things sort of fall apart at the company.  I decided that it was time to move on.  After months of never hearing back from a job, I apply to another two and suddenly get interviews for both of them.


Both jobs seem great and they seem to want me, but they both require me to move away.  Here is the predicament.  At the same time, my two part-time jobs NOW want me full-time.  


So....I guess my question is, how do I go about giving myself the best case scenario?  What questions do I have to ask myself in order to know what I want?


**TL;DR**:  Sought full-time work because my two part-time jobs wouldn't hire me full-time.  Now got two potential full-time jobs lined up, with the part-times wanting to hire me full-on.

icyqo,6,2011-06-30,"Hey /r/consulting, as someone who's interested in management and strategy/operation consulting, which would be the better internship to take?",jiralnom,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/icyqo/hey_rconsulting_as_someone_whos_interested_in/,"So I currently have two internships I can take for this summer. I'm currently a 2nd year going into my 3rd year at a four-year University. I want to start recruiting in my 3rd year so I'm hoping to pick the best internship that would provide me the most relevant or best resume building experience.


I'm currently choosing between a corporate finance analyst internship job where I'll be organizing data collection methodology, assisting creating of valuation models, and statistically testing collected data sample

vs.


Finance intern at a investment / wealth management firm where I'll be assisting them with client investment plans, entering trades into computer, managing stocks, and calling insurance brokers to make sure that the firm isn't doing anything illegal and everything is fine. I'm not sure how involved i'll be in the whole process but the interviewer mentioned that since its a small firm, I'll be exposed and involved in the whole process.

Both internships are at pretty small companies, nothing fortune 500 or anything like that, so i believe i'll be able to do actual work rather than coffee delivery or secretary work. 

Right now I'm debating which one would look better to consultants during recruiting season and which one would teach me more applicable skills in the business world.

thank you all in advanceee &lt;3 "
icwdt,3,2011-06-29,Need some advice...,wilsun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/icwdt/need_some_advice/,"I recently graduated with a BS in CS from a good top/second tier university (some digging in my profile/history will no doubt reveal it). I interned last summer as a software engineer and am now participating in an information systems rotational program in a defense company (again, some research will easily reveal its identity).

Problem: I effing hated the internship, and am already dreading going into work a week after starting at my first full-time job. This may have something to do with the fact that I was not given much to do in my internship and my current manager has been too busy to assign me tasks and I have no admin rights on my workstation so I can't do anything fun with it. Or maybe I just realized I hate industry.

Now, I have choices. I can certainly stay on this job, but I'm scared that spending years in an IS rotational program will put me behind the competition in terms of software engineering experience, and software or systems engineering is where I ultimately want to end up. If I leave after just a week, I'm scared that I'll be burning bridges and maybe end up hurting me in the future.

I don't know. Academia, maybe?

Advice appreciated..."

Oftentimes I find myself with a lot of free time on my hands. The projects my boss gives me often don't take more than an hour to complete. 

I feel like it looks bad on my part when he walks by my desk and says something to the effect of ""Whats up?"" or ""Whatcha working on?"" I try to stay busy as much as possible, but honestly I'm not given a lot of work and I don't know how to reply when he asks me this."
