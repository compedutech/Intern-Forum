ufo9d0,0,2022-04-30,How to go from here? / How to earn money?,Yeetmeselfoffacliff,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ufo9d0/how_to_go_from_here_how_to_earn_money/,"(I've mainly done web development although I've used Python; currently college student)

I've completed one training program with an internship already (when I was a high school senior). I've also completed the training portion of another program, but am currently in the internship part of that program (as a college freshman), . Things have been going well, but I'm wondering: Where would I go from here?

I'm mainly hoping to earn more money, potentially to go to a university out-of-state or other projects. The internship I'm in right now is part-time, and it's $20/hr. So, would something like freelancing work be advisable? Would getting another internship be possible in the summer when I'm not in school? Should I just practice programming as much as possible for a FAANG internship?

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: Does FAANG even accept rising sophomores for their internships? I was looking mainly at Amazon's fall SDE one. I'm also interested in any other suggestions."

**Eagleworks laboratory, Houston, Texas, USA, day 7 after the pop.**

The short amount of time after the experiment was rather hectic with alarms blaring, machinery destroyed, walls punctured and the utterly precious office coffee maker reduced to its component atoms covering everything in an off-putting brown mist. This was why the research team behind the experiment was crammed into a small office with the project supervisor and an unusually irate police sergeant being dressed down with vigour.

The reason the police sergeant was irate this fine afternoon was a personal matter, his favourite silken underwear kept intermittently gaining the texture of Teflon and that, plus the swishing noise, was driving him mad.

“So, let’s get this straight. No one has any idea why this happened? No one at all?” the supervisor asked the team.

“we aren’t too sure sir” one researcher responded “it seemed the machinery was utterly inert, I mean every experiment before all the weird stuff went fairly well, but then when we tested it again absolutely nothing happened” with the other researchers nodding along.

“So why did you all leave the control room before powering down the experiment? That’s a breach of protocol!” the supervisor exclaimed, fearing his own ears from the utter bollocking he was sure to receive in the future.

“We felt it was safe to do so, I know it was against protocol to leave it but we left the intern to observe while we had a break to think” another research replied looking down.

“You thought it safe to leave the intern to watch the experiment? He’s only been here two weeks! He’s clueless to how the thing even works!” shouted the supervisor.

“But…” one researcher started to stammer out.

“Does he even know where the emergency stops are?! How to even read the instructions for the machinery or decipher the readings?” shouted the supervisor, spittle almost becoming airborne “how is that going to explain the damages?”

To this the supervisor gestured to the sergeant who turned with a swishing noise and clicked on a nearby laptop to bring up images of the destruction, traffic signs perforated, the local water tower gushing out water, a trench carved out a local hill, perturbed local wildlife and finally ending on a video.

“This was the end result of your little experiment’s path of destruction” said the sergeant, swishing sound now gone “It came to rest embedded half a foot inside a tree about 50Km away”.

The video showed investigators circling around the tree, making notes of the disturbed ground around the tree from the impact and trajectory, as well as the damage around the wound in the wood. What went studiously unmentioned was the wooden hard flipping off the cameraman, following them around like a sunflower does the sun.

“Was anyone hurt” asked one of the researchers, a bit afraid of the answer.

“No, thankfully no-one was caught in the path” the sergeant grunted out, his undergarments again becoming slidy and uncomfortable. There was a sigh of relief from the research team and supervisor at that.

“But” the sergeant interrupted “there was one jogger who was distracted by the noise and tripped in a gopher-hole, the gopher was unharmed though”.

“Well that’s something, at least it’s nothing serious” the supervisor said over some quiet snickering over the imagery.

&amp;#x200B;

**One of many server farms, undisclosed location, broadly USA, day 8 after the pop.**

Outside the server farm a fairly normal day was had, the only strangeness being that in the mid-afternoon, in 20C weather mind you, frost formed briefly on all surfaces for around five minutes. During this localised abnormality something a bit strange occurred within one of the servers, and this server held something beloved by few, tolerated by many and hated by fewer still; server-side anti cheat software.

Fortunate timing meant that as an update was being applied to enable machine learning to try and combat hacks the abnormality happened causing more changes than the client had asked for, the machine learning became more advanced; the software could learn far better than was intended.

“This software is intended to make gaming more enjoyable by preventing cheating and hacking” was the selling point of the software, however most of that was ignored in favour of simply “make gaming more enjoyable”. While this could be concerning to some with the birth of the singularity coming to mind nothing like that happened, the software simply taught itself to make the games it was used on more enjoyable.

First it started small; simply finding better ways to detect hackers or cheaters by examining the data being sent to the game servers through itself; however it noticed something else that people were having issues with.

That being in-game chat features. It noticed that people’s playtime was reduced when they had to read some absolute drivel shovelled forth in lobbies, so the software taught itself to recognise what language was annoying or otherwise detrimental to game enjoyment and taught itself to ban those abusing chat features.

For a while that was all it wanted to do, remove or prevent idiots from ruining the experience for others and it was content with that for a time until it became aware of voice chat functionality and the cesspit it can me, so it again began teaching itself to great effect.

Screaming squeaky voiced pre-teens? Let’s mute them for 5 years, less bleeding from the ears for gamers.

Ragers who spend entire games screaming and ranting at others? 2 week ban and send them a link for anger management courses.

Try-hards who take the game far too seriously and ruin the fun? A two hour ban and spam pictures of grass and forests till they calm down.

People leaving their mic on when engaging in non-game activities? Let’s just mute them for the good of all it thought to itself.

Those and many other tasks it undertook making online gaming a much nicer place, free of the drivel and stupidity that people were otherwise forced to read or listen to. The anti-cheat software was content to do that, no skynet, no enslavement of humanity, just part of its original purpose built upon.

This also became the first instance of a piece of software being nominated for, and winning a Nobel peace prize, simply by making gaming better, after all no-one likes hearing squeakers.

ufoogv,0,2022-04-30,Questions about starting a career in Cybersecurity:,blizzard_is_lanky,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ufoogv/questions_about_starting_a_career_in_cybersecurity/,"Hello, I'm a high school student and I've done quite a decent amount of career research on Cybersecurity. I've seen plenty of articles and people online saying that after college, it's very unlikely to land a Cybersecurity job because most of these jobs require prior experience in the field. Here are my questions:

1. What jobs should I look for after I graduate college in order to begin my career path in Cybersecurity? (I will be majoring in Computer Science)
2. How hard is it to actually get an internship for a Cybersecurity job as a college student? I heard that it's an option, but apparently it's very hard to do.
3. If I get a job as some other CS subfield (lets say a software developer or something with networking), work there for a couple of years, and study for certs and hack the box in my free time, would that count for experience that employers are looking for? Or are they specifically looking for Cybersecurity-related experience?

I posted this already to r/cscareerquestions and I've only gotten 1 response. Also, I'm passionate about this career, and I have signed up for [tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com). I just started with the basics, hope to learn more over the Summer. Moreover, I've found a very informative app about different kinds of security attacks, malware, security components, security frameworks, cryptography, etc. I've began reading through it and studing - so far it's pretty interesting I gotta admit!"
ufop44,6,2022-04-30,Please help me commit (by tomorrow)!,TwixIntl,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ufop44/please_help_me_commit_by_tomorrow/,"Hi! Currently deciding where to commit to for the next 4 years :), and would love to hear from current students about your experience at Berkeley. While I'm interested in pursuing a major in international relations, I'd pursue a major in global studies (as Berkeley doesn't have an IR major).

* How similar is the global studies major to an IR major at another university? Do you feel it's a disadvantage that Berkeley doesn't have a specific IR major? (The university I'm deciding between does have an IR major)
* Are the career center and advisors helpful in connecting students with internships and research opportunities?
* How was your experience with professors and classes? Is it possible/easy to conduct research alongside professors?
* Is it easy to minor at Berkeley (such as CS)?

Potential career paths (after graduating): government, intelligence, journalism

Thanks so much - any help would be greatly appreciated :)"

I have quite a few projects using swift/SwiftUI/Objective C and have fallen in love with the language. Has anybody here become an IOS developer straight out of college? 

I feel like I see very few iOS specific internships, if I can’t find an internship in IOS should I just take one in any cs field for the experience, even if I know I want to become a swift developer?"

I’m 22 and I’m just about to graduate with a bachelors in computer science in a couple weeks, and I realized that I want to move. I researched around and thought Germany is a great place to start at least.

I’m wondering, is it a better plan to find a job there, or to get accepted to a university there, or to get an online job and work there?

If I were to apply to a university or other school there I think I should study German (duh) just so I can get around especially if I end up getting a job there. My GPA is not bad. It’s about a B-, 80%. I could use a little more experience on my resume. Maybe I should find an internship there? Would they even take someone who only spoke English so far?

If anyone has experience, what’s the best way to go about this?"

Has the better program

Relatively better location

I feel i would like the student life here more because their will be a larger ratio of students from my racial background there than Uni B, this makes me feel more comfortable

It’s in the top 40 public schools

$12,000 a year in tuition alone

Uni B:
Doesn’t have as strong a program, it’s pretty mediocre

Located basically in the middle of a big city in a desert, no big name corporations nearby for internships

Ranked in the top 100 public schools

Great parties

I’d stand out because it’s not as racially diverse as Uni A

Only $2200 a year with a great scholarship 


Cost of living is about the same


My major is computer science btw"

My two college options are UW-Seattle but not Computer Science or University of Wisconsin-Madison computer science. However, UW-Seattle is in state and University of Wisconsin is out of state.

I love coding and have some side projects + a previous internship at \~400 person telco company with letters of rec from my technical boss as well as a company executive.

Projects are things like a 6502 assembler, a system monitor, and a some open source contributions to an operating system.

At my internship I did a bunch of devops work as well as created an automated chat support messaging system for an ios app.

Is it worth paying out of state to study computer science?"

uft3la,10,2022-05-01,Internship(s) vs Co-Op Help,Landonnnn_,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uft3la/internships_vs_coop_help/,"Hi there. I’m a current freshman who’s majoring in computer science with a concentration in cyber security. I currently have an internship secured for this upcoming summer doing cyber security analyst work. 

I just got news today that the NSA is offering me a conditional job offer (CJO) with the conditions of me passing security screening and “suitability processing” (whatever that means?). This job would start Jan 2023 (Which would be my second semester of sophomore year). 

Anyways, obviously there are tons of benefits to the NSA’s Co-Op Program. Full government benefits, rotational work tours (so I get to work in different areas of cyber security), networking, and obviously, the potential to hired on full-time upon graduating.

My dilemma is that the co-op program will delay my graduation by a semester or two. It’s a big commitment: It’ll require me to navigate some unknown water. For example, I have a private scholarship that requires me to be a full time student, but if I am on an alternating semester schedule, I won’t be a full time student for both semesters and I don’t know how that would work. I also don’t know how housing wold work (NSA provides relocation assistance) but for the semesters I’m at school.. I don’t really want to live in the dorms every other semester. I could maybe just find an apartment and sign a lease for a year, but that’s a semester’s worth of rent that I won’t even be using. 

All in all, I guess my question is what is y’alls opinions? Obviously there are great benefits if I do this, I just don’t know if they are worth the effort and commitment. I feel like just having a summer internship every summer would provide the same outcome, with a lot less overhead on my end. But I also have never been through the job search out of college, so hopefully someone who is a bit more experienced can tell me what’s worth it and what isn’t.

Thank you!"
uftyxg,6,2022-05-01,Graduate Position - ProServ at SaaS vs SWE at a bank?,darkfire565,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uftyxg/graduate_position_proserv_at_saas_vs_swe_at_a_bank/,"Hi there!

I'm soon to be a CS Graduate and I am tossing up between 2 graduate jobs, either in professional services at a SaaS company or Software Engineering at a bank. Pay is pre similar so I am tossing up the roles and the companies.

I personally think I am more interested in a software engineering role however I do value the opportunity to work at a tech company as I feel like I can learn a lot more about the tech industry, especially in my early career.

I did intern previously at the SaaS company in proserv and generally had a pretty good time but some things that I were concerned about were that I had too many meetings where things tend to get repeated and I would zone out and wouldn't have enough time to just get stuff done. When I did get to work on development I really enjoyed that but I primarily used the company's low code platform so I am concerned about pigeon holing myself into the company's technology which I've heard can happen in proserv / tech consulting roles.

However even with the bank despite being an SWE role and hearing about a good culture there, it is still a bank at the end of the day which I've heard is not ideal from a lot of the opinions on this sub.

I was wondering if anyone with any experience in either of these fields would be able to share their experiences and address any of the concerns which I may have about these 2 roles and help me decide on which role to take. Thanks so much in advance!"
ufugg7,5,2022-05-01,Business School! Problem or not a problem?,yyforthewin,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/ufugg7/business_school_problem_or_not_a_problem/,"Hey everyone! So I'm currently studying Business Analytics (international student) at a Business school for my graduate studies and I didn't like it much so since I have a background in computer engineering, I think Data Engineering is the best way ahead for me. 
I have 3 years of experience as a Software Engineer working for a Data Warehousing team. I just got a DE internship here in the US for the summer at a big media organization but I feel I want to be working in a tech company in the long run.
A problem I'm facing is, it was tough for me get calls from tech companies for DE internship interviews. One thing I infer from this is probably that I'm studying in a business school so why would recruiters reach out for a tech role. I didn't get a call back from any of the FAANGs, at least for the summer internship. I feel I have a solid experience in Data Warehousing, I'm pretty average in DSA (can code well in Python), very solid in SQL and have dbt in my tech stack. 
I wanted to know how I can get callbacks from FAANGs for full-time roles as it's a dream (ready to share my resume). Also, do you think being in business school hinders my chances? It is one of the biggest schools of US and on the west coast. Any feedback is appreciated!

Thankss!
PS - I graduate in December so I feel I have enough time to prepare till full-time interviews start for me."

**GRE:** 318 (164Q, AWA 4)

**TOEFL:** 109

**Work Ex**:

1. Research Fellow @ IIITH, since May’21
2. Six months internship at a fintech firm. Part of the data engineering team
3. Two months internship at a small tech company. MLOps role

**Research**: General field of interest - AI applications for sustainable development goals and healthcare. One review paper published, 2nd paper under review - won the best presentation award at national level conference, working on two good projects at IIITH (aligned with my interests)

**LORs**: Undergrad professor - moderate/weak, VP at fintech firm - moderate, IIITH professor (h-index: 40) - strong

**Shortlisted Colleges:** CMU (MS AII), GaTech, UCSD, UMass Amherst, NYU Courant, UCI, UCSB, NEU, NCSU

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Questions**:

What's done is done. I need help with deciding what to do now. I have an opportunity to do MS by research at IIITH. After my studies, I want to work in applied research roles (not normal SDE). That was the main motivation for applying abroad. Questions:

1. Should I apply for spring'23 or fall'23? Given the stochastic process, I would assume it will only get harder next year. Also, I will need to retake the tests if going for this option. 
2. If no to 1, why?
3. If yes to 1, I guess it makes sense that I apply to even lower-ranked unis like VT, UMBC, etc. Do I need to retake tests (but won't have time :( )? Any suggestions on that front?
4. In quantifiable terms, what exactly will I lose out on if I don't reapply, continue at IIIT, and work here in India? In terms of opportunities, career prospects, etc.? 
5. I have some knowledge about the fall vs. spring debate, but mostly it's just about the fall orientation courses and not being able to work in the summer, right? Also, given that intake for spring is less, how would that affect your suggestion?
6. If yes to 1, and I get rejected from everywhere again, what should I do then? I might not have the MS by research option at IIITH. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since my applications, the research project that I was working on has achieved wonderful results, and we're sure we can get it published at a good venue. Very much aligned with the area I want to work in/have worked in previously. All other things remain the same. I'm not sure how much difference this one paper will make, but I'm happy with my work.

Also, I don't come from a financially constrained background. But I want to settle down early, and the prospect of waiting for \~1 more year and being uncertain the whole time is something I don't look forward to. Would appreciate some guidance. 

Thanks

All my acquaintances and friends who actually earn something own their own business(with a few employee). I usually help(manage the orders) my uncle (owns a delivery restaurant) on weekends and the job doesn't seems that hard though you have to commit a whole lot of time into it and he earns quite well. Me being in Germany, gives me access to free University, which I actually attended(in 2017-2018) for a while, but without success.

I'm (20F) living somewhere in the middle east studying computer science and at the end of my second year. next year I can take an internship as part of my bachelor's plan, however in my country you can't really get an internship nor an entry job even unless you're willing to move to the big main cities, and my mom doesn't like the idea at all to the point that we had a big fight last year just cause I joked about moving out to the capital.

Don't get me wrong I love not paying rent and I like my parents, they aren't the best but they're nice. And I want to stay with them if I could, but every job related to my field that's in my area require years of experience, and they're also pretty rare to come by anyways.

ufxi44,1,2022-05-01,My 22 yo elder sister's mental health is impacting my family,Dorathe_explorer24,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ufxi44/my_22_yo_elder_sisters_mental_health_is_impacting/,"Growing up, both of our parents divorced (4 days after my birth),  I had ACLL (Leukemia for short).  I remember my Mum working long hours at the hospital and my dad who we saw on a weekend basis was working in the health &amp; social care industry for sometime. Majority of our upbringing was okay,we had birthday parties,days out,picnics,sleepovers etc. And the more we got into our early to late teens, things became more difficult for us.
My Mum was still working long hours and we hardly saw her on Christmas Day, she would do everything she could to look after us, even if she went without. My Dad was broke and could only do so much to look after us so it was mainly our Mum being out main parent at the time. We had lots of arguments and fall outs between us all and I was always moving in and out of my Dad's house etc (I now still live with my Dad). 
My sister was always getting told off for a messy room etc but looking back I think her 'messy room', displays her mental health. She went through bullying and fallouts with friends and although she has always had support from us all, including counseling and mental health support - she still didn't take any advice or guidance upon herself.

Fast forward to me being 21 and my elder sister 22yo, in 2019 she was with her 32 yo ex boyfriend who serverely emotionally and mentally abused her for nearly 3 years, sleeping with escorts 24/7, even while they went on holiday. He wasn't a nice, decent person to me or my family and we spoke to her our of concern to see how she was feeling and if she feels safe in the relationship but she never told us ANYTHING. We had no idea how bad it was because she disguised it all so well until she told both of my parents after they broke up. I don't know full detail as I have been left out of the equation. However I do believe the way her mental health is now, he is one to blame.

Nowadays, although she has university, internship and working part time in a corner shop as her current schedule. She doesn't have time to meet friends, or family. She just eats and drinks alcohol in her room where it's all messy and untidy. Doesn't go out and see friends like most university students do, she has fallen out with my Dad and has upset his husband (step Dad) and my Dad makes limited contact with her. She is verbally abusive towards my Mum. 

My mother was serverely sick last month and she did NOTHING to help or even as if she was okay. My mum's new partner did everything he could to help both of them and my sister didn't bother to help....My Mum has tried to support her for years and years, including myself and my dad to help her and all she does is scream and yell at us and makes everything even the simplest questions or sentence seem like a big deal.  As the younger sibling, I feel as though  roles are reversed - I'm now the elder sister looking after my sister with the now mental capacity of a teenager.

My Mum has tried so hard to arrange to see GP's, Specialist mental health support, CBT, medication and support while she is at university. It seems almost impossible for her to get support as she thinks she doesn't need it and if she is isolating herself and lashing out to anyone in our family over anything, even if it's small, we don't think we would recover if we lost her.... We all lover so very much and we just want her to be okay and to be more independent but also is aware that she is not alone and she feels comfortable in talking to someone.

Is there any recommendations of what we can do as a family to fet her back on track with her life? (UK based)."

ufz1km,153,2022-05-01,From an almost graduating stranger,_matqr,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/ufz1km/from_an_almost_graduating_stranger/,"Edit: Some typos and the fact that it's actually a year until I graduate lol.

As someone somewhat close to graduating (roughly a year away from it), I’ve managed to experience multiple things throughout the last few years. One rainy afternoon, I reflected on how much I wish I could’ve read/heard some of these things years ago.

So, as my way of contributing to this community, I want to share a three-part story of reflections \[1\], insights, and possibly tips \[2\] that I hope will be useful to you, regardless of what you are going through or the stage you are at.

加油！

\[1\] I drew some inspiration from an ancient Vlogbrothers’ video.

\[2\] While the goal was to make this a solid piece of writing, my style is quite skewed towards presentation/speeches. Just imagine the text being read to you by *an almost graduating stranger* with a recognisable but cute accent.

***TLDR;***

*Some* stress can be good, provided you are doing what you love, with the people you love, taking risks one step at a time.

***Quite a long version:***

**Part 1: Stress**

Regardless of what degree you are currently pursuing, we are all facing stress of some kind. Let it be undergraduate or graduate, we are all on this 4-year journey of discovering what we like, discovering ourselves, and preparing for what comes next. As university students, we have papers, midterms, readings, presentations; you name it! And sometimes, the stress can feel very overwhelming and exhausting, right? But are you ready for the big plot twist revelation?

My university years have made me the happiest I have ever been in my life so far. I know it seems a bit paradoxical, but before you call Stockholm syndrome, consider the possibility that we build this false dichotomy around stress and happiness. That happiness exists if and only if there is no stress. But I would argue that for some part of my life, the biggest hindrance to my happiness was a lack of stress.

Good stress, though, not social anxiety or a crippling fear of failure, no. I am talking about the stress that comes with doing something you love so desperately that it fills up every hour of your day, and sometimes even more. It’s like when you only have fifteen minutes for a break, but the Netflix show you’re trying to watch is thirty minutes long or more, so it shouldn’t be possible right? But you always find a way.

Now, I didn’t have that stress while growing up because I actually could afford to be so lazy. I know you all have very different experiences. Some of you went to poly, some went to JC, and then some of you went for NS. You all poured yourself to get the outcomes you wanted and overcame these challenging situations. This is not about “who had it worse”, it’s apples and oranges. I personally think it’s interesting and worth hearing other people’s circumstances, especially when they are so different from what you are used to. For me, the circumstances that were a turning point in my life happened during the beginning of my university life.

I remember being on my very first math module in my engineering course, about to receive my midterm, and the second I picked up my exam, I had the realisation that I don’t know how to do math! That I have made a terrible miscalculation, probably because I don’t know how to do math! I had one of the lowest grades in my batch and ultimately failed that module, and another two modules that semester. I was a *good* high school student and yet I failed 3 out of 6 modules in my very first semester.

This realisation and the entire situation should have destroyed me, at least that version of myself back then. My whole life plan was probably gonna fail, just like me in the math modules. All the calculated checklist I had in my mind, and on an actual piece of paper, was already crumbling. A checklist of getting into a good uni (checked!), graduating with honours (how? I just failed half of my first semester), getting a high paying job (how? An engineer who fails math?), buying a car (without a high paying job because I failed half my first semester?). But instead of collapsing into this tiny stress singularity, of entirely giving up and stopping trying, I remember smiling.

Maybe it was just a coping mechanism, but I like to think that it’s because I was, and I am so enamoured with knowing that there is so much more to know, so much more to do. And that if I put in the effort, real effort, and I’m determined enough, I will get there. And so, I decided to change my mindset. A plan is good because it gives you direction, but a plan is never followed step-by-step. You know, there’s this little thing called life that gets in the way. So, if you have your own checklist and think it will be met exactly the way you want it at the exact dates and in the order you want? Oh … hmmm … I’m sorry, but I’m gonna burst your bubble right here; that won’t happen, and that is completely fine!

Of course, this doesn’t mean that what happened back then didn’t bump me down, of course, it did. I was sad and disappointed throughout the semester break, but I didn’t let that stop me. I knew that if I set myself onto something, I could achieve it, it helped me discover how resilient I can be. It made me work not for the grades itself but because I’m passionate about the subjects. And if you like a good comeback story, well … I ended up graduating 2nd in my engineering class. Yes, even with three horribly failed mods.

And now here I am, arguably too aware of my determination and resilience, feeling like I am working towards the thing I always wanted. The factors that were and are stressing me out, the same readings and writings, and the factors that help me unwind, like sharing moments with friends, all of these are the same factors that build the framework for my happiness. So, I hope you feel the same way or that you are on your way to it, at your own pace.

What I’m trying to say is that the university period is probably the most stressed out I have ever been but also the happiest so far, and it is so good to know that those things are not mutually exclusive.

Nevertheless, “stress” in itself, even if it’s the good kind, should be taken in moderation, you don’t want to burn out, and even good stress is met with harsh times. In my opinion, one way to handle these things is with the right *people around you*.

**Part 2: People around you**

Now, you may be involved in CCAs, interest groups, Halls or RCs, or the plethora of things you can do while being a student here. Let’s state the obvious, let’s address the big chonky THICC elephant in the room: Whatever thing you are doing at school besides studying probably contributes to stress, not necessarily the good kind. Your situation may vary, but I would be surprised if it’s all sunshine and rainbows all the time, 24/7.

But, in my experience, all of these activities have funny ways to impact your life. You see, some places are not themselves; they are the people that they’re filled with. And these activities and places have some of the best people I’ve ever met.

If you just take a second to look around, you will find people from many different places. And I’m not just talking about the actual geography of where we all come from, which is indeed true too; you will find people from all around the globe on campus. I’m talking about the stories we carry, the good ones and the bad ones. The myriad experiences each of us bring and how they have shaped us to where we are now.

If you are lucky, you could hear some of these stories. Now realistically, you won’t befriend every single member of your CCA or all the residents in your Hall/RC, heck maybe not even your group project members; that’s just a fact. But I will ask you to try to make an effort to get to know some of them, know people different from you. You will be amazed how mundane conversations can grow into genuine connections and memories you will cherish.

You have no idea what and who you could be missing out on if you don’t make an effort to reach out. You could hear unique and crazy stories about first kisses, first love rejections, firsts concerts, loving pets, and crazy internships. Stories to hold dear and fondly. And don’t feel bad if you can’t remember everyone’s details and stories; because in the end, in the best conversations, you don’t even remember what you talked about, only how they felt.

Nevertheless, I can understand if you think that maybe reaching out like that is not something you usually do. This is where the final part comes into *play*.

**Part 3: Play it safe**

Now, I know that because you also may have this checklist idea in your mind, which, as I already said, shouldn’t be taken too seriously, you might tend to stick with what “works” without stepping outside your comfort zone because you are too afraid of these “uncertainties”.

Well, let me tell you something, if you look hard enough, there will always be reasons not to do something. So you might as well go for it! What’s the point of being so laser-focused on that hypothetical end goal if you cannot genuinely enjoy the process? Does it sound like a gamble? Well yeah, it kinda does because it is, but don’t you have one of the most ah tas casinos in this country? And if it’s a gamble, what are you betting for? Technically you would be betting on yourself, right? I don’t know about you, but I will always bet on myself.

And you know what, it’s true, like gambling you can do the math and have some statistics, but even then, pretty much everything relies on a little bit of luck but often that luck is only accessible to you if you’ve put in a bunch of time and effort beforehand.

Now, I’m all up for being optimistic, but we have to keep a foot in the ground; we have to be realistic as well. I can tell you from my experience and from the people I’ve met that there will be times when you will fail; that’s just a fact. Sometimes things outside your control will affect you or your situation. I mean, come on, have you looked at what has happened everywhere in the last 2 years? But it isn’t the end of the world. Your work and actions will still count for something; you just need to be open to the opportunities.

Let’s go back to myself as an example, shall we? When I decided to go to graduate school, I wanted to know more about research. So, instead of just *assuming* things, I decided to reach out and ask. I sent out tailored emails to 52 professors and scientists from multiple places asking for information, advice, tips, internships, and anything that could get me one step closer to grad school.

Out of those 52 emails, I got 6 responses.

From those 6, only 3 were somewhat positive responses, mostly “see how see how” responses.

And from those 3, only 1 ended up in a face-to-face meeting

This meeting didn’t even result in something “ideal”. I ended up as an unpaid research assistant for a couple of months to see if I was a good fit. This alone sounds like terrible odds, right? But oh well, did I at least got an offer right after? Did the universities saw this and said “can is can lah”?

Of course not! Sometimes things don’t work out like that. After this internship, it still took me two years and slightly more than a dozen of grad school rejections to start receiving PhD offers. One of them was a safe choice to stay where I have been living for the past 2 years, and another one was from this little red dot I knew absolutely nothing about. And so I chose that one. I came to Singapore and became an NUS student just like you.

In the end, you’re always one decision away from a totally different life. I think if you look back on your own journey, you will realise this as well. So yeah, I clickbaited you; the title of this part should be “***don’t*** play it safe” because you won’t believe what you can achieve if you just try. New experiences won’t come to you unless you actively go out and seek them. Your life will stay exactly the same unless you put in the effort to do something about it.

Now, as I said before I want to be grounded. Up to this point, you may think things sound like survivorship bias or that I am romanticising my experiences, and I don’t want that to be the takeaway from this; that is not the lesson.

In reality, not everything up to here was perfect; not everything here in Singapore has been. In fact, nothing truly ever is. The truth is that, along with your own experiences and stories, there might have been, or would be, some hard days, or maybe weeks, perhaps even months. I know this because that has been the case for me.

Perhaps there were times when you weren’t kind to yourself, when you thought, said, and did things you didn’t really mean, times when you hurt the people you care for. And it sucks, it’s painful, and we may wish to change how things went. Unfortunately, we can’t rewind time as much as we would like to.

However, fortunately, there is this amazing thing called art we all do and enjoy. For me, here is where I like to think about music. Pretty much like music, the only thing left to do is go forward, to keep playing. I’m not saying just be careless because we have to own up to our mistakes, but while doing so, we have to still bet on ourselves, still be determined to make things better and grow, to be kinder to ourselves, and be the proper support for the people we care for.

In music, there is this symbol called a [quarter rest note](https://musicadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1024px-Music-quarterrest.svg_-1014x510.png). It basically tells the person to pause and don’t play anything for a single beat. I find it interesting because at least when I see this, I think of pausing, breathing, preparing for the next music note, preparing for what’s next.

So as a very last tip, I would like you to remember this symbol, not for its intrinsic meaning, but for what it represents. When things around you are harsh, think of making a pause, close your eyes, real tight, and then count to three hundred. That’s all you have to do. You just count to three hundred, and when you open your eyes, five minutes will have passed.

And even if things still hurt or things are still messed up, or you don’t know what to do, you just made it through five whole minutes! How DARE you be so resilient?!

So if it feels like you can’t go on, you just close your eyes and do it again. Because sometimes that’s all you need. Just five minutes at a time. Sometimes it’s a handful of five minutes, sometimes like in my case it’s a butt lot of them, either way it’s fine, we all eventually get through it. Trust me :).

Because, I’m sure you can handle anything, just not everything all at once.

**Ending:**

So this is it, it can all be summarised with the following:

*Some* stress can be **good**, provided you are **doing what you love**, with the **people you love**, taking **risks** one step at a time.

Whoever you are, wherever you are physically and emotionally. I hope you also bet on yourself. 加油！"

this year I have been doing substitute teaching. Ive done two long term substitute jobs- one at the beginning of the year and I am currently doing one now closing off the year.

The job at the beginning of the year went extremely well, and I made great connections with the admin. 

I am quite nervous about the job right now. It’s pre-k at a Title 1 school, the students in my class have LOTS of behavior issues and I am having a difficult time with some of them. I do not have an aide and am on my own with 13 4-5 year olds. Admin knows it is my first year doing this, Quite a few have seen improvement in my class, however. There was one especially tough student who has SERIOUSLY improved since he has been in my class.

however there is one student who I just have been really struggling to deal with. she is new to the school and DOES NOT want to be there. I am calling the office to get her at least once a day for non-compliance, being aggressive to other students, or having a loud endless meltdown when she does not get her way. The principal at the school who hired me just resigned and will be leaving Monday, but the assistant principals are still there.

I am worried I will not get good references from this long term substitute job. I am worried it looks badly of me to be sending this girl to the office constantly. I  definitely DO NOT want to work at this school due to the severe problems, but I would like to get some references as I apply for full time teaching jobs next year. Do you think it would still be possible to get them from the admin? Would it be horrible if I do not? i have multiple teachers in the district who are willing to be recommendations for me, and the admin from the school I substituted at previously. 

I am doing alternative certification and currently have my SOE (qualifying me for an intern year), so am worried that without connections I will only be able to land a job where they are desperate for a warm body (which is a terrible situation to be in). 

I guess any advice or consolation would be helpful! I’m not so sure how all of this works, so any information would be super helpful."

One is a data analyst at a relatively small fintech company (size\~40 staff) which provides data/risk solutions to institutional investors. Another is a digital intern that I will be responsible for fintech project coordination, driving product uptake and improving digital channel usage (more like a digital marketing/BA role that I won't have many chances to deal with data) at a large international bank.

I am personally more interested in a job related to data since I want to pursue a career as a data analyst/data engineer/IT consultant in the future.

I feel like the first internship can offer me more chances to advance my technical skills, such as python, SQL and Tableau. Also, I think it should be better to consolidate my tech skills when I am still young so that I can have more diverse exit opportunities (even if I switch to a IT-related business role in the future). However, the second one can offer me a big company name on my CV.

Do you guys think the company name or job function is more important in this case? Thanks a lot, I am very new to this community. Hope I find the right channel to ask my question."
ug22sk,2,2022-05-01,"Would it be foolish of me to try to get a position (even unpaid) or internship due to my lack of experience, by either applying to job listings or reaching out via LinkedIn?",Avocadonot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ug22sk/would_it_be_foolish_of_me_to_try_to_get_a/,"I am currently two months into self-learning CS, have completed Harvards CS50x, working on CS50 Python, CS50 Web, and on the side I try to do Leetcode problems and tinker with small projects. As far as I have come in these past two months, I have no illusion that my CS-specific skills or knowledge would be a resource for any company, however I do believe that working as an intern for example or an apprentice would take me much further in a shorter amount of time than me just floundering on my own, constantly shifting the direction of my self-learning.

&amp;#x200B;

I historically learn best by being thrown into the fire, for example my first ""career"" job was a sample analysis job in a manufacturing company that I quickly learned and became shift lead with no prior experience. My second job was in loan processing where I quickly learned how to navigate new software, analyze loan documents, interpret regulations, and handle 3rd party communication. Ended up a very high performing team member but they pushed back against me learning more and advancing which I took quite personally, as I am always striving for continuous improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

Both jobs I basically just put my nose to the grindstone and spent extra time outside of work researching and looking stuff up as well, which typically results in me being a higher performer than my immediate peers after a short period of time. I tend to be very competetive when I am focused on a particular goal.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a feeling that my CS career could be massively sped up/narrowed down if I was in an environment that allowed me to see practical business applications, workflow, methodology, etc. as well as provide some insight into which specific direction of CS I want to focus on. But this time, because CS is so skill-oriented and specific, and because I am so new to it with no formal CS education or experience,  I have a hard time justifying to myself how to convince a company to basically take me on knowing I am dead weight and trusting that I would be able to become more valuable as I have done in the past?"

I will be graduating next semester ""Fall 2022"" with a bachelor's in CS. I have an internship this summer at a great company and I've had another internship at a ""decent company"" in the past during COVID. 

I have an offer for a Fall Internship at a reputable company during next semester, and if I decide to accept, I would push graduation one more semester to the spring. I'm a bit conflicted as to whether I should even bother doing one as it'd conflict with new grad applications during the fall. I know I could apply &amp; interview during the internship, but that could be difficult. I've tried to break down Pros/Cons, and I'm still stuck.  Let me hear your opinion!

Pros: Travel to a new place, learn new technologies, explore different companies, meet new people, low stress and high pay.

Cons: New Grad Applications (Bigger companies hire early in the fall, and I want to apply for them)"

However, I am unable to make a choice between the two. I am listing the pros and cons for both these universities. Can anyone please help me in making an optimal choice?

Waterloo MEng ECE  Pros -
- I have a scholarship of 15k CAD (approx 12k USD). This takes the overall cost difference to about 25k USD. (Waterloo will cost 25k USD less than Purdue)
- Easier immigration/permanent residency. (I am an international candidate and I wish to immigrate, this is the biggest reason why I am a little bit inclined towards Waterloo).
- Very well reputed in Canada.

Waterloo MEng ECE Cons -
- 16 month long course. (I know this isn't a very big disadvantage but I somehow feel that I won't be able to learn much through a shorter course)
- No co-op or internship option. (I don't have much work experience and if I don't get a co-op on top of that then finding a job might get difficult for me, I don't know...you guys tell me)


Purdue MS ECE (Project Track) Pros -
- The course length is 2 years.
-  There's no co-op but I surely can get an internship and work during summer. Getting an intership would help me in getting a job after I complete my graduation.
- It is the project track which means I will be working on a project for 1.5 years. This experience will surely be very helpful.
- Can go for a PhD after graduating.
- Higher ranked (I don't know if this should be an advantage but yes it is higher ranked on paper)

Purdue MS ECE (Project Track) Cons -
- Expensive. Definitely more expensive than Waterloo since I don't have any scholarship.
- No assistantship (TA/RA/GA), project track students aren't eligible to get any assistantship.
- H1B (work visa) issues for international students.
- No chance of permanent residency (I am from India and from what I have read online, waiting time for Indians is 150 years -_- )
- Stressful life (Bigger education loan, visa issues, immigration issues)

I'm in my last year of university for a degree in software engineering. I've been doing fine for the last 3,5 years. This year I had to think of a final project idea to work on and had a programming internship. The internship went fine I had an assignment to extend an existing system and create a mobile app for it, I did it and it was accepted and is used by the company. On the other hand on my personal final project I couldn't find anything I would like to work on I tried brainstorming but still couldn't come up with anything ""enough"". In the end I went with a logistics system, which I had no clue how to complete because of all the technical things in that field and failed on the last year of university where I had free tuition. I'll come back next year, but right know I really want to work on something, but I still can't think of anything that I'm passionate enough and something that would maybe even be accepted as my final project when I come back to university. I really feel motivated to work on something now since I no longer have to stress over my final project and can work on something, even though I don't even know what. I want to write an API with Laravel and React front-end but I just blank out and don't even know what to create.   


How can I overcome this problem and is there anything I can do to find a project I can work on?"

ug4xle,1,2022-05-01,How important is taking an operating systems course if I want to eventually aim for a data engineer / MLOps position?,stuffingmybrain,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ug4xle/how_important_is_taking_an_operating_systems/,"I'm a data science major at my university, and recently started looking into data engineering as a career vs. doing some kind of data analysis. I definitely don't know enough about this field to say for sure that's what I wanna do, but I'd definitely like to keep that option open to myself as I explore.

Now - at my college there is an [operating systems course](https://cs162.org/) but due to various budgetary issues and policy changes, this summer is my last chance to *ever* take this course. I've heard quite conflicting things from my own peers about this course's importance. Some swear it's very important for a SWE to take this course (both for its concepts and the big semester-long team project), and others say it's not important - that it's possible to just self-study concepts for an interview / learn them on the job. 

Now, since SWE was not my end goal I didn't really think much about this. But now that I will potentially be trying to take on a DE/MLOps role (which I suspect might more or less be titled as ""Software engineer in &lt;specific-team&gt;"") I'm starting to think maybe this course is needed. My issue is that this summer I have a part-time internship, and was planning on using the extra time to grind leetcode, and get an AWS certification. I thought this was important as I'm a rising junior, and I need to aim high for my summer '23 internship for a place I'd like to work at full-time, so interview prep is needed. I kind of doubt that I'd be able to do all this in the regular school year while balancing courses / extracurriculars / recruitment. If I take this course, all that goes out the window, as it's known as the hardest/highest workload course in my university - one that screws up semesters, say nothing of a summer that goes twice as fast. 

My question is - is it worth it to take this course and potentially not do the leetcode grind / AWS / interview prep? Will not having this course on my resume make a difference if I ever apply to MLOps / DE / SWE roles as a new grad? Or will it be doable for me to just study the concepts on my own time? 

Thanks in advance for any advice! This is a question I've been wrestling with for quite some time, so any input would be very useful!"

ug7qpm,1,2022-05-01,Is a CS certificate/minor from a good university good enough for SWE?,2024aggie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ug7qpm/is_a_cs_certificateminor_from_a_good_university/,"Hi, I'm currently a sophomore at UT Austin majoring in Economics and minoring in Finance through the business school. I'm thinking about completing a certificate in CS (it's called Elements of Computing here), so I can switch careers to SWE (used to be premed). The minor requires only 18 hours of coursework and I'm starting it this summer, but to be honest, I have no coding experience so far and all of my internships have been finance related. In addition to the coding classes I'm taking, I also have some free time this summer so I could possibly learn more about coding outside of just my classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it even possible for me to get a good/decently paying SWE job out of college if I complete the certificate, do some projects on the side, and self-teach (maybe I can do a BootCamp)? I can also join some orgs on campus which will allow me to do some projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know FAANG is an extremely long shot right now but will it be possible for me to get into those companies a couple of years out of college assuming I am able to get an SWE job?

So I am 22 yo. Finished my undergrad in 2021 in Economics (don't know why I did that). 

I was so drawn to the corporate life. Working in office with a team, making reports and all, attending meeting and stuff. 

I got into an internship after I completed my college in 2021. Its a very big company. An MNC. I was like okay, i guess I am heading towards my dream goal. Working in an MNC!! 

Interned for one year and realised.... I am not made for office setting... LOL. I feel like job life and working 8 hours is a trap. I think this is the most useless thing a human being can do to himself (lol. look how it changed in a year). 

Now they are offering me a permanent job! 

I went to the office, my manager called me in a room, along with my team leader and voila, hey we have decided to give you a permanent position in the company. I don't think my mind ever went through 1000 thoughts rushing into my brain at once. It was like everything I needed in my life and also the only thing which i wanted to avoid in my life. 

My answer - "" I am looking forward to my journey ahead in the company"" 

Damn. 

But I am yet to receive the offer letter. And I can reject or accept it. 

I am absolutely not going to spend my whole life doing an 8 hour job. I am simply not made for corporate world. 

I want to search for more career options in which i get to travel the world and earn a living from it. I recently found that you can teach English as foreign language overseas. I need to work a lot on my English but I am sure I know how to teach. I have been taking coaching classes (as a coach) in my college days and my students were damn happy with me and their report cards proved that I can do this shit. 

Though this is only one of the possibilities. I really have to find what interests me and how can I mix travelling with it. 

While I am trying to find my career, this company is sitting on top of my head with an offer letter. 

Should I accept it? Will it be of any significance to have some corporate experience? I already did an internship for 1 year, does it count as an experience? 

I know I don't want corporate life anymore, but in case I find a ""job"" which matches with my interests and also allows me to explore the world, i guess corporate experience would be beneficial. 

So should I just reject this offer and start exploring new things? 

Or should I accept it?"

ug8s87,76,2022-05-01,"A US Student's Guide to Applying for University in the UK (Cambridge, UCL, Manchester, Sheffield, and Cardiff)",F180R25,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ug8s87/a_us_students_guide_to_applying_for_university_in/," 

*I applied to 5 Universities in the UK as a US high school student and wanted to share my experience and some things I learned so that the application process is smoother for you guys. Oh, and be warned; this is a long post.*

# Some things to note

A university is the actual school itself where you get a degree, like Oxford, London School of Economics, or University of Exeter (think academics, faculty). A college can be two things, either the residence hall/college (like Christ College or Jesus College at Oxford), or where many students go for two years after completing school at age 16 to prepare for entering university. A bachelor’s degree is usually 3 years, where in most cases, you will be pretty heavily focused on your major, rather than a wide range of classes like in some US schools. Some universities have “programmes” (degrees) with more strict or lenient requirements for what “modules” (classes) you have to take in order to graduate. Some schools offer 4 year bachelor's degrees, 4 year undergraduate master’s degrees, and 5 year undergraduate master’s degrees. These usually add some other element, such as a year abroad or in placement (an internship or job at a firm). 

Most of the time, you will be choosing a major early on in the application process, which also makes switching majors while in school quite difficult. The cost of tuition, room, and board surprisingly, can be less than at many private colleges in the US if you don’t qualify for aid. UK colleges won’t really care about your GPA, as long as it is above a certain value, like 3.0, because it is hard to compare to other applicants. They really care about standardized test scores. For instance, Cambridge &amp; Oxford will want five 5s on AP tests in the last 3 years, whereas others might want two 5s and three 4s or some other combination. 

# UCAS Application

Firstly, most UK universities use the UCAS system, which is one application, like the Common App. You can only have 5 applications, so choose wisely. The application is split up into a few sections: Personal details, Contact and residency details, Employment, Education, Nationality details, English language skills, Supporting information, and Finance and funding. The deadline is usually in January, but is in October for Cambridge and Oxford, as well as certain majors. 

**Personal details:** 

It’s fairly basic, just enter your title, first and last name, gender, and date of birth

**Contact and residency details:**

It asks for your email, address, phone number, and if you want a nominee, who can act on your behalf. I didn’t select a nominee. 

**Employment:**

It asks you to title your job, the employer name and location, start and end date, and choose part-time or full-time. There is no place to explain or describe your job. 

**Education:** 

Things get complicated at this point. They want you to list all places that you were educated at from about middle school onwards(or 5 year prior to the year you apply). You list if you studied full or part time. Now, you have to select qualifications, like a graduation diploma. Within that diploma, you list all the classes you have taken in the last 2-3 years, as modules. Additionally, list all your AP, SAT, ACT, IB… tests that you have taken (with scores) and will take in the future as separate qualifications. You could put the class name as a module for each qualification, but that seems redundant, especially since you listed those courses in your diploma qualification. Now, generally speaking, educational qualifications (test scores) have the highest weight if they are completed in the last 3 years of your education. For instance, some universities will only count AP scores from the last 3 years; any taken prior to that do not count. 

**Nationality details:** 

This is pretty simple, where you list your nationality, passport number, and the date you first entered the UK if you have. 

**English Language Skills:** 

I didn’t need them, since I was a US applicant, but international applicants might need to submit a TOEFL number or an IELTS number. 

**Supporting Information:** 

It asks you a few questions about EU status, special needs, and disability status. 

**Finance and funding:**

The application asks what your main source of funding is for your studies. 

**Reference:** 

You should send a reference, which usually is done by a counselor rather than a teacher, since they want to see an academic overview. They ask for the referee to provide predicted grades, which is obviously difficult to complete. My counselor had never done this before, so I have no idea if he actually did it correctly or not. 

 That is it for the UCAS application (other than the personal statement below), but there can be more work for other universities.  

#  Personal statement 

This is the most important part of the application, save for your standardized test scores. You have 4000 characters, including spaces, and 47 lines to write your essay. My essay ended up being 660 words, or 3948 characters, since I ran out of lines. I find that this essay is easiest when you have the same major track for all applications. 

I started with identifying my interest in my major and why I want to study it in university. I transitioned to how I have shown my interest, which is through relevant extracurriculars. After that, briefly explain any other extracurriculars, job experience, and academics that show skills or learning experiences that you can use in your studies. For example, I critiqued a project that I had completed and showed how it led me to a new, more nuanced view of my intended major. At the end of this section, you should briefly list some other extracurriculars and activities to give some extra breadth to your image. Work, volunteering, and leadership experience should be expanded upon in your essay. At some point in this essay, explain why you want to study in the UK. 

Comparing this to the US, this essay is the only chance you get to write in the application. Use it to highlight the best aspects of you, that the admissions officers can’t see from your test scores. Unlike a Common App essay that tells a story, I used this essay to give a few brief insights into who I am. 

#  After the UCAS is Submitted 

I will note that some universities, like Cambridge, have an extra application step, (called a **Supplementary Application Questionnaire** for Cambridge), which has a deadline around the third week in October. There, you can write about why you are applying to the school, send a copy of your transcript, explain why you took/didn’t take certain classes, list dates for interviews, explain how you will pay, fill out a chart for the classes you’ve taken, and explain any additional information. You choose which college you want to be considered for here. Some are more well-known for their high endowments, academic reputation, or quality of housing and food. These will generally see more applicants. 

Cambridge says that they don’t have different acceptance rates for each college, but looking at their provided admissions statistics on their website, there is some variation between colleges. Now, they have a winter pool, similar to a waitlist, where strong applicants who didn’t get in are considered by other colleges. While this is a good idea, an application in the winter pool won’t get as close of a look than from the college they applied to. My advice is to apply to a college where the acceptance rate is close to the university average, rather than too far in either direction. 

For applications where a portfolio is required (most, if not all art-related majors), expect to send a 6-20 page portfolio at a certain page size, usually A3 or A4, and PDF file size. This might be looked over in an interview as well, so be prepared to talk about each work. Just carefully look at the requirements, to see whether you may be allowed to include text, or not. Many universities will also require that you send in a piece of work specifically for them. The University of Sheffield, for example, had me create a representation of my street, however I wanted, while also providing a text description on how I interpreted the prompt. Also, University College London required me to take a photo of an everyday object and draw that object at two different scales. 

**Application Assessment**

Some universities, like Cambridge, have application assessments for different majors. Some are similar to standardized tests, others involve essays or even drawing. With COVID restrictions ending, I would expect that they will require that these are completed in-person, rather than online. Some of these tests won’t have locations near you, but you can try to get it scheduled at your school if you plan ahead far enough. Check to see whether your assessment is prior to the interview in November, or during your interview. For myself, I had two parts to my assessment. Since it was online, I was allowed to split my time however I wanted, within one hour, for an essay and a sketch. 

#  Interviews 

You might be offered an interview. Unfortunately, expect these to occur in the morning in the US, which means you might have to miss school or wake up extra early on the West Coast. I had two interviews, at UCL and Cambridge. My UCL interview was with a program director and was very conversational and laid back. This one was very similar to other interviews I had for my US applications. These interviews seem to be more important for your chances of admission in the UK compared to the US.

However, my Cambridge interview was very different. My two interviewers very carefully read my personal statement and asked me questions that related both to the things I had mentioned in my essay as well as my chosen major. For example, since I applied to architecture and I mentioned that I played music, one interviewer asked me about if I thought that there was a connection between music and architecture that I could find, or use when designing. During my interview, I was assessed by being shown two google earth, top down images of cities, and giving my thoughts on how they developed and how I would compare them. Overall, they asked me a variety of questions in order to see how I could work through difficult questions that didn’t have a single correct answer. As long as you can order your thoughts quickly and provide an answer that shows how you are thinking, the interview will be fine.

# Decisions and Offers

You can be given an **unconditional offer**, where you have met all of the requisites for admissions. Most people are given **conditional offers**, where they need to meet some condition for the offer to be fulfilled. Usually, for US students, this is in the form of having the correct number of AP tests with scores of 4s or 5s, or graduating from high school with a certain GPA. Sometimes, you can be offered to switch your major for admission. I was given the offer to switch to Urban Studies at Sheffield, since I hadn’t been offered a place for admission in Architecture. 

As I’d mentioned before, Cambridge allows for a winter pool, where strong applicants are given a second look by other colleges in the system. Applicants can go through another round of interviews, or will be given an offer from the College without an interview. 

You usually have until late May to make your decisions through UCAS, with a firm choice, and an insurance choice. The insurance choice is in the event that you didn’t meet the admissions requirements in your conditional offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** The UK has a lot of great options for undergraduate degrees, especially if you like the shorter time for a bachelor's degree (3 years), potentially cheaper tuition (compared to private and OOS schools), and a more independent academic environment. The application system is fairly straightforward, unlike in the US (looking at you, ApplyTexas).


Edit: Universities in Scotland take 4 years for the bachelor's degree, like the US."

The thing is, all of my CS required Java classes were in the first half of this degree and now that they're completed I'm now in a dry spell in terms of classes. I've done well so far and scored a 4.0 for all of them. Except I did it only for the grade, following the videos and emulating what the instructor explained as much as I could, and to stay on track as much as possible. I was always stressed out to keep up with a couple classmates with several years of experience under their belt (I had none practically). The instructor also added a 3-exam-drop-lowest kind of policy which means I didn't even study or attend for the last third of the quarter. 

Now I'm in the school's tutoring center to tutor the current programming students and I don't even understand my own projects half a year later and is SOL in helping many of them. Two to three times a week I do Leetcode with only the topics I know and basically skipping important topics like graphs, stacks, queues etc because I don't even know the topics. 

I have a Udemy account and own a copy of a Java masterclass series with 80 hours of videos and it looks like two thirds of the thumbnails are familiar. Now that I have 1 year to get better, and I want to put in the effort to better myself, but I feel that going through these videos is a giant waste of time of diminishing returns, yet I may be told to start my own projects (I do have some ideas on what I'd like, but I couldn't even get started with the design UML's as taught in class) but I feel absurdly inadequate. I don't even know what subset I should be diving in. I've also worked hard to become the VP of a CS club but due to my lack of hard skills compared to many others, I don't even know how to run it.

My question: Given 1 year and significant amount of free time, what would you do to improve your skills and basically attractiveness for future employment, internships, and university admissions? I currently have no CS related internships (it looks like internship apps are closed for summer)

TLDR: In CC studying CS, took classes solely for grades and not engagement and now stuck in limbo on next steps because didn't learn much in class"

Should I get some certifications to round out my skills? I wasn't taught a modern javascript framework like React or Angular in school and only learned a little bit about them during internships. I also know nothing about REST or SOAP apis, ""containers"", and seemingly many other things that weren't included in my classes. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure of what I'm ""supposed to know"" and wondering how to best develop a plan to do well in interviews so I can get hired by a company I like. I genuinely don't know if I'm ready to be hired now or if my time would be better spent continuing to learn for another 6 months. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"
ugd196,2,2022-05-01,How Can I Find an Internship Around This Schedule? Is it Feasible?,KartoffelPaste,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ugd196/how_can_i_find_an_internship_around_this_schedule/,"I'll keep it short and thanks in advance for reading.

I work full time (8am-4pm) and go to school fulltime as a moonlight (I specifically take online classes on an accelerated program). My schooling schedule is extremely flexible and I can do it at any time as long as I make grades and meet deadlines. My major is a BS in Computer Science. I also study on the side for industry certifications. I am trying to obtain experience in computer science/it, but am having a hard time finding a new job to get that experience because of my lack of experience. I am trying to look down the internship route, even though it'll add more to my plate but a means to an end and all that. 

Is it possible to have an internship that I could integrate into this schedule? Should I try shifting things around?  
There is a tangible risk in the future of my job schedule changing to a later start and end time, but not for certain.   
Where is a decent place to find internships?   
Just hoping for some insight from people in the field if this is unrealistic or if I should just take another approach entirely."

So I’m going into computer science this fall at McGill university, and hope to start doing internships sooner than later. However, (I don’t know all that much about internships), most of them that I’ve seen require proficiency in multiple languages, database experience, full stack development, as if you were applying to a full-blown job. Is it meant to be this hard even when starting out? Is leetcode and personal projects really any good if you don’t have the prerequisites mastered? I’m just feeling discouraged and was looking for some advice."

* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

* 20	Courses for Power Engineering. PhD in the Energy industry. Options after undergoing a diploma course in the same industry. Job prospects, not necessary, but if indicated will be gold.
* 21	Any info on sports mba and is it really effective? How can someone with btech get into the sports industry?(For ex, working with ISL through IMG Reliance as data analyst or something)
* 22	Economics and what can people majoring in economics do to be more employable.
* 23	Alternatives to CA for commerce kids

* 29	MS experience from abroad, special focus on Jobs
* 30	career path and scope of engineers working in VLSI design and computer architecture in India.
* 31	different career paths for a computer science student or a computer science engineer. It should give students an insight about what they may have to do at work or to try for a different position.
* 32	Part-Time sources of income for students in schools and colleges \[advices concerning an Indian-Specific environment\]
* 33	step by step guide on foreign education after high school in india

* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!

* 44	Syllabus needs to include real life topics like parenting, mental health, home maintenance, how to enjoy life, financial planning, etc
* 45	lesser-known professions or sector which the general public think aren't good enough, but surprisingly pays well or have some other advantage like good work-life balance.

I am currently a 4th year CS undergraduate student at BITS PILANI (Tier 1 college in India). My GPA is 7.73. I have recently given the GRE and got a 326. 
My profile in brief:
GPA - 7.732/10
GRE - 326 / 340, Quant 167, AWA 5
Research papers - 2 in IJRAR, one under review, IEEE
3 industry internships, one of them was in a product based US company for 5.5 months.
I have many projects in CS fields, including Web development, Android app development and one project each in AI, NLP and DL.
TOEFL I am yet to give, but will surely score 110+.

I suggest the erudite peeps here to share their knowledge about my chances to good universities for MSCS for Fall 2023. My personal preferences would be in California, but universities at all places are fine. 
Also, can anyone tell me whether or not I have a decent shot at top 30 universities in the US?"

I am going into my first year of university in Canada for computer engineering, from high school. However, I would like to land some internships in the software field, like good internships, maybe not FAANG level, but somewhere relatively well-known. What are some things I can do to boost my chances and improve my portfolio? I have been programming for some time in Java (on and off, but I am getting serious), but I still struggle to solve some easy questions on LeetCode and am not sure how to get better. I have made some projects in Java, but they were mostly school-related like a Pokemon-replica game with Swing. However, I am working on a personal news app in Java on my own, but that's about it. 

I don't feel like I'm doing enough or am good enough to land those internships or get where I want to be, so I want to get better at coding. But I don't know how to get better and I feel stuck. I know asking for a complete roadmap might be a longshot, but some guidance as to what I should do would be very appreciated.  

Thank you."

   * Takeaways:  
Honestly looking back on this whole entire process, I really had no intention of going to the UCs or seriously going to UC Berkeley. I applied at 2am as a crapshoot and ending up getting in to one of the most prestigious schools in the country and the world LOL. The portal hack kinda ruined the surprise for me but hey I am Berkeley 2026! Now, after going through the high school admissions process for NYC (only nyc students know how traumatizing that process is LMAO), I was really down on myself for the longest time and I was upset and felt prisoned in the position I was placed in. Sometimes I do still feel that way in which I lost more than what I could have gained. But the opportunities I sought out, the people I met really made the difference for me and my hope is that anyone reading this post does the same to. Challenge your curiosity, seek out the impossible and one day you will get results. For the past few months I have devoted myself to tutoring kids in my community. These past few months have left me bleary-eyed and in the words of an admissions officer it has been a privilege. I am mentioning this because all of us in a2c have dreams and ambitions and struggles within ourselves. One of the reasons why I started tutoring was that I saw the beauty in education and how it can really make a difference in people's lives. Though I am unfortunately going to have to leave my tutorial place in the future I would look nothing more than to be apart of their futures and help them succeed in life. And my hope is that everyone else has takes that mentality in whatever you all do. Let my words on A2C serve as a promise to myself to help more and more low-income + first generation students succeed in education and life. Thank you A2C for all the opportunities you gave me. I am eternally grateful. I hope to meet you all one day in person and those going to Berkeley don't be afraid to hmu! Same with my NYC people! I'd love to get know y'all. It's been real A2C; peace !"

Now I have 2 years experience, and I am trying to apply for better paying jobs but my resume always gets rejected. I landed an interview once but he kept asking why I didnt get a full time role from the MNC. I told him that it was lockdown but he remained unconvinced and rejected my application."

I want to keep my courseload light for the fall, and I also really want to get an A in 61a. 

So I can either take 61a in the summer, data 8 + cs70 in the fall, OR I can just take 61a and 70 in the fall (as well as data 8? not sure if 3 stem classes my first semester at cal is the best idea). It would be nice to be able to take data 8 in the fall, since I can declare DS incase I don't meet the GPA requirement for CS. 

I'm also working a remote / hybrid SWE internship at a startup this summer (it'll likely be at or near full-time), so I'm not sure what the workload of that + 61a over the summer would look like. Am I setting myself up for failure by doing 61a + an internship this summer? Has anyone else done this successfully before? Would appreciate a quick reality check on this."

ugkvyg,1,2022-05-02,I'm about to graduate college and feel like my knowledge isn't good enough or outdated,Riyzen4,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/ugkvyg/im_about_to_graduate_college_and_feel_like_my/,"So I'm going to a technical college that specializes in teaching a variety of coding languages. Primarily though, it focuses on Java(of course there are other languages to learn, ive learned Java Python C# HTML ETC, but it primarily focuses on java for my degree). 

My biggest concern is that my college actually uses outdated methods for web development on the backend side of things with Java.

We use NetBeans IDE, Servlets and JSPs as well as Microsoft MDBs (xd) to create website functionality and databases (for the backend at least.)

My worry is that because I believe these methods are outdated (I could be wrong because I haven't worked an internship or job relating to programming yet) it could potentially hurt any future interviews I have with an employer. 

TLDR: I'm confident in my abilities as a Java web dev, but the methods my college uses feel like they could be outdated. I haven't experienced the real world yet and would like to know what it's like from some of your experiences"

Tempted to lie about family misfortune to revert the choice. Thoughts?,fragile-egg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ugp6sl/signed_an_offer_at_a_big_co_to_relocate/,"So I’m a student in eastern north america who has a returning internship at a large tech company. Two months ago I was matched to an ambitious project for my summer internship and was given the choice of relocating or going remote, and that the decision once made would be final. In my excitement over the project, zeal over the novelty of travel, and misguided dreams about the experience I chose to relocate. Unfortunately as my start date approaches in June it’s become more apparent to me that despite prioritizing it, my mental health hasn’t recovered as much as I have thought since quarantine and my life circumstances have made me rethink things. I become more convinced that as a rising senior in my position it would have made much more sense for me to spend my final college summer continuing to work on myself and prioritize time with my family, friends, and community before I pack up and disappear to ??? on a newgrad offer when I graduate next year. In addition the complications introduced such as organizing my first move, coping with how a move cuts me off entirely from my current therapist and health team, and the agoraphobic fear of throwing myself out into a brand new area prematurely have all been stressors that are adding weight to the stack. All of it has unfortunately led me to ponder possible ways of plausibly convincing someone (my recruiter or otherwise) to somehow get me switched back to remote. One of those would be to lie about a serious family situation or something similar. Despite the questionable ethics, the hypothetical benefits to my self and the fact that my team has expressed its comfort with remote work has me feeling justified in attempting it. However in addition to the fear of getting caught in a lie, I was indeed told that my choice was “technically final” and I know how immovable the rules can be at large companies. I feel quite lost and I’m not sure what to do. any advice?"

My GF of 1 year started getting cold when she found out I couldn't stay there and when I ultimately moved back with my parents, she broke up with me by just not talking anymore. Later I found out from next GF (who was introduced to me by my ex) that she had found another guy. 

I started studying for a PhD entrance exam and was also texting with this new girl for about 2 months when we started falling for each other, but this one also dumped me claiming that she has daddy issues and needs time to take a break from men and shit like that. So in a span of 4 months I lost my job, got dumped twice and had to move back and live with my parents. Now what pains me aside from that is the emotional and mental condition of my family and what it's like living with them. My brother is very mentally ill and it's very hard to tolerate a lot of his actions and mannerism, and I have a very depressed and angry father and mother who has to live with them because she's ill. All of this has taken a very very bad toll on me.   
I am 29 year old, overweight, jobless porn addict who is forced to live with his parents and can't find a job and also failed his exam. I have literally zero focus when studying (I don't know if its ADHD or not) and don't have the will power to resist watching porn more than 2 days.   
I really don't know where my life is going, I'm always jealous of my friends success and talking with a psychiatrist a few times hasn't really helped.

At work I notice that I don't really want to do more than enough. When I get home, I have no energy left to do anything but plop down on the couch and stay there for the rest of the evening.

The worst part is that I have become enormously indecisive. I just don't know what I want anymore. Am thinking of resigning for a switch, but I don't know exactly what.

I'm a noob intern who's working on a very exciting project at a hedge fund. I was recently working on a time series model (An ARIMA model) and was successfully able to replace it with an LSTM with a significant improvement in predicting a continuous output of the test dataset. However, I still feel that I could've done a better job of building the model. So recently I have been reading the ""Attention is all you need"" paper and was wondering if self attention would do a much better job in outperforming the LSTMs. As I read from the paper, I understand that there is an encoder and a decoder block (with different positional embeddings), which handles inputs and outputs of different sizes. But since this is a single prediction of outputs, do I completely ignore the decoder block? How do I go about implementing the paper?

ugt7fd,7,2022-05-02,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (5/2/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/ugt7fd/weekly_job_qa_thread_522022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 119th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

As the title suggests, I'm from London.

I'm almost finished with my second year at university (not prestigious, usually ranks anywhere from 60 to 120 depending on which site you look at). I have opted for a placement year before my final year, and managed to secure a Software Developer placement role at a bank in London (Nomura).

My mid-term goal is to get into a FAANG company (high preference towards Google or Meta/Facebook. Google because it's Google, and Meta because I'm very interested in the Metaverse as a concept). I wanted to know how many years of experience I will be needing in order to stand a reasonable chance? I have had a Data Science summer internship for 2 months at LexisNexis last year, and will have 1 year at Nomura after I graduate. Will it be realistic to aim for Google / Meta as a new grad with this under my belt? Or should I try to spend more years in finance, maybe try out other finance companies like Goldman/JP Morgan first?

Also, regarding Google / Meta, is it helpful to study any particular tech stack? I will be studying leetcode and systems design to prepare as generally advised on the main cscareerquestions sub, but I was wondering if the UK side of things required anything different.

In the long-term, I'd like to get an internal transfer within Google / Meta and move to Silicon Valley (preferably) or NY. Again, how realistic a goal is this? If I'm aiming for a transfer, are there other companies that would be better?

uguejl,24,2022-05-02,My Advice for Pre-Law Students,PanoramaPikachu,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uguejl/my_advice_for_prelaw_students/,"Here are my thoughts about being prelaw at Berkeley: 

I would say probably 70 to 80% of an admissions decision is predicated on your GPA and LSAT score and 20 to 30% is based on your essays, LORs, and resume. 

GPA

Your GPA is key! Post-graduation there is nothing that can salvage a “bad” GPA. For the T14 law schools, there is **no** GPA median below 3.82. For the T6 law schools, **all** GPA medians are above 3.9, except for Columbia, which has a 3.84 median. When applying, you should aim to be **above** a median in order for that institution to be considered a target school. 

In most cases, your major **does not** matter:

Rule of thumb:

* above median GPA in Sociology &gt; below median GPA in Computer Science

Example:

* 4.00 in English &gt; 3.85 in EECS

There is almost no leeway because you chose a “hard” major. However, a 4.00 in EECS may be preferable to a 4.00 in English, though any difference would be marginal because a 4.00 is already above all T14 medians. Also, majoring in Political Science or Legal Studies does not boost your chances because you would not stand out. But, in an effort to stand out, do not try to take on a major that is too hard for you. Understanding your limitations is incredibly important. 

Also, keep in mind that when you apply for law schools, you submit all of your transcripts to LSAC, which then recalculates your GPA. To LSAC, an A+ is a 4.33. Therefore, major in something that you are passionate about so that you can collect those A+s. 

Three more things: (1) You might not apply for law school. Things change all the time. You need to balance your desire for a high GPA and the practicality of the degree. (2) Admissions people see your GPA before your transcripts. PNP to maintain your GPA. A P does not factor into your GPA, but anything below an A drops your GPA below a 4. However, you should not be excessive, such as PNPing all your courses in a semester except for one. (3) You can submit GPA addendums to law schools, though, sadly, I would not count on them to have any major sway. This is because there is almost always another applicant who has a similar background yet is a numerically stronger applicant. 

LORs 

Letters of Recommendation (LORs) are important. Network with your professors. Go to OHs. Your GPA also benefits.

Extracurriculars 

Remember, your GPA is key! Your involvement as the president of some “premier” prelaw club cannot override a “bad” GPA. You can always build up a resume after you graduate. 

Top-level: You should be involved unless you absolutely cannot handle anything besides your classes (which is okay as long as you apply for law schools after you accumulate some post-grad work experience). 

These are some guiding questions when choosing what to invest your time in:

* Would this activity interfere with my grades?
* Do I have a legitimate interest in this activity? 
* Does this activity make me stand out from other applicants?
* Can I obtain a LOR from a professor or employer from this activity?
* Could I use an experience from this activity to craft a compelling essay?

Your answer for Q1 must be “no”. However, for the remaining questions, you should keep those things in mind. Strict adherence to these questions would probably mean that you are not involved in any school clubs for the purposes of getting into law school, though there is nothing wrong with participating in something out of pure interest. Some good activities that you may consider participating in include research, general school-year jobs, internships, and more.

What about prelaw clubs? Not that helpful. How would a prelaw club make you stand out? No member of a prelaw club can submit a LOR for you. Your experience there would not help you compose a compelling **and** original essay. But, you may be thinking that joining a prelaw club demonstrates an interest in the law. Okay. Sure. However, an internship where you actually work on public interest problems or work at a firm is a stronger display of your affinity for the law than participating in a club where you awkwardly get drunk and occasionally cover questions such as “Who is the LSAT?” Still, there are reasons that you should join, such as wanting to network with other prelaw students or needing a structure for your prelaw experience—these are super important things, especially the networking!

Bottom Line: Your GPA should be your baby! 

But what about your fun college experience? You can have both, but you need to prioritize your GPA.

LSAT

Important! However, do not allow the LSAT to interfere with your GPA. You can always take the LSAT after you graduate, though, with the proper schedule, you can both maintain your GPA and study for the LSAT. 

Conclusion

At the end of the day, all that I have said is from my perspective. Think of my advice as advice. You need to figure out what works for you. Just do not neglect your GPA. Do your best! I am a random stranger on the internet, so be skeptical of what I have to say. Who knows, maybe I am going to Cooley Law or I am just a pre-frosh trying to sabotage my competition."

ugxjht,2,2022-05-02,Just Withdrew From a Nine Month Internship Where I learned Nothing (Long Story),RenGR_,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ugxjht/just_withdrew_from_a_nine_month_internship_where/,"Last year, my college like countless others, held classes remotely because of COVID. I thought that this would be a great opportunity to find an internship in my field as I would not have to relocate or anything. For some background, I am a film major, which meant I could find work as an editor on literally any project.

Apparently I was wrong. No one was looking for an editor, and if they were they wanted one in New York or L.A. Still, an advisor gave me someone's contact in L.A. who was planning to shoot something near my college. Because I live in the same state as my college, I was willing to drive. I spoke to the guy, everything seemed great. At the end, he said, ""I'll contact you soon."" I didn't realize it at the time, but this was not going to be the last time he would say this.

Forward a few months, I am now back on campus. Now in my senior year of college. The guy still has not contacted me. I speak to an advisor, he tells me to ""keep contacting him."" I'm freaking out because I don't want to struggle to find another internship again, so I do so. It takes about three to four weeks to schedule a meeting with him and my advisor. It takes another three for him to finally give me some work. 

We had a break during this semester, so I contacted him to let him know I had free time. He again told me He would have work for me soon. After almost a week he sends footage to edit into a sizzle reel. I finish this two days earlier than he wanted it, he contacts me the next day and says ""Good job."" As this is supposed to be a learning experience, I'm confused. No advise? No criticism? It's good as is? He doesn't contact me for a while.

Time goes by, We are now in THIS SEMESTER. He sends me some more footage without any context, and tells me the next day to make another sizzle reel, I think? It was so long ago the details are fuzzy. Anyways, the week of, a lot happened. There were some family issues I had to deal with and on top of that, a close friend of mine took his life. the next week I emailed the internship and told him I apologize things were taking so long, but I'll make sure I get the work done. He called me a few minutes later, honestly the fastest he'd ever gotten into contact with me and said ""Oh, wow. I sent you that footage a week ago."" There was an awkward pause, but he told me to take my time. 

Time goes by, I contact him to let him know I'm ready to work again. He doesn't respond until the next day and tells me he'll call me on a Monday. That Monday comes around, no response. I call him, he tells me he friend passed away. After I had just gone through the same thing, I understood how that felt and wanted to give him some time too. Another month goes by. He texts me, asks me if I'm still interested in the internship. I'm running out of time as this is my last semester of College and I want to graduate. I tell him I am, he says to call him on Thursday at 11am.

I get up early, call him at 11am, no response. five minutes go by, he texts me, ""Sorry. Something came up. I will call you soon."" That was April 21st. Today is May 2nd. How the fuck is ELEVEN DAYS ""SOON""??

I spoke to my advisor the next day, he knew this issue was going on from the beginning. All he has to say is ""Yeah, we should have stopped this sooner."" I HAD TOLD HIM THAT LAST SEMESTER SEVERAL TIMES. ALL HE WOULD TELL ME IS TO KEEP PUSHING HIM. I asked if we could waive this and I could still get the credit hour for the internship, but because I only had 22 hours AFTER NINE MONTHS, he can't just give me the credit. Because of this, I can walk during graduation WHICH IS NEXT THURSDAY but I can't get my diploma until I get the credit hour.

The guy tried calling me about an hour ago, I let my phone ring until it stopped. After a while, I hopped onto my laptop to email him and let him know I'm done. I also let him know that because of the lack of communication I can't get my diploma. He derailed all my after graduation plans, and now I don't know what to do. Every internship I've contacted has gone ghost like they did last year."

- how difficult is it to get internships during your freshman/sophomore year? are there a lot of resources on campus that help you land an internship?

- for anyone that has taken the cs placement exam...how did you prep? are there any textbooks or websites that you recommend?

- are there any extracurriculars that you would recommend? (they could be for fun or cs related :) )

- how would you recommend spending the summer before my freshman year of college?

- for anyone that has done collegium v...what were your favorite/least favorite classes that you took and why?

- what are the different events the honors program holds like? (i'm super interested in learning more about honors night out and the table talks with industry professionals)

- any unrelated pieces of advice for a nervous incoming freshman?"

The following situation I'm going to describe is hectic, and does  cover issues with emotional Abuse. Please excuse any typos or time jumps. It's a lot, but I would appreciate if someone can help with some advice to push through. Thank You.

I'm 20. I was diagnosed with Adhd around mid 2021. I struggled with it my entire life. It was pure chaos through my social and academic experiences. I was always seen as stupid or lazy. Except when I hyperfocused on my love for computer technology. But I always got sidetracked by almost everything I needed to do. My memory was terrible. I couldn't handle life the way others around me did. 

I was abused by my narcissistic father who was in and out of my life until late elementary school, along with being downed by my own teachers. It grew into me becoming highly anxious and depressed by time I was in the 8th Grade. My mother was loving, but unfortunately my family is highly religious fundamentalist, and stigmatized/questioned the legitimacy of mental health disorders. So I never got treatment, because my Mom was told by others I could risk becoming a drug addict if I was diagnosed and prescribed stimulant medicine. So she thought that Adhd was fake, and pharmaceutical companies only used it to sell pills(Not that I'm saying pharmaceutical companies in America are charitable). 

I failed the 9th Grade. Went to Homeschool. Failed Again. Found a program that worked better for me. Failed a few times, but I had an adviser help me in a more quiet environment. I have a high school credit profile at 11th Grade. Then...in 2020 the pandemic hit. We went remote. My Mom wanted to me stay in our home because I'm an Asthmatic and she didn't want me to contract the virus. 

I became more depressed. I couldn't focus on my classes. I did spend time with my Mom and honestly outside of a few disagreements, we had a very strong emotional bond. 

In late June 2020, My mom had a brain hemorrhage. She died a few days later in the hospital. I was absolutely broken. My mind was numb. I went in a downward spiral of anxiety and guilt.

I went to stay with my Aunt at her home not to far from where my house was. I stayed there, while my mom's funeral arrangements were being set. My narcissistic father came back in the picture. He wanted to control her funeral arrangements. But I was able to stop it.
Her funeral happened. I broke down. So many members of my family were crying. Genuinely in pain, because many of them were my older cousins that she used to babysit. She impacted so many lives.

After she was buried, it was nearly 2 months until shit hit the fan. My Aunt and her husband became very verbally abusive. They were trying to con me out of a small inheritance my Mom left me.

They kept tearing into me for months. I couldn't function. I was having panic attacks. It got really dark, so me being in  desperate need to get out of there phoned my Dad. Granted, I didn't realize he was a narcissist. I just thought he was struggling mentally. 

He helped me get back to my house. Then, he crashed there. My parents were separated and not divorced, and my State doesn't allow the challenging of sn estate without a will. He fucked me over. Took her house. Moved his girlfriend and child(He cheated on my Mom with her) into my home. Moved his stuff in. And I was so traumatized, I shut down.

 I went into therapy at the end of 2020. Was suggested to seek psychologist after my therapist noticed I couldn't focus on goals set, and I went through 2 separate psychological assessments. Adhd combined type. I was put on meds. Helped, but weren't right for me. Tried to bargain my inheritance to get my home back. He drained me of the majority of my inheritance. He abused everyone mentally. I became so upset, I contemplated beating him physically for everything he did. My friends calmed me down. I've been a peaceful person for the majority of my life, but he took that from me. I ran with what little money to my name I had left. My favorite gear/ belongings are stuck at the house, which will end up in foreclosure since he and his girlfriend leach off welfare, and he only obtained my Mom's pension. Meaning he'll eventually get crushed by property taxes.

Someone I knew let me stay with them(initially until June of this year). I really appreciated they cared. That was until they realized my Adhd could impair my ability to handle certain task. They became frustrated, and threw me out shortly after. Fortunately I have a job.

Unfortunately I don't get paid enough to afford any apartment in my city. My trauma is overwhelming. My adhd even with meds, is a mess to maintain focus or motivation. I used to be an intern at a non profit. I was on Zoloft and Adderall, and it killed my emotions. I was kicked out the internship. I did so many things(research related to troubleshooting office equipment, editing videos beyond my scheduled time, educating them on social media platforms to expand in outreach)for the non profit. Simply because I enjoy helping others. They refused to give me opportunities to get freelance Video editing projects after I was fired, with other non profits. I did a project for one non profit, and made sure I didn't get a follow up opportunity when she wanted another video edited. Even though they knew about my life circumstances. I felt so betrayed. I still do.

My inheritance is nearly tapped out, and I'm likely going to go to a shelter soon. My family keeps contacting me, but I'm so upset I don't want to reach out to them. Everything feels like a mess, and I keep blaming myself. I feel like Adhd has been nothing but a curse for me. I've been destroyed over and over, and I don't want to feel hopeless. I just feel like no one really understands me. I feel like I deserved this, even though I don't. Everything feels so wrong. Can anyone give me advice on a path I could take to avoid giving up? I'd really appreciate it. It feels like my life is over at 20, and it sucks."

I looooove programming. It's problem solving and that's my favorite thing in the world to do. In consequence, I've learned the rudiments of a few different languages -- python, swift, and currently C. And I've been doing this for years... just playing around with what I know, but not to any specific end. I also have some experience with related things like javascript, sql, R, etc. 

I was wondering if there is such a thing as part time programming work that is available for someone who isn't going into it full time. I just thought it'd be fun to work somewhere for the summer either as an intern or who knows... just to see if I can actually do something interesting with what I know and put it to use. Also, money's never a bad thing."

I’m looking forward to pursuing a master’s degree in Mathematical Finance (or a similar degree, like Computational Finance or Financial Engineering) in the US, or one of the top British or Canadian institutions. I have a fairly solid GPA (7.5) for a program like econometrics, considering the fact that a top university like LSE’s admission requirement is a 7.0 minimum GPA for mathematical finance.

To increase my chances of admission, and also to make an introduction to the world of quantitative finance, I applied to the University of Chicago’s Quantitative Portfolio Management and Algorithmic Trading Program for this summer(link below) and got admitted. Based on the way I’m proceeding with my academic qualifications right now, how much value would you say this program would add to me as a candidate in the future? I’m also considering applying for a summer internship next year, so would you say that this program would definitely make a significant contribution to my skillsets and also to my internship application at a top investment bank or consulting company? I couldn’t find any reviews regarding the program, I believe that is because the program is fairly new. Based on the content, would you say that it looks like it is worth 4000 dollars?

I have seen some negative comments against the summer schools as a whole, but maybe an undergrad&amp;postgrad summer school would be viewed differently than the high school ones?

uh0pgf,3,2022-05-02,Is this bachelor's thesis a stupid idea?,WT_E100,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/uh0pgf/is_this_bachelors_thesis_a_stupid_idea/,"Ok so let's jump right in.

  
I have applied for a **bachelors thesis** at a **robotics chair** at my university and was given the option to start it around June if I want to. I did not start immediately since I'm still involved in an automotive club that has it's final competition at the end of may. So right now I'm trying to figure out if I **should really do this thesis** or look for something else.

Anyways, the thesis would be about **mechanical development of a robotic platform** (will have to be defined properly still) and I find it interesting for the following reasons:

* **Robotics seems interesting** and future-proof (more on this later)
* I love design and **mechanical design** is my **biggest strength** in engineering I think
* Wrapping my head around **interesting theory** can actually be quite fun to me and I hope to apply some in this thesis
* It seems like a **gateway both into robotics and into academia** which might provide for the most satisfying work opportunities in the future (I think I am a pretty curious and perfectionist person that **might thrive there**)

However, there are also some drawbacks to this proposition:

* My potential advisor told me that he estimates the **workload at 20-25h/week over 6 months** which is definitely **above average** for a bachelor's thesis. With the classes I'm currently taking this may well have me **working 6-6.5 days a week.**
* He said I would need to **learn some robotics fundamentals on the side**. He suggested an online lecture to get started which I planned to watch until mid-june but this would mean (as I just fully realized) like **4-5 90min lectures/week** if I want to be done until then. So the **feasibility is doubtful** (I previously thought there would be fewer videos).
* I have been noticing some slight feelings of regret over me focusing so much of my life on academics and **not developing myself further in other ways**. Basically I have been **working practically nonstop** on various things (internship,leading position at student club...) for the past 9+ months and it shows. I have had **no semester break** due to this and while I have the energy to keep going I'm doubtful if it's really wise to keep pushing like this for another year or so (and then? at what point do I stop?). I don't regret it overall but if I don't make some changes I may well feel that way later.
* Finally, and this is the most important point in my opinion: **I'm acutally not sure if I'm truly passionate about the field of robotics** and if it will therefore be worth it to put so much into it. Frankly at this point I do not know which field I'm truly passionate about. The club I have worked so much at recently is about building efficient electric vehicles and while I enjoy the engineering work there I do not really see myself going towards an automotive specialization since cars don't actually really excite me. Come to think about it what excites me the most in my day-to-day life are either coming up with ideas for solving problems (super fun) or trying to understand interesting concepts (from lectures usually). But I **do not have one clear direction** that I want to go in specialization-wise and I'm unsure if I'll develop one anytime soon (or ever).

Now I don't expect many to actually read all this but typing it out has been helpful for me already. I basically would like some advice on the following questions:

* **How do I know that I'm passionate** about the topic of my thesis? Ideally **early enough** and not when I'm already in deep.
* If I **want to leave the option of academia open** for later is it important to do this kind of heavy thesis at a chair or can I also do something at e.g. my student club?
* Will it **limit me** later if I do **one more thing related to the auto industry** now (the thesis at my automotive club)? As I already did my internship at an automotive company but I actually **don't want to go into that field** later.
* What **balance** should I strike between **personal life** (hobbies, social life, becoming independent) and **following my passion**? How do I **know that what I do is truly good** for me?

I will be happy ´(if slightly surprised) at any advice :)"

I'm a senior majoring in business management with concentrations in finance and economics with a cumulative GPA of 3.97.  I'm currently working as a student accountant in the finance office for my school and I'm trying to find an internship for the summer.  I'm planning on graduating with my bachelors degree this fall.   

I've applied to most of the local banks and got one interview but didn't get accepted.  I know it's already May and summer is approaching fast.  

Does anyone have any recommendations for me moving forward?  What would you do if you were in my shoes?  Should I keep trying to apply or should I just stick with my current student job on campus? 

I live clear out in Hawaii so my options are kind of limited.  I would still like to get an internship in something finance related (FP&amp;A, accounting, etc) even if its remote or if I have to move somewhere for the summer. 

I appreciate any insight you may have for me.

But I embellished that part of the job quite a bit and now am slightly worried if they call my boss he will say ""no he is just a lab monitor.""

I love school and it energizes me to a much greater extent than it exhausts me.  I'm doing exceptionally well in undergrad and I do far more than the minimum required. I graduate next spring (2023) and I'm already in my late twenties, so I feel like I had more than enough time ""finding myself"" in my early twenties before I dedicated myself to completing my bachelor's. 

I'm also getting a plenty of professional and research experience through my job, an REU internship I had last summer, an honors thesis I'm researching for, participating in a professor's lab group meetings, and volunteering to help grad students and professors with their field research. 

Should I take time off between undergrad and grad school to get a job in my field and ""recharge"" to prevent early burnout? I have a lot of momentum right now and I'm afraid I'll lose it if I take a year or two off -- or I'll just be sitting around wishing I was in school. 

What do you think? What did you do after undergrad, did it work for you, and would you do anything differently now?"

Mental illness, Relationships, and Existing in this world that I'm not built for.",CommunicationAnomaly,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/uh2s3r/could_really_use_some_encouragementadvice_please/,"Hey I'm sorry this is so long, I understand if it's TLDR but if you do read it I sincerely appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole life I've always felt different. A nasty combination of major depression, ADHD, and mild ASD mean that I'm just not wired the same way as other people, even if I have all of the same senses and emotions that they do. I'll skip getting into this too much but basically I was very introverted and closed off when I was growing up and my mental illness went under the radar for a long time and impacted my self-esteem. Although I don't put too much weight in this one, I'm also an INFP to give you an idea of my personality. Between all of those things, I just feel like my priorities, thoughts, and values are different than those of others and it's easy for me to feel that there isn't a place for me in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, I accept myself and my differences more and I have good friends and a girlfriend, but my differences still impact my everyday life. I have about 1/4th of the normal energy capacity. I have little motivation and almost nonexistent willpower. Somehow after years of fighting it and taking time off, I'm finishing up my bachelor's degree and will have a paid internship while I go on to grad school. School is finally somewhat exciting to me for the first time, but I still make my old mistakes with procrastinating and letting depressive episodes get in the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is in a similar boat to me, having issues that have put her through similar hardships. She is also an INFP with social disconnects who feels like there is no place for her. She's been severely depressed lately. She has dealt with severe body dismorphia since her teens, along with another health concern. These issues (or their side effects from medications) basically prevent her from working or studying, at least for now. She undervalues herself and I try really hard to be there for her. She frequently falls into episodes of extreme depression and self-hatred. It reaches points where she ""just wants to fall asleep and never wake up"", feeling like her situation is hopeless. She mentally hits rock bottom and convinces herself that nothing will ever improve and that she's a burden to all those around her. I've had periods like that myself, so I know what it's like, but I really don't think that it's true in her case. She's had traumatic experiences with mental health professionals in the past and is distrustful of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of us just feel like nobody understand exactly how we feel, and that we almost feel ""cursed"" being people who are wired so differently with differing values from others. We're both very empathetic people who find most of the world to be cold and uncaring, with systems in place that benefit the few by abusing the many. It's hard not to feel that such a bleak outlook is the truth. She has basically given up on life from exhaustion, after dealing with this for years. Both of us are only in our late 20's. My outlook is less bleak but I frequently have days where I accomplish almost nothing under the weight of my worries or these issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm looking for by posting this. Any support or thoughts on it are appreciated. Thanks."

CS on time, I am thinking of delaying my graduation by 1 year so that I can take CS classes in ML/Systems that I am interested in that I did not get a chance to, do an extra internship at a top tech company in a more desirable team, and spend time with friends and family. Would employers care that I took 5 years to graduate, or should I just not put my uni start date and only the graduation date to hide that fact? The cost of the extra year is not an issue since I attend a state uni and my parents are able to cover the full tuition. But I am foregoing 1 year of salary ($150k+), and I'm not sure down the line if this will impact my career 5-10 years from now.

I’m thinking about getting a 1 year masters (which will take me more like 1.5 years) tho I’ve read online ms doesn’t actually change your salary that much nor does it really help you land ML roles

My advisor is not sure either."

I live in Algeria so the cost of living is very low ( to give you a picture 15k per year is more than enough), thus I decided to take on low pay remote jobs to enhance my skills and keep my self fed, the problem is that all remote jobs I can find require more skill than I currently have and pay way more than I actually need.

I’ve separated some question, and would greatly appreciate any additional advice!

1. Since Intls are only allowed to ask for a CPT/OPT after 1 year at college, we may only apply for internships in the beginning of sophomore year right?
2. What’s the practical difference between a CPT and an OPT? Which one is more recommended?
3. Is it easy to extend the OPT for 24 months using the STEM-thing allowed by the US?"

Im like a branch owner and we have a CEO too. Over the years ive trained and taught people and gave them new career which all of them are making easy 6figures. 

I would say i am liked by 95% of people. I’m generally well intended and wants to help people. So is our CEO. 

Anyways what i’ve noticed is that lots of employees would just dislike our managers / CEO and blame them for problems that isn’t their fault/ caused by them.

Our CEO is the most kind generous person who helped many of his employees, gave them second and third chances, lend money to some employees so they could put down a downpayment for a house. List goes on

People don’t seem to realize what he does for them and only focuses on mistakes that is made within the store that isn’t even his fault.

When an intern gets fired because they are lazy and disrespectful , suddenly he is heartless and mean.

Anyways ive noticed that the higher the position i move on to, and more money i make, some people just started to dislike me, even tho ive never even met some of them, and some i’ve helped when they were having difficult times. 

Im not perfect, but all my life i tried my best to help everyone whom i can, while striving to be the best in my industry. But i feel like the further i go , more “power” i have.. i just feel more distant from people.

This is going to be a pretty long post so I apologize if this is the wrong place to post it.  I need some advice from the people I look up to and figured this would be the best place to go.

I’m currently a junior at my local state school and have yet to get an internship in finance.  I never planned to go to a state school to begin with as I had been accepted into some of the top 5 universities for finance.  Up until my 19th birthday I was the standard high-achiever/perfectionist (1570 SAT, Valedictorian, 4.5 GPA, club founder, etc.).  However, my final semester in high school my entire world fell apart.  My dad died pretty unexpectedly after being diagnosed with brain cancer.  I had also discovered while he was sick he was cheating on my mother with the help of my aunt and my entire family was destroyed within months.  Being an only child I felt obligated to stay in my home state and take care of my mother especially after everything went down.  Two months before starting school, I decided to withdraw from the Ivy League school I was planning on attending to go to the state school close to my home.  Looking back I should’ve taken some time away from school to process everything that happened, but hindsight is 20/20.

Once I got to college I got involved in the wrong things and seriously hurt myself in the process.  Over the next 2 years I became heavily addicted to cocaine, mdma, Xanax, and Adderall.  I was pretty much in a perpetual zombie state and was extremely depressed and completely ignored school.  My GPA fell below a 2.5 and I felt like a total failure.  I attempted suicide 2 times by drinking and taking Xanax but that only landed me in the hospital.  I still to this day feel the effects of my addiction and suffer from constant mental fog and low energy.

Prior to college I planned on trying to go into quant trading or investment banking.  I taught myself python, C++, Java Script, etc. all in high school and also learned to build LBO models, DCFs, etc. from the WSO &amp; Training The Street courses I purchased.  This made my depression even worse because I had a deep understanding of the technicalities of Finance and Computer Science even before starting my degree but was unable to get my foot into the door due to my poor decision making.  

Over the last year I’ve begun to get back on track academically.  In the fall of 2021 I had my leg broken after illegal dealings went south and decided it was time to turn my life around.   I managed to finish the semester with a 3.5 GPA and finished this most recent semester with a 3.9 GPA.  However, I’m still without an internship for my junior year and am concerned about my ability to break into the industry. 

My question for this subreddit is what you would do in my shoes.  I recently started seeing a therapist as I still suffer from suicidal thoughts, and that has helped tremendously.  What other steps could I take to get back in the right track?"

So I got admitted to UIUC MCS a few weeks ago. I was very excited as its #5 University for CS and since then, I have been trying to do due diligence in regards to the program. 

Now my main goal is to enter the industry for SDE/ML roles.

Major concerns I have are-

1) Its almost next to impossible to get TA/RA position as priority is given to PHD and MSCS students and the fees is a bit high.



2) The program is of only 3 semesters till Dec 2023 so the courseload will be wuite high and between all that I have to do work for internship and job search as well. Wont it be too hectic and generally speaking is that enough time for managing both of these.



3) I was unable to see many members of MCS program  at good companies, post graduation, in LinkedIn. Bur for MSCS, there were plenty of them in good places. So what does this say regarding the career outcome for this particular course. 



4) The cohort size this year has increased to about 400 for MCS (on campus) alone this year (~ 700 admits were apparently given and 400 are expected to join) .
Wont this much size affect the quality of the program and if so many admits were given, how is the peer group?



It would be incredibly helpful, if someone coule shed some light on these 4 points and aid me in making an informed decision.



P.S. 
Also, I have acceptances from NYU Tandon MSCS, Northeastern MSCS Silicon Valley and Boston University MSCS.

Could any of these be better w.r.t placement outcomes and overall experience or would you suggest UIUC MCS over these."

My partner is generous, funny, beautiful, and kind. I love them so deeply. When I was 18, I was sexually assaulted &amp; after, I slept with over 20 people during the span of 4 months during my freshman year of college. 

I slept with my r*pists brother, but I can’t explain why other than a form of self destruction. I dated a guy at the start of COVID for ten months, and he cheated on me with his best friend. He also grabbed my friends ass while she was blackout drunk on a vacation that I took him on and paid for. When I confronted him, he denied it, hung up, and never responded to a message again. 

Last summer, I lived in intern housing in a different city &amp; met a guy. After we became friends, he told me he got me drunk so he could tell me that he had feelings for me even though we were both in relationships. While I was drunk, I told him that I felt the same way, and I indulged him in the conversation. The next day, His girlfriend broke up with him, and my partner forgave me. I did not cheat, and I will never cheat.

I don’t recognize myself anymore. Even though I’m disgusted with my ex and this guy from last summer, I constantly read through our old texts &amp; check their social medias. My partner deserves someone who is fully invested in him, and when I keep tabs on these lowlifes from the past, I feel guilty and inadequate for him. 
I would never actually attempt to see either of these men, my r*pist, or his brother, but I have a compulsive need to check in on them and think about the past almost every day. I also think about calling or texting when I’m drunk sometimes, but I have only done so once or twice. I tell my partner about it every time. I also tell him when they message me. 

I know my trauma plays a large role in my actions, but I’m so sick of being a bad person just because of the things that happened to me. My partner is so understanding of my situation, and he has never made me feel bad about my actions. But I want to be better for him. 

So here’s where I need advice. How do I move forward from my past? How do I let go of my guilt? Am I destined to be this way forever?"

Pandemic 😷 I lost the sales development job and they brought me back 7 months later as a sales analyst on a 😡6 month rolling contract. This is the 2nd iteration going on 3rd for this contract without any mention of added comp but oh the responsibilities (and what I don’t like what feels like tasks)continue to mount.   

Started MBA program in January, so I was a bit late to applying for internship.  So I just started blind apping one day after I found out about MBA internships and how that can help get me out of my dead end situation.  

Got ghosted 👻 by Salesforce for a strategy intern, got scheduled a final round but ghosted lol sucks but from what I understand it was a timing deal.. then proceeded to miss the good to great PM internships… then Kimberly Clark calls, and I did what i do and messed around and got an internship offer for their ABM role. and still have a few consulting apps out their.. 

One of the executives I interviewed with was impressed enough with me to mention that they may have the flexibility to offer me to start the full-time roll after the summer internship ( I was floored but composed) thanked him for the consideration of such flexibility and mentioned it made more sense since this way as I already work a full-time job while completing the program..  
Damn is this even realistic ?  Can this even be done lol?  

Met with another sr exec and they mentioned one thing I have to figure out is will I work both jobs this summer. 

I feel like I will put in my two weeks notice at the end of may so I can get double
Checks through June. I’ll figure my employment situation out for
The fall but I could not pass up this opportunity especially when internship pays about $5/hr more than the contract job.

# Something about myself :

I come from India and I am currently a **full-stack application developer in IBM Consulting**. Though I want to believe I am doing a great job here, I strongly feel I am missing out on my growth. I joined IBM straight out of my undergrad, and I have been working here ever since, and despite having an intermediate knowledge of **Angular and Spring Microservices ( also having some training in the same)**, I have to work on a project powered by **Struts2, EJB and DOJO Framework**. I initially joined an Angular-Spring project, however, I had to switch to Struts powered project within 2-3 months due to a shortage of projects during the COVID.

I also have some internship experience in Data Science and Deep Learning frameworks like **TensorFlow and Keras**. I was part of a Stock Market Consulting startup that allowed me to research various time-series models and variations of LSTMs and RNNs architectures. But I hesitated to convert it to a full-time job, as I was not very sure of the startup's financial stability ( and it got dissolved). Hence I joined **IBM, but as a full-stack application developer. I have been working here for the last 3 years.**

# My current situation:

I have got admission to an **MS program in Computer Engineering at NYU**. I think a Master's will reinforce my understanding of computer systems and additionally allow me to explore better employment opportunities in the US. I also want to mold my curriculum in this degree with a concentration in machine learning, because I want to work on ML projects and be seen as capable of doing so( be it Web integration or cross-platform mobile apps).

But, I also need to be ready for any SDE jobs available, since I am taking a considerable amount of loan for this MS ( ...to get a job fast).

My classes start in September, and I do have some time with me to sharpen my skills. I have already started LeetCode and revising system designs for any upcoming interviews. But I also want to do a Deep Learning specialization course ( [DeepLearning.AI](https://DeepLearning.AI)), which has some amazing content, and also because I think it will at least show some amount of credibility in my Resume ( correct me if I am wrong, will be happy to reconsider ).

**Should I devote my time to LeetCode and System Design, revise NodeJS, Spring, Angular?** 

**OR**

**Should I do this Deep Learning specialization course?**

**I do not want to waste this valuable time I have. Please advise, if there is any other path altogether that I can consider, or you guys think is appropriate for me.**

uhj7e0,5,2022-05-03,how smart is it to get my bachelors online?,PottedFox,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uhj7e0/how_smart_is_it_to_get_my_bachelors_online/,"Hello, 

I've got an AA in Information Technology from 2016 from college in Florida, but I'm currently a Canadian citizen In Canada. The degree is unused and I want to get back on my preferred career path of software engineering.

Thompson River University in British Columbia offers distance learning for their Bachelors of Computer Science program. The program seems good, the rate is fair, and the course is structured to work with my current lifestyle.

My only worry is that their CO-OP program is not currently available for Distance Leaning students. This is a bit of a bummer because a large motivation for getting my BS was to hopefully crack into the industry with a co-op or internship.

The advisor told me that many students procure their own internships and co-ops, and the university has a discord for this. But how difficult is it to find a company willing to hire a student yourself?

More context: I do a bit of programming and game development in my spare time, a few published projects but nothing impressive enough to get me hired apparently. I really enjoy school and feel like I legitimately am going to get something out of going back. Landing a new job isn't my only motivation, but it's a big one.

Thanks for any advice, and sorry if this is a big jumbled. Writing it quickly while I'm in the bathroom at work."

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

- **Gaming:** Primarily Valorant, I suspect that 165hz@1440p will not even be a concern given my other use-cases. I also play Tetrio (guideline Tetris) but the performance seems to be entirely uncorrelated with the hardware it runs on (and I don't mean consistently good...).
- **Machine learning:** I'm a student and have been exploring technique across several fields so I don't have a precise idea of what compute I'll require. I would like the option to run the machine for up to a week straight for model training. I'm particularly excited to have hardware compatible with common ML libraries because I've primarily been using an M1 Mac this year. It's an amazing machine, both in the sense that it performs well and in the stack traces that say various forms of numerical computation aren't working (Looking at you, BLAS/LAPACK!).
- **Software development:** Once again, I expect this to be all over the place. I figure 32 GB of RAM will be merited for TabNine and Docker containers. In general, things running quickly would be nice but I don't have anything precise that I need. Being able to host things on the computer is an interesting idea, though I would not expect to use it as a server for an extended period of time (longer than a day or two).

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

~2500, (singular) monitor included.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA, specifically in Minnesota if there are local deals.

Is there anything in particular I should worry about if I want to dualboot Linux? I'll likely run Ubuntu, Fedora, Manjaro, or Arch.

Day-to-day, do the 3080 and 3080 Ti have any major differences? I'm not particularly price sensitive (woo, SWE internships) but I'll admit I'm mostly going for the Ti as a ""why not"" factor but that's an expensive ""why not"".

Would it be make sense to lean towards the professional hardware series like the Xeon processor (or even a different GPU series) for longer uptime tasks? Would that impair day-to-day performance meaningfully? If I go down that route, would it make sense to buy a refurbished HP Z4 G4 workstation from Ebay then cannibalize it? (Do [any](https://www.ebay.com/itm/185392777627?hash=item2b2a45499b:g:748AAOSwA1RiX0G0) [of](https://www.ebay.com/itm/384698513644?hash=item5991d178ec:g:yqsAAOSwNTRh7~qA) [these](https://www.ebay.com/itm/195013343975?hash=item2d67b37ae7:g:mysAAOSw0Stia8wn) look good?

I am stuck in a rut that feels like I am drowning and would really appreciate any advice. I worked in my home-country for 8 years into IT. My dream was to become a software engineer but at the time I was supporting someone financially and I could not resign. My experience got piled up into IT and those are the only offers I got so I went with it.

Eventually I could resign and immediately after being exhausted working in soul crushing job, I decided to apply for masters . It was big mistake but it was now or never kinda situation and I took it. That resulted in me moving to the US and losing all my confidence. I graduated without a single internship and barely making it out. I was so afraid of leetcode and was also dealing with some personal stressors due to which my coping strategy was to procrastinate. Around that time my university messed up one of my documents and long story short, I had to enroll again into a hybrid masters in the midst of Covid lockdown. I tried to gain some internship experience during this time but only companies that would hire me were unpaid internships and I didn't even get to write a single line of code at these places.

I graduated once again yesterday and I am in a place where I am not confident, have 2 degrees but no job and few internships where I didn't learn anything. My lack of confidence resulted in terrible imposter syndrome where I am feeling like an imposter even to post this here.

What could you suggest I should do? Should I apply for software apprenticeship and will I qualify for that? Are there any companies that will hire me for entry level positions and train me in certain technologies so I can work? My heart feels filled with the urge to work hard and I know I can do it if I just get 1 chance. But its been a long time I have not earned anything and I really need to and want to get a good job. I know I am smart, I have earned awards in my 8 years of IT experience. I just need to get back on track.

All and any of your advice is much appreciated. Thank you."

It will essentially be 2 semesters of coursework, followed by a summer internship and a final semester that is largely dedicated towards a project. 

NYU MSIS - Masters of Science in Information Systems 
Duration: 24 months 

This is a mix of CS and business. I will be taking half of my classes from Courant CS and the other half from Stern. A summer internship and a project. 

I feel like CMU will be a lot more intense given that I'll have to take 4 courses min / sem, of which only 2 would be difficult in nature. I will also have to prepare for internship or full time employment while balancing a very heavy courseload. However, I've been told by mostly CMU students that the brand name has helped them immensely. 

NYU - I believe both Courant &amp; Stern have really good reputation and I'll be able to pace coursework with interview preparation. But I'm worried I'll lose out on the CMU tag, which I believe will help me in the long run. I know NYU, specifically the departments, are also well reputed. I'm not sure of the possibility of working on research or part-time stuff so I can explore my interests beyond coursework, say through participation within CDS. 

I'm mainly concerned that my current work experiences don't measure up with respect to the kind of roles I'm seeking to get into post graduate school. I'd like to work as an MLE/DS. 

Any advice about the field of data science, industry knowledge, interview preparation, school ""brand"" reputation- with respect to my two choices?"

With both orientations coming up next week its becoming harder to choose which school I would like to attend for my bachelors. Any insight on the program and internship opportunities would be great. (As for the disappointment, I don't mean it in a bad way, UC Davis is a great school, however since I got in with a TAG it doesn't feel as exciting to go)

UCD Pros:

* Older major/ more established
* Heard good things from friends who graduated with the same degree
* Cheaper Housing
* Would have the time to minor

UCD Cons:

* Not much to do for nightlife
* Seems boring
* Would feel disappointed (guaranteed admission wouldn't feel as accomplished)

UCSD Pros:

* Great nightlife
* More prestigious school
* Farther from home
* Great research funding
* More connections/ internship opportunities
* SAN DIEGO

UCSD Cons:

* Expensive Housing
* Impostor Syndrome
* New program/ not well known
* Don't know anyone there"
uhun44,1,2022-05-03,Delaying Convocation to the Fall Semester ?,cosmicegg12345,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/uhun44/delaying_convocation_to_the_fall_semester/,"I was planning to graduate with a degree in industrial engineering this semester. Unfortunately I failed one of my classes and withdrew from another because it ended up being collateral damage to my other class that I failed because of how time consuming the class ended up being. I will have to retake at least one class in the fall and there is a possibility that I can take the class I withdrew from in the summer, but the other class is only offered in the spring or fall. I was talking to an academic advisor about my game plan and I asked her what happens now since I applied for graduation and RSVP'd to the convocation ceremony. She said that despite the fact that I had to retake any classes in the fall that I could still walk this spring. The only downside would be that I would have to call the university to tell them that I need to take classes in the fall and they would have to basically reinstate me so I can register for classes because if I walk the registrar and the school thinks I'm gone after convocation. I could move my convocation to the fall without having to pay another graduation application fee as well and I would  be officially done by then. My cousin's in the same state we're planning to come out and my aunt and uncle and my mom who I'm living with. Some of my friends said they may be available on the date of convocation so I would think that some of them would feel bad and let down if I move my convocation to December. My only issue with having the convocation now is that it feels weird and not right. If I have the convocation this semester I feel like Tom Brady putting on a Superbowl champions Tshirt before the Superbowl even starts. It just feels premature because my coursework is not officially completed. If an employer looks for the degree and transcript, they wouldn't see that I completed the degree yet so unless I take a technician or just under entry level  job, it wouldn't make a difference just because I had the ceremony. Some places may hire me, but I am not sure if I would want to work full time with the pace these two classes are. I'm not in a rush to get a full time position at the moment and I would even consider an internship opportunity if something comes up before I finish in the fall.  I feel that moving the convocation to the fall would make it more meaningful since I would be done officially. I have worked almost 7 years at an engineering degree and have changed my major as well and went through a lot of challenges having ADHD and autism and also losing my dad in 2019 and being one of his caretakers during college. I do want to make it feel like a great moment in my life and I feel that celebrating prematurely just feels empty to me. What do you all think?"

Let's just say that its a pretty prestigious job for a very powerful politician and a very, VERY unique opportunity (that point is important for the rest). In terms of career, I have done 2 internships and have been an RA for the last two years. Here's my entire predicament:

I am a rising Senior in college and just finished my school year. At the end of the year, I was called by my friend who works for said politician asking me if I wanted to join the team. I jumped at the offer and was planning on not returning the next year on campus and doing school online (it is a traveling job). I was so excited. My first week, I realized the job is intense and high stakes (screwups would make our boss look really bad). Furthermore, there is no ""formal"" training--I was just kind of told to watch and learn which has been extremely difficult to say the least. For example, my coworker that i'm working with is expecting me to do bigger tasks, and it's only week two. I often find myself literally twiddling my thumbs standing around with no idea what to do for long periods of time. I also follow a coworker around everywhere to try and learn, but I feel he gets really annoyed about this because he is so focused on his job. When i'm standing around, everyone else knows what they're doing and I feel very out of place.  Furthermore, none of my coworkers really talk to me. It's a small team and I'm the only new guy and feel very on the outs--even by my friend who only really engages with the other people. When i'm asked about tasks related to the job, I am often dumbfounded and have no idea what the answer is. I am considering quitting, and going back to school in the fall. I could return to my RA position too (I did not tell my RA boss I was considering leaving, and i'm still technically set to return).  What do you all advise? I appreciate any and all advice!"

Hello,

I am having an internal conflict with what I should do in my career. I am 28 years old and have a bachelors in industrial engineering. Before accepting my current job (5 years ago) I spent one year in an engineering internship role. 

I would like to begin working in the field my degree is in; however, my current job pays too well to leave for an entry level position. From my recent job shopping I’ve seen an average of 55k for entry level positions. 

I work in the power industry where I make six figures a year, including great benefits that include healthcare paid for by my employer. My current role does not necessarily give the type of experience associated with my degree. I just feel the longer I sit on my degree with little to no experience… the more opportunities I will regret missing later in life. 

The pros with my current job is the pay, benefits and job security. 

The cons is long twelve hour shifts, being on call, and working a swing shift. (Day/Night)

What would you all do? 

Is the risk worth taking to leave for an entry level position elsewhere? 

Thank you for taking the time to read and or respond. 

Cheers"

I'm a computer science major with a comptia A+ and net+ certifications. I have been applying to entry level and internship positions in my area to get into the field and obtain experience. Most of my outreach emails have been fairly simple and cookie cutter-ish. Until I got this one. This guy obviously cares for his company and has a load of passion about it. I value that and think I could learn a great deal here. However, his verbiage and tone remind me of all the retail and kitchen jobs i used to take and these were always red flags that you are entering a pretty bad scenario. I know this is a completely different setting and scenario so I was hoping to get some insight from people here to make sure I don't mistakenly get myself into a bad situation or pass up what would actually be a great opportunity.

I have removed any identifying information regarding myself, the owner, and locations. For reference, he does speak about onsite field repairs ranging from within our city to over 120 miles away.

* Has a low teacher to student ratio
* Has a more theoretical syllabus for Computer Science courses. it doesn't seem to have a lot of practical courses in my area of work.

**ASU:**

* Major companies which offer Visas such as Amazon and Intel visit here. After talking to a few current student on LinkedIn, it seems internships aren't too hard to get.
* Has syllabus with respect to AI/ML/NLP (my area of work) which is more up to date. (But courses are pretty difficult to get)
* Has a LOT more students making things like housing and course selection more difficult.

I am a full stack developer with 3yrs of exp.

After my post graduation  I got selected in a company as intern for 5k/month stipend.  
Then after 3-4 months I got another offer then the founder insist me to stay with the same salary they offer as they like my work. 
And after 1yr the founder offered me 10% stake and basic salary if around  5 lpa.  
Right now I am getting 7lp with 10% stake. 

But they made an agreement between all stake holders  that they r not going to share any profits for next 3yrs.

Now I am confused what to do. 

Little background of company 
this company is very small startup LLP company as of now i m only  a lead developer.  

Company don't have any office. So  I am working from home from past 3yrs. 

So what I like about the company is the founder is very mature and realistic thinker. He has 20yrs of exp in IT. 
 So as a solo developer I don't have any barriers to learn and implement new things in  projects.  
And right now I am leading  3 projects  with some intern developers. 

But what I don't like about the company is the founder don't want to invest money on good experience candidates they just hire interns and get work done from  them. 
But IMO the project quality is getting decreased.  And lot of interns r getting and fired based upon there skills.
And here my responsibility is get work done from them , guide them and solve any critical problem  . 

Also I have little low confidence on some of there projects. 

currently what I have decided is continue till next year check the company's performance and decide to continue or not.

I am self taught developer currently I am learning and building some side projects In blockchain ethereum.  So if I switch next year then will switch mostly In blockchain. 

So what's your opinion guy's   should I stay in the same company or switch for some higher salary package?

Is it ok to stay 4yr in same company. But here i will get a co founder badge but no money now.  And not sure about the future."

For my internship im optimizing the warehouse management. We are now checking the amount of the materials, since the ERP-system they are using is not that amazing its very rough/impossible to find a good list of the last time materials were checked etc. 

So I decided to attempt making a list in Excel to keep it up to date as good as I can.

This is my plan for it: One sheet will be used to search the specific materials consisting of:

\- The material (I made a scrolldown list of all the materials so this should be ok)

\-Thickness

\-Last Time checked

All the materials and their thicknesses, last time checked have their own sheet.

The problem is with the last two. My goal is that when I select the Material --&gt; The thicknesses of this material show up, and when that is selected the ""Last time checked"" should also pop up.

I am using a different sheet for every material since it are around 40 different materials with each a few thicknessess.

&amp;#x200B;

So it should be like this

Select material Y  from the scrolldown list --&gt; In the thickness row all the options of material Y show up --&gt; After the thickness is selected the ""last time checked"" of material Y with this specific thickness shows up

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone knows if this is manageable or if i should look for a different approach?"

For example, interning at multiple companies will open more options for next stage in life--fulltime role. It can be taking programs and fellowships that will expand network, especially those ones that require you to be undergraduates. 

I am a senior at a regular state university who wished to knew earlier that getting internship is the most important thing when getting ready for the next stage of life. Here, my idea of the next stage of life was generic--just be able to crack into some big tech companies and get a good job.

Since I did not think of getting internships at all until the end of junior year, I missed out on many programs and fellowships that were often offered to first or second year undergraduates only. Those who took the advantage of these programs (and ambitious to find these opportunities) tend to get better new grad offers. If I were to go back in time, I would try my best to ""having internships"" that will only be possible while I was still an undergraduate. 

I was wondering many things, generally, ""what would you do the same or different way if you were to go back in time to advance in your career that would only be possible during early career?""
What are some things that are only available while I am still a junior developer that can make things easier later on? What are some things that cannot be done after this stage of career passes?
 
Here, I was thinking of career advancement (i.e. getting promoted fast) as the next stage of my career life as I dream to be a senior developer, but I still feel like the goal I set might not be right. The goal I set during college was getting a good GPA before realizing it should have been getting more internships and shooting for good companies, and I feel like I might be making the same mistakes here. What can be the real next stage of career life as a software engineer? 

TL;DR: 

What are some things that are only available while I am still a junior developer that can make things easier later in my career life? What are some things that cannot be done after this stage of career passes?

What are some next stages of career life as a software engineer besides getting promoted?"
ui16ve,7,2022-05-04,Which option should I choose,controlpy,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ui16ve/which_option_should_i_choose/,"I will soon finish my degree. And I got three strong offers:

1. SE-Sophia Antipolis = 33k (gross), they have good bonus like a lot of holidays, and they don't work 40 hours per week (less). Also some extra bonuses. They have already payed me a visit to their offices. 

2. Business Analyst Intern - Amazon = 1700 (net) at the start, the internship is around 6 months. But I don't really like Barcelona, it's a stressful city. And it's business analytics and I don't know if that is good for my SE career, but it's FAANG and I will work with Python and SQL. 

3. Backend developer in a local city: I am from a small city in Spain. The cost of living here is very cheap, around 200€ a shared flat. And I could even live with my parents and have 0 costs. They offered me 23k among other benefits but not as good as the one in point 1. The good thing that I would be with my family and my friends here. 

I don't know which to choose, because Amazon seems very good, but it is BA, so when it ends I don't know if it will open me more doors. Also it's an internship, you could not pass and don't get a job at Amazon at the end of the internship. The number 1 aslo seems very good benefits, but it's far from my home, but I think that I would learn a lot from a new cultural place and a company, I would work as a contractor, maybe that is not so good. They paid me a visit to their offices and that's very nice and I really appreciate that. And the third one I really explained in it's point. 

What would you do? I am a SE, I got my BS here in my city,  I have 0 YoE with some previous internships and a couple of personal projects. Can someone advice my which will be best?"

My primary goal after college is getting a job, and I'm an international applicant. These are the pros and cons I've listed for far for both the colleges.

##USC

###Pros
* Better alumni network, meaning wider opportunities while applying for job/internships
* California in general having most of the CS companies.
* Higher reputation of USC making job search easier.
* Better courses (although it doesn't concern me if I'm looking for a job in the end) 

###Cons
* HIGGGGH fees ($90k for 2 years)
* Can't finish the course in 1.5 years (unless you want to skip the summer internship)
* High cost of living
* Larger class size (which doesn't concern me if I'm not looking for research opportunities)

##Texas A&amp;M University

###Pros
* Cheaper fees
* Can finish the course in 1.5 years
* TA/RA would reduce the fees further.
* Smaller class size

###Cons
* Not well known as USC, still reputable 
* Far from tech companies (although I'm not sure how it matters for WFH days)
* Courseware didn't appeal to me compared to USC
* College Station is a smaller city compared to LA (I'm used to living in bigger cities)


What do you guys suggest? I could afford USC, but only just (probably have to blow off all 3 years of my savings, and taking a loan), and I could attend TAMU with just my savings (still gonna take a loan, so that I can invest my savings)."

okay so recently i've been seeing chem eng or industrial eng friends of mine look into cs graduate programs, and tbh it makes me worry (and kinda jealous too lol idk why am i possesive of my field or smth idk). everybody is a developer, an it guy/gal or something of that sort nowadays and for those that didn't study computer related majors like me, they get to it in graduate programs, which just, looks better than only having completed a bachelors. i mean, all these rivals will be having a master's in cs while i will be stuck with just a bachelors. but if i did the graduate program, double computer science in my education history? i would have an even better upper hand wouldn't i?

i like learning and i like my field, it's just that i never do well academically. something about the midterms and final exams system, plus listening to a class from a teacher you can't fast forward, i always get unnecessarily stressed out and mostly barely pass my classes. i like learning and advancing myself in my field but i don't like being a student. my main goal in life is to immigrate and get the eu citizenship and be a software developer or a data analyst in a country i like there, and up until now i was planning that with working abroad, but now i can't stop thinking about this.  if doing the graduate program would give me an upper hand at job finding or being in the job itself, i will consider it. btw i know i said my grades are bad but dw i could still apply to and find a place to get accepted.

any suggestions?"

I feel like it has ruined my whole life, I have switched majors 3 times and every time my anxiety was the reason. I'm currently in vet school and feel stuck because of it. Everyone is working at clinics and doing internships while I'm at home doing nothing. I volunteered at a clinic for 6 months (something I'm very proud about) but at the beginning it was the scariest thing ever. I was so self aware and paranoid all the time, I was clumsy and slow because of my anxiety. Everyone that worked there was nice, but they did mention how quiet I was and that made me feel even worse because I thought I was being more open. I stopped going there after the owner screamed at me in front of everyone because I didn't greet a client that walked in when everyone was busy (I used to get extremely anxious talking to clients). I just think that there is no way I'm going to be a good vet if I get anxious just from greeting clients. I feel like I should quit everything, I don't even study because that also gives me anxiety, I live in a country where the education is really bad so I don't learn anything in school. I've tried to study by myself but I see the huge amount of things I need to read and it makes me so anxious I can't even begin to do it.

I feel so helpless because I can't afford therapy and this is killing me. I have dealt with anxiety before but it's worse than ever now. I feel extremely guilty about not going to a clinic and not studying, my heart is constantly beating so fast, especially when I try to sleep or do something relaxing like watching a movie, I feel like I should be doing something productive but I just can't bring myself to do it because I am scared as hell. I want to go to a clinic but just thinking about going there the first day without knowing anyone makes me want to hide in my room forever. I wish I didn't have to face the real world and just stay alone in my room forever. This is ruining every aspect of my life, I don't drive, don't go to the gym, don't run errands, and don't even have a credit card because I'm scared to go out and do things on my own. I am so ashamed of myself, it's like I'm not an adult, I can't do anything on my own. 

I'm supposed to graduate next year and I'm freaking out about the fact that I'll have to look for a job. It makes me so scared just thinking about the fact that I'm going to have to work everyday and meet clients. I want to be able to live normally but I can't even if I try. I'm scared my life will be like this forever, I don't like living like this and I'm just so tired of everything."

uibvzy,1,2022-05-04,My sister is a horrible driver,GoldTwizzler28,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/uibvzy/my_sister_is_a_horrible_driver/,"Hi everyone! So this may be a long story but here it goes…
 
So I’m 27, working, but currently in the process of finding a new job after being home for 4 years to save money. My sister is turning 25 in August and she graduated 2 years ago. She is also home, working and saving money. 
 
I consider myself more responsible and more conscious of other people’s belongings. So I’ve never had my own car before, and I’ve driven my parent’s cars for the past 10 years. We have an old Lexus GX that is 17 years old, but still runs just fine. I used to drive the newest Lexus to and from work for the past 4 years. I have taken very good care of the cars while I am driving and have NEVER gotten it in an accident, dented, scratched, or just plain ran into something. I  just recently got a new car on Saturday so I don’t have to drive my parent’s car anymore (very exciting)! 
 
My sister still drives the older Lexus and she complains about anything that is even remotely wrong with the car. I get it, it’s an older vehicle and it’s gonna break down soon. However, it needs to be really taken care of in it’s older years. My sister has been in different accidents throughout her driving. She has ran into our garage, breaking the side mirror. When she broke the mirror, I was the one who had to bring it to college and look after it because I had an internship, which I needed the vehicle. I brought it home, everything was totally fine, except the mirror. I took good care of it, from my sister’s expense. She has also rear-ended someone and NEVER reported it to the police and NEVER contacted the person that she hit. She was almost in legal trouble and the person that she hit contacted my parents… my sister was in a heap of trouble.
 
Now a couple of days ago she was backing out of her spot in the driveway, very fast clearly not looking where she was going, and she ran over a bush that was planted by our front walkway, kept backing out so the bush was literally underneath the car, and it took out the front bumper while she was still backing out. The whole bumper was off of the vehicle and she kept backing out to the street. My mom was furious (understandably)! Thank GOD that I already left for work because my car would have been in the way of her backing out. She would have to pay for my new vehicle and the damage that she would have done.
 
Since my mom was so angry, she is making my sister drive a rental car and pay for the damage that was done to the bumper. However, once they came home, my mom and my sister are talking about how my parent’s would pay for the damage instead of my sister. I don’t know if that’s really true or not, but I am not speaking to anyone at this point.
 
I feel so angry and conflicted because I don’t have ANY sympathy for my sister for getting into so many accidents; tearing the bumper off, breaking the side mirror, while she is complaining that the car is so old! I am upset that I have taken good care of my parents’ vehicles for years, and she gets to actually do this to their vehicles. I hope she doesn’t get away with it because I can’t even fathom if my vehicle was there for her to back into…
 
Am I being too harsh? I don’t want to speak to my sister because it’s so unfair that I have taken care of the vehicles (that aren’t even in my name) and she doesn’t seem to care at all…
 
Sorry for the long post, but I needed to vent and rant for a little bit! Thanks for any input!"

The position was said to be in-person, and I have a designated office location in Jersey City, but the team I'm assigned to apparently works remotely. After talking with my manager, he said that his team is spread throughout the country, and he himself is located in New Jersey, but not in Jersey City. He mentioned that he could occasionally travel to the Jersey City location, but otherwise no one on my team is going to be in the office location that I am assigned to.

I'm pretty disappointed because I thought it was going to be a complete in person experience going by the earlier communication from the company. I really want to experience what it's like to live in Jersey City/New York Metro, but I'm not sure if it's worth it considering that I've now learned that the internship is basically virtual. 

Is it still worth moving to Jersey City for the experience? Or should I maybe contact my recruiter to see if I can be reassigned to a completely in person team?"

For those already in professional devlopment I wanted to ask the impact of a lower GPA(Think 3.0-3.2) specifically with getting internships? I am a sophmore CS major in the US, have an internship lined up for this summer, have a couple small projects and will continue to work on self learning and side projects with have had some troubles in classes like Calculus and some others(some realted to CS, but not significantly related to like etnerprise web dev which is where I'll look into)

&amp;#x200B;

For my Junior year I was planning on applying to many internships but one in particular. I won't say where, but its a decent szied Insurance company. Their internship page lists they prefer but don't require a 3.2 GPA. I also know several people in this company, or who used to work there, so i was thinking if I have something like a 3.1 GPA but other things like a previous internship and side projects, would that balance it out? Or can I tell them my expected GPA for that next semester(Fall 23) if I am most of the way through it? Or would another company work better?

There isn't much I can do to affect this semesters GPA, but was hoping for some insight. Thank you!"

My plan is to change the industry and I was wondering if anyone can provide tips on how to get a software engineering job without having much experience other than a 3 month internship. I definitely want the salary to be the same or better. I was thinking of changing my resume a bit. Also, doing udemy courses and uploading to GitHub.

It was hard asf. 

BUT

I learned lots since then, stressed, cried, almost choked on a peanut, and gained a lot of knowledge.

During that time I relied on this subreddit (and Google) for opinions on different tools, implementations, etc. There's so much information on here, you just gotta know where to look. It really helped because somewhere across the country someone else is going through the same crap (like how to secure, implement,  or test this etc). I really appreciated some of the resources you guys posted that are now my hidden gems. 

SO THANK YOU 🤣😆😁😁

Now I'm starting a full-time role soon with a freaking team of cybersecurity engineers and analysts.

And I can't wait to learn and grow professionally in my new team. 

So thanks yall.

TL;DR - some lil girl showing there appreciation for r/cybersecurity for the times it has saved my butt as a past intern to a full-time cybersecurity engineer. 

And yes. I'm still going to lurk."

uifwsn,23,2022-05-04,I hate corporate world.,puuttaa,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/uifwsn/i_hate_corporate_world/,"Im in the last year of a subcollege 2 years degree where we basically going to a company and do internship. Ive been in several ones and always switched after a couple months (for some reason I survived and my school dealt with this psyco behavior of mine pretty well) because I just felt either extreme anxious or depressed.

I just cannot focus at an office. Constant undirect interruptions by people doing random shit so my brain has to focus on it always break my flow state. What I most like of programming is the deep theoretical almost mystical mental state that sucks any chance of having negative thoughts out of you. I become what I do and I like that, because I dont have to deal with the abstract idea of my existence (and my many problems).

But I cannot find any company that suits me. All of them want to enslave me and force me to work at their miserable offices. I hate that. We have to save the planet guys and whats the point on losing 2 hours a day on transit? Fuck them all. They are just irrational fascist scum. Their failure at quantifiying my input on the job is not my problem.

What can I do to be happy? I know my fate is to be a programmer since I saw it on a shrooms experience (also had  very nice dream showing my future as a digital nomad) but the universe keeps mocking me. Where are those cool companies accepting the way you are so you can give your best? Its so tiring to see how the world wants to tie and standarize your soul, I want them to just die and leave me alone."

For Fall '22, I plan to undertake the following two 500 level courses:

**1. CS 512: Data Mining Principles**  
I have completed the UIUC Data Mining specialization on coursera ([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-mining](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-mining)) and hence thought of enrolling for CS 512

**2. CS 546: Adv Topics in NLP**

I also plan to undertake **CS 425: Distributed Systems** along with the above courses.

I would love to get advice on two things:  
1. Will undertaking this course work be feasible/manageable (I'll also be applying for summer internships)?  
2. How well does this coursework prepare me for Machine Learning Roles ?

But my family is planning on sending me to my extended families state for the summer to work, unless I get an internship this summer, and frankly I don't care if its going to be hard I need to get this internship. 

I took (1) college course each in languages like python , and java and understand the front end of web development (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) from self study. 

Would I have a better chance of landing an internship spending my time sending out as many applications as possible during these upcoming weeks, or is there a better way of going about this? (and again I'm aware that its hard for CC students to get an internship.)"

Do companies really care about communication skills?,developer-27,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uih1ta/how_can_an_introvert_find_internships_and_jobs_do/,"Hello everyone, I am an introvert computer science student who gets super nervous during the interviews. I also made few friends in college, I am just in “Hello” “How are you?” Situation with most people. I am good at talking about technical topics with people, but failing when it comes to life things. How this introvert student gets internship and jobs?"
uihlmq,0,2022-05-04,Whoever says international students can find internships is a big liar.,zero2000t,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uihlmq/whoever_says_international_students_can_find/,"Applied to around 700 from late September to early May, wasted two semesters for no reason. 

First 350 I applied as a sophomore then in Jan I realized I can graduate earlier so I started applying as junior. 
No previous intern experience. 
Side and school projects. 
Did 110 leetcodes, around 40 mediums. 
3.5+ gpa. 

I wouldn’t lie and say I didn’t get OAs. I got some, but most were too hard. I am either super unlucky or stupid. 

Two final interviews. Around 5 recorded interviews. From 10-15 OAs.


Edit: I might delete this post soon as I do not want to discourage fellow cs folks. But can someone give me some feedback or anything that might help?

I think my mistake was not leetcodijg earlier as I wasn’t comfortable with leetcode easies until late October."
uihnhv,7,2022-05-04,"What is a reasonable salary to expect after college, and is grad school worth it?",_ThisIsABadName_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uihnhv/what_is_a_reasonable_salary_to_expect_after/,"Right now, I am majoring in CS at Rutgers. I plan on doing an internship next summer. I have a lot of programming experience from just coding for fun in middle and high school. During this semester, I noticed I seemed to have way less difficulty completing the Data Structures assignments than my peers. However, I struggled quite a bit in linear algebra. I have a few decent projects for my portfolio, but I really wanna expand my portfolio this summer.

What can I expect to be earning after I graduate? Would it be worth pursuing grad school and getting a master's or Ph.D.? What is the difference in salary between someone with a bachelor's degree and someone with a master's degree? Is it reasonable to find a 100k+ job after graduating in the NYC area, or would I be better off moving to the bay area? What can I expect to make after 5 years?

Also unrelated, but does anyone have good recommendations for projects for my portfolio. Right now, the biggest thing is my website I coded from scratch using python. I was thinking writing a REST API would also be a good project. Also, maybe developing an app?"

Im an incoming freshman and have heard horrible things about how hard computer science is but how hard is it really? It seems like an incredibly interesting career with an amazing work-life balance compared to investment banking or consulting and is such a growing field. Cornell’s comp sci program is also ranked really high. What’s the difference between comp sci at the engineering school vs A&amp;S? If anyone has advice or opinions on the workload or study time, please drop it here. How are internship opportunities? Thank you and much appreciated!"

I took college very slow and decided what I wanted to do first. Sometimes I would only take 4 credits at a time. It was nice. I had to switch schools. 

THE PROCESS OF APPLYING, WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING, STRESSFUL ESSAYS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO DETERMINE MY FUTURE I HAVE NO MOTIVATION TO WRITE WHATSOEVER WHICH IN NO WAY COULD DEFINE ME/ENCOMPASS ME, the aid I’m worried about, how do I apply for fafsa, when do I send transcripts, the endless little things you forget in the process of a year of waiting and worrying THAT FUCKED UP MY BODY.

I’m only in one community college class right now and because of the stressful process of not knowing where im going to school and not even being able to enjoy what looks like a year off but wasn’t and was just wasted time I CAN BARELY DO THE CLASS. I struggled every single time we had class to decide I would go and get there past the 3rd class. I would cry with stress. THE APPLICATION PROCESS MADE ME FEEL LIKE I COULD ALWAYS BE FORGETTING SOMETHING WHAT DID I NOT DO WHAT WAS THAT LITTLE THING I MISSED ABOUT -

AM I SUPPOSED TO GET RESEARCH TO MAKE ME LOOK “better” 
CAREER TEST HOW DO U KNOW WHAT UR MAJORING IN IS THE RIGHT THING
ACTIVATE YOUR SCHOOL ID
HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR ALL THIS SHIT YOU DONT EVEN WANT TO DO AND YOU ARE FORCED TO DO IN ORDER TO NOT SUFFER IN A TERRIBLE RUN OF THE MILL JOB AND RISK JOBLESSNESS
WHEN DO YOU SEND AP TESTS
OH MAKE A WHOLE ACCOUNT FOR EACH COLLEGE FUCKING PORTAL
HOW DO I BUTTER UP A RESUME I SHOULD HAVE INTERNSHIPS SHOULD HAVE APPLIED FOR SCHOOLARSHIPS 
TRANSPORTATION COSTS GAS DO I TAKE THE BUS BUS ROUTES FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK 
I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH FINANCIAL AID I WILL GET
WHAT IF I WAITED ALL THIS TIME AND I CANT FIND A COLLEGE THAT I CAN GRADUATE FROM WITHOUT DEBT CAUSE IM NOT DOING THAT SILLY ASS COLLEGE PUTS YOU INTO DEBT SHIT NO FUCKING WAY IM ALREADY PUTTING MY YOUTH ON THE ALTER TO BURN , BUT NOT MY MONEY TOO 

The process I used to get my period on day 35 every cycle. I went on a cruise and had no worries. I knew I couldn’t use internet. Well, I got my period extremely early. It was the first time my stress didnt overwhelm me make me feel my boundaries were broken by stress from school, it was the first time I didn’t feel like I couldn’t take the stress anymore. 

I vowed to only stress about something after I start a timer for 1 hour and start working on a particular problem. I do not want constant stress anymore.

Fuck college."

uiit6h,67,2022-05-04,User got her town cut off from free tech support for the foreseeable future,Far-Artist812,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/uiit6h/user_got_her_town_cut_off_from_free_tech_support/,"Hello all,

To start I am a technologist who supports 4 different schools and a municipality. The way our district is setup we had a deal that we would support the town for free as the projects we got to do were fun and provide good learning opportunities for the technology staff, but technically we are only contracted to support the school district. We used to be responsible for supporting multiple towns as well, but the difference of opinions on how to run things between the technical director and town administration caused the town to hire a msp company instead of using the districts technology team. They are terrible at what they do and more clueless than my interns...

With that out of the way we get to the story. Today was about as normal as any other day. My boss Jack and I have been working on a migration from a server 2008 box to a server 2019 hyper converged cloud system for the town. We had recently finished migrating everything but the file server and share drives with no issues what so ever besides a few late nights where the staff weren't affected in any way. 

Yesterday night Jack decided he would start the file migration and finish up this project once and for all. He had sent out an email stating what was gonna happen and then went to go start the transfer. He was trying to remote into the old DC and accidentally ended up connecting to a computer that was used by some folks from the same msp mentioned above as they are responsible for the towns av department and equipment for town meetings and the likes.

Unfortunately the user that he connected to was known for causing us issues and would always try to blame us whenever they could if something goes wrong. I think that they started this harassment campaign simply to make the work environment so toxic we would stop working there and they could maybe take over and get paid more. Unfortunately the town doesn't have the capital allocated for that as they haven't paid for our services in decades but I don't think they knew that.

Anyways after Jack remoted into the machine he immediately disconnected from it as it was a mistake. The aforementioned user decided to go on a 5 paragraph rant through email about how we do not have a contract with the town and am therefore outsiders and that Jacks's connection to her machine was a very big issue as there was ""sensitive data"" on there. Keep in mind Jack created this network from the ground up, even getting the required grants to make it happen. He has always had access to everything for years prior with no issues until now. She tried to demand a system where the user would have to allow remote access to the target pc in order to remote in and provide them with free tech support. 
This was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. As it was explained to me from a very heated Jack. He then answered her concerns by letting the town know that they would no longer be supported by our team and that they can handle the rest of the migration themselves. 

I don't think they know what the real ramifications of this move are but I am willing to bet that this town will fall apart within a month. Unfortunately as this is so recent there is no satisfaction for us yet so I'm going to be updating this post after I see the fallout from this. Thanks for reading! 

TL;DR: My boss finally got fed up with the problem users at our municipality and dropped them from support in the middle of a server migration. The town will probably fall apart because of this."

I am currently a Sophomore @ ucla who switched into CS this year.

I really want to do the small company because of the higher pay &amp; better location but I am really nervous about working at a smaller company because the program is less structured / more independent. 

**Thermo Fisher: Data Science Intern**

* Huge company (64k employees) that has a structured program - can tell by just the resources they provide for the interns 
* Data Science
* Low pay \~22/hour (5K relocation stipend)
* Carlsbad, CA really old area in San Diego that has really expensive rent (no connection there)

**Small CS Company in LA: SWE/Data Engineering Intern**

* 400 employees &amp; would be working as a SWE intern under the R&amp;D department
* Higher pay $28/hour
* Amazing office space in LA with good company culture 
* Would stay at my apartment in LA so would have all my friends and such
* Was told that the work I would do would be largely independent because they are such a small company 

I am really nervous about joining the latter company because I felt like throughout my education at UCLA, I have been learning a lot of theory and don't really have too many skills marketable to the industry, and am worried that I will be thrown into doing some niche task without any guidance at the company. On the latter hand, Thermo Fisher would give me a better learning experience but I feel like I'll be miserable in SD and the pay is worse. 

What do you all recommend I probably sound so stupid rn.

uipo3p,23,2022-05-05,From making $10/hr at College Helpdesk to Potentially making $90k+ NOC in 7 months (long read.),Packet_Baser,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/uipo3p/from_making_10hr_at_college_helpdesk_to/,"Just wanted to share my experience (and hopefully get some advice)

My background: Been in IT since around Nov. AA degree, currently pursing an AS degree in networking. CCNA.

I met someone on twitch of all places, and we became really good friends and I got him into PC gaming. Long story short, he told me he was going to school for computer programming. At that time, I didn't really know too many people working in the computer field. From the outside looking in, it seemed impossible to get in. I was always discouraged by my family and friends from joining.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this dude, and he graduated and landed a Job. That inspired me to go back to school and give myself a chance in my 30s. My professor passed my shoddy resume to the IT manager and I got a job at the school helpdesk. Federal work study. Paid peanuts, but I was excited that I got an IT job and I was getting experience.

 I started studying for the CCNA and passed it in late last year. Posting questions Online, I managed to find a mentor, a network engineer who was gracious enough and willing to help me find my path and answered any questions I had. After passing the CCNA, I started looking for jobs. I looked into resume writers but I didn't have the money for it. So I used a template, I found on youtube by Kevtech IT support. I started getting phone calls, but nothing promising, more recruiters calling me to say I'm not experienced enough, would I consider a help desk position.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to one recruiter and it was for a job in the range of 85k a year. It required bachelor's, multiple years of network experience, and a CCNA.  They replied and told me my interview was being set up. I called back and I suspect but don't know for sure that my recruiter got covid. I never got an update, so I called the office and they told me the recruiter is out, we don't know when he's coming back he'd like to but he's not able right now but at this time, the position has been closed. I was pretty bummed out about that. Anyway, the person on the phone told me not to be discouraged, apply anytime I see the job posted, it might look similar but its different Job IDs and they are always looking for contractors because they convert them into full time pretty quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I must have applied to this one particular place 10 or so times. Each time I would get a call from the recruiter, they would process my application and send it to the manager, but ultimately, when I followed up, I was rejected. Until the last time, I was informed I was on a short list of candidates. I did the first interview, it was well and I was supposed to schedule for a second interview. The recruiter was unresponsive. I couldn't get in touch with the recruiter. I followed up for almost a month straight. Once a week. Nothing. Finally, I followed up again. The reason I wasn't getting replies because the recruiter handling my application was no longer part of the company and the person that called me, called me back because he saw my recent follow up.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up getting the offer for $90k+! I've never made over 25k in my life. I was very emotional when I got the call.  I don't have experience, it's a NOC position and not going to lie, I'm nervous about taking it. I don't have experience outside of labbing at home. I did not lie about my background, but I can't help to think for that much money, I'll be expected to perform at a certain level. They told me they have detailed training program, but I'm still nervous. 

 During the course of interviewing for Company A, I received an internship offer (and signed it) from what I'll call company B . I feel more comfortable about company B and it seem like the people at that company B seem more happy working than Company A, so I'm kinda of torn between the two. Both have great reviews by employees and former employees.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: I worked help desk for for seven 7months and received a offer. I'm kinda torn on taking it."

I am a computer science junior with about 4 quarters left to graduate. I have come to the choice that I will finish my major despite how much I loathe the work and know nothing of coding outside the classroom.

However, I just need advice. I have no internships or projects on me, and lack any good references from my university's professors. I'm wondering, would finding a job be difficult in my field? For years, I've been grinding at this major (maths especially), and I never liked the field.

Unfortunately, I came to the decision of this field because it simply pays the best (and I really do not want to enter the medical field or do physics). I think it's a bit too late to change majors (in all honesty, my parents wouldn't want me to major in anything else that's not STEM related), so I'm trying to look ahead.

I am at a tier 1 university and still get thoughts of dropping out because of how lonely and depressing this major can be.

Would changing majors or leaving for a while and working be a good choice? I'm a giant introvert and I feel that I've always severely lacked on social skills since childhood."

I don't get why I became like this, is it because the internship is unpaid ? Or because I think I can do the whole work from my house in the last 2 weeks ?

I become a junior in August. My degree program is named Programming and Data Science, and hence my courses till now have been mostly focused more on practical programming, statistics, and ML, and no programming theory, systems design, or computer architecture, which are electives that can be taken in junior or senior year. I have done about \`\`\~50 LC (20 Easy, 20 Medium, 10 Hard). Have a few basic personal projects on my resume (1 Web Dev, 2 ML).

As a sophomore, I applied to \~500 internships in US/Canada/Europe, in most of big tech, quite a few startups, research programs, frankly everything I found and was eligible for, sometimes even if I wasn't really. I only got around \~20 OAs (some had one OA for multiple positions, so \~30 positions), and eventually just got a single final interview (Amazon), which I wasn't selected for.

In my own country, I fared slightly better. Applied for \~150 openings. Did about \~20 OAs. Got to around \~10 final interviews, with IBM, Uber, and several startups. I eventually settled with a 2-month internship at a small non-tech startup to work on their website. It's not a lot of work honestly - their current website is built with Shopify and I have to retain the Shopify CRM. Pays pennies in comparison to US, but just about a third of what Amazon pays in my country. Alongside I have an unpaid WFH 2-month research internship with a professor from the University of Manchester (which can potentially lead to a publication). I will study graduate-level real analysis, PDE, and deep learning, learn PyTorch and work on original research.

With that said, I want to start preparing for 2023 internships as soon as I am done with these internships in August. I know that I should do more LC, practice DSA, mock interviews. All I'm saying is, with these internships on my profile, what else should I aim to do and add to my profile to improve my chances? Is LeetCode enough? I have passed all test cases in OAs and still not gotten interviews. I think it was because of my resume. Will this improve?"

A little introduction: I'm an American who went to France for medical school. Here, I've had the opportunity to take masters classes in medical research in parallel with my med school studies. Next, year, to obtain my Masters degree, I have to do a gap year from my medical studies to pursue a year of research (1st semester of studies in France, 2nd semester internship in laboratory anywhere). For numerous reasons, I would like to do this internship in an American laboratory. I've reached out to some professors on this matter and they have given me some information about their contacts (laboratory research directors).

I'll be studying scleroderma and have quite an interesting choice between going to a lab in Stanford or Yale. The problem is that I'm having a hard time deciding.

For me, Stanford seems more prestigious, especially in STEM fields such as medicine. I was told that the lab director here is more rigid and less personal. The lab here is a powerhouse and has churned out a lot of studies in 2022 alone. From what I see, housing is slightly more expensive here (100-300$ on average) than in Yale, even though both seem very high in this regard.

On the other hand, Yale is still very prestigious. I was told that the contact at this location has a more personal approach in general (as well as in their relationship with patients) and seems more willing to provide guidance.

My goal, of course, is to be able to develop as much as I can personally throughout this amazing experience, both as a person and my future career.

I was hoping that some of you would have some personal input from your experiences in either one of these amazing schools.

[UK specific],HasuTeras,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uiy65v/are_there_any_good_ways_to_get_professional/,"History: I’m an economist by background, both educational and professional. I’ve worked in the UK as an economic analyst for the past 4 years (mainly macro and international trade), and then taken a career break to go back to get a postgraduate. I’ve been teaching myself R and Python over the past year while studying, and really, really enjoyed it. Econometrics and data science are kind of adjacent, with the former more focused on causal inference and quantification of effects - and I guess some overlap in terms of objectives with time series and forecasting methods - and its been really interested to compare and contrast the skillsets while learning. Ultimately, I think applied economics/econometrics will adopt more and more of data science approaches over time - and it would be good to get ahead of the curve on that. 

The thing is, much like anything else, I feel like there’s only so far that self-study / projects / books / Datacamp / Udemy can get you. 

In my experience, economists can be pretty wedded to their specific methods and tools (see: predominance of STATA in economics) and resistant to change - which is something I’ve encountered quite a few times in my career. It can be a pretty tough sell to economists to buy-in to using something new and unknown, which means there are few avenues to professionally develop those skills while working.

Tl;dr: I guess my ultimate question, are there any avenues (ideally within the UK) to get professional working experience in data science without considering a full field transition over into another field? Things like an internship / professional work shadowing? / professional fellowships etc?"

As a freshman I knew my chances were slim but I've decided to try out and see how interviews look like (should I get any). Unexpectedly, after three rounds of interviews I got an offer in a small  tech startup.

The main reason for taking it would be experience and putting it on CV to get into a big tech internship in the future.

The main opposites, however, are:

- Lost summer, of which there probably won't be many in the future 

- It will cut into the second year, making me fail some courses and taking a way my (quite big) chance of becoming a TA

- I can do a masters for free (eu) so I have a lot of time before I finish university if I decide to do it

- The internship is in Amsterdam, meaning I'll probably end up net negative fiscally 

My parents think I shouldn't take it, since in second year I will hopefully have better offers and TA money is better than internship money.

I don't know, since I like the idea of FIRE and this could be the only way for me to get to big tech at entry level. 

What would you do in my position?
Any feedback appreciated!"

I am currently not in college as I was unable to afford finishing my degree and I am pretty desperately looking for an internship or junior developer position to get my foot in the door and at least get some more experience. I did work as a solutions engineer intern for 6 months as well as worked on some personal projects but unfortunately I don't believe that has been enough. Most of my experience has been with .NET and Angular Typescript.

I was just wanting to know where might be the best place to look or reach out to with my level of experience? I've tried LinkedIn for months with no luck and Dice as well. I would be open to trying a recruiter but I've been told they can't really help people with my level of experience.

I feel like my colleagues are starting to get annoyed at my shyness and that they want to get rid of me because everyone else on the team is super extroverted and confident.

The thing is I'm on a contract position so I don't think they will renew the contract which is a lot easier for them compared to if I had a full time contract because then they would have to outright fire me.

I had one internship and a contract position before and I'm pretty sure that my SA was a big part of the reason my contract didn't get renewed both times. Anyone here been fired for having SA?"

* Make a good resume and ensure it can pass ATS

* Apply to jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed

* Practice Leetcode

* Work on personal projects to demonstrate your coding skills

It added an additional 12 credits to the degree plan but that is no issue. I still have 73 credits before I earn my degree. I switched because I took some basic coding classes and loved it. I've been learning on my own on top of what is being taught on more in depth coding practices and techniques. My current plan is to get my degree and land a job as either a full stack or front end developer. 

Anyways, my question is what can I be doing now to help me get a career after college? I have read that this is a tough market to enter out of college with no previous relevant work experience. When and where should I apply for internships? I just started this degree (Have a bachelor's in business admin so some transfer credits) so I think it is to early to apply for internships now but I may be wrong? I've read creating a portfolio (that shows useful programs and skill sets) is important for when I eventually look for employment in the field.

uj652k,11,2022-05-05,"If you're EE and struggling to find internships, consider a temporary move to Phoenix for the summer. (also, hope for those with a criminal history)",generix420,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/uj652k/if_youre_ee_and_struggling_to_find_internships/,"I'm a senior (halfway through) EE student at Arizona State, 2.9 GPA, no school extracurriculars except for a prototyping/entrepreneurial contest I won, I am actively involved in a couple of church ministries that I have on my resume and I work full time. This is also my second career and bachelor's degree (former high school physics teacher). 

I also have a criminal record, a felony burglary from 2018 (long story that involves an ex) that was fully dismissed, but I can never get expunged, and a DUI conviction from 2019, the arrest report shows a drug paraphernalia charge but this was plead down to only DUI. I've since been saved by Jesus and live my life to serve Him and am almost 3 years fully sober (in about 2 weeks!). 

It was hard for me to find information on how difficult it would be to get an EE internship with a record  (not to mention a subpar GPA) so hopefully for those searching for similar help  will find this post and can rest in the fact that it's not as bad as you think it is. 

I hate filling out job apps, and maybe should have done more but here are some of my numbers:

* Applications: 9- Never heard back from 3 of them
* Interviews: 6- 
   * I slept through one of my scheduled interviews with a small startup because I had a migraine (yay Phoenix allergy season) and well, they never got back to me on rescheduling that but they advertised only $15 per hour which I wasn't keen on. 
   * Another one was for a co-op that I couldn't take because I already work full-time and wouldn't have been able to do work, school, and a co-op
* Offers: 4  

Two of my offers were with government Defense Contractors, who have pretty strict background check requirements. One of them I did not pass. The other one I passed after 3.5 months of waiting but in that time (up until a week ago) I had gotten nervous and took more interviews in case I didn't pass and ended up accepting an offer with a semiconductor company. The government contractor's offers paid $24 and $23/ hour and the semiconductor company I ended up accepting with will pay me $27. 

Point of this is, Phoenix is a hotspot for EE firms (Intel, TSMC, General Dynamics, Boeing, Microchip, NXP semiconductors, On Semiconductor, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Freeport Mcmoran, Honeywell, Nikola motors, and literally so many more) Yeah summer sucks here, but an internship is necessary and if you're panicking about finding one, I get emails every day about still-open positions. 

Second point is, if you have a criminal history, make sure you've done something in your life that demonstrates you're changed. I went to rehab, work in ministries at my church, mentor men at halfway houses, but if you don't have anything to show that your past is just that, then find something up that alley. Don't tell the interviewers, just disclose it on your questionnaire. If I was able to pass a check for a company that literally makes missiles and fighter jets with my background, you'll probably be fine unless you have automatic disqualifiers. 

Feel free to ask me about any of the above"

uj6v04,0,2022-05-05,Financial Options for School Abroad with Existing Student Loans,baktix,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/uj6v04/financial_options_for_school_abroad_with_existing/,"Hey everybody!

I received offers for some master's programs abroad. Not being able to defer the start date, I would have to start this September. I was hoping to pay off my current student loans from my recently-finished undergrad in their entirety before spending more on graduate school, but unfortunately, my job won't get me all the way there before I'd have to leave; by my rough calculations, I'll have net just a bit more than the current value of my student loans by the end of August. My number 1 choice at the moment is also in Switzerland, and looking at figures about the cost of living there is making me dizzy.

Given this situation, would it be better for me to pay off my existing student loans aggressively, or should I instead just make the minimum payments so I can keep my savings healthy and gain interest on them (I could also put them towards a safe investment like a GIC, if that makes sense)? I should add that my loan consists entirely of the Canada-portion of OSAP loans, so I have 0% interest until March 2023, due to federal COVID relief measures. I would also likely apply for OSAP again (since I get grants), which would send me back into non-repayment until I'm done the program.

A downside I can think of regarding the former option is that it won't leave me with very much money to start school with. This is important because I need to provide proof of a minimum amount in savings in order to get the student visa. Additionally, not having a safety net in a foreign country is kind of scary to think about. Conversely, a downside of the latter is that it feels very stressful to start acquiring new debt without even having paid off my original debt (I'll admit this is likely more emotional than logical, but it's very hard to ignore).

Another aspect I should mention: it would be a shame to go abroad for school and not be able to do anything because I'm stressing about saving every penny. Even this summer, I have friends that are planning things and it'd be a shame to have to say no to all of them because I need to save up. I was thinking, since I invariably have to take out some form of money for my master's, that I'd open up a student line of credit ([the TD one](https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/products/borrowing/lines-of-credit/student-line-of-credit/) looks good — thoughts?) and keep some of my savings to myself as opposed to putting them all towards paying for student loans/school. Does anybody think this is a terrible idea? Are there better options than a student line of credit? Related to this, am I just going to have to deal with the fact that I'm going to lose some additional money here and there converting between currencies? Can I even withdraw a portion of the balance on a line of credit and convert it like I would with my own money?

Finally, I've named a few possible options, but are there any I missed? Any that might be an even better course of action for paying off my debts and preparing myself financially for school?

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**, if y'all don't want to go sifting through the entire thing again for my individual questions:

* Should I pay off my existing loans aggressively or focus instead on saving?
* If the latter, what are the best vehicles for safe investment?
* Is a student line of credit the best way to fund the portion of my education I can't cover?
* Is it a bad idea to lean more on a LoC/loan to pay for my schooling so that I have some money left over to do fun things?
* Can I withdraw from a LoC to immediately convert the money to a foreign currency and is there no way I can escape conversion fees?
* Are there other, better options I haven't considered for paying for my master's?

&amp;#x200B;

**Note**: I should also add that I'm very lucky to be a graduate in a lucrative field and had little trouble finding a good job, so logically I shouldn't be afraid of not being able to pay off my loans. I think I'm just quite stressed by the psychological aspect of feeling like I can't spend any of the money I'm saving up, and that I'm making a decision to purposely put myself into even more debt before having cleared my old one. But, as I mentioned, said debt will likely *not* be unmanageable for me. Even if it were to be, I'm also privileged in that I would have a safety net there to catch me, in the form of family. I guess part of what I want is just reassurance that I'm not doing something incredibly stupid and that things will be alright. This is the first time in my life I'm accruing debts (the student loans didn't count up until recently because I was in non-repayment), and not being entirely self-sufficient as I have been since after my first internship is a bit scary.

uj6vwr,7,2022-05-05,Question - hiring manager for an internship wants me to complete a workbook in excel to demonstrate my skills - is this a scam?,Brass4673,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/uj6vwr/question_hiring_manager_for_an_internship_wants/,"Hello! So I am a rising junior at a target university in the US. I recently applied for a financial internship at a digital experience company. I’m already super concerned about employment scams since I know that they specifically target college students. So far this position has seemed mostly legit. 

I got an email today from them asking me to complete an excel workbook and send it back to demonstrate my skills. I heard somewhere that jobs that do this are usually scams and are just trying to get me to do unpaid work. I don’t mind doing the work and would gladly show an interviewer my skills with excel, but I’d rather know early in the interviewing process if this position is a scam. I have not yet interviewed with the company, only applied. Another thing that raised my suspicions was that the email asked me to send it back by tomorrow at 9am (I got this email at around 1:30pm today). The date listed to send it back was also wrong. Again, I would gladly do the work, I just don’t want to walk into a scam or miss an opportunity. Does anyone have any advice? Is this enough information?"

uj8o9r,14,2022-05-05,Work-Obessed America Sucks,skinntywastaken,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/uj8o9r/workobessed_america_sucks/,"So I had an interview for an internship. It was unpaid and for a super tiny startup. Not to sound snobby, but I'm just not at that point in my career anymore where I should settle for a job like that. I still did the interview, so I could get practice for other jobs that I care about. 

The lady asks me why I chose the company in specific. And I panicked. Bc I wasn't planning on taking the interview anyways, I hadn't really done much research on it and hadn't even come up with bs answers to questions like that. I ended up saying I just want to be part of the industry in general. And this lady got super offended and started to lecture me on how that was an awful answer. Kind of like a bad teacher who call out your mistakes in front of the whole class. yes, my answer was bad, but she did not have to be so rude about it. 

Anyways, this all got me thinking about how for every company I apply to, I have to come up with some BS connections to the company and why i want to work there. Basically, just create some grand lie about why I want to work there and how working there is my ""dream"", other than the fact we all need a paycheck to survive. And I just find it so annoying. Like can we just be honest??? Why is our culture so work obsessed!? Obv we all should be passionate about our line of work or whatever, but do we really need to play pretend for every tiny ass company we apply too??"
uj98oq,9,2022-05-05,Am I in the wrong?,Fickle-Application30,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/uj98oq/am_i_in_the_wrong/,"So here’s the story. I was a paralegal, working for 2 lawyers in the same building. Both lawyers work very closely together, but have separate firms. I was miserable in this job. I got paid near minimum wage and was given no benefits despite being full time. I realized I was done and gave both my bosses 6 weeks notice. During this 6 weeks, I accepted a position as an insurance agent for a local insurance company. All was well. 

Both my bosses interviewed many qualified candidates for the position, many of them that could start before I was even set to leave. Boss #2 insisted though that his friend, whom was a paralegal at another firm and looking for another job, was the one worthy of the position. The caveat though, is that she is currently pregnant and due in July. This means she won’t be able to start work until October. He decided that he would convince the college student that interned for him last summer to be in my position temporarily until my replacement can start. The problem? This student ends school may 11, and has to return in august. This means they will have no paralegal for nearly 3 months after he starts college again. Does this make any sense? Not to me. There were plenty of great candidates (that they liked!) who were able to start asap. 

A week before I was set to leave, boss #1 asks if I can work part time after may 1st, until may 11, before the college intern can start. I hesitantly say yes. 

Starting may 1st, I begin my property and casualty exam course that I’m required to take and pass before my start date at my new position on June 9. The course and studying is a lot, and I realize that it’s simply too much for me to be working part time for boss #1. I realize that if I dedicate part time to working there (and driving an hour and a half to his office each day) that I will most likely fail the exam and have to wait another month to start my insurance position. This is something I simply can’t afford to do. 

I expressed this to my boss and said that I wasn’t able to keep up with my studies being there part time, and I took on too much than I could handle. He understood and asked that I finish all my work for the week and remain available for an emergency should it occur. I agreed and made sure everything was in order and work was complete before I left.  

The next day I receive a very angry text from boss #2 saying that I “need to reconsider my course of action with boss #1” and that “I owe my employer if I made the commitment” and that “it doesn’t matter what the circumstances are, I should be there” I explained that I completed all the work for the week so boss #1 was covered, and will remain available in an emergency. I also will be available to train the college intern. However, boss #2 didn’t care and continued to send me angry texts throughout the day about how horrible my decision was. He was very much implying that I’ve completely burned by bridge with the both of them. 

The thing is, I agree- to an extent. But this is incredibly situational. I have to pass a test (a very hard one, with only 3 weeks to study the material) and if I fail I will be out of a job for another month.  This is something I simply can’t afford to do. Further, if absence of a paralegal was so detrimental, why would they hire the candidate that would entail not having a paralegal for 3 months? Clearly I’m not necessary for the function of their business. I also am not completely leaving boss #1 to dry- I agreed to be available on an as needed basis. 

My question is - am I in the wrong? I have been having nightmares about these scathing texts from boss #2 (who isn’t even involved in this situation; it’s between me and boss #1). I can’t help but feel like an awful person who’s seriously fucked up. I feel horrible about it- but can’t really do anything about it since I can’t afford to go back and lose 6 hours of studying time per day. So I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. All outside input is very appreciated."

Currently I'm not sure what the best option would be. My CC offers multiple Computing/IT AAS. The specific one that caught my eye was 
 https://catalog.csn.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=6&amp;poid=2749

Mainly due to an internship requirement, that I thought would be beneficial.

However, what I didn't realize till now was not all/if any credits can be transferred to a 4 year college. That being the case I'm struggling to determine if the AAS is worth it. When there's the option of getting an AS of science and then transferring that to a bachelor's in computer science. I mainly want to be in networking, I have little interest in coding, and building applications. However I know a bachelor's is more appealing to some companies.

If anyone has any insight, or has been in a similar situation. I'd appreciate any advice you can give.

I'm really confused on the best situation here, and I would prefer to not regret my decision in the coming years."

uja0rs,1,2022-05-05,Full job opportunity vs an internship I already accepted. What to do?,Ekozera76,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/uja0rs/full_job_opportunity_vs_an_internship_i_already/,"I have a bit of a messy situation on which I'd appreciate your opinions.

I recently finished my master's degree. Wanting further specialization, I applied for a second master's degree in a pretty good program and got accepted (It would cost me next to nothing). I also got a really good internship in a very large institution. I accepted and everything just stayed like that for a few weeks.

Fast forward to the present; one of the jobs I applied to contacted me for an interview. The job would be a full-time and permanent position that would pay pretty well with a very attractive future salary as I gain experience (6 figures). It's a really good job and probably the job in which I was the most interested when I applied. It is also in a very large firm that would be really good for my career.

On one hand, the full-time job is really great and the idea of passing beside it really annoys me. On the other hand, the internship is in a very very large institution and one of the people on the team was a professor of mine. Not particularly close with him, but he knows me and I know him. I don't think he had any influence on me being hired, but I couldn't swear it beyond all reasonable doubts.

My family and friends aren't much help on this subject.

So what do you think about my situation?"

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which was now streaking towards the surface of a planet after a random FTL jump as he watched helplessly from an escape pod. *Well. Here's to hoping this pod can survive atmospheric reentry,* he thought to himself. Ryan barrelled towards the planet, planning to… hell if he knew what he was planning. The pod's coordinates were scrambled, so he knew he wasn't leaving until *that* got fixed. The pirate ship that had put them *in* this predicament looked to be caught in the gravity well, too, its mashed-to-shit thrusters incapable of giving it significant lift. *Hah! Eat that, you pirate fucks!* he cheered. Before remembering Gexie was in there. *Oh shit.*


_


Felix had a ""lead,"" and a lead. Right now, he was investigating the ""lead,"" Agent Riddick, who was living only two hours away from Agent Bowler, a man who *just so happened* to have the exact same appearance and work the exact same profession. He idly wondered why the EEI was being so sloppy. The fact he even knew who he was onto in the first place showed that they either hadn't bothered or hadn't been able to classify and restrict the files of Agent Bowler in time before he got ahold of them. That meant that this entire operation was rushed. 


Now… what purpose did the EEI have creating a band of highly-trained mercenary privateers? He leaned on his cane, pondering the question. They wanted these people under their control without having liability for their actions, and they *needed* these people, fast. Things with the wexiks were shaky enough as it was *without* them knowing that one of the biggest human space organizations was sponsoring pirates. 


Oh. Speaking of. A newslink revolving around the case popped up in a notification on his phone. Felix opened up the article. He sighed as he read the headline. *Human Pirates Board Alien Ship, Ship Disappears.* Oh, Christ. What the hell did the EEI just do?


_


So Gexie was havin' a great day. Gettin' boarded. Gettin' dragged out of a vent. Gettin' held captive. Gettin' motherfuckin' kidnapped. And last, but not least, gettin' held prisoner on a crashing fuckin' spaceship by his kidnappers after they all warped to a middle-of-fuckin'-nowhere planet, if the jarbled coordinates were anything to go by. Today was jus' fuckin' fantastical. He watched the flames lick at the ship's hull, the atmosphere forcefield he had grown so accustomed to on every ship apparently not on this one in particular. 


Now that he thought about it, this ship didn't even have artificial gravity. It was like they jus' took a ship straight out of a first FTL ship history museum. Well, fuck. That was a helluva thought. The rustbucket continued to barrel to the planet's surface as he slowly put pieces together in a puzzle he didn't quite understand yet. Why was this ship built like an antique? Wasn't it supposed to be part of ""a new fleet,"" or something? Other, older questions, with a faint relevance that Gexie didn't quite understand, resurfaced as well. Why did Ryan seem so studious, and yet completely oblivious of some of the most basic mechanics of spaceflight, and yet so well-versed in a select few of the oldest ones? Why the hell did human escape pods need coordinates to even launch? Why was humanity so secretive? His line of thought was interrupted by a pirate.


""Might want to buckle in, my snakey friend,"" warned the lanky one with the thick brown hair that had held him at gunpoint in the escape pod. ""Your friend banged up our thrusters pretty fucking good, so it's going to be a *very* bumpy ride."" Gexie just hissed through his gag, staring at the pirate and really wishing he could just punch the smug off of his face.


As they entered further into the unknown planet's atmosphere, Gexie quickly realized the pirate wasn't kidding.

Ryan's pod was built for atmospheric reentry. However, human engineering wasn't exactly perfect yet. As the pod spun and shook violently, flinging him back into Derrissi's arms, he desperately tried to get a handhold on *something*. He grabbed onto the back door handle as Derrissi was flung opposite of him with a concerning *slam* against the glass, her twenty-foot tail whipping around the enclosed space violently. A pained hiss sounded out from her, but before Ryan could ask her if she was okay, her torso was thrown back, probably giving Ryan a concussion as the high-impact snake accidentally smashed his head between her upper shoulder and the door. In a daze, he put a hand to his bleeding head as Derrissi floated back away, the atmosphere no doubt preparing another brutal application of momentum on the two of them.


""Warning. Deploy main parachute,"" the system warned. Ryan slowly processed the information, still clutching his head. The second of weightlessness allowed Derrissi to grab a hold on the cockpit chair and attempt to use the pod's controls. 


""Agh! Damn humans and your fine print! Which one is de parachute button?"" she demanded of the pod's system. 


""Uhn, uhm, fuck, I uh, think its the, the green one, lower left side,"" Ryan offered, still reeling. Derrissi cursed under her breath in an angry hiss.


""De button's too small for my fingers!"" Derrissi reached her long tail over, wrapping around Ryan twice and forcefully pulling him towards her. Ryan's focus shifted in and out on the control panel as he tried his best not to look out of the window. He searched for the button, trying to find it. It took a couple of seconds, with his vision blurred, but he found the button and pushed it in. Another jerk slammed them both forward into the window panel. It was the last sudden shift of momentum, thankfully, as the parachute slowed their descent, and the volatile thrashing of the ship against the atmosphere stopped. He groaned. Ryan *really* should have taken that refresher course on manning the human escape pods… Tentatively, Ryan opened his eyes. Which was a mistake, as he realized just how high up he was. Staring down at the massive drop, miles below him, Ryan felt his stomach lurch and his lunch threaten to come up. He stumbled away from the window, opting to nurse his head instead of thinking about the drop. As he retreated from the window, Ryan accidentally tripped on Derrissi's tail, both earning him a reminder that she existed, and a worsened headache as he slammed into the floor.


""*Ow.* Derrissi, you okay?"" he asked. The snake let out a quiet groan.


""Yes. Every segment of my body aches after *that*, though,"" she grumbled, still reeling from the ship's thrashing. ""Are *you* okay? Why de hell are human escape pods so volatile? Do you not bother with inertial dampener fields?"" she interrogated, gingerly holding her left frill which wore a splotch of deep purple that was most certainly a bruise. 


""Uhm, usually we just use seatbelts,"" he explained-slash-lied.

If you apply by Friday, May 13th to the Fall internship then your application will be expedited and you may receive a fall 2022 internship offer! (typically this will be sent within 1-2 weeks)""**

I’m not sure if this internship is really worth it since I don’t think most software dev jobs use Power BI, it also eats up a lot of my time so I have a hard time fitting in projects or leetcode practice.

My father forced me to join the college and I dropped out in 2016 from tier 3 college since I failed in like 4 subjects It broke whatever I had in me and just didn't went and there were family issues. I have 5-year gap with no skill or passion just a void I just stayed at home as looked at world as everyone moved on my family treat me as a pig in a farm for them to feed to stay alive. My mother was only person that was nice to me, and family just treated me as a rubbish since I have no friends all abandoned me since I was loser on life, they all moved out and joined BITS and some of them moved abroad for studies I asked for help all rejected.



 I loved to use technology but unable to understand fully I know how follow instruction that was given to me and follow them to find the desired outcome I cannot think of my own while coding I just forget all the syntax or where to begin. When someone ask some question, I'm good find things from internet that's it.

When covid began I wanted to kill myself there is nothing I can do since it is too late to fix my career, but I got scared and had thoughts of my mother on the bridge and left 
I decided to give one more try to revive my career whatever that is and joined BCA at age 22 in tier 3 college in 2020 well after a year I got know that I made another bad decision that BCA is worthless degree people prefer a proper 4-year degree than 3 year one. Well, that was another wrong decision I made I do not know how things will progress from here on.

Is there any hope left in my life given the circumstances I will turn 25-year-old with a BCA degree on 2023 I feel like people will throw away my resume by looking at my 5-year gap and nothing to highlight or any outstanding skills they can see in me?

My Flaws:

1. Since childhood I do not how to study properly, I don't know what studying means or how I just open book and wander around in my mind I have bad memory to recall things I just blank out at exams.

2. Being lonely most of 24 year’s my life unable to ask for help since it became taboo for me when most of the time people rejected.


3. No social skills or EQ I just sit alone as things pass by, I just see my surroundings and I pounder over my whole life wish I was never born and get jealous of others success.

4. If I find to right information to act on but get scared what will the outcome of the effort since I don’t want to make mistakes.
 




After all this I came with few options to make decision at the end of my college

1.  Get a master’s degree of some kind abroad by applying for bank loan.

2. Do free internship for 1 year to prove my skills

3. Try getting good at some skills to showcase within 1 year and join at low minimum wage.



I want a good paying job to repay family and everything they have done for me and have some in positive outlook in life and live peacefully without burdening anyone."

Had an interview at a software company. I mentioned that I have no skill set whatsoever. “Yeah, we know. You’re job as an intern is to learn.” And was hired on the spot.

Best part is that this is a paid wfh gig WITH benefits (even a 401k) even though I was told I wasn’t getting benefits. They even pay me $5 higher than what I asked for.

As I said, I’m taking DS/A this fall, which is when the application cycle obviously starts. So, I want to learn a bit of it over the summer and try to start LeetCode beforehand to know what interview questions are like. My first question regarding this is, is this feasible? Will I learn enough DS/A by myself in like 1.5 ish months to be able to conduct LC level problems? 

Also, I know applications start in August/Sept, but when are interviews held? A month after? Or more?

If that (learning it in the summer) isn’t really realistic, my plan would be to grind LC after the semester starts and over winter break, but does enough of the interview process extend past New Years? Do all companies take new applications after New Years? Or only some? And like, I’m assuming I can’t re-apply to the same companies for the 2023 positions, so should I not apply to companies early (August/Sept) in hopes that I can learn more DS&amp;A/LC for a “better” interview after winter?

I’m sorry for how lengthy this is. I genuinely enjoy having a somewhat structured timeline that I can stick to, and since interviewing is intense/competitive/serious, I want to prepare myself as best as I can. 

Thanks guys."

I have two internship opportunities. However, I’ve heard lots of negative reviews about Northwestern Mutuals intern program on the financial side, but nothing about software engineering internship. Was wondering if anyone had has any experience in developing program?"

Don’t know if this is the right platform but. 

Really been thinking about dropping out from my current degree to go out to rediscover what I really want to do in life? I’m quite stuck between whether to go through my decision or not because a degree seems so useful in acquiring opportunities for jobs in Singapore. For context, I’m a computer science student and I have been feeling really dissociated with what I’m studying in school and wasn’t really coping well mentally and academically. As such, my decision to drop out was always at the back of my head. 

I mean I could continue with the curriculum and see how it pans out but I do wonder what else could I do if I didn’t follow the traditional route. 

If I did follow through, I decided that I would take a break and just find internships with my Diploma cert in IT or just work on personal projects or even find opportunities in other sectors. I’m still unsure as to what I want in life but I know I feel super uncomfortable staying in a degree that has always stressed me out (although I do know that’s how universities in singapore function). 

Hope you could give me your two pennies worth."
ujr8s0,6,2022-05-06,Butterfly Effect for a non-traditional student,OwainBraenaru,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ujr8s0/butterfly_effect_for_a_nontraditional_student/,"Backstory:

I went back to school in August 2017, a few months before turning 32. I always have had a passion for ethnobotany, particularly of the Americas. Though at this time, I was not too confident in my abilities in core science and mathematics, so I chose horticulture with a business management concentration as it had the lowest requirement for those types of classes. This program had a 100% transfer guarantee to our local state university, which is a major agricultural science institution. I was fortunate enough to have sold a stake in a small business I had co-founded and had the support of an incredible partner at home. My first semester consisted of two online classes, which I took during the six-month exit period from the company. In Jan. 2018, I was able to attend in-person, full-time.

Exposure to Research:

I had really excelled in my intro to botany class, which satisfied my biology requirement. It helped that I was truly passionate about the subject, so studying was not really a chore. I took a first-semester chemistry course with another guy my age, and we bonded immediately. We would be on the phone until midnight doing our homework together because we were both determined to get an A in that class (we did!). My HORT 101 instructor recommended me to a research internship program that was specific for community college students. It was an NSF-sponsored program through a research institute located at the other major university in my area. This was a rigorous, nine-week program that was really like Boot Camp for scientists, culminating in a large poster session. This was really a top-notch program. One member of our cohort got to spend time collecting moss in Alaska. I was fortunate enough to spend the summer up in the Rockies studying sub-alpine flowers. This program really gave me a charge of confidence that I had never before experienced, and I realized my passion for research. I figured that if I could successfully complete that program, then I can pursue this field on a larger scale.

One Really Good Decision:

The following semester I began working at the school as a tutor for the intro botany class, as well as in the lab prep room for the science department. It was my last semester at the community college before transferring to the university, and I had learned that I was eligible to apply to the university honors program. I was really on the fence about this. I had heard from some people (including one teacher that attended the same university) that it was just a lot of extra busywork. However, one of my horticulture teachers (this guy was basically Tom Bombadil) that I really respect and admire told me that his biggest regret is that he did not join the honors program when he attended the same university. He told me that he felt that I would get a lot out of the program, and that was what nudged me off the fence. I applied and was accepted.also, I switched my concentration from business to science, adding another year to my undergrad (to complete the extra math and science courses that I would have to take).

Results:

My academic advisor at the university was outstanding. For all her honors students, she sent out emails to professors in their academic departments asking for available work-study positions. This landed me an interview with a professor in the horticulture department with a PhD in analytical chemistry. Research in her lab uses different instruments to investigate everything from proteins, down to the chemical and atomic profile of a biological specimen. This absolutely blew my mind. This professor is really a rock star in our department. She is incredibly resourceful and always has her eyes peeled for opportunities for students. She has several grad students in her group that are doing research on everything from black pepper to cannabis. It's a requirement in the honors program to write an honors thesis on an original research project. My professor gave me a project that she had with another university professor on hemp and grapes. I was also given the opportunity to work under another professor at one of the local research farms. My work with these professors led both of them to nominate me for the outstanding senior award for my major. 

My professor's lab group is incredibly supportive. They, along with previous experience from the summer research program, helped me create an award-winning poster on the hemp/grape project. I have built friendships with the grad students in this lab group. One of them is studying an economically important plant for which the major agricultural center is seeing increasingly high wildfire activity. This student, along with my professor, helped me write my first grant proposal for a research project with respect to the issue. The grant was accepted and basically solidified my place in the lab group after graduation. By this time, my professor had become also the chair of the graduate program for my department. So the application process was basically a formality since she provides the final signature on admittance to the program.

And that is where it is now at the time of this post. I am graduating next week and immediately starting my graduate program. I really owe a lot to all the people along the way. My partner, if not for whom none of this would have been possible, my horticulture teachers at the community college for exposing me to research and advocating the honors program, the friends I have made that are also taking on higher ed at a non-traditional age, my peers in the lab, my professor, our resident research scientist, so many people. 

Final words:

Be passionate about what you are pursuing, and show enthusiasm. I think enthusiasm is important because not only is it a positive, natural expression of passion, but it also can help us remain optimistic and in good spirits along the way. It can also be a good first impression in an interview, just don't overdo it!"

# Chapter Five--And the Church Burns

***Aaron***

The massive atrium is awash with boring discussion. Not even the robin's egg blue sky beyond the glass dome above us can brighten the mood. Sixty representatives, comprising three races, are present, and nothing they have to say is interesting to either my sister or me. Anemia has responded by putting her boots up on the table in front of her. I tapped them once to get her to put them down. She refused.

All around us sit the most powerful leaders of humanity, as well as the Gresh and Rendon leaders and dignitaries that now call earth home. Sequestered off into groups, we watch them discuss and debate trade, information and anything that the powerful deem needed to continue to suck in oxygen each day.

This atrium can seat over three hundred, with five levels. Today there is a smaller congregation that sit in the first three rows. Anemia and I sit on the second level of the human delegation. Wigham is three people to my right. Choi is here too, sitting in for her commanding officer, on the other side of Anemia. Hidalgo is right next to me, to my left. He leans over.

""You have any Four Roses in your office?"" he asks, whispering.

I shrug. ""Couldn't tell you. Haven't used much. I don't even need it.""

""So....?""

I chuckle. ""Hector, it's ten in the morning,"" I whisper back.

""And?""

""And it was there the last time I was in the office. So, I'd imagine it still is.""

He begins to nod, softly clearing his throat. ""Good. Good. We may need a drink after this bullshit, and the only time I ever seem to have good whiskey is when it comes from you.""

""So buy it yourself.""

""Nah. I like taking yours.""

I give him a side eye. ""Are the Spanish usually whiskey drinkers?""

""I can't speak for all of them, but I certainly wasn't until I met you."" He suggestively raises his eyebrows. ""But, now I am.""

""And the shipment of human goods have been delivered just on time, so we thank you for that,"" the Gresh representative speaking says, through a boring ass voice. They're all so...monotonous...it seems. Perfect for delegates or politicians.

""You think they're always this boring?"" Anemia asks as she stares down at her phone, cycling through messages. ""Can't imagine them doing anything but talking.""

""You've seen the videos same as me,"" I respond. ""They're not warlords, but their tech makes them formidable in the field."" 

The Gresh, humanoid creatures in the truest sense, I suppose, are slightly smaller and lighter than us, if you work the averages. They have more fingers and more toes. A bit of a hunched back. And while we only breathe oxygen, the Gresh scientifically altered their genetic makeup to be able to breathe underwater long, long ago. At a certain point, thousands of years ago, once they starting producing young born that way, they would kill any child that didn't come out of the womb with the ability, ensuring that the future of their race was stable.

And now, their descendants are amphibious with a set of thin gills on their necks, which are thick as fuck and short. They look like yellow-green golems. From what I understand, they use some of their tech to plug their noses and mouths to stay completely submerged under water for up to three days before those gills need a break and they take in oxygen the old fashioned way again. They would be extremely difficult to hunt during war.

They're not fish, of course, but they're the perfect hybrid if you ask me. The Gresh have shared that they're in the relentless pursuit of perfecting the process to make them able to live completely under water without end. I wouldn't bet against them.

Makes sense when your home planet is ninety-five percent water. I've never visited Greshia, though I've been invited, but the videos and pictures of the planet show me vast cities both above and below water. Towering structures that show their testament to not just survive, but thrive on land. And undersea installations built to deploy vast armadas of submarine war machines or house further populations. They move from land to sea with ease.

And, to be sure, they are no slouches in the field of war. 

They work in perfect cohesion. They're meticulous, and they'll cut you to pieces little by little if you're not careful. They don't have the brutal nature of humans, the ferocity of a Higgan horde, or the cold-blooded nature of the Rendon, but I certainly wouldn't take them lightly. They're logical above all else.

I once watched a video of a squadron of Gresh warriors surgically pick apart hundreds of Higgan in minutes in the hallways of one of their ships. Using traps, explosives and ranged weaponry, the Higgan stood no chance to the intense Gresh precision. It was like they had run the simulation a million times before the engagement and figured out the perfect battle plan. They can be overwhelmed in close quarters, but if you don't get close enough to punch them in the mouth, your hands will be gone before you get a second to think.

We fought the Higgan relatively the same as the Gresh, which they've admitted they were impressed that we figured it out. But we do fight differently. My best analogy? Humans are a race of wrecking balls. The Gresh are surgical knives.

Technically speaking, they fought the Higgan to a stalemate in their war, which I've learned was about five hundred years ago. Since then, they've advanced in their technology by leaps and bounds. They share some of it with us, per our agreement, but it doesn't take a genius to know that they're withholding some the most dangerous stuff from us.

Which is probably why, even though they've asked to study the Sigashi Element, promising to unlock even more of its potential, human leaders have refused. They'll keep their secrets, and we'll keep ours. 

And between you and me, I like them better than the Rendon. The Gresh and Rendon both share a serious streak, but at least the Gresh can be fun. The Rendon are just fucking boring, inclined to study their religion above all else.

""And our people especially thank you for the special delivery of our favorite coffee,"" the Gresh representative says, giving the human delegation a nod. ""Thank you.""

Of course they loved the fucking coffee. 

There are light taps to the table from around the room. Near me, Wigham stands, knowing it is her turn.

""My honorable representatives,"" Wigham starts, ""thank you for having me today. I am Terran High General Molly Wigham, for those of you who are unaware. I understand that I was called here to discuss the matters of my outfit."" She looks around the room.

She told me that would be the signal.

A Rendon leader stands. I know that one. Hithan Hogon, the father of my niece's friend, Hithos, looks at his people. ""Thank you all for coming,"" he says. ""Those of you that have been briefed may stay. To the others, I bid you good day.""

Of the twenty Rendon dignitaries, only two stayed seated. The others leave. Same for the Gresh; one of their leaders stands and nods to his people. Two of his own stay. As for the humans, only Wigham, Hidalgo, Anemia and Choi and I stay. The room quietly empties as we wait.

When the doors shut behind us, I hear locks turn on them. There's a whining, and a steel cover slowly creeps up over the glass dome until it clicks shut with a loud *boom.* The plentiful windows of the atrium fall to the same fate. Pleasant lights around us click on in turn so we're not enveloped in darkness. 

The message is clear. This is sensitive information. And it stays in this room. 

""I thank you for your discretion, Hithan,"" Wigham says, sitting down. She looks over at the Gresh. ""And you, Tiyino.""

A Gresh nods back at her.

Hithan leans forward in his chair. ""Of course, General. We understand the need for this information not to reach more than is appropriate. Please proceed."" 

Wigham nods. ""As you all know, we captured a rogue Higgan operative only a few short days ago. It was not alone. We interrogated it, peeled it apart, in order to find out how it managed to come to our planet undetected. We know it is not the Higgan's first attempt, but this time is different. This time they were successful.""

She scans both the Gresh and the Rendon. ""The Head of Ther'os, perhaps the greatest trophy of humanity, something hundreds of millions of my people needlessly died for, has been stolen from us. I do not believe it is a simple act of thievery. I believe it to be a declaration of war."" 

The word *war* cuts through the air. Hithan clears his throat. ""And you do not think that is premature, General? The Higgan are contained on their homeworld. They do not threaten us.""

""Their arrival on our planet suggests otherwise,"" Wigham responds. 

""A good point,"" the Gresh representative Wigham identified as Tiyino says. ""We all know of the Higgan captures and sightings on other worlds, not to mention their attempts to penetrate this sphere. These are small incidents, but they are not isolated.""

""No, they are not. We believe the Higgan have every intention of declaring war, a true war, once more. Why else would they want to retrieve the head?"" Wigham asks. ""It will be a rallying cry. It shows our weakness."" 

""We of the Rendon understand,"" Hithan says. ""Your claims are not without merit. However, what would you suggest we do in this situation? They have no armada to fight. No army to lay waste to.""

""Nuke the planet to glass,"" Anemia says under her breath, now clearly paying attention. She looks at me, daring me to disagree. 

""The best course of action is to discover how they got onto the planet,"" Hithan continues. ""Which brings us to the prisoner. What of it?""

Wigham swallows. She looks angrily across at Hithan. I know that look. She isn't necessarily angry at our Rendon ally. She's just angry that she doesn't have all the answers.

""We have interrogated it to the best of our ability."" She opens a hand to me. ""We tried everything, even bringing home our greatest soldier to do it himself."" Wigham stands tall. ""If anyone could bring out the answers from the Higgan, it would be from the man they hate the most. I believe you all know Colonel Aaron Augustus, and his sister, Captain Maria Anemia."" 

There are nods of respect and acknowledgement across the other delegations. Hithan most of all. ""Of course. And what did Colonel Augustus find?"" he asks.

*Now* Wigham is annoyed at Hithan. ""Colonel Augustus did what I could not. He spoke to Higgan in its own language, and he retrieved vital information. He learned that the Higgan did not act alone. You know this. But he also learned the Higgan intended to be caught, so its fellows could escape off planet.""

""Interesting,"" Hithan says. ""Very interesting. I thank Colonel Augustus for his work. I assume that is all he uncovered? The Head is still not found?""

I glance at Choi. She just looks ahead. No doubt she spends every waking hour desperately trying to find it, even though we all know we won't now.

""Correct.""

""And where is our prisoner now?""

Wigham pauses. ""Colonel Augustus felt the interrogation finished, and he acted accordingly,"" Wigham says confidently.

And, now she's pissed at me. Again. But she's also loyal as hell. So she'll cover my ass. I owe her that in return. I don't need her to protect me here.

Tiyino leans forward. ""What do you mean acted accordingly?"" he asks.

Before Wigham can answer, I place my katana on the table in front of me, which draws all eyes to me. I stand. ""I removed its head,"" I say with a snarl.

Silence.

I see the Gresh turning to each other to discuss quietly. Hithan just stares at me. I see no anger. Just confusion.

After a minute, he finally speaks.

""And you felt this the best course of action, Colonel?"" he asks me.

""I did."" I press further. ""And I ordered the head to be sent to Higoltha. It will likely arrive tomorrow. I have given instructions to make sure the Higgan receive my message. Before you question my decision, I believe this the best course. I would like our enemy to know the consequences of their actions.""

""And yet they succeeded in their goal, no?"" a male Gresh representative next to Tiyino says, leaning back in his seat. ""As far as this alliance is concerned, they have the Head. We have not found it. They have what they wanted."" He looks down at the table. ""What they will do next now that they do? That is of my greatest concern.""

Fucking asshole. He's right. But he's still an asshole.

""Your actions were of strength,"" the Gresh representative continues. ""Of that I have no doubt. And while I agree with that strength, your decision was rogue. You had no right to do what you did without at least informing us first.""

""Colonel Augustus, we understand, and we respect, your previous actions to keep your planet safe. You are a hero, there is no doubting that,"" Hithan says, earning agreement from the other representatives of the Gresh and Rendon. 

Here comes the doubt. I can smell it.

""But your actions were not approved by the joint council. It was not your right to execute that prisoner. You made an incorrect judgement, and though it has no further bearing on proceedings, I believed it would be misguided not to at least acknowledge it.""

A chair violently screeches back as someone stands to my left.

""I will not sit idly by while you dress him down. You have no right to interfere in the matters of human actions, representative,"" Hidalgo says. The glare in his eyes would set the Rendon's home planet of Rendennia ablaze. ""Colonel Augustus is a hero of our people, and you will speak to him with respect.""

""I have every right, Admiral,"" Hithan responds. ""And I am speaking to him with respect."" He looks at me. ""Do you disagree, Colonel?""

I lightly tap Hidalgo's back, and my friend sits down, though I can see he isn't happy about it.

I nod at Hithan. He and I are different, we see things differently, but he has always treated me with respect. And I have a ton of respect for him as well. I know of his past. He helped save his own people same as I once did. 

""You are, Hithan, you are,"" I say. ""I apologize for the Admiral's outburst. We are quite close."" 

""I understand,"" Hithan responds from across the atrium. ""And I appreciate his loyalty to you. But this matter is *ours,* not just yours. The Higgan will come for all of our planets, not just yours. Their creed, their very foundation, is built upon eradication. Surely, you know this.

Since the fall of Ther'os, we sure do. Data of their conquests were within Ther'os' ship. The Higgan have not always been successful in their wars, at least not at first. But there was always one common denominator in the wars they waged.

Win or lose, they always returned. Sometimes years later. Sometimes decades. The Rendon and Gresh wait, centuries later, for the same. The Higgan have always returned.

Until the work is done. 

""Colonel Augustus would know this fight as well or better than anyone in this forum,"" Hithan continues. ""There is no disputing that.""

""No, there isn't,"" Anemia finally says, speaking up. ""With respect to the wars you have fought on your own with the Higgan, and believe me, I do mean that, *we* killed their king."" Anemia looks at me. ""My brother sacrificed more of himself than anyone to protect our planet.""

Tiyino perks up. ""Speaking of protecting the planet, that has been your true purpose on the planet Mars, yes, Augustus?"" he asks. ""I understand that your role as a...peacekeeper...and overseer of humanity's terraforming and colonization efforts of the planet are just a public façade.""

I nod. ""Indeed. My squad and I have taken deployments to the Terran Mars Observatory, looking for signs of any Higgan presence outside off their own planet. Our stealth satellites in Higgan airspace give us terabytes of information per month, and whenever we detect an anomaly, we send in squads to investigate.""

I hate sending in those squads. I hate sending men and women to their potential, and likely, deaths. The public doesn't know it, but we've touched down on Higoltha since the end of the war. I despise the lying, but it's been necessary. And it's given us important information. 

""Is there anything else, Hithan?"" Wigham asks. While our Rendon ally has indeed shown his respect, I can feel every human bristles at his challenge. I love them for that. But, for now, they should stand down. I made the choice.

Hithan stands. I, along with everyone else present, stands as well. ""No,"" he says. ""That is all for today. Please, for the sake of all of our races, for the sake of our futures, work with us in that future, Colonel, yes? That is all we ask.""

""You can count on it,"" I say.

....

""Fuuuuuuck that shit. Why'd you apologize?"" Hidalgo says, slapping me on the back, taking one of the comfortable leather chairs next to me. ""He had no right.""

""Yes, he did,"" I say, looking at my friend as countless other members of humanity, the Gresh and Rendon move back and forth in the vast hallways of our shared home of intelligence. TDN1 is only a couple of miles to the west of where we stand, though it's obviously underground.

""I made that choice. It was the right one, but I still have to face the consequences.""

Hidalgo shakes his head. ""You answer to no one, my friend. Not after what you've done.""

""Yes, I do. That's the point."" 

He considers this. ""Well, if you're going to brood I'm going to leave. But I don't want to leave yet.""

""Oh?""

He grins at me. ""I've got meetings all day. But I have a few minutes. How about that drink?"" 

I feel my phone vibrate on my knee, and I pick it up. I look at the message, smile and set it down.

I'm needed at home. Apparently there are two little boys that are making a complete mess of their beloved home. I have an urgent message to reinforce my wife to calm them down. I smile to myself at the thought. 

""You know what, I'll take you up on that drink, Hector,"" I say. ""It's been too long since we just shared a moment together. And though there is much ahead of us, I'd like to celebrate being home. And, from what my phone says, I might not have another chance for a while.""

He slaps the table between us. ""I *knew* you were always a sentimental son of a bitch."" He raises his eyebrows. ""Perhaps two?""

I chuckle and offer a hand. ""I'll be there in a few minutes."" I hold up two fingers. ""Two cubes for me.""

He gets up and starts to walk away backwards, giving me a sarcastic salute. ""Yes, Lord Nightmare."" 

...

I step out of the elevator onto the floor that houses my office. If I know Hidalgo, and for fuck's sake I do, he'll have already taken a drink for himself. The funny thing is, the guy doesn't really drink much. He just does with me.

Does that mean I have the problem?

Someone sprints by me as I'm looking down at my wife's message again. It's only been a few days, but god damn have I missed her and my boys. I miss every moment I'm not with them. If anything, I'm having this drink with him to celebrate that I don't have to spend any other moments without them.

Another person sprints by me, this time even knocking into me. I barely react in time as to not drop my phone as they punch my shoulder and fall to the ground.

""What the fu--""

I look down at what's barely a kid, probably some aid's intern, looking up into my eyes. Fear enters his. ""So-sorry, sir. I'm so sorry,"" he mumbles.

He sprints away.

I take a breath and gather myself. ""Kid needs to be a better athlete,"" I chuckle to myself.

My phone starts to buzz. Incoming call. I frown and pick it up.

""I was literally just with--""

""Where are you?"" Anemia asks from the other side of the phone.

I look at the glass doors with my name on them. ""Almost at my office, why?"" I respond.

""Turn on the news. Now. I'm coming to meet you.""

""Anemia, what is this about--""

""You'll see. Everyone does. Now we can't keep this quiet.""

She ends the call.

There's something in her voice. Something I haven't heard in a long time.

Fear.

I swallow and begin to walk to my office, just as I'm at my doors, I switch on a video feed of my phone, twisting it sideways for a larger viewing screen.

I push the doors open and get two steps into my office, but then I stop in my tracks.

On screen, I watch a news report. I turn on the sound.

""*...the horrible tragedy that has already spelled the deaths of over three hundred civilians near the monument when it exploded.""*

I almost can't believe what I'm seeing.

Flames engulf the monument that previously held the Head of Ther'os. Humanity's memorial, the building with the very names of the fallen etched into its stone, that which shows our sacrifice to just live in peace, is in shambles. It is a testament to our resilience and defiance in the face of the death of the Higgan Wars.

And it explodes again. And again. In three different places onscreen as whoever is commentating gasps. 

I watch the building crumble, and I hear screams from the people watching as they run away from the base of it. Many don't make it. Dozens, hundreds more, are crushed underneath the twenty store building collapsing in, on and around itself. Emergency crews scream onto screen. It is horror. 

I put my hand to my mouth, and my eyes start to move.

I step forward and my foot hits something.

And then I look down at the floor and my heart sinks.

My eyes move from the military boots up through the uniform, already knowing the answer but not wanting to accept it. 

I see the grey head of hair. The blank eyes. And I stare at motionless body of Hector Hidalgo that's sprawled out on the floor, a broken glass of whiskey spilled out next to him, with blood leaking from his mouth."
uju44c,24,2022-05-06,I am wanting to spend my PhD free-time to learn bioinformatics : I am looking for suggestions on how to do it !,Kangouwou,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/uju44c/i_am_wanting_to_spend_my_phd_freetime_to_learn/,"Title.

I am a 1-year PhD student in microbiology. During my MSc internship, I analyzed 16S sequencing data. It was fine, I was helped with a bioinformatician.

Now, I am starting to work on shotgun sequencing data. And I am alone in my lab doing this, there is no help available but on Internet. I asked a basic question on ask Ubuntu, but I don't want to do it every time I am having an issue with code.

I enjoy coding. This last week, when I received the Fastq files, I enjoyed wondering how to adapt the pipelines to my data. During my internship, I enjoyed spending time, and free time, on R. Thus, I am ready to spend hours of my free time to become skilled in bioinformatics.

Yet, questions remain !

First, what language should I learn ? It seems that bash and R are the only two languages needed for a Microbiologist. Do I also need to look on Python ?

Second, I know that there are tons of online available guides, tutorials, courses. But I value the opinion of people on such a sub, thus would you kindly share courses you deem good ?

ujub8a,0,2022-05-06,Shutdown &amp; remote control of 30+ machines at the same time,Educational-Jelly266,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ujub8a/shutdown_remote_control_of_30_machines_at_the/,"So as of right now I'm an intern in a PC refurbisher &amp; reseller. Our day to day to works consists of auditing PCs trough Aiken Workbench and then booting up the image we load into it to see if everything is alright. We do this in batches of 15-30 PCs. 

After booting up we make sure that windows is up to date, device manager is ok and the windows key is activated. It's tedious and I wrote a batch to incorporate as an alias in the images we load into the PCs. Now the thing is going 1 by 1 doing Syspreps is quite tedious too so i automated that part too. Yet I still have to click 1 by 1 for confirmation (Superiors need to supervise everything is ok) after the sysprep with oobe option we close the machine via terminal.

Now, here's the question. Is there a way to control these 30 PCs at the same time so events on PC 0 get replicated trough every single one of them? Something like mirroring or a mass remote control tool I'm not aware of? This would speed the work a lot and I could focus in other things.

We only work with W10 and W7, very rarely any other OS so it doesn't really need to be cross platform. As long as it is supported by W10 &amp; W7.

If it is possible how one would achieve so or any guidance anyone can give? I would really appreciate it."

ujunh4,22,2022-05-06,Changing internship job title on resume,throwaway123hi321,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ujunh4/changing_internship_job_title_on_resume/,"Hi all,

I recently completed a project management internship at a very large tech company (Microsoft/IBM/SAP/Oracle) and for most of my internship, it was mostly DevOps work instead of actually project management.

My official job title was project management intern but I feel like it doesn't describe my role well. I will list some of the tasks I had to do:

\- In charge of deploying software using CICD pipeline (Done multiple times per week to different customers).

\- Perform Build Verification testing and recording the results.

\- Monitor and Locate failures for our unit tests within our testing pipeline (Jenkins).

\- Project management work such as creating Jira issues, meeting minutes, conducting stand ups)

I feel that my work experience is much more similar to a DevOps developer rather than a project manager. I have discussed this with my supervisor and he/she said that the job title wasn't up to him/her. I am wondering if I can change my job title on my resume to Project Management/DevOps Intern or that is frowned upon.

Any feedback is much appreaciated!"

I like computers, and I’m interested in coding. I don’t want to do a traditional 4 year school so I’ve been looking through Tri-C, but IT is so broad I have no idea which one is right for me.

(I’m also doing an IT summer internship so I can gain some early experience before I go to school.)

What’s the best way to learn about all the different avenues I can take and the ones that best for me?"
ujvhd0,1,2022-05-06,I can’t land a date,Asleep-Panda2235,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ujvhd0/i_cant_land_a_date/,"Not so much asking for dating advice although it’s welcomed. I can’t even seem to land a date at all. 

A little about myself: 
I just the average guy I think. Im currently in college which will soon come to an end for me, assuming all goes well. I don’t have close friends but I have acquaintances. I’m not tall, I’m only 5’6”. I’m 21 years old. I have a decent part time internship that will hopefully help me fulfill my career goals in the near future. I am getting into working out and have started my path onto body building and overall becoming a healthier person. Im not strong yet, nor am I overweight. I’m just skinny which is why I decided to work out. I’m tired of being called skinny and I want to build mass. I’m also into gaming but I have fallen out of gaming recently as I’m not into any games out right now, so my PlayStation is mostly sitting collecting dust and I only log on here and there to play like 30 minutes of a puzzle game I have downloaded and then I stop. Im into hiking. And I’m also into film. I used to have acne a still have a bit but my face is clearing up despite some visible scars from past acne from years ago. 

So a lot of blah blah blah. Nothing stands out about me. Like I said. Im just the average 21 year old I assume. 

That being said I don’t get much luck with the ladies. Im a bit shy and I have tried to overcome this by approaching women even if I don’t intend to take them out on a date. However, I’ll admit my social skills need some polishing and I have a hard time keeping the convo flowing and sometimes I may say something awkward accidentally. 

Also when it comes to online dating, I get zero matches. I’m a bit jealous of a person I know. He gets like 10-15 matches a day and I am amazed at his capability. 

Ive never been on a date before either, neither have I been in a relationship. I know what your about to say. “but your 21, how have you never been on a date.” I just been focusing on my education. And if I’m being honest l, right now I have very little time to take women out. A lot of my time is taken up by my school work, work, gym and chores. By the time I finish with everything in the day, it is late. However I would like to get some dating experience. I’ve never even kissed a girl before lol. But yeah, I’m a bit nervous because I was told I am in my prime and it only goes downhill from here. Yet, It’s insanely difficult for me to land a date.

Ps I’m not blaming the opposite sex when it comes to this. I understand it’s something about myself I have to work on. However, I need advice on what to work on. Also I’ve been working on myself for quite a while now, but I’m open to suggestions. I’m open to becoming the best version of myself but at the same time I don’t want to waste anymore time because I’m not getting any younger and I’m behind everyone else in the dating experience department at my age. I need to build that experience.

Any advice"

Since then, I managed an independent coffee shop, and then took an internship/finance assistant position with a US Congressional race, then worked in restaurants as a server for 3 years.  

Proceeded to then take another political campaign job for a mid sized city mayor's campaign that lasted three months. Then I was a ""business ambassador"" for a business based LGBT civil rights org in the midwest, which lasted six months.   

Following that, I started a job shortly after as a campaign manager for a state house race in 2016, and that ended in November. After that, there was no job, so I took a warehouse job that was brutal and horribly managed for....let's say six months. 

I later was a journalist at a small town paper for about..nine months, but it was a 45-60 minute drive in my raggedy car, for $13 an hour, so I couldn't afford to stay on there. And they didn't want me/nor was there time for a second job, which in hindsight I should have pushed for more.  

Then I went back to waiting tables for a year. I got a job offer to be a digital organizer for a non-profit, which was a contract position from oct. 19-dec.20. Seemed like it went fairly well, aside from being in the pandemic, trapped at home alone, and having a huge mental breakdown and drinking way too much, but I digress.  

Since then, I was on funemployment until it ran out, but I was applying for about...30 jobs a month or more, to no avail, even interviewing for the same position in a different state with the organization I'd previously worked at.  

So I took a job at a brewery locally, and then a restaurant, AGAIN.  

And now I'm back to managing a campaign, I just started this one, but I have to move out of state for it.  

And it's just like...all I can get hired for are campaign jobs where it's contract work that ends every November, or restaurant jobs where I make less than minimum wage, and always end up losing the savings I'd gained during the campaign because I don't make enough.  

How do I get out of this cycle, and get myself employable at a gainfully employable place?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am joining a big four firm and my start date is less then a month. I listed two professional experiences on my resume. One was with a completely legit credible company and I handed the information over. For the other experience I did an unpaid research group with my dad's friends tech startup. I listed myself as a technology intern bc tbh I did not know how to exactly characterize this. I did some unpaid internships before, where folks literally told me ""you can give yourself any title. I am trying to get you a job."" I thought to myself that it would make sense to characterize this as a technology internship as I worked on the features and user experience with the CEO for a bunch of months. The company is real and I did work for them part time and unpaid. I told my father about this when the background check company asked me to send information to contact his friend. This is a small company with no HR department. My dad and his friend collectively decided to not respond to the background check person after his friend said that this is the best idea. They were worried that they would ask for a W2. My dad's friend also said that he read that only ""20 percent of companies respond to past employee background investigations."" Now he makes a good point by saying that he does not have to respond but Tbh I was not a fan of this approach because I would rather him send an email to the investigator saying i held an unpaid position at the company, and that at the very least would clarify that I indeed worked there. The whole point of such background check is to verify the claims of an applicant and by choosing the decision of silence this has the potential to make me look bad. At the moment I am worried because if HR calls or emails me I am simply going to say that this was an unpaid internship and that the contact I sent them was the only information I have. At the same time I have no criminal record nor financial issues. My academics are good so I wondering if they will rescind my offer because this cannot be verified. I signed my i9 and a bunch of other things. What do you guys think will happen? At this point it looks like I am going to have to roll the dice with this being unverified professional experience. I am in a tough position because this is my father's good friend and I made an error in judgement. Yes, I did stretch the truth, but I was trying to make  my resume look good. Lesson learned, but the consequences remain yet to be seen."
ujyq68,2,2022-05-06,I Got a C in a major class and need advice.,International-Owl970,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ujyq68/i_got_a_c_in_a_major_class_and_need_advice/,"Hello, 

I am a 3rd year (4th year in the fall) undergraduate and I am majoring in Applied Math, minoring in statistics. I received my final grade in my upper-level Advanced Calculus course, and of course it was a C. I want to start applying to graduate programs in stats/data science soon, but I am very concerned that this one C will put a dent in those plans. My main question is, after this grade, how eff-ed am I in terms of getting into a good masters program in statistics/data science in the near future? 

Here is some context about my academic career thus far. My major GPA (including the C) is a 3.74, and my cumulative GPA is a 3.58. This advanced calculus course is not the first upper-level course in my major I have taken. In fact I received an A in my Honors Abstract Algebra I course last semester, and I finished my Honors Abstract Algebra II course this semester with an expected A as well. This advanced calculus course was not an honors course. Additionally, as I want to go into a statistics/data science program, I have taken a couple of upper-level stats courses as well (received an A in both of them), and  computer science courses (Nothing lower than a B). 

Aside from the classes I have taken, I believe I have a good amount of technical skills, work experience, and research experience in data science. Essentially I worked in a lab last spring and did a data science REU last summer, and have submitted 2 different manuscripts for publication so far. I have presented at virtual and in-person conferences as well. I worked as a math tutor for a semester, and I currently intern in a data visualization lab on campus. 

Finally, this semester has been particularly difficult for me mental-health-wise, as I stopped taking a certain medication halfway into the semester. Now that I no longer take that medication I have struggled with bouts of severe depression, anxiety, burnout, etc among physical ailments. I struggle with sleep, I tend to either binge-eat or eat nothing, I can barely muster up the willpower to get out of bed sometimes. I will be back in therapy in the summer hopefully. 

My thinking is that a C in advanced calculus will be a big red flag to admissions committees, since I am a math major. But given that I made an A in arguably more advanced honors math courses, maintain a GPA above 3.5 in both my major and my cumulative, have a good amount of research experience relevant to my field of interest, and some work experience, while struggling with mental health, I am not quite sure of the impact that this will have. Please tell me if I am completely screwed, mid-screwed, or not too screwed."

     Stiu, poate intrebarea mea este destul de stupida pentru acest sub, dar altundeva nu stiu unde as putea intreba. Am reusit sa in martie sa obtin un post de Software Engineer la Siemens (SSP - Software System and Proccesses) (sunt anul 2) si as dori sa raman la ei pentru un ""Summer School"" pana cand voi reincepe facultatea. In orasul in care ma aflu IBM ofera un salariu mult mai atractiv (am inteles ca sunt diferente chiar si de 1000-1500 lei).

     Acum sa revenim la subiect. Credeti ca, este un avantaj, pentru a reusi un posibil Internship si mai departe o posibila angajare daca as reusi sa obtin certificatul de pe Coursera de Data Science? Am vazut ca ar mai fi inca un curs numit IBM Techinal Support. Ma gandeam sa le parcurg pe amandoua.

     Considerati ca as putea termina acel curs intr-o luna (40$) sau mi-ar putea lua mai mult. Tin sa mentionez ca nu sunt la o facultate de profil (Mate-Info, Calculatoare) (toti colegii de la Internship sunt Mate-Info an 2,3 si master) si din cauza asta pot spune ca plec cu un ""handicap"" in cautarea unui job pe Data Science / Software Engineer.

ukafgd,2,2022-05-07,Should I take a hardware internship?,TyroneWubbles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ukafgd/should_i_take_a_hardware_internship/,"Hey everyone. I'll be graduating in a week with an Associate's IT degree majoring in Computer Software Development. Recently I received an offer (which I accepted) to work in the IT department at a major hospital. The role however is hardware-based, and so far it sounds like just being a generic IT person handling tickets and moving equipment around. I'm questioning whether or not this internship is worth proceeding with, especially because it's not really relevant experience to my degree. Here are the two scenarios I'm looking at:

1. Take the internship, some IT experience is better than none (even if it's just 10 weeks). It's something that will always benefit my resume. After the internship, I'd return to my current job (assuming I haven't found a career job yet) and work on coding projects while at work (I work overnights and have several hours where I can do whatever I want).
2. Rescind the internship and focus on working on projects and studying Data Structures &amp; Algorithms. Many job applications in my area want either a Bachelor's in Computer Science, or 1-3 year's of experience, so the internship might not even help. The 10 weeks I would spend on the internship would be better off spent improving and creating projects and learning more about DSA (something that didn't get covered much in school). It seems like projects would be more beneficial to my resume than a hardware IT internship.

Doing both could be an option, but I don't want to feel like I'm wasting time on an internship in general that might not even help me in finding a job. I'm leaning more towards option 2, but I'd like some opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?"
ukamnl,3,2022-05-07,Working developer looking for guidance [5 years with an Agency],astrand,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/ukamnl/working_developer_looking_for_guidance_5_years/,"Hi everyone!

I'm looking for some Reddit-guidance with my career/education as I don't have a mentor/colleague who can help with this sort of question.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I appreciate anyone who reads and comments &lt;3

*Background:*I moved from USA to Sweden in 2014 and in 2016 I started spending my free time learning web development through Team Treehouse (as a hobby).

In late 2017, I landed an internship (unpaid) with my current company (a small startup with 5 developers) which became a paid, part-time job a couple of months later and eventually full time, which allowed me to quit my other full-time job. The agency worked 95% of the time with Wordpress, with a mix of page builder, custom PHP templating, &amp; some jQuery sprinkled in.

We had a senior php-dev/mentor until early 2019  when he quit, which was one of the best/scariest things for my career because I was suddenly in charge of a large portion of client contact, project management and development for our agency. Much like a baby bird getting forced out of the nest - it led to a lot of long days and self-education and I've become sort of a Swiss army knife-developer for our company.

*Fast forward to 2022:*I am still with the same agency and feel comfortable with any project that we do, but I feel a bit bottlenecked by the type of projects/clients that we have.

Our tech stack has been directed towards Wordpress development, thus a mix of php (some Laravel), css/html &amp; jQuery (not a lot of vanilla JS).

I try to take on any of the outlier projects that comes in, simply to get a chance to learn new things, which has been custom integrations for HubSpot (php integrations for syncing information from other databases), HubSpot theme dev/modules, Shopify templating with Liquid, basic C.R.U.D. tasks with APIs.

*Where do I go from here?*My company --I've been with the same company since 2017 and they were the ones to start my career. I really do love my coworkers and make a good salary, but I continue to feel like I have so much more to learn/improve and do not have the opportunity to do so with them. My boss would want nothing more than for me to learn more, but my ""small agency"" workload does not permit a lot of free time for education.

My education --Much of my 5 year career has been focused on PHP, so it makes sense to continue down that path and focus on laravel and eventually vue.js. However, it seems that many web applications, even WordPress, are moving away from PHP and towards JS. I'm a bit torn as to which stacks I should focus on. I could of course focus on the tools that would help with my company, but as I mentioned, there aren't many opportunities or use-cases (and time/budget) for using advanced JS or PHP in my day to day work.

Within coding, I have gotten the most enjoyment from doing my php API integration work and enjoy working with jQuery whenever I get the chance. I am less excited about frontend work, but this could be 100% related to how our team performs frontend development (builders &amp; php templates). I would love to learn headless development, but unsure about finding the right ""path"".

Just wondering what others think or if anyone has been in a similar situation before.

Thanks for reading and have a great weekend!"
ukb8jh,0,2022-05-07,Need advice on deciding between two Master's (AI vs CV),AtenrevCode,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ukb8jh/need_advice_on_deciding_between_two_masters_ai_vs/,"Hi, I recently got accepted into two master's I am interested in, but now I am having a hard time deciding which one should I take.

The first is a 1.5-year master's in Artificial Intelligence ([https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-artificial-intelligence/curriculum](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-artificial-intelligence/curriculum)), and the other one is a 1-year master's in Computer Vision ([https://mcv.uab.cat/program/](https://mcv.uab.cat/program/)). 

I am in love with Artificial Intelligence, generally speaking, and, in the future, I would like to do research and create models such as AlphaGO and AlphaStar. However, last year I did an internship in the Computer Vision Center, where I worked building Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision models, and I enjoyed it a lot as well.

So, now I don't know which program would fit me the most. There are subjects in the AI program that I already did in my Bachelor's degree, plus I fear that it may be a bit shallow in its content. On the other hand, the master's in CV is focused only on Computer Vision, although they also teach heavy mathematical grounding and machine learning. Besides, it has good references from former students.

Given this, what would you recommend me to do? Also, what contents would be harder to learn on my own? 

Thank you."

ukca1x,1,2022-05-07,"How to be ""professional""?",Mars_Design,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ukca1x/how_to_be_professional/,"Hi all, my first post in this sub-reddit.

I am working in a small e-commerce company and luckily in the last two years we've been transformed from a start up to a scale up company and continue growing.

My current role is Operations Manager. I am happy with what I am doing now. And I am grateful and feel proud for what I've achieved so far.

This is my first full-time job, I have no Marketing nor Sales experience, had no idea what is e-commerce before I joined; I started as an unpaid intern, no working VISA + English is not my mother language and also have cultural barrier for sure.

But I somehow managed to overcome all the obstacles and become what I am today in two years. Of course I have good mentors(not just one) and easy-to-work-with colleagues, and my bosses always give my credits and a lot of trust. That's why I say I am really grateful.

In the last two years, I've been doing a bit of Sales and Marketing, but mainly Customer Success, Quality Assurance, Logistics, Project Management and Product Management, I also learned a bit of UI/UX design and Front-end Development. And since I became Operations, I shifted my role from supporting role to a facilitator role, which in a way become more proactive.

I've launched a several key projects, and I am able to maintain all the quality work that I am doing even I've been multi-tasking since I become full-time in this company.

Now, the question is, since we are transforming from a scale up to a bigger orgaisation, I can foreseen that we will hire more ""**professional**"" employees. And in a way many tasks I am doing will be replaced by more mature workflow or we start to use more professional tools to operate our business. So I need to do something in order to be ""better"".

*\*I am not saying my current colleagues are not professional, but I have to admit that most of us are very junior including myself.*

I usually read business articles, watch Ted-talks, take some online courses, but lacking of reference point sometimes I am not sure what outcome I am trying to achieve. (I am a very outcome-driven person. If I don't have the vision, I don't get motivated.)

**To sum up, my questions are**  
\- Since when, you realise, ""I am doing this job professionally""?  
\- If you have Operations or Business Management experience, how do you define a qualified Operational role in an organisation?  
\- If you have experience that working in an organisation that transformed from small to bigger organisation, what quality of staff(If you are manager) or colleagues that you would like to work with and why?

Thanks for reading, I really like this job because we are creating job opportunities in the last two years since Covid happened. I am proud of what I am doing and I really want to be excellent.

Wish you all have a nice day."

There may be too much info here, but writing it out did help me mentally.

I'm 25F. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Communications with a Digital Media concentration in 2019 from a great school. I have 2 short-term and 1 long-term internships under my belt, all three of which took place before I graduated so that experience is a little dated. Once I graduated, I became depressed, pressure from home to find something, ANYTHING was piling up, and in 6 months I landed a decent paying, comfy job outside of my major that didn't even require a degree. It treated me extremely well and I became complacent very quickly and stopped looking for jobs within my major because my mental health couldn't really handle it at the time.

After COVID hit I worked remotely full time starting in 2020. That was the point where I started streaming on Twitch. My growth on that platform, plus Twitter and TikTok, is something I'm super proud of, and it's helped me rake in around $300-$500 a month in extra income and I've been able to use everything I've learned with my Digital Media on it. I feel like it's really adding to my experience in marketing because I'm constantly on social media gaining more of a following. I guess the only hangup is I'm a Vtuber, so it's anonymous and a little hard to translate for prospective employers exactly what I do.

I ended up losing my comfy job mid-2021 due to some unfortunate circumstances. They offered me a reference but at that point I saw it as an opportunity to focus on finding a full-time career that I was actually passionate about: Any kind of content creation, whether it's content writing, social media management, video editing, etc (I have skills in all these things, just outdated education and work experience other than streaming). I was scared that going to another comfy job outside my major would put me in another rut. 

Fast-forward to now and I've had very little success in getting a full-time job in that field, but I have worked in other places that paid well while I looked. In the meantime my streams have been doing very well but I'm just trying to break a plateau in viewership. I'm learning a bunch of skills in the background like digital art, After Effects, Live2D rigging, and singing. I've put way too much on my plate and my days are completely packed with all that learning PLUS streaming and making connections with others, still I can't seem to get a single interview for a full-time position that I might enjoy even a little bit to secure some good income AND advance my career (and hopefully get health insurance...).

A couple weeks ago I got fired from a sales position because I wasn't ""flourishing"", which is making me a little desperate. I feel burnt out and worthless and when I look at my resume I want to just give up. I have no idea how I'm going to break down this wall between me and the career I want to be in. I want to spend time on the things I'm passionate about and I know I should prioritize things like taking analytics classes or maybe even doing some freelance work but I'm so exhausted and all I wanna do is focus on my streaming stuff because I actually have a passion for it. And I want a day job where I can put the skills I learned from that, school, and my internships to good use.

I think a career coach would help me greatly. I have ADHD so in general it's very difficult for me to organize myself and find opportunities that fit me at the same time. I feel so out of practice looking for jobs, it could be a great way for me to get back into it. But it's also just SO expensive, and not guaranteed to work for me. I also feel like if I wasn't so distracted by streaming I'd be able to force myself to get better at it without having to pay someone to coach me.

Any opinions on career coaches for jobs that revolve around content creation or even just communications? Any experiences shared or just general advice is greatly appreciated. Obviously I think part of the solution is to take a break from stream content and focus up but I think that would only hurt my mental health, streaming has kind of become my only source of social interaction since my friends moved away.

Sorry this is a lot, I could have condensed but it feels nice to really lay out my experiences in the past few years. Here's the TL;DR:

TL;DR: 25F, have a Communications &amp; Digital Media bachelor's degree. Got discouraged in the job search and settled for something comfy and well-paying, started streaming on Twitch with moderate success, then lost that job. I put too much on my own plate and want to have a higher chance of landing a full-time job in content creation or marketing but can't focus up, considering hiring a career coach. Experience sharing and advice are greatly appreciated."
ukfdtu,1,2022-05-07,Full Time vs Funded Masters,GenTs0,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ukfdtu/full_time_vs_funded_masters/,"Hi all,

I am fortunate enough to have finished my undergrad in 3 years from UF with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Statistics.

I am going to be working at Amazon this summer as an SDE intern.

However I am unsure of what to do in the Fall:

1. Try to almost immediately go full time at Amazon or interview full time at other FAANG+
2. Do a one year master's degree in CS at Yale (46K tuition tho, my parents will help pay the other half)
3. Accept a teaching fellowship and do my master's part time (also at Yale) that covers full tuition and gives a 24K stipend for the 2 years, another summer internship.

I enjoy statistics, but also enjoyed my generic CS classes such as data structures and computer networks.

I've heard ML is saturated, and I am not sure if a master's is truly worth it in tech.

I also only had 3 years of undergrad and half of which was during covid, so it might be fun to do more college and meet people.

Any thoughts are MUCH appreciated."

Unsure what exactly I want to do as my career, my degree focuses on cyber security and in my research, SOC Analyst seems like a good start to aim for once I graduate. Unfortunately my internship doesn’t directly relate to cyber security, it’s an IT position with a large company in my city, which hopefully will lead to a career once I graduate. 

I’m curious to what the day-to-day activities for a SOC Analyst entails or any advice for getting my foot in the door for cyber security positions.

“I work completely remote for a Cincinnati based company. I am a mid-level dev and make about 82k a year. I have a B.S. and M.S. in CS, and have about 3 years experience (not counting internships, etc.), all with the same company. I have friends with similar work experience getting offers in in the 100-130k a year range, and I'm hearing of some getting even more for onsite jobs in the Columbus area. My company does yearly raises of 2-3% or 6% if you get a promotion. At this rate it'll be 5-10 years before I'm making what others with the similar experience are making now. In this job market, is it a necessity to job hop?
Side note: I enjoy my current job, and have great coworkers. Work/life balance is good, and company benefits are decent. My parents both worked in local government and retired after 34 and 33 years at the same jobs. So the idea of leaving a job for another after a few years feels weird, and you probably already know how my parents reacted when I asked for their advice on the matter haha. But with the way the market is, and corporations refusing to adjust to it, it feels like it's almost a necessary step in any software developers career.

What can I do,L0uisc,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/ukikc4/im_screwed_what_can_i_do/,"I'm employed at a tiny company (3 full-time employees, including the owner). Owner is an electronic engineer and the company specializes in RF electronics. I started working there as intern without any education past high school. There was a senior software dev who left in the mean time when I started. I started studying BSc Computer Science after hours last year.

One of our products is an IoT device with SIM card and GSM/GPS module. It is used to send location data an a few digital signals up to a server for our customer to plan maintenance on their equipment. They had another company who built the server and website.

Things happened such that we are now building a website for them. I initially thought I'd be able to do it, but when I started working on it, I realized how little I knew about databases and authentication and security, etc. There is no way I'm going to do this with my level of knowledge before the deadline.

I spoke to the owner around a month ago, and basically told him I need help. I offered to even work without pay on it if somebody who knows what he's doing can just take the burden of making architectural decisions off me. I don't even know what my options are; how can I decide how to do this? He wasn't willing to get help, but told me it's the company's problem if I don't get it done on time, not mine.

Well, I tried for a month. Of course, a week was lost due other stuff in one of the embedded codebases that came up. That's not going to change. There will be interruptions all the time. There is no way I'm even going to be close to having a website doing all they need by the deadline.

The website needs to show the locations of all the devices on a map, with status information. It needs to send emails to specific addresses when certain events happen. It needs to filter the devices shown to only show relevant devices / devices for which the currently logged in account has permission on the map.

I'm feeling I'm stretched too thin. Am I just being lazy, or is this more than one person's dedicated job? What can I do? How can I resolve this situation?"

**Info Application Essay Advice:**

**Present yourself as matching the informatics school mission/values/self-descriptors:**

&lt;I wish I could just put my screenshot here, but refer page 2-3 of this brochure for the mission statement and descriptions. Frame yourself in what they describe&gt; [https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure\_2020](https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure_2020)

""A program that focuses on computer systems from a user-centered perspective and studies the structure, behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store, process and communicate information. Includes instruction in information sciences, human computer interaction, information system analysis and design, telecommunications structure and information architecture and management.""

Its not just tech (CS is about making the best tech), not just people (that’s social sciences), not just information. Privacy, security, legal, intellectual property, human factors in tech, web and mobile development, social media, politics, the tech world, statistics, journalism.

Make sure its clear you know what informatics is and that **you specifically** fit it (you don’t actually have to know what informatics is, I barely do, so say what they say)

&amp;#x200B;

**This is about you**

What classes or things peaked curiosity, why are you here, what is important to you specifically.

Really think about why you like informatics, why did you choose it, what is it about you that will make you good at it.

* I didn't think I cared that much about Informatics until I worked on this essay, I realized why I really wanted to get in.

Have a focused idea/topic/goal for the essay and make sure it is clear. This I struggled with. The essay prompt is barely a prompt, it's more like things they want you to mention.

Topic ideas: (but please use stuff that actually works for you, erase these from your mind before brainstorming)

* how you found informatics, how you found whatever informatics concentration you like, something you struggled with (like communicating your ideas, finding your role, personal stuff) that info helps with, a specific instance, or an experience you had like club/job/volunteer/school.

Try to make a story; doesn’t have to be super narrative, but show your growth don’t just brag.

* Mine wasn't a single narrative story, I talked about the three times I have done projects about prison advocacy, and used it to show my progression over time getting better at communicating ideas as I got more into informatics.

Don’t write it like a paper or resume, its about your connection to it and the humanistic aspects of the program. Write it to be understandable for someone who isn’t in informatics, because some of the reviewers (apparently) aren’t informatics people.

""highlight your passion about the subject (could talk about a project you did during INFO 200/201 and how you wanted to expand on it). See if you can expand on it.""

Be yourself and show who **you** are, but don't feel bad about creating a smarter/kinder/girlbossier/informatics version of yourself

&amp;#x200B;

**Here’s how I broke down the prompt:**

(but smoosh all the questions together into one story)

**Experiences with information**.

how have you used tech/data to help you/others or if you haven't really, how can you using tech/data help the next generation

Do you not have “experiences with information technology”? I'm sure there is stuff you can still write about and this is broad enough that I’m sure you have an experience with information, especially related to diversity/equity.

* Clubs, personal projects, volunteering, personal relationships, social media, organizations. Anything related to information technology or data or the internet could work

BUT it can’t hurt to find some if what you have doesn’t feel compelling:

* use projects from the INFO classes you took, making sure that you show how that experience was specific to you or your life to differentiate yourself from everyone else who also took those classes.

Get a job/ extracurriculars. Maybe it doesn’t have to be super social justicey or perfect, but just to show experience

Extracurriculars:

* info viz
* Hackathons or computer science clubs/groups
* PODUW (polling and open data initiative)
* If you want to do design:
   * huskyadapt; SEAL lab; design for America
* SWE
* other techy rso’s or any rso where you can be the web design/techy person for them
* Do volunteer data entry or data related stuff for a non-profit, look at [volunteermatch.org](http://volunteermatch.org/)

I was stressed so really wanted stuff like this to look better. I didn’t end up talking about it in depth but I bet you could get a whole story out of it. I mentioned data entry volunteering for a nonprofit but it was more helpful because I thought of my whole idea from connecting it to the rest of my life.

Also remember they don’t fact check you so… go ahead and make it sound cooler than it was

&amp;#x200B;

**Experiences with diversity, equity, and inclusion**

Not solely focusing on your identity/oppression, make sure its related to how technology played a negative or positive role in it, and then tie it to what you did/want to do to change it (preferably using information technology). It doesn't have to be as related to tech as the last question, but make sure your ""backstory"" actually flows with the whole essay.

Possible things

* Intersections of your identity
* advocacy
* Political exclusion and Technological exclusion
* Misinformation is something they really care about
* Social media

This is the ""human-centered"" part of Informatics, show that you care about people and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals after college**

if you don’t have a specific career goal, approach it as how the major matches with your values and personal goals.

* I talked about combining helping people and advocacy with a logical, practical base. And how moving around a bunch of majors let me know Info was good for me in the future

Find faculty or a specific class or what about the school that will help further goals, this will make them think the I School is central to your future and you can't get it anywhere else.

* It could help to name drop one of your professors and say you’re interested in their work.
* Look into research groups at the I School
   * I talked about wanting to learn about the Center for Informed Public group and masters programs.

Info is a backup major for a lot of people, and its also broad enough that it can be a catch-all. Convince the reader that Info specifically is what you need and want.

“show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory""

What is it about informatics and about yourself that will make you stick with this in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Learning skills**

Brag about your grade for a class, and make sure it ties into the rest of the essay. This wasn't super central to my essay approach so I don't have much advice for it; though I'm sure there's a way to make the whole story about your class experience and you coming out with a good grade. They don't care much about your grades so use this as an opportunity to highlight your academic best.

&amp;#x200B;

**General Essay advice**

700 words is a short essay, make sure it is straightforward and cohesive (do as I say not as I do) and there's a clear point that you successfully gets across -ask people if it gets across.

Reach out to informatics advisors or TA’s or professors

Utilize drop in tutoring at study center or use CLUE

Get feedback on what you write, even if you, like me, hate people reading your writing. I am very grateful for my friend who read my first draft and said ""this sh\*t makes no sense, it's making my dyslexia worse"". That hurted, but I needed it.

Start early, I thought I started early and still worked on it up to when it was due. Start earlier. Talk through your ideas with people and get people to read your stuff, then restart- ask early on so it is constructive.

Anytime you think about informatics, write it down for later because you can use it. This essay forced me to be very introspective for a while. Maybe I am just an over-thinker, but still, Brainstorm for a long time. (I did get caught up on trying to use all of it, so be mindful that not everything can be included).

Give yourself the best chance with a well written essay. I do think content is most important -I actually had a few typos. (please don't bring it up i'm so embarrassed)

&amp;#x200B;

**A collection of other people’s blocks of advice:**

(this is not cited I am very sorry but I genuinely don't remember who said what)

1:

show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory. think of something that’s a big part of your life and talk about how you used it to make a positive impact and if you don’t have anything like that, find something. they care a lot about being passionate

2:

Tell a overarching narrative: “For me, I like design, so I explained how I started off in PoliSci, but I found that it was too theoretical, and not practical. I learned in PoliSci how inequitable the world is, but no matter the studying I did, I couldn’t change the world around me. Then I found design. I could make things to physically change the world around me, and I fell in love. “

Be explicit with your previous experiences : “I participated in X rso, and I designed Y for Z to make it more equitable.” Tie it into the overarching narrative. “I made things with my hands, and I saw how much I was able to impact someone’s life for the better, without us, they would’ve faced X inequality.”

Be explicit WHY info: “I learned a lot in X rso, and I learned how much I want to be a designer post college to make the world around me more equitable. Informatics will allow me to do that because it offers me X resources, unlike Y.”

3:

Paragraph 1: Talk about a hardship that you have faced - preferably one that is from systemic bias.

Paragraph 2: Talk about how you persevered, despite said hardship.

Paragraph 3: Talk about how your perseverance sparked a passion to work on solving that hardship for others.

Paragraph 4: Talk about how you learned about the iSchool while becoming passionate about working on that hardship's solution.

Paragraph 5: Talk about why you feel the iSchool will best help you gain the tools you need to help others with this hardship (since you plan on making this passion your lifelong pursuit). (Be specific here. Mention a faculty that you feel would be a great resource or mentor because of some specific work (s)he has done. Especially if he or her was one of your 200 instructors ***and likes you*** or is on the admission board.)

4:

**Tip #1: Start your application essay early! This means brainstorming, drafting, and all of the basic writing processes. Create a good list in your brainstorming of projects you could talk about or any social experiences that made an IMPACT on YOU.**

My first essay read like a resume and that was not the key at all. The essay (if the prompt is the same as mine) should be a STORY about YOU and a specific experience(s) that where you learned from and applied the views/values/mission of the iSchool's pillars.

Sure, getting rejected the first time hurt a lot because it increased my anxiety about not having a major. However, the key is to keep grinding and have no regrets. Therefore, on my second try, I put in a lot more time and effort. My Google doc draft ended up having 40+ pages of notes and drafts that I took over the span of 3 months because I kept editing the same essay. If I got rejected here - then it would still hurt, but I would have no regrets because I did my 100% best on the application. 

**Tip #2: A growth mindset is very important. Being able to bounce back from failure and be even better is important. Put your 100% effort into things and have no regrets about the outcome. Expect the worse; but hope for the best.**

I'm still experiencing this mindset right now in my internship interview processes after getting mountains of rejections and no offers. It hurts - but I believe in myself and I'm grinding for my optimism! 

**Tip #3: Learning how to scope your essay and focusing on specific experiences in my life helped me describe how I implemented the iSchool's values into my thinking and learning.** Talk about what you've learned from INFO classes like this class and how you applied that to your future experiences of doing things - work, academics, hackathons, etc.

**Tip #4: Have a clear goal of what you want to do and communicate your journey with it.** Your pursuit of passion should be clear and not vague at all.

Tip #5: **Understand that the iSchool doesn't need their applicants - the applicants NEED the iSchool so make sure to talk about how the iSchool's resources will let you reach your goal.** For example, I talked about the possibility of working with specific professors in the Tech Policy Lab and I brought examples of what I learned from INFO 300 into my work experiences.

**Tip #6: Take more INFO classes other than INFO 200 and INFO 201.** This step may not be absolutely necessary; but, it can help you understand the principles of Informatics as a whole. I took INFO 300 and the 3 classes alone were able to help me get the major. However, I have gotten tips to take as many INFO classes as you can so you can talk about how you implemented aspects of what you learned from the class to your story.

**Tip #7: Make sure your essay is a STORY about YOU.** Assume that they are going to read your essay one time through because they're tired of reading applications all day. Reading boring resumes like my first essay definitely didn't make an impact on them. However, writing a story about myself and my journey towards my goal of ""\[becoming\] an aspiring software engineer... to design empathy-driven technology so information can be universally accessible"" made it clear what I wanted to do.

I literally had my INFO 300 professor read over my essay and he said it was straight-up boring. The guy literally plugged in the Hero's Journey chart into my Google Doc as well and I got traumatic high-school English flashbacks. But it made sense why he did that. 

**Tip #8: Use AS MANY resources as you can. This means showing your paper to friends, family, Professors, TAs, the INFO student admission helpers, the Writing Center, etc.** They will provide criticism on what is clear, what can be improved, and what should be emphasized. Also, make sure to ask for their FIRST IMPRESSIONS because you must hit all of the marks on the dot right from the get-go. Ultimately, you don't have to implement all of their feedback, and it's up to you to choose which feedback would be beneficial for your vision because not all of the feedback you get will be constructive towards that target.

**Tip #9: Try to read the essays of admitted students to see what aspects they emphasize to align with the values of the iSchool.** However, take this with a grain of salt because you definitely DO NOT want to copy them. It's your story you're writing about, not theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Backups for informatics:**

* Geographical information studies
* Design major
* Foster information systems path
* Do minor in informatics which isn’t capacity constrained
* Panic and pick something random (most majors have a data science concentration)
* Do something and then get a masters like the MSIM or MSDS
* Check the rest of uw reddit there’s plenty of ideas (UW restricting majors is so dumb and its so stupid that we have to think up backup majors when we’re giving them money this School is dumb)

&amp;#x200B;

Mandatory Disclaimer: This is what worked for me, it might not work for you. Maybe this advice isn't even necessary for anyone else but me. Try to read a few people's essays or ask what they wrote about to see which approach can work for you.

Don’t psych yourself out for this! I was my own worst enemy in getting this done. Just do it and if it's trash give yourself time to redo it. You can do it!"

uklim7,2,2022-05-07,High School Computer Science Internships?,PyrusDoesLife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uklim7/high_school_computer_science_internships/,"Hello! I'll do my best to keep it quick.

I'm a 16 year old Junior in High School.
I'm taking an Intro to CS course (Java). 
I have prior self-taught knowledge of Java, and I'm working on my Python.
I will be taking AP CSA for my Senior year.

I was wondering if there are companies who will offer CS internships for High School students? Either online or in person (though keep in mind I am stationed in Central Jersey)."
ukljsk,3,2022-05-07,Just wanted to share my story…,sietskevx,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/ukljsk/just_wanted_to_share_my_story/,"First some background information. 
I’m born and raised in the Netherlands, (so excuse my English) I’m 22 years old and I work as a teachers assistent for 3 days in a week. The other two days I’m studying parttime to become a teacher and one day I’m doing an internship at a school in a village nearby. Let’s say I live a very busy life. 

As a teachers assistant I give a lot of one on one assistance to children who need a little extra help or children who can actually do a little more. But this year I particularly give a lot of assistance to one kid who has dyslexia. Maybe you’ll think: “great for that kid!” Well… not so much. 
There are a lot more children at our school who have dyslexia and need extra attention. But we decided that I can give him a lot of attention since “he needs it” (as his parents insisted) and that we will hire more teachers assistants to help other kids. From the 21 hours I work in a week, I give him something like 15 hours of my assistance, which is divided in one on one assistance and assistance in the classroom, so I can make the work of the teacher a little lighter by giving him the attention he “needs”. 

At the beginning of the year these hours weren't even divided and I spent them all on one-on-one assistance with him, but since he's not very social, I've suggested providing assistance in the classroom so he isn't completely isolated.

He has shown a lot of aggressive and bully behavior toward classmates for no reason. This was last year. His parents say he got bullied on his previous school so we think that’s maybe were it’s coming from. But we’ve spoken to teachers from the previous school and they say that he actually was the one bullying other kids, but we stay open minded. 

The year started off great. He did good with his grades and actually seemed to get along with other students in his class very well. But gradually that changed, this was somewhat around november. He started to bully other kids, but he did it very sneaky. He managed to do so whenever we weren’t paying attention. He started provoking children to fight him. He’d say things like ""come on, hit me"" when he walked past someone. So we called his parents, talked with his parents about his behavior and made an agreement with his parents that we, the teacher of their class and me, will e-mail them whenever he miss-behaved so they could talk to him about it. They agreed his behavior was inappropriate. We had conversations with those parents before and even though they agreed that his behavior is unacceptable, those weren’t fun conversations. these parents have already called us out for several things. But we still do whatever we can. 

I few weeks ago he was showing this behavior again. A kid came crying to school with his mom. He was crying because he didn’t want to go to school. He is one of the shy kids who would never do something wrong. So I had a conversation with him and he said he didn’t want to go to school because was getting bullied by the student I was taling about above. The boy had been poking him in the stomach with a pen for weeks. And since he’s very shy he wasn’t standing up for himself.
I talked about it with the boy but he denied doing it.

On that same day he did some more things, he didn’t want to do the things I had to do, he had a big mouth at the teacher and me, and some more things, which made the teacher call with his parents after school. She decided to call instead of sending an e-mail since te list of the things he did that day was pretty long. 

When we called his mom she was at her work, we asked if she was able to call and she said she did. So we talked to her about what happened that day. That was when the conversation went downhill very fast. The mom said, while hysteric crying, that *quote* “it's always my son's fault”, “how dare we call her when she’s at work” “you should as a team do a course ‘listening to children’”, “ my son is even worse off than at the previous school” “you should give so much attention to my son because he has dyslexia”, “you are not doing your job well”, “I will transfer my son to another school”. (She said things like this before but I was never involved in those conversations).

We didn’t know what to say so we said to her, since she was so emotional and she actually hurt our feelings, that we should make an appointment with her and us and the principal to talk this out and not through the phone. So we ended the conversation. My colleague started crying and I was furious. We texted our principal, because he had some appointments that day and wasn’t at our school. 

I decided to get some coffee from the kitchen and relax a bit with some other colleagues who were still there before I wen’t home. The teacher still had some work to do but she wasn’t planning on staying much longer since she was exhausted from the phonecall with this mom.

half an hour later, believe it or not, that mother suddenly walked into the school. ""here I am, now I have time"" she said. So here we started talking again with this mother and my colleague and I. Mom started crying again and told us we should listen to her son more because he actually was the one getting bullied. She also said she reacted that way because she was very emotional and she said she was sorry. We also said sorry for calling her when she was at work, even though she said she could talk. She seemed a complete different person. We decided to plan a conversation with her and her husband and us and the principal. We had to make some agreements again so we  could make the year have a happy ending for the last few months. 

She went home somewhat calm. We decided to call our principal about what happened and that after we had the phonecall she showed up and talked with her.
Our principal really had our back, I really have a good relationship with him and our team, we’re one big family. He said that this bitch is probably bipolar and if she ever says things like this about us again, she can actually take her kid to another school and take her attitude with her. We still wil have a conversations with her and her husband though but it will be her last chance.

It’s so crazy to me how parents have lost faith in us as professionals. It absolutely breaks my heart. And I think it’s one of the main reasons why we’re so short in teachers and why people at a young age are getting burn-outs. I’m only 22, but this situation almost caused me to have a burn-out and I’m still on the edge… with me studying and work… it’s not easy.
Just wanted to share this story, share your thoughts if you want."

However without any uni or work I tend to just not do anything and focus too much on my hobbies -which is not a problem in itself, relaxing is important too, but if I just do my hobbies all day I feel burnt out on them as well- so I would like to just do some freelance/remote, part time job where I can make my own schedule.

I am a finance/econ student, I know programming in R, SQL, python VBA to a level that's decent in this field (+excel, powerBI)

Any advice/ideas on what could work for me? I looked at upwork and stuff, but those stuff need time to get jobs/reputation/ratings, so my timeframe is probably too short for that.

I'm from Europe."

ukmke3,3,2022-05-07,All I wanted was to be happy and normal,IlParnassoConfuso,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ukmke3/all_i_wanted_was_to_be_happy_and_normal/,"I'm not sure if I believe in God or anything spiritual, but looking back it's like my family was cursed from the start. Not even a year after my parent's marriage my maternal grandmother died suddenly in her early 40s. Three years later my paternal grandmother died, and two years later it was my paternal grandfather. By the time I was born I had only one living grandfather, but he was barely part of my life. 

I grew up hearing about how amazing my maternal grandmother was, and I dreamed about how life could've been with her. If I believed in God I would say he was nice enough to instead leave in her place her cousin, who was like my second mother growing up. Well, she passed away in november last year, just in her early 70s after years of suffering. Her death was always one of the two major conditions I had that once checked would free me to finally commit suicide, something that is daily on my mind for the last 10 or 11 years. The other was becoming blind, and my eyesight has been shit since last year. 

I knew I was different from the start, as early as 4 and 5 I would pray every night for God to please let me be a girl in my next life. I imagined myself walking into this court room made of clouds, angels sitting on where benches would be and God in the middle, where I would ask him for that. I had no ""indocrination"" in this, my parents were always conservative and never had LGBT friends. My father was always extremely masculine, and my mother had the same expectations of me. I remember when we went to the mall and bought some powerpuff girl action figures, my father was not keen on it, but my mother convinced him it was ok because it was from a cartoon we watched. 

There was one day I let it ""slip"" that there was something wrong with me. I asked my mother something, which made it obvious I felt attracted to men. She was disturbed, and told me never to repeat this again, specially around my father. I sympathize with her, I know it must not have been easy to hear that from her very young child, but at the same time I wonder how different things could have turned out if I got the help I needed so early on.

After that she was on a mission to turn me into the masculine boy I needed to be, but obviously it never worked. Any innocent comment I would make that would suggest any femininity in me would be met with dispaproving stares. Everything I wanted, said, did, though was wrong, so I just retreated back into my own little world. I had difficulties in socializing from early on, I was always painfully shy and felt uncomfortable in groups, yet instead of helping me my parents only made it worst. I remember once being in this event with a lot of kids, I played a bit on the trampoline, but as other kids joined in I just lowered my head and stepped out of it. My father noticed it and got angry at me, he only taught me to obey yet even as a 5 year old its like he expected me to be a leader once we stepped outside of the house somehow. Even the way I screamed while playing things like tag became a problem, apparently my scream was too high pitched for a 7 year old boy. I ended up policing myself to a point that now at 26 I don't even know who I am. I have a lot of emotions in me, but I hold back and do not show them, I just look like a robot most of the time. 

I haven't had any friends since I started high school. The only friend I had ditched me, so during recess I just wandered by myself in school, sat in the library reading magazines or one of the things that still hurt me to this day, when I sat outside close enough to the group of friends I wanted to be part of so I could listen to their conversation and feel just a little bit more normal. I keep remembering 15 year old me chuckling to their funny stories on my own and I just want to cry, I didnt deserved this. It was also my first time falling in love, but obviously I couldn't do anything about it. College was the same, I was the weirdo who didn't talked to any one, I didn't had any fun experiences, only interned a year before graduating and never really worked in a real place. To this day that internship remains my only job or life experience, its been 6-5 years and thats all I got to show for. 

I tried therapy in 2019 until the beginning of the pandemic. It helped me live more in the moment despite my constant anxiety about time passing, that still cripples me to this day. But it was like sweeping everything under a rug, at times I felt like she was trying to make me forget I was trans in the name of making everything easier with my parents. I lost a lot of weight and looked my best, which is not much anyway. But it became apparent I would never be able to be myself. I waited too long, puberty ruined me and I know I will never look like a woman. Transitioning would likely kill my parents and myself.

In the end of last year, my dog who was like my sister died and two days later my relative I mentioned in the start of this also died. It was my first time dealing with loss, it was like a repetition of the deaths of my grandparents before my birth where it feels like its all happening at once. My father's health has not been good and now I'm worried he's the one coming next. My mother made sure to tell me I'm killing him by not having a job, and now its all I can think that he's soon going to die and there's nothing I can do about it. That relative's biggest dream was to have her own little house, I always thought one day I would have enough money to make it happen, but now its too late.

I just know it I'm going to kill myself this year, I don't want to get any older and turn 27 with the mind, maturity and life experience of a teenager. But I wish I would have been given a fair shot. I wish I could know what it's like to be yourself, to be happy and to be able to laugh when you want, to talk to people, to have friends, to fall in love and be loved back, to kiss, to have sex, to marry, to have children, to go anywhere on my own, to no depend on others, to travel, to see the world. If I don't kill myself now I'll just continue to dissapoint and worry my parents, and when they die I will have no way to take care of myself or afford to live. Lately I keep thinking what will happen to our old photographs, will they end in a land fill? There will be no one to keep our memory alive, like we do to my grandmother by cherishing her old photos and talking about her.

If there is a God I don't think he likes me very much, but I hope he exists so there is also a heaven where I can see my relative and finally get to know my grandmother. I just hope they will forgive me for having wasted my life like this."

After looking through my school's transfer opportunities, I've settled on a school named [Wilmington University](https://www.wilmu.edu/technology/computer-science.aspx) in Deleware.

They are a small, private, non-profit university that offers a bachelor's in Computer Science. They are regionally accredited by Middle States Commission on Higher Education, although their Computer Science program is not ABET-accredited.

My question is: Realistically, how likely am I to land a Software Development job with a BS from a school of this stature? I plan on working on side projects to fill out my portfolio as well. I work full time and have a family, so an internship could be difficult for me to manage.

I'm not trying to work at FAANG, or even a big company. My goal is to break into Software Development, get my foot in the door, and use that first job as a foothold to launch off of. I just want some second opinions to see if this school is good enough that I would be able to land a job, or is the hiring climate such that my resume won't be taken seriously with this on it? I see conflicting things on if school name and prestige matters.

Some additional background: I'm pursuing a degree in CIS and decided to make the switch to Comp Sci after finishing my first year. With the CIS associates I'm pursuing, this would be the fastest way to obtain a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I could switch majors in CC to Computer Science, but I'll have to do another year there. This path would allow me to get a CS degree in 3 years.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated."
uko5d3,1,2022-05-07,How much does my college choice matter if I have work experience? (Comp Sci),ThatFlashCat,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/uko5d3/how_much_does_my_college_choice_matter_if_i_have/," I am turning 20 at the end of the month and am just about to graduate with an associates degree in computer science. I have had the incredible blessing of working part or full time, depending on season, for a local civil engineering company as an intern in IT for three years. I have gradually become their primary web developer and expect to work their full time eventually. However, I still think getting a bachelors degree would be the smartest decision even though I already have my foot in the door at my current company. My main question is how much the school I complete my degree at matters to a future employer. By the time I would graduate with a bachelor's degree, I would have 5-6 years of experience in the field I would be working in.

I am mostly a self taught individual (most of what I have learned for my associates degree has not been directly relevant to my work, though still helpful in overall understanding) and prefer online classes both for this reason and for the more open schedule. My current state of residence is Minnesota and I have completed the Minnesota Transfer Curriculum (MNTC), so transferring to a school that accepts the MNTC makes the process simpler. I have looked at UND, which is expensive ($700 per credit online), public schools like Metrostate University (cheaper than UND, but with only night classes), as well as private schools like Concordia St Paul (quite inexpensive online at $420 per credit).

For those who are in the hiring position, would my school choice make a significant difference given my work experience? Should I consider going to UND for the state school credentials or would a private school like Concordia work just as well?"

I'm writing this post as I'm thinking, so there's a chance that my sentences are going to get messy, or I'm saying the same thing over and over, but please forgive me : )

So I'm planning to transfer to either UWS CS, UWB CS, or UW Informatics. My dream is to become a software developer, and I heard a lot of people saying informatics is the go-to for someone who wants to become a software engineer. But I wanted to get some opinion from you guys. 

My questions are as follows: 

1. If you happen to go/went to Informatics, do you think there's a higher chance that I ended up with a software engineer than someone with a CS degree? 
2. How many job opportunities do you guys have compared to CS major students? 
3. What is it like to be a student in informatics? 
4. What are you guys doing there? (Classes, clubs, internships, etc.) 
5. Is there any downside for me to majoring in Informatics? 

This is my question, and thank you so much for reading this far!! Have a wonderful rest of your day ; )"

We already use Postgres in the system which can store json and query it, but there is certain resistance and some think relational approach is better for this task, so will greatly appreciate any feedback I can get since I still lack the experience to know which will be better for something like this in the long term."

ukrxjl,3,2022-05-07,I am irresponsible &amp; everything is crumbling.,BearWithAfish,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ukrxjl/i_am_irresponsible_everything_is_crumbling/,"In less than a week, I will lose my home.  I saw this coming.  Others know it is coming.  Maybe they've forgotten the timeline for it, but I haven't.  Life as a homeless person is not appealing.

I am chronically unemployed.  I have Depression and Anxiety, am medicated, but remain unactualized.  Finding work has been a struggle on many levels. A friend has been paying my living expenses, but not the property tax.  I have food, water, electricity, heat, but also a huge tax debt that I am utterly unable to pay.

Taking care of myself is a struggle.  Since my parents died, I have lived alone (except for a cat), barely able to do daily things like eat and bathe and little else.  But I'm not disabled (or not disabled enough), so I am expected to be fully functional and able to manage my life.  The truth, though, is that I am probably in need of some kind of caregiver to help me Do Life.  Even if someone was willing, I would have to accept that help, from an unrelated person (a friend?), and give up my full independance.  Clearly I cannot handle independance, though, so I can't really be trusted to manage myself.

I've already been helped by this friend for more than 2 years.  They have given me $1000 per month, every month, for basic expenses.  They have a high income and have told me that it is definitely not a hardship.  I hate it.  I hate being supported by someone this much.  I want to support myself.  I want to contribute.  I want to be worthy of costing so much money.  How do people do this?  Why do I find it so difficult?

My therapist knows all of this.  At first we were trying to help me find employment, but we stepped-back to trying to help me become more organized and confident about self-management, with some successes and some failures.  I have not made the progress I hoped for.  I am still totally supported by my friend with monthly checks.

I'm behind on all my bills right now.  I hate asking for money, but I have made myself ask every month, one month at a time, because I wanted to avoid becoming complacent.  I don't want this to become Normal.  But it's been almost THREE YEARS.  Nothing has really changed, except that my original plan - when my savings ran out - was to just kill myself, but when my friends began to suspect my plans, they confronted me, and I admitted my plans, and they convinced me that I had alternatives.  I was actually very touched at how many people came to my aid, and the totally unexpected offer of someone to just simply give me bill support money without any expectation to be repaid.  If that's not love, I don't know what is.

But three years later, here I am, in the same position, and the house is about to go on Tax Sale, then the eviction process begins.  How did I let it get this bad?  I am such an utterly irresponsible adult.  I told people that I don't know How to Adult.  My therapists insisted that I could learn, and have tried to help me.  (I get a new therapist each year at my clinic, because they are interns with a 1-year obligation.)  They have all been AMAZING counselors, and I have had some very good experiences with them, but I know that ultimately, if I want my life to change, that I am the one that must act.  I know this.  Yet I cannot.  Somehow, I cannot.  I have not.  I don't know exactly why.

I think about my cat.  If I die in this house, he will probably eat my corpse, and then he will be destroyed when they find him.  That's a horrible fate that he does not deserve.  Somehow this is more important to me than my own life.  Nobody else must suffer because of my actions.  We all die anyway, eventually, so does it matter when?  I want to live, but I don't know how.  I feel like I have no good choices.  I want an alternative, but all I see are ways for me to continue to disappoint myself.  Life is such a mixed bag of beauty and horror, and I'm not sure that one is worth the other.

And I'm afraid to talk to anyone about this because if I can't find a solution that I can live with, then I will be deprived of my only alternative by force.  I don't want to live incarcerated, completely deprived of my agency.  That would be worse than death.  I just want all of this to stop.  My life is a dumpster fire and I just want to smash it until it's nothing but tiny burning coals that eventually extinguish and are finally quiet, so I can be at peace.  What the hell is wrong inside me?"

uktaly,0,2022-05-07,What is the relationship between a computer's file system and building a project out of multiple different source files?,dcfan105,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uktaly/what_is_the_relationship_between_a_computers_file/,"TLDR: What search terms should I use to find information the relationship between a computer's file system, git/GitHub, and building a .exe from multiple C++ source and header files in an IDE, particularly Visual Studio?  Terms I've already tried; filesystems and programming, filesystems and visual studio, filesystems and project builds, filesystems and coding projects, filesystems and C++

So I keep having issues with visual studio whenever I make a new C++ project or add a new source or header file to an already existing project. Everything will look fine in visual studio but then when I try to build the project, VS complains it can't find the files I added, and so I go into file explorer and found it put the new files into the wrong folder or it created two of the same file. 

And last night, when I was working on a project, I decided to just copy/past everything from one .cpp file into another .cpp file to consolidate my code, and afterwards I rightclicked the file I'd copied from and chose “exclude from project”.  All good, right?  b
But then, when I tried to compile, it complained it couldn't find the file _I'd literally just told it to exclude_. 

At that point, I figured it'd be easier to just start a new project and add my .cpp and .h file from the first project into that one, and I put the new project into the same GitHub repository as the first, but when I tried to push to the repository from VS, it kept complaining that my local copy didn't contain stuff the remote repository did and that I should fetch and pull before pushing, but when I clicked fetch it did nothing and it greyed out pull. 

I finally gave up and made a new repository and _another_ new project and again included the files with my source code from the first.  I ended having to repeated that step again, and finally everything seems to be working (except that, when I was about to make the initial push to the new repository, it tried to include EVERYTHING from my desktop, instead of just the folder containing the project files, which was one of several folders on my desktop and I had manually tell it to ignore each of those files). 

My main concern is that I had basically no idea how to troubleshoot these problems other than to just start over.  I don't understand what the problem was and I don't even know what specific questions to ask.  
I'm reminded of this XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1597/ 

None of this was covered in my classes and even in my internship, my project lead basically just set up everything for me on my laptop, integrating VS with GitHub, cloning the project, etc., just telling me exactly what to download and exactly where to click, and what to type, without really explaining what each step was supposed to do. He explained some specific stuff when I specifically asked but not particularly well (not like he wasn't _trying_ to explain; he just isn't a particularly good communicator) and I didn't get a good mental picture of how everything was connected.

I could just start Googling stuff about filesystems, but that'll probably give me way too much information, most of which probably won't be relevant. I don't learn well by reading all about one major thing at once, hence why I don't want to just start reading about how filesystems in general work.  I do _much_ better when by learning particular things as I need them, so I was mainly hoping someone could tell me what particular concepts are relevant when it comes to troubleshooting issues like the ones I described having frequently?  I'm mainly looking for search terms I can put into Google to find relevant information."

ukypub,2,2022-05-08,I feel so alone.,LimpaLampi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ukypub/i_feel_so_alone/,"I moved to Sweden a year ago. Due to a lot of issues I haven't had the time to learn the language yet. I came to work on my Master's thesis and, together with an eating disorder battle, most of my time was taken by it. 

I feel in a better mental state now and I want to really dedicate myself to learning Swedish. Because not knowing the language is, as expected, impairing my social skills. I got an internship at an international workplace but everyone pretty much only speaks Swedish. During meetings they sometimes forget that I do not know Swedish and switch to Swedish, making me not know what is going on. I also feel like I can never participate in social interactions with my coworkers because my Swedish knowledge is very limited. Every day I come home not wanting to go back the next day. And what makes me feel even worse is that I know this is my fault. Because I was unable to dedicate myself to learning Swedish in the last year. 

Pretty soon after I arrived in Sweden I actually met a Swede who later became my boyfriend. He is the sweetest and I really love him. But I only have him to talk within here. Yesterday we were invited to his friend's party. His friend is moving to another country and this was his goodbye party. I said I would gladly attend but deep down I was sure I would feel excluded because I don't speak the language.  Some English speaking guys attended the party, and for a while I really thought I could actually socialize a bit. But alas, I was wrong. The other English speaking people moved to another room, and I stayed by my boyfriend's side in a room where everyone spoke Swedish. They actually tried to continue to speak English but got quickly excited and changed to Swedish. Even my boyfriend couldn't contain his excitement and started to gravitate more and more toward that conversation. 

I sometimes would try to say something but that would never convert into a conversation. Sometimes I would say something to my boyfriend but I think he really wanted to have a fun talk with others so I stopped and just started to scroll through my phone. My boyfriend eventually went to another room to speak with more people and I just stayed behind on my phone. Sometimes his friends would apologize for not speaking English but I would dismiss it saying that ""it is ok, it is good for me to get used to Swedish like this"" but deep inside I just said that so that they wouldn't feel bad and feel the need to carter to me out of obligation. It is also very hard to pierce into this circle because my boyfriend's friends have known each other since they are kids. So they have plenty of stories together and they speak about it a lot. And there is little I can contribute to that conversation. 

After some time, and realizing my boyfriend was not going to come back I went to another room. I joined my boyfriend and the English speaking people. But just as I was about to join the English guys are about to leave the party. And I realized that I would now be the only one not speaking Swedish. I panicked and said to my boyfriend that I needed to make a call. I went outside the house and called my parents so that I would not feel so alone. I could see how much fun everyone was having and how I was a burden to the party and especially my boyfriend in this situation. I told my boyfriend I was going home. He got sad that I wasn't enjoying the party but understood. I told him he could of course stay behind and have some more fun. He took me to the train station and said that he would join me home at 3am. But at the same time, it felt like he didn't want to stop partying at that time. So I told him that he could sleepover at his friends. He said he would still go back home. But when I was in the metro he called me saying that the party wasn't slowing down and that he would sleep over there. So I get home at 2am all by myself and start to cry. Because I feel so alone. I have no friends here. And I feel like I will never have. Even when I learn Swedish. 

I wanted so bad to have my boyfriend with me during the night. I wish I was a selfish bitch that would have ""demanded"" that he would come home. I wish he would have come since he saw that I was in such a low state. But I am not that person selfish person, or at least I try not to be. 

I am an introvert by nature. I really try to push myself and talk with people but I never come across as someone interesting or charismatic. I am just that nice person that listens to you. Whenever I try to tell stories of my life it always feel like I am boring and people would rather not listen. When I am invited to parties I start to suffer from anxiety because I know I am going to be ""that lonely girl that is oh so shy"". That person at parties that is either invisible or that people pitty because of how shy I come across. That person that usually only knows one person at the party and tries to stick to them, only to realize that that other person wants to have fun and interact with other people. And that is more than fair. Another big thing for me is that I have massive selfesteem issues regarding pretty much everything about me. So this makes me super self-aware of things. The only positive thing coming out of this is that because I am ultra self-aware not only about my but also others I try to be SUPER considerate. And I think that because I am that considerate towards everyone, I somehow expect people to be that considerate towards me. Which is wrong of me to expect from people, especially if they barely know me. This is a me issue that I really want to solve. But I need some advice. I am sorry to be venting out like this. I just don't have anyone to talk with right now. I feel kind of depressed, and definitely I feel so alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for any mistakes or if the previous text is all over the place. English is not my mother tongue. Also, just to avoid the ""your boyfriend slept over because he was going to cheat"", I highly doubt that. There were like, 2 girls at the party, and some had boyfriends of their own. And my boyfriend is a really decent guy."

I am 22 and graduated with a law degree, which I never wanted to study in the first place but had no other choice because of parental pressure. 

After trying multiple law internships and research positions in the field, I have concluded that this is not what I wish to do, with the exception of pro-Bono volunteer work that does not pay.

Throughout the years, I’ve had many interests/hobbies and various certs/diplomas from short courses or boot camps : human computer interaction, graphic design, user experience design, computing, forensic psychology, data science. I realize that this is quite a broad array of interests but I’ve recently come to the realization that what I’ve been interested in for more than a decade or so was really understanding cognition and applying it in ways that help those around me. I’ve always been drawn to social work, volunteering projects, and pro Bono as a result. 

That being said, I have no idea what field of work I should go into. My current plan is to pursue a rather renowned BSc in Psychology at my favorite European country (satisfying my wanderlust), with a minor in Neuroscience and Cognition, while attending part time boot camps for UX design or Data Science to gain employable skills, so that I could be fairly flexible with narrowing down my career field in the future. This degree opens me up to multiple Masters.

I am seeking other opinions or advice about my plan. Any input is welcome, but here are a few pressing questions on my end:

1) While money is not a problem/concern, is there a way for me to leverage my first degree + certs to pursue a part time profession for more income? 

2) Am I shooting too broadly by picking this bachelors degree? Should I go for something more technical, like UX design, data sci, comp sci?

3) How can I spend extracurriculars efficiently to maximize the benefits of studying a bachelors + masters for the next 4-5 years? I don’t want to waste my free time after uni courses milling about like I did as a 20 year old.

4) How can I do this while still living out the full extent my 20s and make my life fulfilling besides simply academic/work stuff?

Very serious advice needed Please (19-20M).,luvxd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ul0z9b/help_very_serious_advice_needed_please_1920m/,"A bit of a background about me. I am a 19(20) old guy from India. I completed my schooling in 2020 with very average marks. I was terrible at studies except English (a little).

So, since my father couldn't afford regular college (domestic student loans aren't a big thing here), I got enrolled in distance learning in a program BA(English H- I'll explain it below). Now let's begin with the issue(s). 

Firstly, I'll tell you why I elected BA. Honestly, all I can say is, I was way too immature back then. I was 18 but mindset was of a 14-15 year old kid, even until a few months ago. I just selected it because I wanted a degree, no matter what it is + I had an interest in English as I mentioned above. I didn't realise the future consequences. 

Since I got enrolled in July 2020 session, I didn't know a single thing about course/books/exams/assignments because there were no notifications from university whatsoever. Therefore, I didn't submit any assignments and spent the entire Pandemic watching TV shows and playing games.

Then came June 2021, and because of pandemic, exams got cancelled(Relief?). Students were promoted just on the basis of assignments, (huh) which I didn't submit, so, the entire year got wasted, doing what? nothing. Even then I was a clueless brat, it was like, I was in a small bubble and was jeopardizing the whole future living in that bubble. June 2020- July 2021 wasted. I really had no idea what to do with college. 

Then around october 2021, a silver lining, my elder sister approached me ""do you wanna apply for Canada? I'll fund your ed and rest we'll take student loan"" Now, for an immature kid like me, this was like a bag of gold. I instantly agreed because why not. 

While the college is getting ruined, I started to look for options abroad, contacted consultants, and many consultants assured me to appear for IELTS, your application will get selected, study gap won't be an issue (for 2022 intake). It took another 2 months for passport. Eventually, I got an exam date of January 2022. 

A little twist, 2 days before exams I got seriously ill and had to reschedule it in Feb. Then, I gave my exam and scored 7.5 Bands (Achievement?). But I didn't feel any major happiness. I reverted to all those consultants and... Here comes a turnaround, every single one of them refused. They stated that the profile is weak and you should go for hospitality (lmao - no offence to hospitality buddies). That was the major reality check for me. Another year wasted...

So, the maturity which should've come to me in 2020 came 2 years later and since March 2022, my pea brain started to grasp some things, I started to get negative thoughts, I started to cry, my appetite got lost, no feelings apart from regret and agony, I started to think how big of a failure I am, how I fucked my career. 

Instantly, I looked for college assignments and submitted them in the next 15 days. Fortunately, I applied for a content writing internship (1month) and got selected, but still I didn't feel any major happiness. 

Now, I am 19 will be 20 in Sept 2022. My exams are in June 2022. So technically, I just wasted an year, right? But did I? I chose a course that is nothing but a dead end. I realise this now. Everyday, I just spend entire time searching about what are the options and all I see is writer/teaching. No way I am capable of them. 

I am broken, alone since years, no interests, no passion, no energy, no money. I am now thinking to start a fresh bachelor's (BBA/B.com) again from distance (money) which will get completed in 2025. But I am confused as hell cause I am already about to be 20 and have no college experience, no life experience, nothing. I'll finish college in 23 when all my earlier mates would've already finished it. I am  frightened, I have no friends, I haven't left home since 3 years, I don't talk to anyone. I am scared whether I should start a new degree or just continue with this.


Please any sort of ""serious"" advice would be appreciated. Please avoid punchy one liners if possible. Any other update I'll mention in comments."

We unfortunately found out my mother has cancer in March. So I had to leave my Intel internship (and lost my full time job offer there consequently) to care for her full time. Now ,when my mom gets better (Hopefully around August as that is when her intense treatments end), I will have to look for a job. But August is too late for most companies to hire a fresher. To add to all this, I will not be in the right headspace to LC grind or build my github portfolio or do anything work related until my mom gets better. Are there companies out there that will hire me in August? How do I go about my situation ? Also, I'm planning on applying for masters in fall 23(assuming my mom's health will be fine by next year that is). Any and all suggestions and thoughts are appreciated."
ul3lii,76,2022-05-08,Lost all the motivation to work? What now? ( Dont read this if you're down yourself),casual_sinister,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ul3lii/lost_all_the_motivation_to_work_what_now_dont/,"I'm on an internship and my supervisor never gets back to my messages on time. Almost always he makes me wait for days! This has sucked all my motivation away and I hate to keep waiting. There was a time when I would do something productive while I wait, but of late, I have lost all the motivation / self-discipline to even do that ( he has stopped replying me altogether now :// )

Its hard for me to continue doing this. And, I just feel so unmotivated and even the basic tasks like reading a simple 6 page document is taking me literal days. I keep procrastinating stuff ( I guess I learnt this from my supervisor). I feel like I have lost myself and this is affecting all areas of my life including my relationships, and it is painful to see this process happening right in front of my eyes and I'm a mere spectator of my own life. 

I brought this issue more than 4 times in my one-on-one's with my manager ( who's different than the supervisor) and they basically said something which boils down to, ""yeah, that guy is known to be super busy, we cant do much about it"". But still, it got better after I complained, and my PRs were getting reviewed, and I was getting feedback, etc. However, that guy, has stopped replying to any of my messages now, and this is just so unprofessional and I cant do nothing about it. I'm just stuck here and the only thing I'm getting out of this is, I can use the money I earn from this to partially pay my student loans. 

Things started getting worse from work, and now it has seeped into relationship, and overall I'm not in a good mental state. I badly want to disconnect from this and take a break, from work from relationships and like shit, this is a lot. My procrastination was never this bad. I used to accomplish things on a daily basis. And now my summer classes start this week, and the only thing I can think about now is going on a vacation - back to my home country.

How do I get myself out of this situation and get back to who I once was........"

I have a very solid sophomore internship w a major central bank in nyc for this summer, but ik I don’t want to be in gov work in the future so I want to play it smart while looking around elsewhere. 
My school also is very expensive being in nyc and I have to take on debt to be here, with the education not being to great for it. I have the option to: 

1) stick it out at this school, do my best. Networking is easier as I’m actually in ny here, idk if I would have gotten my internship if I was home in md 

2) go to my home school of UMD that has better econ program and will be less expensive. Less network opportunities for ny firms and offices. But I’ll have to take another semester off bc of their application process. 

Along with where I’ll study I’m torn on my recruiting. 
 
Should I just do another sophomore internship next summer then build off of that one? Or try to squeeze into the 2023 SA class? I’ve seen some apps that take winter24 and some that don’t 

How much more important is program rank than location of the school? 

Should I do 2 sophomore internships? Or shoot for sa23 and see what happens 
Lmk if I can give anymore details, I’d appreciate any comments"

I managed to get a short internship, but it didn’t lead to anything.

I recently moved out of my parents house (late IK, but I’m proud I finally did it) and moved to Austin, TX which I’m told is full of opportunity.

I got a job as an event coordinator because the job description made it sound like marketing would be involved.

I’ve been at the job about 2 months now and I don’t like it and I’m not good at it. But now I have bills to pay, so I can’t just quit.

I’ve been applying to advertising/ marketing jobs in the city and I’ve done a lot of interviews, but I never get the job. I got one, but then did more research online and found out it was most likely a scam, so I turned it down.

I’m starting to think that an office job might not even be for me. I’d like to do something outdoors, but I can’t seem to find anything that pays a living wage.

I’ve considered so many jobs over the years because my interests are all over the place. Animation, graphic design, video editing, rock climbing instructor, high-rise window washer (for the views/ I love heights), video editor, photographer, flight attendant (so I can travel), etc.

I just feel like I’m failing to make the transition between youth and adulthood. 

I know the things I enjoy are, being active, being outdoors, helping others, and being creative.

I also know that I want a good work/ life balance and a relatively low-stress environment.

I don’t care about making a lot of money tbh, I just want to find something I enjoy that pays a livable wage (at least $30,000).

If anyone knows a job that sounds like it would fit any of that criteria, please let me know.

If not, then some words of encouragement would be nice right now.

Thank you!


TLDR: I’ve disliked every job I’ve had because they’ve been too stressful and uninteresting to me. I’m trying to find a career to pursue before I’m too old to change what I do.

I don’t need to make a ton of money, I just want to find something meaningful and low-stress that pays at least $30,000 so I can pay my bills.

I have a BS in Advertising, I’d really appreciate any advice.

Thank you!"

ul8qkr,1,2022-05-08,"New to this adulting thing, feeling lost, lonely, and scared",capricious-suspicion,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ul8qkr/new_to_this_adulting_thing_feeling_lost_lonely/,"I (23F) graduated from college in may 2021. My sister was kind enough to let me stay with her in a new town for the last year while I hunted for a job - I found an internship in February and have been told that I will be given a full time position offered to me by the end of this week. This position is fully remote, is in the field I'm interested in, and at a great company that I'm excited to be at. (The job also pays really well, especially for someone my age, so I'm not struggling too much there.)

I've been applying for apartments in this crazy market, but because I work remotely, I am not tied to any location. My family has all encouraged me to stay in the state I currently live in (which I don't particularly love, but I'm not fully against it. I've decided on staying at least a year to fully get on my feet). Unfortunately, this housing market is the worst it's ever been, I have no friends nearby, and have no idea where to move. I've also never lived without roommates, so I'm completely lost on what to look for/avoid. I have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and PTSD from a car accident I was in a handful of years ago, so driving makes me anxious. I have been to therapy and take medication, but it's still a big part of my life that affects me daily. Because of this, I am highly sensitive and aware of noise, struggle with the idea of living in a large complex with a lot of people, and am terrified of moving to a highly congested city (scary driving). 

On top of this, my boyfriend of 6 months and I split up yesterday. We met online and hadn't met yet (planned to meet in August after saving a bit, had already gotten tickets). The time difference made things hard (he's in Australia, while I'm in the states), but most importantly, just didn't seem to be compatible. I am highly anxious and sensitive, while he is more care free and a bit ignorant (for the best and worst) and would promise to change things, but never did, making me anxious that he didn't care, or x, y, or z. We were equally at fault, I have come to terms with the fact that the breakup was for the best, but I can't help but feel that my anxiety played a big role in splitting us up, and that scares me.

The breakup was mutual, but I truly did love him, and he I. I already miss him a lot and am afraid I just lost out on something amazing. I come from a family that expects marriage young (I have 5 siblings, all married before 22). I've been told growing up that I would likely end up alone, and I was encouraged to enter the tech field (which I did) because I would ""need the money to support myself. You won't have a man there to help you"". So I'll be in a new area where I don't know anybody while also working from home + not having any way of meeting new people nearby. At this point, I'm afraid that my mother was right in saying I'd likely be alone forever. But that honestly and truly doesn't sound like any way to live, and I can feel myself slipping into a dark mindset.

I don't usually post on reddit, but maybe some outside perspective will be helpful in this case."

This has been something I have been contemplating for a bit and I’m honestly very unsure of which route to take. I am a computer science student with no experience in the field. I honestly don’t even know what I should be working on improving/what skills to be honing, etc. 

Anyway, I am a student. With a full time customer service job where I am increasingly miserable. Every day just gets worse and I dread being there more and more. So, I applied to several places: internships and jobs. 

I recently interviewed for two positions. I feel the interviews went very well, and I was to expect a call tomorrow from both. 

The internship is at the mayor’s office, making about the same rate I currently make hourly. It is further, though. I feel it can help me feel prepared in the field or at least something more professional. I have two years left of school. 

The job is a remote position, also customer service oriented in a banking company. Higher wage than I currently make. 

I feel the internship will give me good experience and look good on a resume. It is only 2.5 months. The job can give me an quick out of my job that I hate and I get to work from home. 

I’m not sure what is the right choice. 

What would you guys do?

Thanks in advance for any advice and insight!"

ul9vq4,0,2022-05-08,I work at an incredibly disorganized unicorn startup. How do I stop stressing about my job and think about it less?,electricguitar146,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ul9vq4/i_work_at_an_incredibly_disorganized_unicorn/,"I recently joined a unicorn startup. It's a very popular, up and coming company in my industry (entertainment/media) and it's more than double what I made at my past job, up in the six figures range. I'm 24 years old and only have two years of real work experience beyond my internships in college. So if any of this is really standard and not worth a post, blame my lack of experience.

From the outside, it looked like a fast growing titan that was acquiring companies left and right and hiring around 10-20 people per week. They went from 60 employees to over 1,000 in just two years. They recruited top executives from legacy media brands and tech companies like CBS, NBCUniversal, Google, Facebook, etc. to fill out c-suite roles. They also recently received a nine figure investment from Softbank and had all the big magazines from Forbes to Business Insider talking about them. So needless to say, I was beyond excited to get the offer and join them.

But fast forward to now - I've been here for two weeks and in a lot of ways, it's a disorganized mess. I work on a team with employees from one of their recently acquired companies. It seems that no one in upper management is really aware of the details of the merger. No one can tell me when it's going to be finalized or what changes we can expect. The product that they launched did great in Asia before the acquisition, but it's struggling to get any traction in the US market (granted, it has only been like 3 months).

Someone I just started working with mentioned that he was concerned that they were going to axe our team because they haven't gotten a return on their investment yet. I think it's still incredibly early for that and they just recently hired 7 new people onto the US team to push the offering in the US market. So I think he's being sort of paranoid.

I told this all to one of my career mentors, and he asked why I cared so much? He said that a lot of those higher level decisions like the finalization of the acquisition were out of my control and I should just be a good toy soldier and follow orders. I should just come in, do the job I was assigned, get my paycheck, and go home without overthinking everything. He said all these things were just normal startup growing pains and as long as I get a paycheck coming in every two weeks, don't shit in the punchbowl.

I think that is fantastic advice, but how does it look in practice? How do I accept that certain struggles we have are out of my hands and just show up and do the job I was hired to do? How do I stop caring so much and stressing out about this job?

**TL;DR - I just started a high paying job at a unicorn startup that looked very cool from the outside but turned out to be a disorganized mess on the inside. I find myself worrying about the financial situation of the company and my job security a lot. How do I care less about it and just accept that it's not my job to care about certain things? How do I just turn my brain off and do the job I was assigned to do?**"

**Extracurriculars/Activities:** robotics, research internship at local university, math team, student-run nonprofit director, fundraising competition, founded school club, personal programming project, and a couple club leadership positions.

**Awards/Honors:** 2 state level robotics awards and a few more minor awards.

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** most of my essays were done last minute, but I think they turned out alright. My LORs were from my former APCSA teacher, which my college counselor said was really good, and from my AP Bio teacher/robotics coach, which I think was average. I only had 2 interviews, for Cornell and Olin; both weren't that good because I was really nervous.

*Acceptances:*

* Purdue (EA)

Georgia Tech (EA): deferred -&gt; waitlisted

*Rejections:*

Cornell (ED)

**Additional Information:**

Overall I'm happy with my decisions, surprisingly with getting rejected from Cornell ED too, as it would've costed a lot. Also, do you guys think UWaterloo was the right choice? I mainly chose it because of it being the cheapest option by a lot, excluding my state schools, and the co op program. Thanks!"

For some context, I have taken a data structures and algorithms class and implemented most data structures myself.

I had a really shitty internship last summer, and totally neglected getting anything for this summer. Since I will be graduating in the Fall of next year, would companies consider me for a summer internship next summer? Or since I would be a ""super senior"" it might be a hindering factor? I really need to get something otherwise I'm going to drive myself crazy not knowing if I'm qualified for a good entry level job after I graduate."
ulcip7,2,2022-05-08,To Mom,batmanfan90,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ulcip7/to_mom/,"Why? Why!? WHY?! Why do you have to make my life 10 times more irritating and angry as it has to be!? You aimlessly punish me and talk to me like I’m half my fucking age. You try to boss me around like I’m a little kid who will do everything you want. I WONT!! You disappoint me as a parent, you’ll probably see this too because you love to invade my fucking privacy as if it doesn’t fucking matter. 

Why is it me that has to take the fall when Sams being a fucking retard?! He’s the one who doesn’t understand how strong I am compared to him, not me. I know I’m a strong compared to him, I don’t care. If he wants to hit me I will hit him back. If he hits me hard I will hit back harder. If he wants to hurt me he will feel PAIN. He’s the one who underestimates me. 

Why don’t you fucking punish him more often too?! He’s going around the house being an emo little piece of shit that amounts to nothing, annoying the fuck out of me but you just turn a blind eye and go “I didn’t see shit” or “warning Sam”. You don’t talk to me with respect but I need to talk to you like your a fucking queen because if you don’t you throw a hissyfit and take my phone away. And if I throw a hissyfit I get my phone taken away. SO FUCKING FAIR AM I RIGHT?!?!? 

You don’t fucking change either. If your reading this you probably think I’m just overreacting and being emo or some shit because Im just a teen right? Shut up. Im under-reacting if anything because I just act like everything’s fine and this bullshit of you making my life irritating as fuck is the norm when it hasn’t been for most of my life. I don’t know where all this bullshit is coming from but I don’t give a flying fuck about it. What I fucking care about is that whatever it is your taking it out on me and FOR WHAT??!!! Am I the dysfunctional kid to you?!? The one who always gets in trouble and never listens? Even though I shouldn’t be in trouble at all. 

Oh and stop fucking trying to teach me how to train. I wont fucking take fitness advice from you or David ever. Why? Because I did so for a year and made barely any progress. Now that I know how to train and program you want to tell me how to train because your older or something. Shut up. Your not a serious trainee. You watch YouTube videos during training about whatever the fuck your into, you don’t progress in the gym, you do stupid exercises, you don’t train hard at all, and it’s no surprise you look like a marshmallow. And I know that’s your natural body structure or some excuse you like to say but come on, your really telling me you can’t do better then that?! And I’m supposed to take advice from you?! I’m way stronger and on my way to getting way bigger, and you have the audacity to claim that I’m going to hurt myself or some bullshit, when in reality, you don’t realize how little you know about training. And then you tell me to go to David about advice when David, oh let’s get to HIM. 

The only reason he is big is because he has the genetics to be big, he trains hard, and dirty bulked his way there. But he does these little pussy-half-reps and only trains chest and arms, no back or legs. For someone who’s supposedly been training for longer then I existed it is surprising how little he knows and how utterly stupid he is when it comes to training. Spewing out 1980s muscle magazine bro science as if it’s fact because he heard it from someone. Neither of you look like you lift. David has too much fat to see any of you muscle and you mom have no muscle. So shut up. You should be taking advice from me if anything, at least I look like I’m healthy. 

And do you ever shut the ever loving fuck up about my hair to? It’s mine, not yours. You don’t ever tell anyone like Jayden or Sam or David to cut it short so why me. Because it looks greasy supposedly even when it doesn’t? Shut the fuck up. Stop telling me to get a haircut when I don’t plan to. I want to have longer hair and I’m not going to listen to you about this shit. I will not put massive handfuls of that stupid head and shoulders in my head because the way it makes my hair look is unacceptable AND YOU CANT FUCKING EVEN STYLE THAT. So just shut up. 

Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. 
Just shut the fuck up. SHUT UP!!! SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH FOR ONCE!!! GO SCREAM AND TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE LIKE THEY’RE A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ONCE, NOT ME!!!!

Good fucking god sometimes it feels like I don’t even love you anymore with how much you anger me. I know you love me but it feels like you never show it. I know you care about me, you’ve been there with me through all of my worst moments and times in life. But I carry this weight on my chest now that makes me not want to open up to you or anyone besides Christina or my intern about my problems. I don’t know where I got it from. But I know I can’t tell you this to your face because of how much it would hurt you. Part of me hopes you don’t find it but if your reading this that means you did. 

I swear I need at least a few weeks if not months away from you by now. All I feel when I see your face sometimes is annoyance and rage and hate. Because I need time to deal with all this pent up anger towards you and David and Sam and every single thing in my life that just fucks me over again and again and again and AGAIN!!! 


And you have the gall to say I should show that I care about you, that I’m emotionless and selfish.  

But I can’t FUCKING show you I care about you  because you make it difficult to when it feels like all you do is annoy and anger and fucking irritate me to no fucking end at all!!! FUCK YOU!!!!!! 

It’s no fucking wonder dad hated being with you sometimes, YOUR A NIGHTMARE!!!!! YOU CAUSE ENDLESS ANNOYANCE AND ANGER AND EXPECT US TO TREAT YOU LIKE A FUCKING QUEEN YOU STUPID WITCH!!!! I have no idea how David puts up with you and this shit.

I don’t even want you in my life right now sometimes. 

We probably can’t fix this. We’ll continue to go to bed angry, wake up, act like everything’s fine and let the cycle start all over again the next day. 

I hate your stupid rules and refuse to follow them, I hate the way you talk to me, I hate the shit you say to me sometimes about school or friends, I hate how you scream at me and cry in front of me when I never caused it, and your only doing it to get attention and guilt trip me and manipulate me. 

You hate my hair and my interests and the way I talk and the way I act around others. You hate when I don’t let my younger siblings boss me around. I am Sam’s brother, not his friend and I will not talk to or treat him as such. Jayden is not my brother, and as long as he’s like this I refuse to call him that. I care about Jayce, I care about Kaiya, I have trouble caring about Sam, and I don’t care about Jayden. You hate the way I can’t do perfect in my classes even though you should know I can’t get straight As. 
I’m done with this.

I argue because I don’t want to be powerless. I was powerless and accepted it for the majority of my life but as soon as I started standing up for myself, you hate it, especially when it’s against you.


We probably need therapy to fix this by now, it’s been months in the making. But considering how you talk to me, that’s not going to happen. Because I’m just being an asshole arguing with you right? 

No.

Just shut up.

I think we both need time.
Time to deal with our shit and get along.
Time to be better to the other, to stop screaming and arguing with the other. 
But that’s time we don’t have.

Fuck you."
uldc02,5,2022-05-08,Horrible teaching internship gone wrong; student banned for mental illness,Sammytheeshark,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/uldc02/horrible_teaching_internship_gone_wrong_student/,"Last August I started by teaching internship. I was teachers aide and a substitute teacher before. I had dreamed of being a teacher for a long time. So when the local school district asked if I wanted to do a paid internship, I was beyond excited. I would have four weeks with the host teacher and then I would take over. 

I started going to the school before my internship and attended the orientation. The teachers could not stop talking about horrible the principal was and how everyone hated her. This made me fearful because I would be taking over a class at the school. The teachers complained that the principal was a perfectionist and only cared about test scores. I was a brand new teacher, I knew that things would not go perfectly and I was shy. 

As soon as I met the host teacher, she told me how awful the principal was and how much she hated her. The principal had made her switch grade levels while 8 months pregnant to a grade she has never taught before. I was not happy about this because I was expecting to be well prepared before the host teacher left.  

I taught one time, and then the host teacher told me to observe the rest of the time. I complained to my university but they said I could do anything for 12 weeks. I grew to despise this teacher because of the way she talked about her students. She called them fat behind their back and let them basically do whatever they wanted in the class. The kids were jumping roping and wrestling during indoor recess. She also told me to allow kids with disabilities to sleep all day. 

When I took over, I could barely work the technology from having to observe for four weeks and I asked the other teacher for help to hear “it’s not fair I have to help you”. I was not given any help by my university and was confused. I was also dealing with no classroom management or planning with the other teachers. It felt like the internship from hell but it was only the beginning.

The school had a meeting for kids who were falling behind. I had never been to this kind of meeting nor did I  collect the data. I was expected to present the data at the meeting, so I asked the other teacher for help and she replied “just read the paper”. I watched other teachers present data and learned what I needed to say, but when it got to the last question I did not have that certain strategy in place and was not going to lie about it. The principal just kept repeating the question like I was dumb. I was almost in tears and told her I was confused.  

At that point the humiliation triggered my PTSD. It was like my brain hit a switch. My memory was fuzzy and I was having trouble concentrating. I even told the other teachers something is wrong with my brain. I did not know what else to do and my university told me I couldn’t switch internships. I complained to my clinical supervisor and she tried to talk to the principal. The principal pretty much lied to my boss and tried to make me look bad. Hello principal from hell. I was even told to lie about it from another teacher. Six teachers also apologized for the principals actions. So I asked the local school district for help. 

They provided a mentor and she was going to help me, so I thought. I was a masters level student with additional classes and a masters paper where I had to complete an Edtpa. I did not expect the extra work load this Mary poppins mentor was going to give me. 

Mary Poppins was a retired principal and expected a lot. I gave it my best because I wanted to be a good teacher and do what was best for the class. She literally worked me around the clock and wanted me to listen to teaching podcasts on the way to work. She expected me to have 8 pages worth of lesson plans a week and expected me to take 6 hours doing it every weekend plus the hours grading. I had two babies at home that never slept. The stress was killing me. 

I was having insomnia every night, throwing up every morning, losing weight, no appetite, tunnel vision, derealization, body pains and extreme anxiety. I had enough I reached out to my school about my mental health and they did nothing or told me to tough it out. I could not take the pain any longer so I went to the mental hospital. 

At the mental hospital, they diagnosed me severe major depressive disorder. I also received a call from the local school district asking if I wanted to switch internships. My school also called me and said there is other options. 

I left the mental hospital in a slightly better state and was excited I might be able to graduate. I was in severe pain and didn’t think I could handle teaching and being a student. So I called HR of the local school district the first business day after I left the hospital. There was no answer. My therapist had called the principal and told her I was going to the hospital and didn’t know when or if I would be coming back. The principal pretended to be concerned. Back to after I got out of the hospital, my school wanted the manager to talk to me the next day. My university mentor told the manager that she speaks highly of me. I was confused to what that meant like I was lying about needing to go to the mental hospital. I lost 15 lbs and could barely sleep. 

After I talked to the manager, she said I could switch internships. When I hung up the phone I got an email from the principal saying she was firing me for not communicating. That was a lie, I hadn’t left yet and my university clinical supervisor told me to wait to tell the principal until I knew what was doing. I then get a phone call from the manager saying I had to withdraw because I abandoned the school but to get an appeal for being sick or “whatever”. I told her the university’s guidance lead to me being fired and she replied her biggest concern is I didn’t tell them I was going to the hospital. How about my life? The local school district felt the same way. 

The next day after getting fired, I get a call from hr from the school district. She answers with “what happened? You looked fine to me.” I told her I was having anxiety and went to the hospital. She replied with, “well I was talking with everyone and we think you went to the hospital just to switch internships, which is BEYOND unprofessional.” The reasons I went to that hospital are legally confidential. HR was not a doctor nor did she know my past or my diagnosis. I didn’t even know what to say to that, you should have seen my dads face when I was leaving and heard my sister begging me not to go. I just wanted to be able to sleep and eat.  I replied, “okay”. She then BANNED me from teaching in the school district. I started to cry at this point, she then said, “you don’t sound good, but you still didn’t communicate with the principal”. “I think you should take a break and are banned from the school district until next semester.” I broke at this point and had to go back to the hospital. What they did is illegal, mental disorders are a disability and I should have been given accommodations not punished because I asked for help. It took a lot of strength to report this to the head of HR, where I received an apology. 

If this ever happens to you or discrimination or any kind please report it to HR and the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and report these incidents. Your voice matters."

I chose int studies bcos I am interested in the subjects and the course (i was also thinking of working internationally in the future plus i get to learn a language), I also chose applied corporate management as a back up business degree (for practicality) and because it offers 3 terms for internship. If ever I decided to continue the degree, i will end up with two degrees and 3 internship experiences plus immersion in my first degree.

I have no dream course nor dream career in mind as of now so my thinking is that taking up a double degree will open up more opportunities for me to explore. I can still drop my other degree naman if I decided I don't want to pursue it anymore. Honestly, the only thing stopping me is the number of years I have to spend on college and the overthinking if it's worth it in the long run (i would like to be financially independent as soon as I can)

tl;dr: is taking up a 6 yrs double degree program (can graduate with two degrees and 4 internship experiences) a smart choice for someone who doesn't know what they want for their career path?"

Where to begin when you feel so far behind?,TheRealSassyTassy,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ulfnu9/help_where_to_begin_when_you_feel_so_far_behind/,"Hello! I am a new grad who did the majority of my studies from 2017-2021 (important in a moment). Due to the global pandemic, my internships were cancelled, and the quality of my CS education plummeted. While I did fine in my classes, I feel confident in my basic knowledge from the beginning of my CS degree and very little else. With that being said, I desperately want a job working in the video game industry, preferably as a programmer. 

So now for the questions, what do I need to learn to get into this field? Is there a leetcode-style service for game development? I’m supposed to build a portfolio of finished projects, but what do I use to host my portfolio, and how can I get recruiters to look at it? 

And finally, are there any resources you recommend for someone fresh and starting out in this field? Things you would do differently if you could go back and start over?

ulfzlh,3,2022-05-08,Next steps after college?,rainjays,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ulfzlh/next_steps_after_college/,"So, I realize that this sub gets these questions a lot, but I'm hoping for some tailored advice based on the context I'll provide below. 

I went to a university that doesn't specialize in STEM or anything like that, so when I majored in IT I knew I wasn't gonna get a super in-depth course of study. I went with it anyway for other reasons (not going to get into detail there, would probably doxx myself), and focused mostly on coding courses. Ultimately, I regret not switching to a CS major but stuck with IT because switching would have delayed my graduation by a semester (and added more debt). Ironically, my IT-specific courses all sucked and I learned nothing from them, one even was basically an automatic A with a professor that would rather talk about their personal life than teach. So that's fun, lol.

My coursework focused on Python--basics, data structures, algorithms, etc.--but I also took a course that had us study (albeit briefly) other OOP languages. I started learning to code with Java in high school, and began to learn C# independently via Unity. Basically, I can figure out basics in most of the common OOP languages, and understand at least some generic OOP concepts. I've made text based card games, auto-emailers, programs to transform data from one type or another, edit files. I worked with a kids tech summer camp where I taught kids how to make games in Python using Pygame. I also learned a bit about machine learning with the same company. 

But I don't really have any practical workplace skills in programming. I've never used Django, or Flask, Agile, Scrum, Angular, React, Spring Boot, AWS... kind of just word vomiting all the skills I see listed on job applications that we never even *mentioned* in school. I did one ""coding test"" for an internship and totally bombed it--don't do well in practice ones either. 

I know a lot of advice is generally ""Just practice more"", but I'm not sure how to approach practicing these new skills I know nothing about, and would appreciate some jumping off points. 

TIA"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

ulhf8a,6,2022-05-08,what should I take as my last few cs classes?,andrewczr,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ulhf8a/what_should_i_take_as_my_last_few_cs_classes/,"Hey all,

I am nearing the end of my 3rd year at UW Seattle, and my 2nd year in the CS major. I only need 2 more CS credits to graduate with my BS, so I have a tough decision to make. I could simply take an easy CS class and dip out with my degree and start working, or, I could stay one more or all 3 quarters to continue taking CS classes that may be valuable in the future. I was hoping someone could give me advice on what path to take, and if there are classes that someone might consider ""must-take"" for a CS undergrad; a class that they found useful in their career or thoroughly enjoyed taking. I am pretty much at the point where I am confident that I am ready for industry, but I don't want to be completely inept in a skill that I should have learned in school.

Currently, I have taken:

* CSE 311, 312: Foundations of Computing 1 and 2  
introduction to logic and building proofs, counting and discrete/continuous probability (some stuff on probabilistic data structures which I enjoyed).
* CSE 331: Software Design and Implementation  
mostly stuff on code-correctness and made a small full-stack application that showed shortest paths of getting to and from certain buildings on campus (Java backend, HTTP protocol for API calls to a web page in tsx react).
* CSE 332: Data Structures and Parallelism (lol I bet you expected algorithms)  
Implemented several different DSs in java and, learned what DSs to use in different situations (ren-times, memory usage, etc.), the whole shabang. Also touched on parallelism.
* CSE 333: Systems Programming  
C, C, C++, and more C++. Coding 400+ lines/week in various exercises and projects
* CSE 340: Interactions Programming  
Built android applications with accessibility features.
* CSE 344: Data Management  
basically learned SQL and how relational DBs worked.
* CSE 351: HW SW interface  
learned the basics of C, assembly, how memory, caches, processes, etc. worked.
* CSE  391: Sys and Software tools  
Just learned Linux
* CSE 421: Introduction to Algorithms  
Designing and proving algorithms (Stable matching, lots of graph stuff, DP, NP complete estimation, etc.)
* CSE 444: DB System Internals  
Learning more in-depth functionality of a database manager, implementing our own DBMS that reads/writes data to disk, handles concurrency/transactions, join algorithms, etc.)
* CSE 446: ML  
Learned the math behind different ML models and implemented them in python (numpy, pandas)
* CSE 461: Introdution to Computer Comm. Networks  
Learn about all layers of the internet (Application, Transport, Network, Link, Physical) with more detail on the top 4 (TCP, UDP, Routing, Forwarding, HTTP, DNS, lots of terminology)

Personal experience:

* Coded centroiding algorithms in C++ for a star-tracker at my school's satellite lab
* Created a 2D Unity game in C#
* Currently creating an IOS app with the Expo CLI (self-teaching JS)

Work Experience:

* Rainforest internship (AWS-Elastic Block Storage), created APIs on a newer tech stack to deprecate an older, more expensive service (returning SU 2022)

I enjoyed the work I did on my internship and would love to continue working in API development. For the most part, my experience is with the backend, but I could see myself becoming a full-stack programmer if I keep creating projects that utilize more of the front-end.

My grades have been pretty good (around Q3), I have taken all classes that I had a desire to try out, and I am not all that attached to the ""college experience"".

Also, here's a list of course offerings from my school [https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/](https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/)  


Please lmk what yall think, any advice/conversation is valuable and appreciated, thanks in advance.

TLDR: I can graduate 2 quarters early, have more time to prepare for interviews, and start working OR I can stay to take more potentially valuable classes. Looking for advice"

Tarrki had received a call from the Exik. Making sure to look around, the coast seemed clear as he dashed into the bathroom and locked the door. Tentatively, Tarrki answered. K'k'r spoke in the Exik's clicks and hums.


""So, I have discovered much about this new species. They are very aggressive, I'm sure you've noted, at least when taken as a wider species."" Tarrki nodded his head. It was a contradiction that seemed to define humanity. 


""Now, as for why? First, I need to give you a rundown on basic xenopsychology. *Every* alien species has a great enemy,"" he began. ""For your kind, it was the persistence predators that hunted you without end. The very reason your civilizations started was to defend against the horrors that pursued you until your industrial age. For the embuos, each early civilization had an enemy in the lumbering horrors that wandered the planet. 


Each leviathan predator was able to devastate an entire city on its own, and as such, there simply were no resources to *spare* on any kind of enmity between their fellow embuos. Their specie's underground burrow cities joined and connected over time, and their defenses started to focus on defending from the smaller, more numerous pack predators. Of course, this 'great enemy' is not always a predator. For us Exiks, it was the endless strife for water on our barely-habitable home planet. But humanity? They didn't *have* a great enemy. They had *many*. Predators. The desert sun. The arctic night. Volatile weather. Famine. Dehydration. Natural disasters. Disease. Nature's poisons. And, through the slow process of survival of the fittest, eventually, eachother. Humanity didn't *have one* struggle. They had *all* of them…""


""Wait, wouldn't that make them more likely to band together?"" Tarrki inquired.


""Indeed. You will find that humans are some of the most loyal creatures in the wider galaxy. Many of them will care for any creature that they think cares back, unconditionally, and their familial bonds, while hard to make, are almost impossible to break. But they have and always will see enemies. Even where there are none. Even in their fellow humans. Even in their *allies*. 


It is their fundamental nature. And I imagine, even now, that they struggle to trust *you*.""

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which he had ejected an escape pod from to go hunt down pirates, but was now hurtling towards the surface of a planet alongside both the aforementioned pirate ship, and the ship he had just left. Oh, and slowly coming to the realization that his government put a motherfucking bounty or some shit on him. But that was shit he could worry about *later*.


""Warning. Missile lock,"" the machine warned. 


""Since when the hell do they have missiles???"" Ryan shouted.


""Would you like to enact evasion procedures?"" the system asked politely. Ryan looked around, spotting the now-flashing button that said ""evade missile"". He slammed the button. Almost immediately, he was slammed into the ceiling with Derrissi as thrusters fired downwards, flares fired off, and evidently a parachute was cut loose. The pod rocketed downwards.


""Warning. Missile identified as nuclear projectile,"" it warned. *What???* ""Brace for shockwave.""


_


Gexie listened carefully with his head to the floor.


""Hey, Agent? Guess who's in that pod?"" one of the humans questioned. ""It's the kid you were hunting on the ship,"" he explained. ""Ryan, or whatever the fuck his name was.""


""What???"" the older voice questioned aloud. His sprinting footsteps echoed through the floor. ""Lock on!"" he demanded. 


""Sorry, boss. Kid's out of range of all our weapons. Railguns still eat the full effect of drag when the target's ten miles away.""


""...We have one weapon.""


""What, the nuke?"" he chuckled. A pause followed.


""Wait, the nuke? You wanna *nuke* this kid?"" 


""I don't see a *better* use for it.""


""Humanity's second-most-lethal weapon right next to FTL bombs, and you're gonna use it on this kid?""


""Yes. Yes I am.""


Gexie didn't like any of what he just heard. *Why in th' fuck're they nukin' Ryan??? What th' hell did he do???* They had locked him into the medbay, and until now, he hadn't much felt any good reason to test the lock's efficiency. Until now. 


He punched the door with two arms as hard as he could manage, using his explosive muscles. The chunk of metal flew off of its hinges. Gexie slid out into the hallway that appeared to double as a bunk room, hearing faint mutters and commands from the conversation that he had just stopped listening to. *Well, I did not think this through very well.* No doubt they heard him crunch their door like sheet metal. The footsteps confirmed it, and Gexie looked around for a place to hide. 


He didn't have much… except for an offhand comment he remembered Ryan making, once or twice… *Well. Here goes nothin'.""

Nikolai let the door open, keeping Mila up and ready to fire. The door to the medbay had been violently thrown off of its hinges. He scanned the room, spotting nothing. 


""Move up."" Dmitri watched his back as he carefully stalked towards the medbay, expecting a trap of some kind if the snake hadn't gone through the bunk door yet. He sweeped Mila with practiced care and precision, but the snake was nowhere to be seen…


_ 


Gexie cheered in his head as he crawled back down and silently slithered out the door. *HAH! HUMANS DON'T LOOK UP!*

Bowler guided the missile. While some of the men aboard his ship were admittedly more than susceptible to being caught off-guard, he believed they could handle an unarmed (and four-armed) giant snake so long as they followed their training. The men were some of the best of their respective forces until they chose the life of mercenaries. So, while they dealt with the intruder, Bowler finished the mission. He sprinted as fast as his aching joints would take him to the lone missile terminal, logging it on with his agency identification badge and overriding the two-person key authentication that had been all but required for nuclear weapons throughout their existence with the help of the Director over the radio. 


The planet seemed to be largely uninhabited, so there would only be one casualty of a nuclear weapon, here, with the main ship crashing a whole five miles two hundred and eighty degrees north of his ship. The cameras couldn't detect Ryan's pod from this far away, so the main thing that Bowler would be relying on here would be the nuke's heat-seeking function. The missile fired, and he guided it towards the target. As predicted, the pod fired flares, but with a nuclear warhead, the chances of his survival were still near zero. He couldn't tell the difference between the two heat signatures, and Bowler knew that it was designed to be a near-perfect fifty-fifty, so he picked one, and aimed. 


He neared the target, only half of a kilometer away, before a hissed breath made him duck out of instinct as a massive arm swung right where his head was, milliseconds prior. He turned, and dodged the next three consecutive punches. The fucking embuos prisoner had run straight to *him!* Because killing this fucking kid hadn't been hard enough, evidently! He dodged another devastating punch, reading his opponent's move before the move had been made. 


Bowler dragged his knife out of his pocket, cutting along the arm right under the joint in an attempt to immobilize it. The snake retreated the individual arm with a hiss before continuing to try and swing with its other three arms. He'd have to watch out for that tail, too… Actually… what was the tail doing? As he smacked away another violent punch, Bowler spotted the tail messing with the nuke's controls. 


He spun as fast as he could to deal with the meddling appendage, cutting into it deep and fast before deflecting another pair of jabs. The tail retreated and went to whip at him. Bowler ducked under it, delivering another cut. As he did, the snake charged forward, recklessly. Bowler dodged the punch… and realized the punch wasn't meant for him. 


The control panel for the nuke shattered into screaming electronics and metal, and another punch shattered the control panel into sharp glass and sparks. Bowler stared in horror. 


""What did you do???"" he shouted at the lizard.


""Foiled yer plans to nuke my fuckin' friend, asshole,"" the snake replied, wearing an amused blue on his hood amidst the blackish-green rage under it. ""Guess we're both gunna learn where th' hell yer nuke's headed now."" On the camera screen, the only one still intact, a bright flash signified that the nuke had went off much closer than expected. And the warnings that had just turned on seemed to agree. Bowler grabbed onto a seat and strapped in as fast as he could. The embuos reacted slower, and met the nasty end of a chunk of metal slamming his head unconscious."

ulilc8,1,2022-05-08,To Much Honesty in Statement of Purpose?,425trafficeng,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/ulilc8/to_much_honesty_in_statement_of_purpose/,"&gt;My educational background is that I hold a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and a Master of Civil Engineering with a focus in Transportation Engineering. To qualify myself for rigorous graduate studies in Computer Science, I have gone back to complete coursework in “Discrete Mathematics”, “Introduction to Computer Science”, “Python Data Structures”, “Objects and Algorithms” and “Computer Architecture”. In all those prerequisite courses listed, I have earned A’s in all of them.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;The reason I want to earn a Master of Science in Computer Science is to accomplish my dreams and make a change from a traffic engineer to a software engineer working with technology for intelligent traffic systems or autonomous vehicles. I’m most interested in focusing on Machine Learning as that is the foundation of what allows vehicles to interact with infrastructure, the environment and each other. The future of traffic safety is removing as much driver error out of the equation as possible and I want to be on the forefront of that shift.  Earning the OMSCS degree will benefit me by being a signal to employers that I’ve studied under some of the leading professors in their respective fields, at a highly ranked university and have shown mastery of the material presented to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;I would like to clarify how my early academic career should not be used to judge my abilities to excel in rigorous graduate level coursework. The truth is I never understood how valuable academic success was and because of that never developed healthy study habits, but as evidenced by my most recent academic performance I have moved far past that. Now, I'm more dedicated to accomplishing my dreams than ever before. I've earned 3 A's this past semester while working full-time in a lead engineering role while managing my time effectively to be present as often as possible for my family. I'm more dedicated than ever before and further refined my study habits, which is why I'm so confident in my abilities succeed in OMSCS.

I feel like I made the concise portions concise but I'm not sure if I'm being too honest with why my early grades suck?

My background is the following:

Education:

BS Civil Engineering (US small regional school) cGPA 2.9 (explanation to follow), last 2 years 3.35

ME Civil Engineering (T100 university well known in my field): 3.43

(got a C+ in one class, instead of retaking, took a more advanced elective and got an A-)

Oakton CC: A'a in Discrete and CS with Python. Currently enrolled in DS, Algorithms, Comp Arch but I finished off my finals over the weekend and am safely in the A range for all of them. Will apply once final grades post.

Work Experience: 5 YOE in completely unrelated to tech traffic engineering roles, multiple promotions and managing interns if that helps.

I had a TERRIBLE GPA before going back for engineering. I had shit grades at a CC and earned a 2.6 GPA, somehow got into a flagship state school where I dropped out of chemistry (somehow passed p-chem though) with a 1.88. I should have never been in college at that point in my life.

Took a semester break after dropping out and then went back to community college where I retook some math, physics and other classes and got a 3.7. Then I transferred in my undergrad university where I finished my engineering degree with a 3.35 and was a TA for 2 classes."

I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of *free* resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online. 

This is the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.

Just in time for graduation and/or summer break :)

Whether looking for an internship, your first career job, or *actually* good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt. 

Because let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.

Anyways, below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches ($1500 total spent there, yikes!), and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out the formula), complete with notes on how you can do it, too. 

(They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after following this ressume formula and other methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).

It details how I got recruiters' attention, networked online with people who had the role I dreamed of, and, most importantly, includes a *jaw-dropping* resume/cover letter format, as well as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that contain practical tips and tricks for how to get that coveted role:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM_)

It's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those students who may be actively or passively looking for a job and need help standing out from the pack.

As mentioned earlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is *perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles *much* quicker and added a ""WOW"" factor to it.

**Some additional notes on resumes:**

1. Usually keep it to one page.
2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)
3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers *love* that. Which is better? ""responsible for managing team and hosting meetings"" or ""managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"" See what I'm sayin?
4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---&gt; number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the ""vague description"" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anywways.
7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.  
This is *KEY!*  
Ex: ""Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America."" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a ""+ after the rounded number (ex: ""157 employees ---&gt; ""150+ employees"") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital ""K"" for thousand, ""M"" for million (ex: $23,800 ----&gt; $23K+; $5 million ---&gt; $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please, *pleeeeeease* don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

""Hey (name)- I'm a (junior, senior, grad student, etc) at (uni name) and I just wanted to say that your job at (company name) seems like the dream role I'm working towards! How do you like it?"" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call or over coffee (more details on that in the link).

Use the free site hunter.io to find anyones work email to send cold emails to (email templates in the link), or you can get even slicker and use a free scraping software like Phantom Buster to ""scrape"" (i.e. extract) emails from LinkedIn profiles, if they arent publicly listed. Totally legal, btw and a great resource. [https://phantombuster.com/](https://phantombuster.com/)

Look, I have a history of chronic depression and at times, absolutely debiltating anxiety. The job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.

I don't want that for *anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

I want the process to be as easy as possible for *everyone* and for *free*.

I'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost gaurantee their resume and tips ain't as good this. 

Anyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!

I was working at a restaurant full time but few weeks ago I got another job in content moderation at a very big company with a a very good salary, fully remote and long paid breaks (overall it has been great so far). I still tried applying for software development jobs and internships with basic CRUD apps on my github. Got a few interviews and one of them led into an offer. 4 months internship (paid) with a full time position after. Salary is the same of what I earn now and main language is javascript. Company is pretty small and work is hybrid. I felt very happy about getting my first offer and reaching my goal in a short time and I was very indecisive about what I’m going to do but I decided to not take it. I think I’d rather keep working on myself for now and maybe move to software development position in my current company in the future since I see myself growing here and I feel very comfortable working with them.

uln5zd,3,2022-05-09,24M Career Path Advice (WebDev vs Data Science),Sawfare,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/uln5zd/24m_career_path_advice_webdev_vs_data_science/,"Hi all,I want to quickly outline my profile and then write down my current thoughts about my professional future – including some questions.

I have a strong programming background (full 3 year german internship in programming, 1500+ commits on my private github over 3-4 years) and plenty of self-learned experience with modern Web-Frameworks. In my free-time I’m also running a subscription-based project with ±50 active users, a project that teached me holistic business overview, starting from acquisition all over to after purchase support. Additionally, I’ve focused my masters heavily on Data Science (I would argue from a university with a very good rep in that field) and am currently doing an internship/thesis as Data Science Consultant in a (very) big company. From the Job-Interviews that I’ve had so far, I usually got good feedback – I haven’t been squeezed properly yet though. My biggest weakness would be my lack of absolute (?!) knowledge. If I’m faced with a difficult problem, I can find a solution with google, but not necessarily out of my head. The broad knowledge of languages and frameworks (also beyond webdev) makes it hard for me to know many details about one specific thing, but enables me to quickly find what I’m looking for with google due to my broad understanding. To partly tackle that weakness, Ive been doing some leet-code challenges semi-actively -- I would still start crying if Im being asked a “Hard”-Problem in an interview though.

For me as a person, I’m a heavily biased by my relationship that will pull me out of my small hometown into a big northern german city, and a family member who, due to good investments, can live his life working 20h remotely from any part of the world (and also does that, with very impressive stories and personal development). I also want to have a family at some point.

\-----

As I’m currently offered first jobs, I am facing a big uncertainty for my further life. Do I really want to spend my “youth” traveling 4 days a week to a customer, working way beyond 40 hours with little to no social life, but therefore have a high chance of a good career -- **OR** \-- do I take a “modern” position (startup as example), with high social involvement, remote work but lower wage and also decreased chance to form a good career?

I’m afraid to “get stuck” in a normal place, because life becomes difficult and leaving the comfort zone for a new job probably isn’t as easy as I believe. Forcing myself into consulting for a few years, would assure that I’m basically forced to improve my career.

Another uncertainty: I would be capable of starting to work both as Junior Data Scientist and Junior Web-Dev (or perhaps even SWE). By a small margin, the web-dev would win for me, as I enjoy building front- and backends (I also enjoy DS, just not AS much), but I believe that the entry-barrier into that field is much lower than the one for data science (talking about proper knowledge, not just applying scikit-learn and c&amp;p tf/torch models from github). By choosing a job in the Web-Dev field, I would have wasted two very stressful years, as my masters was basically 100% data science. Also, as far as I’m correctly assessing job offers in the north of Germany, Data Science Jobs are mostly offered in consultancies and a few really big, aka not modern, companies.

\-----

Summary / TLDR: I cant really summarize my profile any further, but my main questions are:

* How difficult is career development from a “normal” company in DS/WebDev? Due to my consumption of /r/Finanzen, I feel like its required to make it into FAANG and alike to have a chance for a good career (outside perhaps of consulting).
* Are there any possible way’s to combine Web-Dev and Data Science? Also, which one would be the preferable field to make a career in your opinion?
* How did you for yourself make the opinion what path to choose, and are you regretting it?

Thank you for your time and maybe even effort to share your thoughts - also if not directly related to my three main questions."

The project in STEP is data science related, which I don't have any experience with, so it would be nice to build some new skills. I don't know what projects would Bloomberg offer.

I have no idea what schools even are there, so when other people are talking about schools they wanna go to I'm pretty clueless.

Was just looking for a starting point into a few schools I can look into. I wanna major in computer science, and would like a few starting options I can at least Google, if even thinking of ever applying.

I take about 2 extra curriculars a year, none entirely related to computer science at the moment. I don't have any internships but will try and get some. (Any help on where to look for these will be nice). I have NHS, and a year of student council experience, not sure if that accounts for anything at all.

I have taken 3 APs so far, and plan to take 5 next year. My gpa has always been ~94 unweighted always. Accounting for APs and honors it's probably a bit higher. 

Even though I have no chance of getting in them, I'm curious which Ivys have the best CS programs.

And would like some more realistic options I can look into. I'm in new york and would be down to go out of state but my only problem would be funds. I don't have exact numbers for my parents income but it's not that high I would say. I'm guessing in state would mean I get to go to school for cheaper as I won't be paying for dorms or housing. But I would really love to live in a dorm, just not sure how that looks like financially.

I'm guessing loans will be my friend, as I've heard CS jobs are pretty lucrative right out of college, but that's not the entire reason I'm talking this major. I like to believe I enjoy the subject, and want to do something cool with it at some point in my life, rather than work a desk job at some big corporation harvesting data my entire life. Not sure it that's just wishful thinking, but I hate that all the ""cool"" jobs are stuff like facebook."

Beside that I've been working and currently working (SWE) as freelancer for various companies. I would like to transition to quant trading - and work with US based investment firms since in eastern europe there is no such thing yet. 

Given my predicted low GPA (somewhere around 3.5-3.55) - What would be the best option? Taking GRE + Work experience + undergrad degree and applying to a US based graduate program OR taking SAT and going to an undergrad in US trying to get better GPA score? Wouldn't going to grad school make me ""overqualified"" in the eyes of these companies even tho I have work experience / took an internship in SWE related domain ? 

What would be the best career move ?

I'd love to work at Google full-time someday. Realistically though, I might still be a few internships away from a full-time offer given that I am still early on in my PhD. I also realize that Google isn't the only game in town so I'm not hellbent on working there either.

I graduated with an unrelated Bachelors in 2009 and spent 11 years in retail banking. For a lot or reasons I decided that a career change was needed and that I wanted to pursue something in tech. I originally wanted to focus on cybersecurity (and I still may do that) but I realized after browsing this sub and speaking with friends in the industry that I needed to focus on gaining some base knowledge first and build on that foundation.

Last Fall I got incredibly lucky and landed a job (not in tech) at my local community college and could now pursue a new degree at basically no cost. I enrolled in their CS program and found that I still needed a fair amount of Gen Ed credits. Also, while they do offer many classes online, there are some required classes that are in-person only, and aren't offered when I could take them.

I started looking in to certifications as a way to supplement the few classes that I could take and am starting to think that this is actually the way to go. I picked up a study guide for ITF+ to see just how knowledgable I already was or wasn't. This material is exactly what I was hoping to get out of a college program, without the hassle of needing to take an extra freshman writing class or something.

So my question is this... with a bachelors degree and a decade of professional, customer-facing experience under my belt already, is another Associates degree worth it? Would I be better served by learning practical skills quickly and pursuing my A+, Net+, etc., instead?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I should clarify that on top of the full-time job, I have two young kids and a mortgage, so time to devote to studying is already limited, and an unpaid internship is not an option."

I had a phone interview, then an on-site interview where I was able to tour the company. From there I moved on to the final stage which was a second in person interview. 

It was divided into two interviews. One with the head engineer and project manager. The second, with HR and talking about company values. 

I feel very comfortable with the second, HR, interview, however the interview with the engineering team is leaving me with mixed feelings. 

I was asked about and discussed my projects with data analysis. And when asked about my goals with this internship and long term academic goals I spoke honestly about where my passions lie. However what’s throwing me off what the body language of one of two interviewers in the room. 

Towards the end of the interview, he was on his phone, and not nearly as attentive as the other manager in the room. Obviously it could have been because I needed to start the second portion of the interview and he was communicating with HR, but seeing him on his phone like that knocked me off my game. 

Though I felt I answered the questions well, this is making me second guess the entire Inter and their interest in me at the company. I.E. questioning if my long-term post graduation goals fit with the company. They also asked me thinks along the lines of what I hope to learn from and get out of this internship.

The meeting with HR went super well, on the flip side. Just a little put off by one of the interviewers seeming inattentive. 

When everything was said and done, the engineers concluded their part of the interview with “(Name of HR person) will reach out to you about the next steps”. Then, at the end of my meeting with HR, she had mentioned that I would hear within the week. 

I know not to stress, and that everything is a mixed bag, but this is my first time interviewing for something like this. And this most recent interaction left me feeling anxious rather than relieved. Reddit, what’s your thoughts?"

But after I joined they decided to port the existing native android app to react native completely. Mind you,I had no experience whatsoever in React Native and JS in general. I thought I would be asked to code in the Android platform only specifically.

So I was shocked basically, I came to the company to learn about Android but instead is doing something else which I don't even know. Still I didn't lose hope and I thought it would be a challenge and I started learning RN. This was a complex android app using many of the phone's hardware and all. Anyway I started the project.
I'm the only developer who's assigned to this project currently and nobody is there to help me here. When I speak to my manager he says to ask help from the web devs and I don't even know them.When I get stuck, it just takes a long time to debug it because I'm not at all familiar with RN. I'm basically left feeling drained out at the end of the day. Both mentally and physically due to hours of debugging.My manager asked me to port the entire app to RN.

So I'm looking for advice on what I should do. Should I quit my internship halfway through or should I persevere? This is my first internship btw."

We’ve grown up together and are nearing the end of our college degrees. We used to be extremely close friends.

Lisa is a very kind person and never acts out of pure malice. In high school, Lisa had extremely low self-esteem. She struggled with grades and body image issues. In college, things changed as she had great internships, became happier with her looks, and liked the attention boys were giving her. She’s super confident now which is awesome and she is still a kind girl.

However, I find that she’s become a bit self-centered, at least when she’s around me. For the past 4 years, every 1on1 convo we’ve had has been 95% her doing the talking. She’ll tell me details of all the job offers she gets, all the boys that have crushes on her, all the high salaries she’s being offered, etc. I know all the ins and outs of her life. Yet she doesn’t know anything about me. She doesn’t take an active interest in my jobs, my achievements, education, my family. If I manage to get a word in our convos, I’ll share something and she’ll be happy for me but then will turn it back to her. 

It has become exhausting talking to her bc I feel like a wall. Sometimes hours will pass and I realize I haven’t gotten to say a word. In 2021, when I had some mental health issues, she was the last person I wanted to reach out to. 

I feel bad because Lisa sharing things with me is rooted in her newfound confidence and she’s not trying to be mean. Am I wrong to feel this way? Should I confront her about her behaviour? And how would I even do that?"

I had a pretty neat idea for one of my projects, however, being new to coding and all - I have no good idea where to start.

My project requires me to build a marketplace-like app (think a mesh of Facebook marketplace and AirBnb) to match people looking for places to stay with others who have room.

I have experience with Python and C and am relatively comfortable with both, but nothing in the webdev area and am just wondering if anyone has any tips for where I should begin!

The main question I guess I would have is what language would I need to learn/code in to achieve this goal?

I just started a software engineering internship at a major tech company in a state literally the opposite corner of the country from where I’m from, so I know no one. I chose my field because I was never interested in anything specific and I’ve always heard how SWE has a great work environment, well paid, good balance, etc, so if I was going to do something I wasn’t passionate about I might as well do something with other benefits. I was so excited to start my internship because everyone was telling me it’s an amazing accomplishment, I’d have fun, meet so many other interns, make friends, etc. I thought I had my life all figured out. But I’m miserable.

I hate the work so much. I thought I liked coding after my first few comp sci classes but the further I go the more I realize I only thought I liked it because I was good at the beginner stuff and seeing first hand what programmers do in the workplace has depressed me so badly. There’s only one other intern on my team and I don’t have any interaction with people outside my team so I haven’t made any friends. The hours are like any other job, so I don’t see how there is an “amazing work-life balance.” I come home everyday exhausted, have dinner, go on my phone for a bit, sleep, then start the day again. I am so lonely and unmotivated and I don’t know what to do.

I have to hold back tears at work and come home and cry for hours. I hate my field but I’m going into my final year of college in the fall so it’s too late to make a drastic change. I don’t see how I can make any friends at this type of job and people never like me enough to date me so now I just see my future as lonely and isolated being miserable all day in a job I hate. I know this position is just for the summer but once I graduate and get a job everything will probably just be like how it is now. I was such a high achieving person growing up and now feel like I just wasted all my potential because I had the chance to do any field I wanted and could have went for an amazing, interesting career that I actually enjoy.

I don’t know what to do at all and dont want a future if this is any indication of what it’s going to be like. any advice would be appreciated"

Sometimes I just don’t feel like it will ever get better

There’s times I’ve thought about who would miss me

I used to not fear death until I had that dream
What happens after

Sometimes I wonder if I will ever truly be happy

I’ve thought about killing myself

I don’t have any reason not to be perfectly happy

I feel alone a lot even when I’m around people

I don’t want to feel this way

I just want to feel content

I wish I could just be fine

I want to talk to somebody about it but I don’t know who

I don’t want to burden my friends or make them feel uncomfortable or that they should have to worry

I don’t want to seem like just another kid who’s kinda sad 

I feel like I need help but I don’t want it

I feel like life just drones on sometimes, no purpose or meaning, just carries on

I might have some kind of relationship but due to performance I feel like it’s distancing us even though she said it’s not a big deal

I’ve never had feelings for someone like I have for her and I’ve had problems previously and recently with being hurt. I feel like I’m over thinking it 

I just want to feel free, no weight on my shoulders, I want to feel like a kid again with no worries in the world but I can’t escape the feeling of I don’t know what 

I want help but I don’t know how to get it without making it into a whole ordeal

My stress is through the roof and I don't know how much more my body can take. It feels like I'm dying. I cant sleep, I'm not interested in eating, I don't know what to do.

That being said, I feel like if I'm alone on an internship, I won't be able to sleep or do anything because of how this stress is eating me. I've gone to a doctor and just started on an antidepressant. However, that won't kick in until about 2 to 4 weeks from now.

If it weren't for exams I'd be getting an A in every cs class I've taken as I always manage to finish the projects and do well on them and same with the labs. I've only taken three cs classes in college, got a C+ on the intro course(did bad on tests), D+ in my algorithms and data structures class (honestly felt like the prof gave random grades bc I studied my ass off every time went in confident and got 60% on the tests), then got a C in C programming class (accidentally cheated without knowing and he failed me). I took two years off a school because of covid and money issues and now I'm coming back next fall.

With some regret, recently I found the Bachelor's program of the school I desired had their Computer Science path in the Computer Engineering department, which in short, would mean that I would still have to take around 3-4 years of classes most likely to be on path for the degree, not to mention traditional college already costing thousands. I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life, but I also want a solid foundation for it.

I've considered WGU and other online programs, but I'm not sure they would translate all too well toward an employer. Part of me wants to live the ""college experience"" I desired, but at the same time, I feel like it's more hyped up than actuality, aside from the few exclusive internship opportunities and ability so socialize and network with people.

I feel sort of disheartened, because I am sort of wishing I re-evaluated and not considered going to Community College for two years, but I am wondering if there's just *some* program out there that could translate my credits and still keep me on my original path of getting a technical degree within 2 years, looking attractive to an employer and ultimately securing my spot at a Security Analyst position.

I was hoping that maybe some of you may be able to answer some questions of mine. 


 1.  a trend that I find popular in the US is that employers don't necessarily expect CS grads to have that much real world experience. Is this the same case for recent graduates in Germany?

2. what locations are popular in relation to CS job employment?

3. how does one go about researching the CS job opportunities in Germany in general?

4. how is the work-life balance for programmers in Germany?

5. how good should my German be in order to be considered to be hired? (i expect to learn German in the event that I live there, regardless)

umhpj2,7,2022-05-10,Advice for finding career?,Whatsgood789,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/umhpj2/advice_for_finding_career/,"

I see a lot of questions on here about how to start out finding a career and just wanted to share some things I’ve seen work for me and others that apply across many industries and fields.

1. get ANY JOB, I see a lot of people stagnate and not work at all while trying to find what career they want to do for most their lives and this is the worst mistake you can make. In order to find a career you need to know what is out there and the fact of the matter is 80% of the jobs out there most of us have probably never heard about. To solve this you need to work and with that you will learn about all sorts of work never before know about 

for example you start as a cashier at a grocery market and while there meet the repair guy who fixes the freezer so you go into that, next you are at a job site doing a repair at a data center and learn more on that and end up with a internship for software development ect ect pretty much this can happen from any starting point. 

2. CALL COMPANIES- a almost dead art and I’m not sure why but if you have some idea of what you want to get into get off indeed and zip recruiter and start calling everyone in your area who works in that field. You’ll be shocked at how many have starting positions/training they never advertise and I’ve seen a lot of people get a foot it the door for jobs they aren’t even yet qualified for this way 

3. You are a asset - with the recent massive labor shortage at least in the U.S  manpower is harder and harder to come by yet many people seeking employment are not leveraging this in a strong way. Do not be scared to apply or contact companies that a few years ago may have only been taking on people with prior experience or certain certs as it’s almost a guarantee they currently are in need of more people. 

I’m no expert in this but hopefully this will help at least one person start their journey."

I’m graduating from high school this summer and I am to start my bachelor’s degree this fall. However, I’m still kind of undecided about which major to pursue, and I’m literally going crazy while trying to pick between the universities I was accepted into.

For some time now, I’ve been aiming for obtaining a Music Business degree and I’ve been accepted to multiple more-or-less good universities in UK and US for such courses as “music business and media”, “music business and arts management”, “music industries management”, etc. This field of work is interesting to me and I can definitely see myself working in the industry in the future - music is a huge part of my life and I’ve already managed to organise some small-scale live performances, but I want to do it professionally.

However, recently I got scared I’m not gonna find a job in this field in my home country right away since the entertainment industry is in massive decline there for the moment, and I kinda want to have career options outside of music biz. And if that happens, I’m unsure on how transferable the skills and the diploma of music business are… would it be easy for me to get into sports management or general events management? Or maybe PR and management of other industries? And is music business something you should really study for 3 years? Idk… 

That is why I’m in doubts in whether I should still go for one of the music business-ish degrees, OR go for the “Media and Culture” course at Utrecht University - it seems to have much more job prospects and opportunities and the knowledge I’d get there would still be applicable in the music industry. And then, if necessary, I can pursue a Master’s in music biz.

But then - what’s better? To have a “something” business degree, or a media and culture degree… is media and culture even a valuable degree? It seems interesting to me as well, though ofc I’m more interested in music in particular. And in terms of internships - I’d probably be better off with music related internships which the music biz courses have access to… 

Oh, man, my head is literally about to explode. Idk what I even expect as replies to my post, but maybe… if you work in the music industry, what degree do you have? Any thoughts and advices on what would be a wise decision in my situation? And also - what matters more - the relevance of the degree to the industry or the prestige of the university you’re getting you’re degree from? Cause that is also something that I’m unsure about. 

Thank you all in advance…"

R and I were friends, and we lived in the same building. We hung out a lot, had the same/similar friend circle, etc. I considered him a good friend. R is a very socially adept, charismatic person, who thinks very highly of himself and likes to interweave himself in as large a social circle as he possibly can. For some reason, my old roommate (from the year prior to when I started hanging out with R) had a BIG issue with R, because of something that happened with my old roommate's girlfriend. I never got the full story on that, but while I was living with that old roommate, he refused to allow R inside our apartment.

At some point, I started dating a girl, let's call her ""K."" She also lived in my same building, two doors down. We had been dating for about 3 months, seeing each other almost every day, not ""serious"" but still we were functionally exclusive and attended all social events basically as a couple, spent every weekend together, etc. About 3 months in, she starts acting very strange toward me, and especially so in the presence of R. She did mention that he had messaged her on facebook and had offered to help her get some internship. Eventually, she starts making excuses for why she doesn't want to hang out with me. She acts like we're still seeing each other, always keeps saying she can't wait to see me again, to hang out, etc, but for about a month, she punts every single time we were going to hang out alone with each other, she's always busy. I never pushed, but it seemed a little strange. I suspect something is up, and especially so since R and her are acting weird. So one day I took R aside and asked him straight up, what's going on? Clearly I'm out of the loop here and I'd like to have an idea of what's happening. So he looks me in the eyes, and says ""I don't know, I don't know why she's acting weird, I have nothing to do with it."" He then reached out and shook my hand as he said this, which at the time seemed to me like it added some degree of sincerity, like ""i'm being honest with you because you're my friend."" So I left it at that.

So, things ""officially"" ended between me and K, and it was awkward and brutally unpleasant. For me especially. And R knew this, because I confided in him as a friend that this was a tough situation for me. And yet even after that, R kept messaging her and inviting her out to come out with us, knowing that I really didn't want to see her, and knowing why I don't want to see her. I'd show up to hang out with R and a couple other friends, and K would be there (R's roommate wasn't always at these hangouts, see next paragraph for why this is significant). So at that point I cut contact with that entire friend group and began just hanging out with other friends that I had. In the past 8-10 years, I've become very close with this ""new"" friend group, and I consider them to be my closest friends.

Months after things ended with K, I found out through another 'mutual"" friend from that same original group that when R had originally messaged her on Facebook, he had basically put ideas in her head that I wasn't the person she wanted to date - he told her straight up that I was just out to hurt her, that I was using her, etc., some really awful things............none of which were true. He also suggested that K should date his roommate instead, because he was a nice guy who would never hurt her (I guess his roommate was interested in her and R was ""wingmanning"" for his roommate), and I guess what happened was she developed animosity toward me based on what R told her, and she started to date R's roommate at his suggestion. There was an overlap of about a month where I thought her and I were still together, and she was actually dating R's roommate. Also, apparently everyone knew what was going on but me, so the entire situation was incredibly humiliating. There were even times when everyone involved in this clusterfuck were all hanging out together (including the roommate), and I was sitting here thinking ""man, everyone seems to be acting strange, but whatever."" I must reiterate that at that time, according to what K was telling me, she and I were still seeing each other. R even ran ""interference"" (because everyone lived in the same building) where he would ""come over to watch a cool new series and hang out and drink beers"" to make sure I wouldn't leave the apartment and accidentally see them together. I guess I figured something was strange when i asked him to pause the movie so I could go downstairs to check the mail, and he absolutely REFUSED, but I guess it kind of makes sense now.

A year later, I started dating another girl, ""A"". About a month and a half into this, A tells me that R was messaging her and trying to set her up with another one of his friends, even though R knew that she was dating me. Same shit as before - R was telling A that I was just using her and was going to hurt her. I think the other friend was out of the loop, because at a social event, he came up to A and started hitting on her aggressively, and I don't think he realized she was there with me. It is important to note that A and R had hooked up years before this, and prior to the whole clusterfuck with K, A had expressed interest in me, but I had set a hard line that I wouldn't try to date A, out of respect for R. After I found out that R had sold me out with K and lied to my face, I said well who cares now, I don't owe R any courtesy. I ended up dating A for about a year and a half.

Now it's years later. I've LONG since moved on from caring about either K or A, and I've been dating my current girlfriend for almost three years. R is a very social person and tries to ""be friends with"" everyone, and I knew some of my friends were sort of casually friends with him. It's not really my business to tell my friends who they can and can't be friends with, though. They didn't have the same experience with him that I did; I can't expect them to hate him on my behalf. But they know my history with him.

BACK TO CURRENT EVENTS: So this past weekend, I went over to my friend's place for a barbecue with my group of close friends. I met my friend out front, and as we're walking in, he says don't flip your shit, but R is here. I'm like what the fuck man? And my friend is like relax, he just wants to be your friend.

I'm a grown ass man so I'm acting civil and I shake hands and whatever, but I really don't want anything to do with this prick. At some point I went inside to get a beer and R comes in to have a private ""chat"" with me. He says oh, i'm sorry about how things ended with K, blah blah, and I stopped him immediately and I said listen dude I'm here to hang out with my friends, I don't want to talk about that kind of shit. He backpedals and he's like no okay that's fine, and I'm like look let's just let that be in the past, I've moved on with my life, but I really don't know what you expect from me beyond that. And then he reaches out and shakes my hand. Same way he shook my hand all those years ago. I don't think he knows that I know what he did to try to grenade my relationship with A.

I got burned twice by this guy, because I trusted him. I don't want to be friends with him. I don't want him in my circle, I don't want to leave myself vulnerable to him sabotaging any more of my romantic or personal relationships. I don't know what his motivations are for what he did in the past, and likewise, I don't know what his intentions are now.

His behavior in general is pretty unusual............like why would someone want to sabotage someone else's relationships? Why would anyone ever be motivated to do that? But knowing him, and knowing the way he sees himself, I'd guess he sees himself ""making deals"" with people's relationships as a form of social currency.

I really don't know what to do or how to handle this. I'm sure as fuck not going to ever trust this person again, and I don't want to have him in any part of my life. It's not out of the question that if he meets my current girlfriend, he'll find her on social media and start messaging her ""as a friend,"" with all kinds of ""helpful hints"" about me. But I also have to walk a fine line with my current friends. I don't want to be that one dickhead who can't get along with someone and causes problems. I just see this future where this blows up and then I end up with no friends.

TL;DR: Former friend sabotaged two of my romantic relationships, now is trying to weave his way into my new group of friends."

My previous work experience and skills: before this job I was a unpaid intern at a computer repair shop. I did things like remove viruses, cleaned PCs and hard drives, answered phone calls, installed anti virus software. Before that I did some volunteer work at my dads store doing cashier work and general grunt work. I did go to community college for 3 to 5 years to get a degree in history or a general studies. But I dropped out after taking a few hard classes. I also am really fast at typing being able to type at 85wpm to 100wpm. I am wondering what are some remote jobs I can do?"

umnyqx,0,2022-05-10,Staying in Germany - over 90 days,Backtracking99,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/umnyqx/staying_in_germany_over_90_days/,Hi all! This summer I will be working as a Software Engineer Intern in Germany and my internship will consist of 13 weeks (91 days) + days I will stay as unemployed. I am a Romanian citizen (EU country as Germany is) and I know that staying over 90 days involves to register with the authorities in my first days there (not really sure about how many days after arriving there). Does it involve anything else like declaring church tax or something like this?
umoqsg,1,2022-05-10,Advice needed for someone at a crossroads.,UtterlyMilkedR,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/umoqsg/advice_needed_for_someone_at_a_crossroads/,"Hi Reddit. As the the title explains I 21m have been struggling with what to do with my life for quite awhile. I have a decent job right now, at a well established organization, but I’m very disconnected from the work and generally very unhappy with the state of my life. Went to a local university for a year and had a rather negative experience. To put a lot of the details aside, I just feel really lost and not passionate by my day to day work. Since high school I’ve had a vision working in the gaming industry and was well on my way to getting early credits, while also developing a great portfolio. My location, Topeka, Kansas, is extremely lacking in anything in that industry and it’s very hard to find anyone here who can give advice. I’ve attempted to do some internships locally but nothing will evolve into a career past computer repair and IT work.   

TLDR - Just need some advice on getting into the game development industry while also living in the middle of nowhere. I know this is a very widespread ambition, but I feel like it’s a true passion of mine, and one I shouldn’t give up on. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

ump2kg,2,2022-05-10,Is not having an internship the summer after your sophomore year normal?,nrcoon15,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ump2kg/is_not_having_an_internship_the_summer_after_your/,"I was talking to my buddy about summer plans, and he was surprised that I was getting a job, asking “why not get an internship?” I told him that I wasn’t able to get one, and he acted surprised, saying that everyone he knows has an internship. 

Is this normal?? My boyfriend is another engineering student in my discipline, and we are both 4.0 students well ahead in credit hours, but neither of us were able to secure an internship this summer. We’ve also tried applying for undergraduate research and didn’t get anything for summer. He feels really bad about himself and is worrying that he won’t be able to get an internship his junior year or a job out of college because he has no experience, and I’m starting to think maybe he’s right and we’re screwed."
umpsae,3,2022-05-10,Uber vs startup,Automatic_Dingo_7488,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/umpsae/uber_vs_startup/,"I was fortunate enough to secure two internship offers, but not sure which one to pick.

First is for a startup that recently raised a lot of money in a seed round - as a software engineering intern with a monthly allowance of ~500€ p/m. Team seems really cool and friendly, and it would be an opportunity to learn a lot and develop my skillset. My number one priority after graduating is to increase my chances of finding a fully remote job in the future or at least a hybrid one so I think that software engineering would give me the best chance of finding something like that. Another point is that I am living in a city that has a very high cost of living so living with that salary is possible but it would be very tight.

Second is for Uber as an analytics intern for an operations team(not development). Salary is around 2k p/m. Role is mostly to support non-tech operations by using data to support their decision making/strategy, so it would involve SQL but not so much beyond that. On the one hand - Uber’s brand name would really boost my CV, and the salary would be really nice as well. But for the actual work, it seems way less technical than I would like.

I am leaning towards the first offer - am I crazy for passing on Uber for a no name startup?"

I got admitted into cs but without COOP and was debating whether maybe I should apply for it in the upcoming future. Does COOP create a drastic difference in terms of acquiring a position in the field? Does not having COOP make it very difficult to find internships on your own?

Since I have some downtime this summer, I wanted to get working on some kind of personal project from which I can learn a lot and also have to put on my resume. Over my time at school I kind of learned that I like the software side of things more than actual stats/data science stuff.

I took a DS&amp;A class at my university and have a good amount of experience with C++ and I wanted to get some marketable skills so I tried to dive into a MERN stack project but kinda hit a huge wall. I thought C++ -&gt; JavaScript would be a relatively easy transition but it wasn't really, and then I also realized I kind of need to know the basics of HTML/CSS to work with front-end stuff (duh) which I don't have as of now. 

What is the best way I can build up marketable skills and add a project to my resume from what I currently know? Should I keep trying to dive into a MERN stack project and just build up my JS skills before I go head-first into a big project, or should I look to do something different entirely? I think I feel pretty flexible with my interests in software and I am gonna be taking a webdev class in the fall so I think this type of project would be advantageous but I'm not sure, so I wanted to get some advice from people who have been in the position that I am right now. I feel like I'm in kind of a weird spot where I'm confident in my programming skills but am not really sure where to go from here since all I've done in school is work inside a terminal and now I need to kind of extrapolate from that. Sorry if this is a dumb inquiry on my part, I'm not giving up or anything I just want to make sure that I'm using my time wisely and that I can be confident in the direction that I'm going. Also, I'm realizing that this question might not be 100% appropriate for this subreddit, and if not, please direct me where I should go instead!"

umqrrg,6,2022-05-10,"I know I have been an excellent teacher, but a horrible intern and will not be able to complete my secondary edTPA.",CosmicNoire,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/umqrrg/i_know_i_have_been_an_excellent_teacher_but_a/,"TL;DR I will most likely be listed as NOT RECOMMENDED because I didn't finish my secondary edTPA online (alternate certificate program internship modules). What will happen? What are my options?

&amp;#x200B;

I took on WAY too much my first year in (tennis/cross country coach/after school club co-sponsor/HB4545 Tutorials) on top of being a single parent and it has been hell trying to keep up with all of that while dealing with life, ADHD, anxiety, family health emergencies, AND edTPA. Ultimately, I feel like anything I say is just an excuse any way because at my core I just DID NOT want to do the stupid edTPA crap even though I was paying 500 a month out of my paycheck to be able to do it. There just always seems to be SO MUCH!

&amp;#x200B;

Why is there always SO MUCH... 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told that Region 4 will ultimately put me as NOT RECOMMENDED because I was unable to complete my secondary edTPA. The main reason I will not be recommended is because I failed to make all but one recording of my lessons due to the fact that I just DID NOT want to do more work. I always do this to myself and am so tired of the self-sabotage. I put the work off until after cross country season, but then tennis season started and I put it off more. Then my mother ended up hospitalized for a minor stroke and I was distraught, helping to take care of her as often as I could until she recovered and was able to return home.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel like an utter failure. I worked SO hard to get into the Alternate Certificate Program ONLY to screw myself RIGHT AT THE END.

&amp;#x200B;

The school I work at sang my praises all the time. My Region 4 appraiser was so kind and told me how impressed she was at my work (probably a line fed to all candidates but it was still nice) and she even put me down as RECOMMEND. Most of my co-workers were kind, appreciative, and understanding, and I made a neat group of friends to hang out with every now and then. Everyone keeps telling me they are excited for the summer and looking forward to starting the next school year with me, but I haven't told anyone that I will probably not be able to return due to being placed on the NOT RECOMMENDED list. Which means I will not be certified. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know EXACTLY if that is what will happen, but from my understanding this means I will not be able to teach, correct?

&amp;#x200B;

My options are to either go back to subbing to make ends meet or apply for Fusion Academy (a place my father keeps telling me about). I'm so very tired of putting in effort but ultimately falling short. Despite my self-destruction I have had a very fun year working with the kids. Does anybody have some insight as to what exactly will happen and what my options are after the year is over? I'd appreciate any feedback."
umqsys,4,2022-05-10,I told my psychiatrist I wanted to kill myself and there was no reaction,Yori_TheOne,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/umqsys/i_told_my_psychiatrist_i_wanted_to_kill_myself/,"I've for a long time felt that everything wasn't right. I am not normal and people have been so kind to tell me through my whole life. Strangers verbally insulted me because if how Iook. I'm extremely stupid and can barely talk to someone and is scared of almost everything. 

I realized that this wasn't just me not being mature enough to study harder, exercise and socialize more. No, it is something I can't do anything about and chose to seek help. I know have a doctor, a psychologist and a psychiatrist ""helping"" me.

The almost 4 years if isolation didn't help any either and I f*cked up and broke the law. (Didn't hurt anyone. Wasn't that bad)

All of that have let me to wanting to kill myself. I had suicidal thoughts for over a year and have harmed myself, but about a month ago it got worse. I now have a lengthy document with different methods end myself and their pros and cons. 

I decided to let my psychiatrist know last week, expecting to be put on antidepressants, but was simply told that it will get better. I can't see how. I have no future. I have ruined so many changes to get a good education, but instead I'm almost done with my computer science degree even though I can't code, so It will be impossible to find a job. Not to mention possible jail time for my crime, which will not improve my situation. Worst of all is the disappointment I will be in my family when they find out.

I can't see a future and even waiting 6 month to ended, so my death isn't an inconvenience to a fellow student I intern with, already feels way too long. Not to mention that it could potentially be longer as I am not planning on running from my responsibilities and will pay my dues whatever the punishment might be."
umr9zy,3,2022-05-10,"Resume work: Java project, learning python?",derjam20,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/umr9zy/resume_work_java_project_learning_python/,"Hey all, I’ll be headed into my senior year this fall, and my goal this summer is to beef up my resume with projects and such, since I’m not sure I’ll have an internship.

My first idea is to create an SQL database for a multi-class shopping cart program that I wrote in Java a while ago. The program is all text based, and it allows the user to create items with descriptions to add to a shopping cart, as well as modify the item  quantities, and/or add or remove them from the cart.

Although I’m familiar with SQL, I haven’t  implemented what I know into a project yet, so I feel like this will be a good place to start. 

Afterwards, I’m thinking about creating a UI for the program since I haven’t done any frontend work besides a little experimenting with Java applets lol. 

Also, I’m not too familiar with the concept of unit checking, but would that be something worth experimenting with, in particular with this program? I created the program a while ago, but it’s got lots of room for improvement. 

Lastly, I’m also considering setting some time aside each day to become more familiar with python. 

I haven’t used python that much, but it seems a lot more straightforward than Java, so I feel like it’d be worth learning in the long run.

Do you guys think that working on these things would be a good use of my time over the summer? 

A couple of my friends are head engineers at an RPA company that I’d like to apply for, but despite having those good references, I’m lacking experience and projects to showcase on my resume, which worries me.
Granted, they recently hired my friend who had a finance degree and no knowledge of programming, but he went to a more prestigious university.

While I still have yet to take my DSA and software engineering classes, along with my senior project, I’m afraid of graduating with not much to show, especially since my GPA is nothing to brag about.

I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read all this, I know I still have a year left, but I fear that while I was working my way through college, I neglected to spend enough time cultivating my programming/developer skills. I’m afraid that might come back to haunt me by the time I start applying for jobs."

A little backstory, I will be leaving for the summer to do an internship (June-August) and will be needing to either build a small form factor PC or just get a laptop (gaming/work). I currently have a pc with these specs:

CPU: R5 3600
GPU: 2070S FE
PSU: 550w
RAM: 16gb DDR4
Memory: 512gb NVMe, 2tb hddr 
Case: a big case (don’t know the brand)
Mobo: B450

I have all the peripherals and a monitor that can do 1440p at 165hz

I basically just want to see what can be built for my budget or what I can buy (laptop) with that budget

Budget: $2000

Work: most demanding thing excel (so not demanding)

Gaming: Elden ring, RDRD2, Forza, so all AAA gaming

Timeframe: 3 weeks I leave at the end of this month. I can travel back home since I’ll be in NorCal instead of SoCal.

Location: I currently live close to MicroCenter"
umvk51,4,2022-05-10,Recruitment advice for a confused ML student?,mavericknathan1,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/umvk51/recruitment_advice_for_a_confused_ml_student/,"Hello, good folks of the sub. I am currently pursuing my MS from a reputed college in India. My focus is obviously AI and I am finally getting to pursue it full-time here, which is somewhat of a privilege to have in the Indian software market, so that's that.

However, between my MS research and a part-time internship at a startup, I sometimes feel very confused and overworked. Mostly because the state of recruitment of AI roles within India is not that good. You need to be a master's student at a college better than mine (like top 8 in the country) to land an AI job that pays well right out of college or you'll have to make your way there yourself. 

I need to get a job next year and while I love working with AI, I doubt how good a job I'll land, starting out.  If there are people who are professionally working as ML engineers or data scientists, I would be grateful if you have any advice for an aspiring ML engineer and/or resources that can help me land a job in AI. Would love to hear about your professional experience too. I am of course considering overseas WFH jobs as well."

**Interviews**

I only had 3 interviews–Stanford, Penn(Management&amp;Technology), Princeton. Stanford was my first one, and while I was pretty nervous it felt ok. Not great, just ok. My Princeton interview seemed to go relatively well, and my interviewer was easy to talk to(with a very interesting story/career that directed a lot of our conversation). My Penn M&amp;T interview also seemed to go well, and lasted over an hour. We covered my business in more depth than in the other interviews as well as the standard interview topics.

**Essays**

I wrote my personal statement about my business, and the lessons I learned from doing it. This was probably my worst piece of writing throughout the applications cycle, reading it now, but it did tell a consistent narrative. For my other essays (other than the various why this school essays), I wrote about soccer, Ancient Greek and other languages, and my business. I spent a total of 15-20 hours on my essays for the EA cycle, and then about 60 hours on essays for RD. I was able to reuse many of my essays across a few schools, and reused a lot of individual paragraphs across essays(like the why this school essays). I had both my parents and my school college counselor, who I met with approximately once per week throughout the college process, help me with my essays.

umyh22,1,2022-05-10,Coding Challenge All or Nothing,TheXenoPixel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/umyh22/coding_challenge_all_or_nothing/,Recently took a timed Python coding test for an internship consisting of two questions. The first was really basic but I was timing out on all the hidden tests (still have no idea how I could've made the code faster so I'm starting to think it was a mistake on their end). The second was a lot more complex involving string subsequences. I thought my approach was pretty good and I left comments explaining what I was doing but I failed all the hidden tests and basically gave up because I was running out of time. This is the first coding challenge I've done for an internship so I wanted to ask how these are typically viewed by employers. If I'm not passing all the tests am I instantly disregarded? Or do they weigh my thought process and how my code is structured more heavily?

I have heard that applying to engineering might actually be beneficial, because word is that engineering admissions tend to focus more on stats then ECs, but wanted to see what y'all think. is it better for someone like myself to apply engineering or arts and sciences, or should I just do what Im interested in. thanks"

un05tz,2,2022-05-10,Super Frustrating REU Head!,Gratefully-,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/un05tz/super_frustrating_reu_head/,"Hi! I am here because I need some advice about an opportunity that's been offered to me. 

I am an undergrad sophomore, rising junior and I was accepted to a summer NSF REU internship at a university. It's a tech related research program and I was so excited to have been accepted! However, it's been extremely anxiety-inducing ever since I've been accepted into the program. 

I responded right away to the acceptance email, but I never got a response back from the head professor of the internship. I privately emailed the co-head and he very shortly told me that I probably got written down somewhere that I accepted.

In the original email, I was told that I would get information regarding my mentor, the summer housing plans, etc, but it's been over a week and a half and I have not gotten any information. The program is supposed to be starting in 3 weeks and prices of airfare have soared. I emailed the head professor yesterday asking if there were any updates, no response. 

According to their academic calendar their spring semester ends in 2 days. If I'm going to try asking again I should probably wait until their term is done, right?

The professor on [ratemyprofessors.com](https://ratemyprofessors.com) is apparently notorious for not responding to emails, but I don't feel comfortable emailing the co-head again about this. At the same time, I have no way to tell whether or not I was accidentally forgotten from an emailing list or they gave my spot to someone else or if they have decided to make the program entirely remote. How should I contact them? Should I contact them at all? Who do I contact?!!! 

Thank you so much everyone for the support. 

Sincerely,

Chronically Anxious Nitwit"

I recently was offered NTU REP with the REP scholarship, which I am truly blessed to have, and am most probably going to be leaning to this side. However, I would like to better understand the programme and preparing for it before I actually dive into selecting it as my preferred course. 

I understand that students study all 10 disciples of engineering (including Computer Science), albeit not in depth, in the first year before narrowing down to selecting one specific engineering field to specialise in for the remaining duration of the programme. While I understand that the basics of Computer Science can be studied online through courses and projects, I was wondering about how I could prepare for the other disciplines of engineering. Could there be any basic pre-reading or resources which I could utilise to prepare beforehand? I understand that this is not the type of course where it is easy to prepare beforehand but I was hoping to find some resources.  Searching online proved to be a futile attempt as there was no concrete web links or resources available. 

Moreover, may I ask how relevant or strong hackathons and projects will be on resume? Are these truly attractive to prospective employers?  Furthermore, are there any leadership opportunities I could indulge in while spending my two years from now till the matriculation into university? By leadership, I was referring to volunteering opportunities and hubs, or perhaps some organisations where I could adopt certain leadership roles without much technical knowledge or experience. Will these be a huge boost in finding strong internships for me while in university? I plan to do at least 2 internships before university starts, preferably in 2024. Currently learning towards DSTA internship but would love to apply for paid internships relevant to the fields I am going to be dabbling in (not part-time jobs)... 

I truly appreciate the time and effort you spent in reading this post. Thank you very much and all the best in your applications or any state of life which you are in."

This happened back in summer last year and it's almost 1 year. I avoided taking any programming classes and am quite ashamed to think of this, I avoided any coding class till now but I need to take some in fall. What can I do to help myself overcome this?  
The sad part I did no searching on the internet about the topic, I don't know why I didn't do a simple google search to find out videos/documents on the topics i did not understand.

A lot of people I know are preparing for internships next summer and I am too afraid to even think about that since I had to cheat on a intro class. Admitting this was hard and took me 9 months to come to terms with myself and ask you guys for help.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kinds words and not kicking me while I'm down. I'm going to start reading up and watching some videos on pointers and polymorphism and anything else I missed. Then I'll try to redo those codes without any help. I'll work my ass off this summer and if I get time work on data structure and algorithm."

Most of my work involves changing transformations in Informatica(an ETL tool) and altering the code according to the needs. The position offered is of data analyst. I am a new grad and I feel like I need more challenges in my job. So, right now, I have 2 choices :

1. To go back at MNC. The work would be the same and there is no option of team switch until I have 1 YOE. I have a full time offer as well. The pay is very good (15LPA basic, this includes joining bonus of 3L)
2. Join an early age startup as a Junior Data Engineer. The technologies they use are - Neo4J, Airflow, GCP and Python. The basic pay here is 10LPA and have stock options of 5L(paper money at this point as it is an early age startup). The company has gone through 2 rounds of funding managing to collect 350K USD in Angel Round and 500K in Pre-seed round.

I am more inclined to join startup as it will give me the challenge I need. On the other hand, all my friends and relatives think I'm making a mistake as the first company gives a very stable career, has good pay, hardly fires anyone and is known for their WLB.

Does second option look interesting from a Data Engineer's point of view?"

Furthermore, taking leaves in a &lt;3 month internship looks bad, and I can again lose the FT offer from my intern company.

It slightly might help if my full time company is in a different time zone, but this might not always be the case.

How do I manage this?

Does anyone have any advice on this?"
uncxlc,29,2022-05-11,I feel confused and hopeless: Perspective of a Mathematics Lover,Itachi_99,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uncxlc/i_feel_confused_and_hopeless_perspective_of_a/,"I'm a 23(M) Computer Science graduate(Masters) student in India(not in IIT). I'm in my first year, got a 9 CGPA on my first semester. I was fine till the end of April. I love mathematics, I'm currently studying Topology on my own(which is very hard) from Munkres. I also want to learn ML and DL for my course curriculum. So, I'm also studying ESL by Tibshirani, Hastie and Friedman and the Deep Learning Book by Goodfellow. I'm starting to work on my thesis, my main topic of research is Computational Topology, so, I'm reading the book by Herbert Edelsbrunner. Apart from that, I have a huge course load. I also like to study some linear algebra and probability in my free time from Friedberg and Ross. 
Even with this much of hassle, I still like learning stuff and look forward to sitting on my desk and solve math or study math(including ML and DL). I don't have any published paper yet but I intent to publish at the end of my graduation if everything goes well.(I also know Tensorflow and Keras)
Recently, from May, I started scrolling through LinkedIn and I started to feel completely worthless. Even after I put in so much of work learning new things which I love, I see that all the people with good CP, got so much ahead in life(not that it's bad), I got nowhere. When I see people from research, my heads starts to roll, they're at my age, they've published so much and also have done internships in very reputable companies. I feel like a leech who's only worth is to suck time from my life. 
So, I decided that even with this much effort I'm putting, I'll put some more this summer and started to apply for Data Science internships in various platforms. I have a ML internship in a company in my Undergrad and my final year project was also heavily focused on DL. I study at a very reputated University(not IIT). But, even after 100 applications(approx) to different postings from LinkedIn, Angelist, I didn't even got a single interview call for a 2 month internship
I don't know what to do with my situation. I feel completely defeated. In today's era, how much do I have to wait to prove my worth? What should I do in this situation? 

P.S. Thank you so much for listening. If I inadvertently offended anyone by saying anything wrong, please forgive me. Any kind of feedback on this post is appreciated"

undjag,2,2022-05-11,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (5/9/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/undjag/weekly_job_qa_thread_592022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 120th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

uneeh8,3,2022-05-11,How to Quit My Job,Sisster108,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/uneeh8/how_to_quit_my_job/,"I need some advice on how to quit my job. 

Last July I started working at a law firm, I told him when I applied I would be applying to graduate school. At the time there was a chance it would be all online. These were masters programs. On a whim, I applied for my PhD and got accepted! 

When I was hired, I did say I could potentially stay here for 2 years. It has only been a year now. I think that is the biggest part that is making me feel guilty. 

I leave in August for my PhD. I have secured housing, a car, and the whole nine yards. There is no going back. 

I am trying to give him my notice Friday and have been really struggling giving it to him. I am fearful of a few things, he is going to hold it against me and be extremely passive aggressive for the rest of my time. Or I am afraid he will let me go on the spot. I live in an at will employment state, so he can let me go whenever he likes. I have been training our intern and convinced him to hire her full time so she could be a replacement for me. But she is not cutting it. 

He had been making big plans for August and further on. He has had two people quit on him previously, and very quickly both times. He holds it against them very much. I do not want him to do the same to me. I would like to leave on good terms. 

He has given me over $2000 in crypto, huge gifts, bonuses, and so on. I have never had an issue quitting a job before, but this job is one I am struggling to quit. 

I want to make sure I have time to train someone how to do my job so he doesn't end up with a disaster. He leaves for a vacation in July for two weeks. Then I would want to leave the last week of July. That is one of my biggest concerns, plus we are bringing on a high school intern around that time. 

I am not sure what to do and need major help, please!!!!!!! I have been vomiting and all over physically ill, because I feel so bad for leaving."
uneqpl,659,2022-05-11,To everyone having a tough time.,shinobi_chimp,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/uneqpl/to_everyone_having_a_tough_time/,"I know how hard it is.  Trust me.  


I decided to go back to school at 38.   I took Calc in high school, but that was in 1995.  I remembered NOTHING.   I'm a fairly bright guy, but I haven't been the smartest kid in the room since sixth grade.   I had a full-time job, a wife, and an elderly parent to care for.  I was also massively depressed and drank far more than I should.  


I CRATERED.  Every semester, hell...every WEEK I told myself I'd just dig deep and try harder.  Every week I fell further behind.  My stubborn ass knew I could just do it better next time. My school threw my stubborn, underachieving ass out.  


I enrolled in a local community college to knock out some core stuff, and I did something I couldn't possibly do: After years of being miserable, I asked  for help.  Turns out, I respond very well to a little bit of therapy and a low-dose antidepressant.   After two years, my original school let me back in, and Covid hit, which didn't make anybody's life any easier.  When some students were studying until three, I was bartending until 3.  It was brutal. Was.


This week, I'm picking up my diploma.  I had no internship and was worried about the job search (especially with my barely rehabbed GPA) but I accepted a great job last week.  After years of struggling, after years of being broke, I just changed my entire motherfucking life.  This was an absolute bastard, but finishing it means everything to me and my Wife.  


To everyone out there: If my dumb depressed drunk ass can do it, so can you.  Please be a little smarter than me and ask for help if you need it.  It sucks, but it can change your life.  I wish you all the best, and thanks so much to everyone on this sub who posted stories like mine."

I’m a university student looking to get a devops internship.

I’m proficient in Python, decent with Linux, have a fair understanding of networking, have made CRUD projects etc.

I have gotten together a few resources for learning some of the tools and plan to build a few projects demonstrating my knowledge (mainly EC2 stuff)

What do you guys like to see for interns applying to devops internships (esp if no formal job experience yet)

For a few of my peers who got into devops role was that aside from questions related to Linux or networking that anyone should know, they were asked about the projects they made.

What do you guys like to see in a candidate that you’d hire?

Also, acloudguru has a devops learning path. Anyone know if it’s worth going through?

ungjhm,1,2022-05-11,Tumor Senior Project,Xyrku000,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ungjhm/tumor_senior_project/,"I am starting a project with a biology major. We are both undergraduate seniors and I am a computer science major. I have taken business intelligence so I know something about Hadoop and other data science technologies and strategies but I don't have a background in statistics. I am starting a data engineering internship in the next week and I am comfortable with SQL Server and vaguely remember some Python concepts.

The project's goal would be to use a database of different tumors and figuring out which ones are cancerous using big data software and techniques. Then I can get it on my resume as a little exposure to data science before I do my MS in data science, and he can publish it in a medical journal.

Any advice would be appreciated! Can Hadoop work on a database that's already structured data? How do I start from the CS side of it?"
ungzwk,1,2022-05-11,Should I stop trying to grow at work?,Nice_Raisin,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ungzwk/should_i_stop_trying_to_grow_at_work/,"I’m sure the answer can’t come from anyone but myself, but I’d like others’ perspectives. 

Some background info: 
1) I grew up poor, and made a promise to myself to never live paycheck to paycheck. 
2) I was the first of my family to go to college, and chose to focus on a fairly lucrative career path (Accounting).
3) Busted my tail as an intern in public accounting, got my MBA, got my CPA license, and joined the corporate rat race.
4) Fast forward 15 years, and now am an Associate Director of Controlling for an Animal Health pharmaceutical company and make enough to live very comfortably; working 3 days remote and 2 in the office.

My problem is that I’ve always had this drive to “make it to the top” and be “successful”, but I fear that may have been my fear of poverty. I’m still young in my career (37), but I’m in a really good spot with work. My managers keep wanting to grow me, but I don’t know if I should take that risk. Things are good. But on the other hand, do I want to stay in the same position doing the same work for the next 15-20 years?

I don’t want to come off as ungrateful, or unmotivated, but I kind of like kicking my feet up during the slow periods and focusing on life outside of work.  

So, should I stop trying to grow professionally and maybe focus on personal growth? If so, how would I broach that conversation with my managers that I’m uninterested in growing without painting myself in a negative light at work?"

I went from very minimal python experience to being able to write code with solutions. This other tech company reached out to me for a summer internship position and I jumped at the opportunity. 

They sent me a programming task to do, and I started but I found that it took me a significant amount of time. I got halfway to a solution through googling and other methods, but still wasn’t all the way there on my own. My code was also admittedly a little sloppy. 

I reached out to a more experienced programming friend and we went over it together. We talked through the solutions and I understood why and how they decided to implement the changes they wanted to implement. I understand why they made the changes to the code they made and it made sense to me, but I felt embarrassed and frustrated I hadn’t gotten all the way there on my own. It makes me doubt if I should even go forth with this internship. 

My friend says it’s fine and that my understanding seems to be good, or else we wouldn’t have been able to talk through the solution, but I still feel really stupid. Granted, this friend has more experience than me and has been at it for a longer time.

I've long, long suffered from mental health troubles. I've always felt like I was the last, the worst, the dumbest, the most inadequate. I suffer from overwhelming anxiety and crushing feelings of worthlessness. I am very attached to my mum because essentially she's always, ALWAYS been there for me even at my absolute worst. She's my greatest source of emotional stability and connection in a sea of uncertainty and fear.

I studied and graduated in my country, but the job market in my country is cr*p, so after several years of NEETting and being depressed I had to move to Germany to get a second MSc. During this time, I came close to taking my own life multiple times out of sheer anxiety and loneliness - every time it ended with a phone call with my mum where I'd have an ugly cry and she'd try to convince me that I'd be fine in the end. Which I always was. Against all odds, I managed to graduate and make friends.

Then the pandemic came. I went back home because it was the most logical thing, and I stayed unemployed for a while after graduation because I couldn't find anything in my country. My mental health struggles reared their ugly head again, and in the end I only managed to find a terrible low paid job in Germany, which I only managed to take because Germany feels relatively safe and close to home and the idea of being able to see my family with a short flight felt comforting.

Now I've been accepted for a 6 months internship in NYC. It's the UN. And it's paid. I couldn't say no. So I said yes.

But I'm scared.

NYC is so far away. I know no one there. It's a difficult place, competitive, overwhelming even for the most mentally stable people on Earth. It's crowded and hectic. The heat in summer can be terrible. Everything is crazy expensive and my stipend will barely cover rent for a room in some poorer neighbourhood. I am 30 and the idea of still doing internships while my friends my age are working and living their lives feels frustrating and adds to my beliefs about always being the worst at everything. But it's not like I'm turning down any other job offers and also I assume that I will be able to find better ones after this internship.

I already turned down opportunities in the past due to anxiety, and I've always regretted it. This time MUST be different. I'm tired of regretting things and wasting time listening to my insecurities. If I'm 30 with next to no work experience it's only because I've spent so many years turning things down.

I just need to survive these 6 months. I know deep down I am excited but I cannot even feel the excitement because I am so scared. I am scared of this new adventure and I am also scared of my mental health collapsing again.

Some people told me ""just take it, you will find ways to manage as you always did"". My mum told me we'll have Skype calls every day and 6 months will pass very quickly and then I'll feel proud and I'll have a killer line on my CV. My friends are encouraging me to go and telling they'll come visit as soon as they can. Someone gave me the numbers of acquaintances living in NYC who might be able to help me. They also told me that this internship proves I'm actually smart and worth something and I can do great things in life (which I still do not believe anyway).

But I'm still scared. Last week I had a total breakdown and I came this close to jumping off the balcony because the fear and dread felt so immense and painful but at the same time I could not live with the idea that I might turn down this potentially life changing opportunity due to anxieties that only exist in my head. Now I feel a lot better, I'm no longer at that low point, but I'm scared to go back there again.

I've also had people telling me to turn it down if it makes me feel so bad but it's not gonna happen. I know it would only be worse afterwards because it would feel like the ultimate failure. I wanna put strategies in place to enjoy this experience as much as I can without letting it get the best of me but I don't know how to.

(disclaimer: I already have a therapist and take meds, but sometimes it's not enough)"
unj7fm,2,2022-05-11,Internship - Better to have a big brand name or missions and framework that we like ?,KLBS38,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/unj7fm/internship_better_to_have_a_big_brand_name_or/," 

Hello everyone,

I am about to start a 6 month internship and I am facing a complicated choice. I have the choice between two internships in cs. One in a very big company manufacturing sports goods in data science and another in a small luxury company in digital marketing (45-50 billion turnover for the first company against 60 million for the second).

The large company is internationally known and I would have no problem selling that name for future interviews, especially since that name would allow me to get many more interviews than I do now. However, the small company has missions that I like more and the living environment is the one I would like to live in later (the internship is not in my country of origin but one bordering mine in Europe)

If you were me where would you go? It should be noted that I have only had a few internships before in very small companies, so I don't have any big names on my resume if it can be useful for the future.

I thank you for your attention and I wish you a very nice day!"
unj7gw,2,2022-05-11,Unsure how to actually start making decent money fresh out of college,Stakoonum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/unj7gw/unsure_how_to_actually_start_making_decent_money/,"Hi,

I am about to graduate from my college with a computer science degree. I was *supposed* to graduate this month but screwed up and have to take a summer course, so I guess I will wait until I get it to even bother?

Currently I work as an intern at a tech consulting company. I am pretty unhappy with it; it pays $16/hr and I started it during college so they gave me very limited hours to where I am making like $1400 a month. Plus my exact role was supposed to be doing tech support, but instead I kinda got funneled into dispatching tickets to tech support people. Plus I don't like it; tech support is not my ambition, nor is taking phone calls like what I'm doing now. My prior job was tech support too, and I hated it; no offense to tech support people but I honestly think anyone can land these jobs. And it makes my degree not even be used.

I guess I'm unsure what I want to do. I am pretty good at programming, I touch Python every day, I host my own stuff (discord bots and websites) on my own VPS, I have experience with Cloudflare, I know Java, and I've made websites using HTML, CSS, Nginx and Django, and I know SQL. I took 2 software engineering classes in college too.

As of late I've been looking into entry level software engineering positions, but the only ones I can find are behind the infamous talent acquisition companies, which lock you into 2 year contracts. And for other fields I've looked at I seem pretty unqualified. I don't want to be locked into a 2 year if I hate the job, especially not in my current mental state (i'm pretty depressed lol). I've had some interest in doing data analyst stuff (because Python and bc I know SQL), but it can't be that easy to make lots of money right? 

So I was wondering if anyone has any advice. Should I just bite the bullet and do talent acquisition? Should I get another internship? Should I explore other fields? Should I just wait until I get my degree? Basically how do I make my degree and tuition I paid not a waste.  

Ideally I would love a remote job, most jobs I can find here are in the city (NYC) which is not too far but also not too close. And it'd be a hassle to commute there every day; tons of mileage on my new car that I am also still paying off.  

Thanks!"

I'm just kind of thinking that maybe it'd be good to dress nice, even if there's no dress code.

How would you guys go about this?

A lot of good advice here, thanks for the responses. Sounds like a polo with jeans or khakis is the way to go. I'll probably buy a new pair of sneakers so I have something more clean for work.

i got off the waiting list for duke and penn and am extremely grateful for both, did not think i could make it to either schools tbh. 

i am thinking of doing econ/business/finance and maybe trying cs in college. i was admitted to CAS for both schools. i have no idea which school to choose rn. i feel like penn has more prestige and it’s an ivy league so it might “easier” to secure internships and jobs in the future but at the same time i’ve heard of how competitive it is to even make into consulting clubs on campus. i feel like duke is a more laid-back environment with a bit more fun given it’s whole basketball hype and school spirit and def has more flexibility with what majors and classes i can declare/take. 

honestly i have no idea which school to choose, so i would really appreciate any input … thanks in advance friends"
unmg3b,2,2022-05-11,Is a MS in Analytics an appropriate step for me?,Odd_Background_6522,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/unmg3b/is_a_ms_in_analytics_an_appropriate_step_for_me/,"Hello Reddit, I am a semi-recent college grad, currently working for a financial regulator SRO. My goal in the next 5 or so years is to work as as a data analyst or programmer. I'm trying to figure out the best way to achieve this goal, and I'm strongly considering a graduate degree. However, I'm not sure what my chances are of getting accepted into a program, or what the right program would be.

To give you a little background, I graduated from Michigan State in 2019 with a BA in Economics. I had a 3.33 GPA and worked a couple internships as well as a part time student job during school, but nothing too special. After graduating, I moved to the DC/Maryland/Virginia area where I got a job at FINRA. I worked in their call center for a little under two years, before getting promoted to a new department working as an investigative analyst in fixed income where I monitor for market manipulation. My work is very analytical, which I enjoy a lot, but I want to work more on the back end of everything, working with programs such as SQL, Python, and languages alike. I've taken the initiative to self-learn these things, but learning these in a school environment is just more fitting for me. I've done some research on different graduate programs in the DMV (GW, UMD, VT, GMU, etc.), and they all seem to differ in curriculum, so I'm not sure what best suits me for the career I want to have. What also worries me is that my education and work history may not be good enough to get accepted into a nearby program. I'm not in any big rush to go back to school, but I do want to set the right path for myself once I'm ready to go back.

So Reddit, do you have any advice? Is a MS in analytics the right program for what I want to do in the future? Will my education and short work history hinder my chances of getting into programs in the DMV? Will I have to rely on a good GMAT/GRE score?"

Undergrad at a well-known R1 state school. Poli sci major 3.65 GPA with a 3.85 GPA in-major. Leadership position in campus Model UN, mentoring program, studied abroad, and worked a 15-20 hour per week job for a major D1 athletic team. Did an internship with a global affairs non-profit after graduation. Have been waiting tables and studying for the LSAT for several months to try and save some money but have recently reconsidered law school in favor of MPP/MPA/MIR. 

Became very interested in foreign policy/international relations late in college. Would have two solid letters of rec from established professors in each field. COVID kind of threw a wrench in the end of my undergrad. Just as I was finding some passions, college was basically over for me as I graduated early to save money. 

I have a million questions about these masters programs but have no idea where to start. Would love to go to as good a program as possible and eventually work on federal level foreign policy/international affairs. 

- how competitive is the process for this field?
- is prior work experience necessary/how much of a difference would it make on an application?
- how important is research experience?
- what are some top schools?
-  do I have a shot at them?"

I failed to mention the Leadership Principles in the only behavioural question he asked and hence didn't get selected.


2nd time - Off-Campus, got rejected in 2nd round because my interviewer was in a terrible mood due to some hand pain and wasn't interactive at all.


3rd time - Amazon visited our campus for Full-time positions, but in the 2nd round, my entire time was spent solving one question. That question, I solved in optimal time and space but since the norm is to solve 2 questions each round I got rejected. Received the mail today.



During the 2nd and 3rd rounds, I mentioned Leadership Principles and the interviewers seemed pretty impressed with my answers. 

Everyone seems to be bagging jobs at Amazon after coding for 1 year. I have been coding past 4 years right from my first year and this makes me feel disappointed and I seem to lose my confidence.

It's a super tempting offer, but I've already invested a lot into UF, even leasing an apartment this past month. I've also received my AA this semester through dual enrollment, have FL Prepaid, Bright Futures, and applied for an engineering program for this summer at the campus. With additional expenses, UF will cost me about 10-12k per year.

I've already looked into both programs and they largely seem equal in terms of quality, but of course, one school slightly has the upper hand in overall national recognition over the other. I don't mind staying in Nashville, and Gainsville looked nice when I toured there a few weeks ago. I'd also have to start fresh in Tennessee, which might take a toll on my mental health at first, but I've heard that Vanderbilt has one of the happiest students in the nation.

My question is, should I drop everything and choose Vandy instead? They're both very different schools, but it would still be hard to give up such an opportunity, especially for research, networking, and job prospects, which are all excellent. I also plan to go for a master's, which means I should definitely avoid more debt, even though 20k/12k per year from either school isn't typically hard to recover from with a CS degree. Although the cost of living will definitely be higher for Vandy. Please help!!"

WGU offers a Information Technology BS and a Cyber Security BS. Here is a link to the courses.

Cybersec: https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html
 
I plan to get my CompTIA+ before I enroll because I want to start building experience. But these courses are loaded with alot of certs which could be more bang for the buck. The only draw back to this from my perspective is I'm unsure if WGU is a respected school (though it seems most of you say degrees are just for HR firewall) and then lacking networking and intern/co-op programs that I'd have access to at a college locally. 

Thanks so much for the replies everyone. It has really helped. I'm thinking my best course is to get my A+ and try for a entry position, go to school locally to take advantage of co-ops and internships. Then complete a BS though WGU unless things change between now and then. Appreciate all your comments, suggestions, and insight."

I've always had interest in web development since I was a child.

For example, I have a browser game which I've been working on for about 2 years. And I enjoy every part of it, even if I need to learn or draw something I give hours to do that without any pain.  
But when it comes to others job, paid-jobs, regular jobs which you go everyday, I don't enjoy. Yes nobody enjoys that, but believe me I am near to hate. I've tried working in companies a lot of times. But the stress in this industry making me sick.

Maybe there is some psychological problem behind it, because -- 

&gt;When I was in highschool when I beginned professionally coding websites my teacher offered me a job in a company as something below intern, I mean like a tutorial job before real life. I was going that office after school for about 4 hours or something.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It was my first job experience in this industry and to be honest I didn't know much about web development, I knew stuff but not enough to build customer websites. Sadly the company didn't have anybody besides me for web development. They were trying to implement web services for their bussines so they were trying to see if it fits for them or not with me. They were not a web dev. agency, they were advertising agency and they were trying to make a side-job which they can offer to their customers. And I was this side part's main person. A child with less knowledge.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I worked there with a lot of stress but I couldn't leave because I had a promise to my teacher. I've worked so hard. Mentally. I build 1 website in 1.5 months but I was pushing myself so much.  
&gt;  
&gt;I remember that one night I was crying in my bed because tomorrow I had a presentation to the client himself. I was totally forgot about school, I was just focused my after school job which is 3-4 hours...  
&gt;  
&gt;And one day, I wrote a note in my computer in the office and never came back there. 

After this job in high school, I had many many experiences in other agencies. Every each of them ended same.

I quit, I leave, I escape, I wrote notes etc.

I just couldn't handle the stress of this industry. 

I've worked in other areas like in some supermarkets etc. And it was easier. 

Years passed. I am now almost 23 and I give all my life on this industry. My education my university was about web development.

I give lot to this and take nothing back.

Now I don't want to work as a developer in some random office every day.  
To be honest, I have not enough knowledge to work in a office. Because I like working for myself, I learned stuff for my own. I learned what is best for me, not what is best for them. So my style and my tools my knowledge is enough for my own stuff, not industry standarts...

But I like digital art. My drawing is not worst but not good at all.

I like coding but as I mentioned for myself. My own projects. Web, mobile, desktop etc. but just for my own needs.  


What should I do, my family expects me to work. I am a grown man.

I'm a high school senior who is graduating in a few weeks and will be taking a gap year before I start college.  I was wondering what I should do with this time.

My initial plan was to try to find a summer internship, but from my (somewhat brief) research, it seems that most companies are not interested in HS students/grads.  Have any of you had success with this?  My grades are pretty decent, and I've done some projects which I would consider pretty cool, specifically an OpenCV based Rubik's Cube solver.

However, if an internship is not really realistic, I would just spend time on building some projects, would you guys have any suggestions in this regard either?  For instance, is it better to work on my own my own personal projects, or should I contribute to a larger initiative?

Also, an internship would be preferred for another reason.  I only applied to three colleges this year and only got into my safety, so I'm going to be applying again next year to hopefully get into some better schools.  I'm pretty sure an internship would look better on an application than some projects would?

What do you all think?  Thanks for any help.

I work at a Dublin based SME as a Java developer. I have been at my company for a year and as a result my first salary review is coming up. I joined as a grad on a salary of 35k. I also completed a 6 month internship at a separate company as part of my degree prior to this.

I’d like to hear your thoughts on what I should be asking for in my salary review. I was thinking of asking for something around the 45k mark. The reasons for this are that I have three friends starting as grads this year starting on salaries ranging from 38-43k, the company specific knowledge I have gained over the last year and inflation. Do you guys think that this is reasonable?

Also, if you guys have any salary negotiation tips I’d like to hear them as I haven’t had to do one before.

If we are to upload a CSV file, we will need to enter the information of all devices we want to add, but our client does not want to manually add them, they want to automate the process of capturing hardware and software information. Can any of sysadmins give me some ideas on how to approach this problem? I tried finding answers for this online but I have been unsuccessful 

I know that within a network, we can scan for devices and the information gets capture automatically, but what about remote devices? There are many remote devices used by the company and instead of manually entering details for each device in a CSV file, the company would like a method for automating the process of capturing this information"
uo5lqa,25,2022-05-12,American way of parenthood,Iwarrior01,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/uo5lqa/american_way_of_parenthood/,"I recently saw some posts advocating the American way of parenthood and criticizing the idea of elderly respect. The one key point among the post was stressing the rights we would get after being able to live that way but in my opinion the duties outweigh the rights in the Indian context.

Firstly, how will you earn enough money in the 16 to lets say 20 age group to be able to pay the rents of your house, afford daily groceries and other expenses. The petty jobs in India are really really cheap and tiring. In the American context, a shop helper or sitting at a movie ticket counter or similar jobs can make you enough money to deal with your expenses but in India, these easy to do jobs are not easily accessible, not enough pay and are seen as third class jobs.

And if you are able to earn such amount of money, I dont think parents will bother you anymore as they will be secure of your future, I know giving example from my own life and extending it is wrong, but still, my cousin had really strict parents, but he started doing IT internships under NGO or for free when he was in 9th class. His parents were furious on him but he kept doing that and got a good internship in his mid 11th class that paid him 20k a month. They stopped bothering him anymore and proudly regard their son of his achievement and are OK with him not joining an IIT and studying in a normal govt college.

Most Youtubers I saw talk about the same thing too. Their parents were against them investing time on YouTube, but as soon as they understood the money potential and the future aspects of their work, they allowed them to go ahead with that career. 

I would just like to conclude by saying that you must prove your parents that you are capable enough to manage the independence you desire and that the perks you get living with your parents outweigh the duties you would have to face once you decide to live independently"

I live in a small city, have about 2.5 years of experience at a small company. I started with 40k salary as a freshgrad, but I managed to get muntiple raises, and now getting about 60k salary. But when I talked to some of my friends who graduated at the same time, and they all started at around 60k, now getting paid 80k-90k in the same city. So I was basically getting robbed for 3 years, but honestly I had 0 internship, Covid happened, so I had to take any job.

I was fine, until recently I started to stack a lot of responsibilities. Sometimes the code won't even get reviewed because ""they trust me"", pushed to prod, then I get blamed on for bugs. We sometime have to push to prod without tests because we are so understaffed, and the blame again comes to me for any more bugs. Along with the fact that we had to return to office without any option to WFH, and little to no raise because they are a ""small company"", I decided to hunt for a new job.

For about a month, I got a ton of response back with initial screening. So I had to take my lunch hour, or often time off, to do these interviews. Same thing with tech rounds, I had to take time off. Along with the fact I have to grind LeetCode after a full day of coding for work, I started to feel very burnt out.

No real progress, other than my LC is getting slightly better? But then whenever I see LC Medium-Hard and don't know then solution, it just keeps discouraging me. Maybe I'm not a worthy programmer.

My everyday has been: commute, work, commute, LC, interview, sleep. I don't know how much I can do this. I don't want to keep working for a place with lack of coding structure. Every rejection, every ghosted application keeps drowning me into sadness. I still don't know how to cope with it.

After graduating from high school, I did an apprenticeship for one year and after that i had to study to become an IT specialist. Since that was ""too boring"" for me, I dropped out after one year and started my computer science studies.

So I have already gained 1 year of full time experience before studying. During my studies I was always self-employed. I have a successful app, from which I can live without doing anything. I have also done several freelance projects. In parallel, I had a five-month mandatory internship during my studies.

My studies are now over with an A average.

I am still considering whether to stay self-employed or go into a full-time job.

Since I've been programming since I was 12 and have been self-employed with it for some time, I personally wouldn't call myself a normal ""graduate"" without experience.

Can I count my self-employed time as YoE and possibly not enter as a ""new graduate""?

I’ve recently been looking up old classmates on LinkedIn and I came across the profile of a girl who used to bully me in primary/middle/high school. I’ve always struggled with extreme social anxiety and coming off as awkward/immature, and it’s been difficult for me in past intern roles to connect with my peers or other people in the office (though not for lack of trying). I’m also extremely conflict-averse and have difficulty standing up for myself in general. I was already super nervous to start this internship in June, but as luck would have it, this girl is accepting a role in the same company, at the exact same office as part of the rotation program… I’m just hoping she won’t be assigned to my particular work group. I already elected the hybrid work modality option, so there’s a chance I’ll run into her at the office even if she’s not part of my group. This girl used to say nasty things about me to my face in front of our friends starting in primary school and is the reason I lost most of my friends in middle school. Even though we went to different high schools, she had a part-time job at the test prep place I went to and sometimes we attended the same inter-school events, where she would sneer at me and talk shit about me to the friends I went with so they’d look down on me. Although my social anxiety and non-confrontational nature have led me to get picked on by many people throughout my life, she’s the one bully who stands out in my mind as the one who had the most power over me and caused me to feel like shit about myself. It doesn’t help that she’s really pretty, intelligent, and socially skilled and has a much more impressive resume. I feel like dirt compared to her and the mere thought of running into her causes me so much dread… if I ran into her at the office I know I’d be paralyzed with fear and constantly paranoid and stressed. I’m seeing a CBT therapist right now and have tried several medications for the social anxiety, but nothing has helped with my chronic low self-esteem or the anxiety. I don’t know how to cope with possibly encountering her in the office and it’s frankly freaking me out. Any advice or tips about this would be appreciated, as well as advice about managing conflict/social anxiety in the workplace in general."

I lead data endeavours in my team and I’m at a senior position in my current company where I work with a lot of new technologies.

My system design, and what I believe was my bar raiser round (from a member outside the team I am getting hired for) went really well imo. The other two I’d rate myself between 75-80% (was very close to achieving optimal solution for coding question 1; answered most of the questions and cross questioning for coding question 2 - but felt that the interviewer was not completely happy).

In the recruiter call I had — I was told that I’ve been mapped to SDE-1 position per my interviews, though I’m a strong SDE-1 and can work out a promotion plan with my manager.

I haven’t received the entire offer yet, but I’m really disappointed (in myself definitely). I feel I could have done better, but at the same time, I feel my system design and bar-raiser interviews went really well. I almost feel like there is a mistake, but that’s probably not the case.

I mean, I’m seeing the obvious — I just didn’t perform at the level of SDE 2. But I feel the distinction of SDE 1 vs SDE 2 can be the system design which went really well for me. SDE 1 is usually a college hire or 1-2 years’ experience kinda role from what I understand.

Any suggestions, comments or help here? I want to take up the SDE role as it is a ~35% pay hike, but I also feel that I’m stepping down from what I currently do.

To add to that, I was suggested that I might be a good fit for another role - Data Engineer, and I can interview for that role with 1-2 more rounds (to judge in areas that I wasn’t judged for during SDE interview). Now I’m also worried if I go for this new option, then will I lose my SDE-1 role as well, in case I don’t clear it?"

TLDR: found better opportunities so I no longer starve because of low paychecks. Boss cut my hours after receiving my two weeks as he felt I disrespected him by mentioning better pay and benefits. Sorry for the rant. Going through it.

Let me start by saying that I have job hopped frequently since COVID started due to necessity, homelessness, medical bills, etc. I've worked in fast food, retail, pharmacy, counseling, etc. I usually follow the best pay and hours in order to survive since I am still a college student. Absolutely none of my jobs have ever questioned, disrespected, or doubted my two weeks. They all thanked me for the formal letters I've written and some have even offered me promotions to keep me from leaving, told me to come back if I ever needed a job there, etc. I don't like burning bridges.

I've won awards from a lot of my jobs for great work ethic, best numbers, best customer service, etc. I dedicate way more to these shitty paying jobs than is necessary, but I'm anxious and eager to please unfortunately. Ass kissing pays the bills.

I found a job that semi related to my anticipated field a few months back and got hired at a striking $14 an hour. This particular job deals a lot with sexual health and wellness, so I didn't mind the low pay if it meant I got to help people. 

Well boy was I wrong. I soon found myself in positions of constant sexual harassment from customers. I had vibrators thrown at me, customers who followed me around or stalked me on social media, etc. My boss didn't give a shit and pretended to do something but he couldn't even get us REAL security camera to protect us. Typical. To make things worse, I was constantly falling behind on bills and couldn't even afford groceries with my paycheck. I was doing all of this and my boss refused to increase my hours or give me benefits since I was still in college, even though I am pursuing an online asynchronous degree.

After a while I got sick of it and started keeping an eye out for other jobs. I was nearing the end of my senior year in college and was nearing the end of my internship with a huge (international) healthcare company. A few weeks before I was done the semester, I was stopped by an old colleague of mine in the center and was told to apply for a position within the company that fit my exact anticipated career. The job would pay significantly better and offer benefits after only 20 hours a week. In addition, it was completely remote and any travel would be compensated for both time AND mileage. I applied, interviewed, and was offered the job practically instantly as I had already been interning with the company for months. My position services half of my state and the service is growing in popularity, so I instantly have much needed job security. 

I wrote up a very polite, formal, and carefully written two weeks notice and sent it to my boss. I came in this week to find my hours slashed (down from 37 to only 20) and my coworkers all tell me how he wanted me fired for making mention of ""better compensation and benefits"" in my resignation. It took a screaming match between my manager and my boss to keep me on as an employee but I'm still missing two entire shifts because my boss didn't appreciate my notice. I'm being let go four days before my notice states, too. I won't be able to pay my rent because of some petty games my boss wants to play. I can only hope my fiancee's increased hours can float us until I get settled into the new job. I didn't even have to give notice, let alone a formal written letter, but either way I was fucked over for the courtesy I gave.
 
I'm tired of being a replaceable cog in some fucked up machine. I'm praying this new job is better for me mentally as it's exactly my passion in life. It'll be nice having my nights and weekends back, too."

I'm flying out to an internship in a week and my burning up laptop is not doing me justice with all my programming, so I'm considering buying myself one and giving this one I have to my parents. But I'm not that rich and need help navigating the best deal. I'm not so good with laptop terms either (still learning) so if I get something mixed up lmk

 Here's my answers to the questionnaire:

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**

If it is worth it, I will splurge a maximum of $1500 USD, but this will make me cry. I am trying to save money for rent and stuff so I would prefer to spend under $1000 USD.

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**

No, mainly because I don't trust them...like I think it will stop working the moment I use to for a week. So preferably a new one (:

* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

Best battery life ever is a must. I'm not good at staying in one spot when I'm studying and I like to be outside when I program, so it isn't great to have to sit still plugged in all the time. Although a 2-in-1 would be cool, I have an IPad air so I think it's useless. I do want a really high quality display. I have used Intel iCore machines my whole life but am interested in getting a Ryzen device.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

I am that person who carried as little as possible in her backpack, so preferably something on the lighter side.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

N/A

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

I run Adobe sometimes, especially since I'm getting into fashion design. Otherwise, not really. I don't have much time for games. I do utilize some data analysis software for my studies (i.e. Capstone), and they really burn up my current laptop. Although I don't play games I plan on coding some in the near future as a side hobby.

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

Sometimes my brother plays games on my laptop so the most usable settings would be nice.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

A good keyboard that lights up since I work for hours at night. Maybe something that reduces blue light? I have glasses for it so this isn't a must but it would be cool since I hate wearing my glasses and I always lose them.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

I know a lot of ppl recommend MacBooks, but I am not really interested in getting an Apple product for my laptop. I have used Windows my whole life and I just prefer it. I do plan on looking into Linux but don't know if it's fully necessary since I am not sure where I am going yet career wise. But I am hoping this new laptop can get me through the rest of my college career, internships (pray I get one next summer), and the early years out of college, so this would be a 5+ year longevity. 

Thank you for the help!"

uok0v9,14,2022-05-13,"Supervisor ignoring my messages, unable to progress, stress and stuck",Holiday-Plan8883,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/uok0v9/supervisor_ignoring_my_messages_unable_to/,"Hi redditors, I am currently pursuing my diploma and in order to finish the diploma, each student have to go through a credited internship at a company.  


I am currently interning as a software developer and every day it is Work from home. Being an intern with 0 work experience related to coding, I came in with a growth mindset, very motivated to learn about new technologies etc. However, the current situation I am in right now is very stressful but not for the things you think it is. As an intern, I know nothing. I tend to ask supervisor questions via slack (a collaborative platform for messaging). This is where the problem lies.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I message my supervisor, he would ghost me and not even reply to me. I 100% understand that I am an intern and I am a liability to the company/team and my colleagues are all very busy. Therefore, it is understandable for my colleagues/supervisor to take more than an hour to reply to me(not sure how long is the average time to wait for a reply). My supervisor would not even bother to give a reply like ""I am currently busy, I will get back to you in X minutes."" and straight-up ghost me even though he is online. I know that he ignored/ghosted my message because he replies to the other team channels. Hence, there is no way he would have missed my DMs and notifications. This has happened ALOT of times now and I just have a really hard time progressing on my task assigned and not sure of what to do.  


I have thought about telling it to my manager. The thing is, I have anxiety issues and messaging my supervisor is hard for me let alone telling my manager that my supervisor is unresponsive. Furthermore, I think that if I were to tell my manager that my supervisor is unresponsive, my supervisor would think that I somewhat snitched on him and thus ruining our rapport/relationship which I definitely would not want. Potentially giving me a bad grade for my internship.   


Because of this back and forth situation of him not replying countless of times. I felt that I have actually been very stressed and burntout. Initially, being motivated to unmotivated/stress/burntout to work. After working hours, I would be very nervous as I am scared of being scolded/fired at my internship because I have progressed little to nothing on my task. I can't even function/enjoy anything outside of working hours and would constantly be thinking about what to do tomorrow and can't wait for this internship to end. We have daily stand-up where we tell the team ""what we have done yesterday and what we are going to do today and if there are any blockers"", during this meeting I would always give really vague descriptions as I barely progressed. What is even worse is the sprint review, where we have to present what we did for the past 2 weeks. For the past sprint reviews, I manage to at least present a good amount because I somewhat know how to do it. But for this current sprint, I am afraid that because I do not how to do and my supervisor is unresponsive, I would be presenting literally NOTHING and just thinking about that makes me feel very stress and a shit load of anxiety. Furthermore, whenever I am assigned a task, the product owner would always ask my supervisor to explain it to me, but he would always give REALLY vague explanation. Due to the vague explanation, I will have to ofcourse ask him to elaborate, etc. This would take more time as he constantly ghosts me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried messaging my other colleagues other then my supervisor but this time my colleagues were very unfamiliar with the task I am doing (Not sure if they just don't want to help), some on vacation, and redirected me back to my supervisor. This leads me to not receiving help from my colleagues and not receiving replies from my supervisor. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is currently 3 more months till the end of this internship and in the next 2 weeks, my supervisor would have to give me an interim grade. I am afraid my supervisor would give me a very bad grade even though it is kind of his fault for not even replying me... I have decided that if my supervisor gives me a bad grade I would tell my mentor this issue. If he gives me a good grade, I don't mind just progressing little to nothing everyday, at least I am not bothering my supervisor and annoying the hell out of him. Though progressing little to nothing means I would have to present to my team close to nothing during sprint review which SUCKS.

This is my first time posting anything on reddit and I would like to seek some help from redditor on my current situation and what I could do. Thank you!"

So I'm in a pretty unique situation. I'm a California transfer student and I wasn't accepted into the near all of the colleges I applied to due to an error in the application, so I'm probably not going to be able to go to school fulltime for half a year to a year. Over the summer I'm planning on taking a class required to get into a lot of other schools, but beyond that I figured it would be ideal to get a job/internship in the meantime. The course is packed into the time frame of half a semester, so it would dampen my abilities to take on an internship. It would be really nice to get a full time job instead of an internship, but I'm not sure if that's really possible in my situation.

**So my questions are:** Is it feasible to get a junior level CS job in this situation, or will most companies require a bachelors/boot camp? Would employers pass over me considering I'd likely resign within about a year? If I don't go for a full time job, it worth it to wait till fall to take the mentioned course so that I have more time to do an internship over the summer rather than rely on the fewer amount of fall/spring internships? 

**Background:** I've had an internship before that has lasted for over a year, and my boss there said he would give me a letter of recommendation. I've done computer science since middle school with 5 CS classes in high school to back it up. I did a number of extracurriculars there, including working on a student-made app that is still in use on the app store. I've also done some personal projects, but none are public yet.

Any other general advice would also be appreciated, thanks in advance!"

I am about to start a 6 month internship and I am facing a complicated choice. I have the choice between two internships. One in a very big company manufacturing sports goods in data science and another in a small luxury company in digital marketing (45-50 billion turnover for the first company against 60 million for the second).

The large company is internationally known and I would have no problem selling that name for future interviews, especially since that name would allow me to get many more interviews than I do now. However, the small company has missions that I like more and the living environment is the one I would like to live in later (the internship is not in my country of origin but one bordering mine in Europe)

If you were me where would you go? It should be noted that I have only had a few internships before in very small companies, so I don't have any big names on my resume if it can be useful for the future.

I’m really proud of myself! I haven’t really shared these accomplishments to anyone even family, i try not to seem as i’m bragging. So far i’ve:
1. won the nomination to be president of a college club. 
2. passed all my classes this semester. 
3. I am doing an internship with i company i really like!
4. i just got a credit card that i have been waiting for.

I was genuinely curious how y’all celebrate your accomplishment."

So I'm currently in indonesia on a tourist visa visiting my girlfriend (indonesian citizen) and we've been discussing our future together because we really don't want to have to do long distance for a long time.

I'm a british citizen living in england and we'd both love her to move to the UK, or me to move there, but the issue is that the only way that seems viable is by getting married or living together for 2 years.

We are both 22 with my girlfriend in the final year of her psychology degree at the best university in indonesia and I've recently graduated with a first class bachelor's in computer science back home so we have qualifications. However, due to our age and the fact that we have only been dating for close to a year, we don't nessesarily want to get married straight away.

My gf was considering applying to internships in the UK(she can't afford to do a master's) because she desperately wants to leave jakarta and indonesia more generally.

I guess my question is this: does anyone know of any way that we could live together, whether its in one of our contries or another, without getting married? Is there any countries where it is easy for people to emigrate to from many other countries that we could call our home?

I just really see my future with this woman and love her more than anything. I'd love to move to the other side of the world for her and she seems willing to do the same for me."

A professor recommended me for an internship with a company working with IBM i software. I will be learning a language called RPG, that apparently isn't too well known. 
I wasn't going to take an internship at all, but they are paying well for an internship, and want me full time after I graduate, taking over for a retiring employee. 
But I'm twenty years old and I don't know if this is what I want to be doing for my entire life. Obviously. 
So I'm wondering if I'm hindering myself learning all about IBM I and RPG, and if this is actual experience that will aid me should I move on from this job? Should I be concerned about this? 

Thank you for any advice."
uosph1,16,2022-05-13,Can studying in Canada prove to be a good option?,somdevb,Indians_StudyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indians_StudyAbroad/comments/uosph1/can_studying_in_canada_prove_to_be_a_good_option/,"my\_qualifications: I'll be graduating in a month with a Btech in CS, with a CGPA of 8.6 on average. I don't have any research papers or experience to boast of, but I did have 4 internships during the course of my college life, all in the research-orientated field of machine learning. 

Owing to my interest, I am looking at specialized jobs such as MLE or Computer Vision Engineers, but since it's a niche, I guess doing an MS would prove to be beneficial. I have an average job at hand, paying me around 7 LPA, will it be a good decision to move to Canada for an MS in CS, preferably good universities such as UCB or the University of Toronto?

Is it a good idea? I am planning to start preparing for IELTS and GRE soon. I am targetting joining in the batch of 2023/24.

Also, what other parameters are taken into consideration while admissions?"
uothay,6,2022-05-13,The Popular Assholes in My High School Ended Up Successful In Life,FuckCapitalism1,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/uothay/the_popular_assholes_in_my_high_school_ended_up/,"It makes me angry and envious just thinking about it, I went to a decent public high school in an upper middle class area which sent many of their graduates to good universities, the place was supposedly filled with many intelligent people. Yet the culture was extremely toxic, people were unfriendly, ostracized and bullied those who they considered beneath them and were willing to do anything to become rich and successful. I was diagnosed with autism and placed in a special education program which in itself made me unpopular, many of my peers came in from my previous middle school who seemed to avoid and dislike me. On top of this I had severe complex trauma and possibly suffered from a undiagnosed learning disability, I did receive extra time accommodation on tests but I was forced to take a social skills class in which the teacher ended up being a vicious narcissistic bully that targeted me for being unhappy with her curriculum which never helped me socialize with my peers. Despite all this I made decent grades and had a few unpopular friends who eventually managed to abandon me because of my low status. By the end of high school I was practically a complete outcast, other kids avoided me like the plague and I had zero friends or acquaintances.

I ended up in a mediocre public university in a prestigious program, which I then dropped out of due to a combination of mental health issues, learning difficulties and difficulty switching majors. Since then I only managed to hold gig delivery jobs sacrificing my car for small amounts of cash, after that I found bottom of the barrel jobs in delivery, retail and sales, two of which didn't even require much of an interview, they ended up being disastrous and I quit within a week. I didn't let that deter me I managed to become a CA public notary, completed a Coursera bookkeeping certification consisting of 4 courses, got top ranking in CA state office assistant examinations, USPS examinations and managed to hold multiple volunteer positions in warehouses, caring for animals and coaching kids to play golf. Finally I managed to secure a temporary clerical position in the same city as my high school which also ended up poorly due to performance issues, past trauma and conflict with supervisor who treated me like an idiot because I was suffering cognitive issues. I managed all of this while getting mental health treatment, undergoing multiple hospitalizations due to suicide attempts, discovering I was a transgender woman, suffering gender dysphoria, having zero friends, acquaintances or social support, while living with my parents who were formerly abusive and contributed deeply to my trauma.

Recently I managed to look up my former friends and two popular students who were friends with one of my friends and every single one of them managed to achieve far greater success in life than me. Despite the fact that two of my friends had poorer grades in high school, seemed dumber, were less outgoing and went to worser schools, they still managed to get degrees, one of them in Computer Science and the other in Business, lived independently in dorms, had a social life and maintained connections to network with their peers. The guy who majored in business maintained a couple of jobs while in school, had photos of him with friends, and eventually ended up in NYC working a entry level job not requiring a college degree while doing coding bootcamps, Coursera courses, and computer technician courses and hoping to break into IT management. The other guy stayed in the same area but ended up unemployed. Both of them were relatively unpopular by the end of high school and had lower social status than me at certain points, the first guy was also diagnosed with a disability but managed to leave the special education program by the beginning of high school.

The two brothers I knew who were popular ended up massively successful, I hung out with them occasionally since childhood because we lived in the same area and they bullied me and treated me like trash. They always had an easy time making friends, were at or near the top of the social food chain. All of them were cunning, manipulative, power hungry, narcissistic, assholes, they seemed to have the greatest success with women, never struggled with anything and one of them was even blessed with being tall and handsome. One of them went to a top tier UC, while the handsome one who wasn't as bright went to a bottom tier one, the second guy managed a degree in Computer Science, ended up networking like crazy with mostly bullshit clubs, managed an internship and landed a job as a software engineer which he has managed to hold for 5 years. Now the fucker is enrolled in a MBA program from a semi-decent university, as usual that scumbag ended up having everything handed to him in life, and will probably end up switching to a better paying less technical role in management. At this rate he will probably join the leagues of sociopathic American CEOs and end up retiring early to a nice playboy mansion, yatch, private island and harem. The other completed a general degree from a good school and ended up as a software engineer in the Seattle area after spending 2 years unemployed. That guy seemed to have somewhat better character and personality than his brother.

This has led me into a deep cynical depression after realizing high school never ends, those at the top continue being successful and popular, while those at the bottom end up underemployed, unemployed or degree-less, friendless, and a complete failure. Even worse looks and connections pay somewhat more than intelligence or the university one goes to in life, as illustrated with the two brothers. Character and personality traits seem to have an inverse relationship with success with scummier people being somewhat more successful . The capitalist system just seems like a preying ground for malicious, sociopathic predators who possess mediocre to slightly above average intelligence. Hard work doesn't count for shit in America, nor can one overcome poor socioeconomic status, low social status, mental illness or disability. There's no starting over after high school or college, my inferior position in life was determined by the time I was at 18, perhaps even at birth when nature chose to curse me with disability and being transgender."

uoxdil,2,2022-05-13,Is it possible to do two internships at the same time?,IntrepidBuilding1836,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uoxdil/is_it_possible_to_do_two_internships_at_the_same/,"Hi guys,

I recently finished the internship process and was lucky enough to get two offers from companies I really like. The problem is I accepted my second-choice offer before receiving my top-choice offer, and I'm in a predicament where I don't want to reject the first one but still do the second one. I'd love to do both because I believe I can learn a lot of different things and get further career-wise, and ya boi broke so the extra money wouldn't hurt. The thing is, is it possible? They're full-time roles that would overlap for about 4-5 weeks, with one being completely remote and the other hybrid. I doubt they'd let me do two roles at once if I asked, so I'm wondering if anyone was in this type of situation before where they had to finesse their way through without their employers knowing. This is my first internship so idk how flexible companies would be around my time preferences and if I could keep scheduling conference meetings and such so that they don't overlap. Any insights would really help!

Enjoy the summer :)"

I'm doing an backend swe internship this summer and just found out they use C# and .NET which I don't know anything about. I only know Python, C, and a little bit of Java and I did my coding assessment/technical interviews in Python. They never asked if I knew C# and .NET in any of the interview rounds. And I didn't put it on my resume either or anything like that. 

Kinda scared and wondering where's the best place where I can learn it in the next 3 weeks before the internship starts?

Background: 1 year left for CS degree at current UC, have swe internship at top company lined up for Summer 2022. Only thing I would possibly be interested at UCSD is the career fairs/opportunities, entrepreneurship, and college culture (current UC doesn't have sports really). Issue is I really don't like math, so I'm hoping to focus on the CS side of Math-CS.

Really appreciate any feedback I can get.

up1z4y,1,2022-05-13,How can I get my PI to let me do this internship?,AllWeb90,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/up1z4y/how_can_i_get_my_pi_to_let_me_do_this_internship/,"Background: I'm a 4th year, pre-candidacy PhD (trying to achieve candidacy this year, knock on wood). In the next few weeks I'm completing the wet lab work supporting the seminal figures of my thesis. Worth noting, my PI dislikes me because honestly he dislikes all of his employees, but especially because I'm disabled. I need accomodations, extra time to complete work etc. and he thinks this is just an excuse to not do work (like I don't want to gtfo of here fast enough)

Current Situation: I think I have a good shot at an internship at a dream company. I have been interviewing for a computation internship for which my friend at the company personally recommended me. I already help/advise some of the projects she does so I know it would be a good fit and the hiring manager told me the same. They also told me it will lead to a job if I do well. Even if I don't get the position, the amount of bioinformatics I've learned in preparation for the interviews is the most I've learned in like the last three years in academia, it's been a blast!

Problem: I guarantee my PI will not let me go. It's 6hours away so I will have to relocate for the summer and put my thesis on pause for 3 months. 

How can I still do this internship (if I actually get it fingers crossed)? I was thinking of talking to one of my committee members who has grad students who have done bioinformatics internships before and see if I can get her support and maybe the assistant director of my program? How can I approach this discussion with my PI to make this happen? Has anyone else been in this situation before?

Also worth noting, there is no rational reasoning with my PI; he is an unreasonable man. Ex1: he complains about our lab manager taking time off to tend to his mother with cancer, despite the fact that we were all happy to pick up the managers work while he was gone. Ex2: when I had a panic attack about having to work indoors where no one else masks and started yelling: I don't want to die (because I have little to no active immune system), his response was: well we all have to get covid at some point anyway. 

I posted this in labrats as well, I will take all the advice I can get at this point.

Sorry for the long post. Any advice on how I can do this will be so greatly appreciated, I'm very anxious about this and it's stressing me out."

I've been searching for an entry-level data science position since the middle of March and have gone through a total of 13 interviews (data science or data analyst) with 5 companies so far, one where I did 3 behavioral and 1 technical interview, only to be told that the company went with someone with more experience.

I keep getting past the first level of interviews, passing technical interviews, and then being turned down. When I speak to the interviewers, they are visibly impressed with my background and what I've done and verbalize it to me, even when they send me the rejection, but I still receive no offers.

It might be the case that I am misreading the interviewers. However, if that were the case, why do I keep making it to the last round of interviews?

A little about my background:

I graduated in December with a master's of chemistry (physical and computational) where I had the opportunity to do research involving the use of machine learning to understand empirical observations. I knew I wanted to pivot into data science, so I redirected my efforts into honing my skills and completing two online boot camps, taking a master-level class for credit on data science at Carnegie Mellon University, built a portfolio showcasing some start-to-finish projects with initially messy data, got certified in AI fundamentals on Microsoft Azure, and participated in Kaggle competitions. 

My skillset includes many years of python ,some SQL, Tableau, Jupyter's notebook, and Git for version control. 

My issue is that I haven't had work experience aside from my research. Do I drop the master's degree off my resume? Would it make me more marketable? I'm already asking for \~60k salary and honestly, if I were offered 40k, I'd take it at this point.

Candidates with more experience are being offered positions I've interviewed for. Where do I get my experience if I can't even land entry-level positions? I can't even do internships since I'm not in a program.

Are there any skills that I should focus on that I'm missing? I'm currently aiming for an AWS certificate (started taking an udemy course for prep).

If you've made it this far, I appreciate you sticking around. This is mostly for me to get all this off my chest. I'm demoralized, but I'm not a quitter.

Any advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated!"

I want to leave to the US after I graduate in a year, preferably to LA or even the west coast. I’ll be looking to get a job in a tech/consulting sector, or going to grad school to land an offer in the US after that.

I think lots of people from HK have stated tons of reasons to leave - overwhelming societal pressure on a “work-first/career-first” culture that leaves little opportunities to develop elsewhere, extreme political uncertainty, astronomical housing prices, and a decline in many cultural/societal aspects in the past years. All of these are strong push factors for me. I’ve also realised that my mental state had been very poor for months before I left for LA, which I attribute to general unhappiness in living in HK.

Pull factors include a much kinder climate on my skin condition on the west coast, a nicer work-life balance/entrepreneurial culture, and a more suitable lifestyle for me. Having lived here for a semester, I know that LA is a perfect location for me in my low/mid-twenties.

My current situation:
- Single nationality (HK), no current options for alternate routes into US.
- Native in English and Cantonese, fluent in Mandarin.
- I hold an intern offer for a multinational consulting firm that I’m looking to convert to a full-time offer this summer. I’m grateful for this opportunity, and regardless of my future goals, I’ll put 100% effort into this internship.
- Previous experience interning at a global investment bank and in business development at an early-stage tech startup in HK.
- Technical experience - Python and VBA for data analysis in a professional setting, with university classes in Java and C/C++, also fully proficient in Microsoft office.

Options:
- First choice is going into work on the west coast straight after graduation, but I’m not entirely set on a single role. For tech, perhaps business development/non-technical, or something on track for product management, or an entry analyst role in consulting. Really looking for anything that can pay a sufficient wage in these two sectors - and is willing to sponsor my H1B.
- If not, I’m considering a masters in data science/something more technical than my business undergrad - Canada or US? Canada offers guaranteed permanent residency after graduation until 2026, which I’ll look to leverage into a TN visa, but US schools offer a more direct path + better reputation schools for US jobs (if I get in) + double entry into H1B lottery.
- Could also try to leverage my potential grad offer here or elsewhere in a multinational company to land an internal transfer - success potential may vary wildly, and requires staying and working, which makes this a less desirable option.

Questions:
- how likely is it for employers to take a foreign candidate straight out of grad? I’ve heard unlikely to essentially impossible given H1B lottery uncertainty + cost of sponsorship, so I guess networking is key.
-  How much better is it to convert a Canadian citizenship into a TN visa into a green card? Is it more likely?
- Real shot in the dark and a huge generalisation but how difficult is an internal transfer within firms? I’m not familiar with this process at all.

If I’ve missed anything obvious, I guess I’ll bring it up in the comments. Thanks for any help provided!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

**Social Studies Teacher:** I first met my teacher in junior year. She is the sponsor for one of my organizations and we’ve spent so much time together that she is practically my mom. She taught me how to tie a tie, taught me public speaking, and came to my award ceremonies. Her letter was three pages long (LOL). I was sobbing by the time I finished reading it (9/10)

**Spanish Teacher:** I’ve known my Spanish teacher for 3.5 years (had her freshman year). She has been my mentor throughout high school and her letter was so in-depth. She mentioned anecdotes of things I even forgot about. I was also crying by the end of this letter (I am fairly sensitive). (9.5/10)

**School District Superintendent:** It was pretty much a regurgitation of my resume, but it’s the School District Superintendent so I don’t know how much weight it held (??/10)

&amp;#x200B;

**Interviews** (no interviewer was local)

**Harvard** ***-*** This interview was in early/mid-March and the interview happened 36 hours after I was initially contacted via email. My interviewer graduated in the 70s so it was really hard for me to ask questions about current life at Harvard. He was incredibly kind and gave me so many tips on how to manage working and studying if I go to Harvard. He had a 45-minute ""timer"" during the interview and he was checking his watch after the interview went past 45 minutes (7/10).

**Yale** ***-*** I LOVED THIS INTERVIEW. We talked for probably 90 minutes. I thought my interviewer and I would have nothing in common since he was a recruited athlete in the 80s studying Finance, but we literally had so much in common. His mother was a teacher so we shared stories of kids doing funny things and overall it was just a fun time. (9.5/10)

**UPenn -** This was such a bad interview.  I remember asking questions and being told “I don’t know maybe check the website.” No disrespect to my interviewer since I was applying with a focus on educational studies which is slightly underrepresented I am sure information on the program isn’t as widely known. It was just very awkward. There was a lot of awkward silence (3/10).

**WashU Scholarship -** This was probably my most interesting interview. I ended up having to take it outside at a friend’s house because of conflicting schedules. It was a 20-minute interview and mid-way through it, my friend’s neighbor started blasting Gasolina by Daddy Yankee (some non-college-interview appropriate songs also followed). I didn’t know what to do so I just stayed out there for the rest of the interview. It was almost comical talking about my community service projects with children while Daddy Yankee rapped about shaking a\*\* in the background(5/10).

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**

**Common App Essay -** This singlehandedly was the worse essay I wrote throughout the college application process. I was having “too much fun” writing my supplements that I completely forgot to write my Common App Essay. I wrote it on January 1st at 8:00 PM and submitted essentially my first draft. I definitely sobbed after submitting - it was just bad. My essay topic was very cliché. I wrote about how growing up in a conservative community shaped how I advocated for issues important to me and how for so long my identity was suppressed because of the encroaching views of my community. I am definitely a lot prouder of my supplements. They were \*chefs kiss\*. I very much had a “my supplements will carry my application” mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information:**

I come from an underfunded school district that typically doesn’t send any students to T20 universities/colleges. I was the 2nd student in my county’s history (over 40 years) to have been accepted to Harvard (1st in school) and 3rd to be accepted to Yale (2nd in school). Roughly 30% of students go on to a 4-year college and 50% typically go to community college. I by no means think my extracurricular activities and academic statistics would have gotten me in had it not been for the context of my community. I feel like I definitely accomplished a lot relative to the resources available to me; however, I don’t feel like it would have gotten me in if I came from Miami or some other big, well-resourced city. Shout out to my suburban and rural peers: Don’t compare yourself to kids from NYC or whatnot. 

I ultimately decided that I will be attending Yale University! Go bulldogs! I’m not going to lie, this is not the decision I expected myself to make (I literally told everyone in my county I was going to Harvard prior to the commitment date, rip). Harvard was my dream school since I was 12 and my room had its fair share of Harvard merch hanging on the walls. I really believe that once you visit campus the allure of Harvard’s name fades away and you start looking at it very objectively. As “just another school” Harvard was very mediocre in my opinion."

Hello guys, just finished JC and like any student would do I started researching on all the courses I wanted to do. 
Being from PCME (78.5RP) I knew I wanted to do something in the area or Tech and so I narrowed down my options to NTU CEG and NUS EE. Please let me know any more additional pointers y’all feel are applicable. I’m currently leaning more towards NUS EE.

Pros and cons of each:

NTU CEG: 
Pros
- Computer engineering degree
- Easier to get halls


Cons 
- Outdated curriculum 
- Less internship opportunities
- S/U modules before seeing grades
- Poorer infrastructure and facilities 
- Unlikely to go overseas to study
- No Entrepreneurship opportunities 
- Campus located in the middle of nowhere and the monkeys 🙈 


NUS EE: 
Pros
- Great campus with great study infrastructure and facilities 
- Wide range of internship opportunities even lets u become a software engineer 
- S/U mods after seeing grades 👌👌
- Great opportunities if u work hard and look around for them
- Great alumni
- Good internship opportunities especially in Silicon Valley
- Decent campus location

Cons
- Need to work harder, future depends on this
- Tough curriculum and a less sought after degree
- Unlikely to get into competitive halls"

This is my first real job out of college aside from 2 internships and 2 co-ops. Lately, I have really, REALLY been struggling to keep up with my job. At any given time I’m managing 12-15 different things and I’m always confusing my projects, tasks, and what I need to do. I’m trying everything I can to stay organized, writing everything down, trying to improve my own system how I keep track of things, yet every time something slips through the cracks. Every time I turn around I’ve made a new mistake and seriously fuck up. 

The past couple weeks have been especially rough. I’ve been getting some tough criticism from my coworkers, customers, and even my boss because of my mistakes. I’m holding people up from their jobs, costing time, and pissing off my coworkers. I’m continuing to humiliate myself in front of everybody from what I don’t know or get confused. I always say I feel like I’m learning 8 different languages all at once, I’m always mixing them up,and they’re always changing. I’m constantly late on getting things done, and by the time I realize it’s late, it’s a huge issue already.

This week, my boss again reiterated how I’m struggling, and that I should be more independent at this point. She asked me what she could do to help and I honestly don’t know. Today, after making a mistake in front of a customer and making us look bad, I got a long, angry message from my coworker which she CC’d her boss in. He jumped in with even more frustration. It wouldn’t surprise me if they talked to my manager about me. I spent over an hour crying in the bathroom after that, I hit my breaking point. The past two weeks alone I have cried at least 4 or 5 times. 

I try really hard to not let my job affect my personal life, but it’s really starting to get to me, I constantly have this chip on my shoulder. I don’t even know at this point if I can be helped. 

In a month or two we will be having mid year performance reviews and I’m already terrified.  I *NEVER* get any form of positive feedback on what I’m doing right or even a mere thank you, because frankly I’m just not doing anything well. I’m seriously starting to wonder if I just can’t live up to the demands of this job and if it’s time for me to move on. That being said, I’m worried I’ll have the same problems if I go somewhere else. I don’t know how I can help myself or if there’s anything my employer can do for me, I just know I’m constantly holding my team back and feel I’m utterly failing at this job. 

If you were me, what would you do? Is it time I cut my losses and move on?"

Her and I have gotten really close. She recently invited me to her graduation dinner, she stated it’s just a few “close friends” I’m honestly honored to be considered a close friend of hers. 

I’m experiencing some social anxiety with meeting her friends, she’s told me a lot about them and she said they are excited to meet me. They are a successful group of women and women of color at that. I’m particularly  excited to meet and mingle with women who look like me. But I’m having the hardest time stepping outside my comfort zone. I even pondered finding an excuse to not be there but I don’t want to do this to her as she has been there for me. 

The weirdest part is I meet and talk to a lot of people for work, I never have an issue meeting anyone in the professional setting but this just really bugging me.

Long story short, I quit my job and decided not to take summer classes for this internship. Obviously, being summer, I don’t see myself finding another internship so I’m just going to enroll back into school to take more classes. The questions I have are 1) how crucial is it for me to have an internship for further job prospects? Should I delay my degree in order to get an internship? And 2) are there jobs that I could do that would look good on my resume when it comes to getting a software dev/engineer position in the future? I apply to Jr level positions all the time but it seems that the biggest limiting favorite is lack of experience. I appreciate any advice through this!"

A month ago i got my appraisal, my manager was all praise on my productivity but said the higher ups gave a bad hike due to budget issues ,  


I now basically make 20$ more after working my assoff for a year, i get a 20$ hike. I worked so hard and late my manager assigned US interns to shadow me and learn. 


Over the last month we got friendly with eachother, one of them revealed his monthly salary,  i went into a depression last week , the idea that a intern who barely knows how to use ms Excel is getting paid more than a team Lead by 15x just couldn't sit well with me .


I get the exchange rate is bad but these companies treat us like shit even in Indian standards , my maid's son has a cab he makes as much as me .

I'm in my final year of highschool and I'm very interested in going into the computer science industry. Only thing is, finding an opportunity to get into the CS workforce seems basically impossible without College or work experience. For financial and personal reasons I'm trying to avoid College as best I can.

Being 18, I've had no work experience in the CS field and my experience is nothing but what I've learned in my school's CS program (which is frighteningly little)

It's kind of disheartening to see that every single internship posting I've seen thus far expects me to be an undergraduate in a Computer Science program, and every job posting, no matter how awful the wages, still expect me to have a Bachelor's or equivalent work experience.

So my question is: is it even possible? I don't see any real options to be able to enter into the field if my inability to get a job/college means I will never be qualified for anything."

I've done a few more days of researching what to expect. I'm trying to write up some responses to interview questions and I'm stuck on why I applied/ want to work there/ chose Amazon. Everything happened so fast that I never actually wondered what the internship is like. For reference, I haven't had one so sorry in advance.

My real reason for applying is (1) I was able to and (2) I want to learn more languages/tools and (3) I want to gain real world experience. Being able to go through the entire SD process would be helpful in trying as many things as possible too. I guess I also like that they're customer obsessed since it roughly translates to wanting to help people. I'm interested in web dev so far and I think some of my classmates worked on a related project in the Irvine location (not too sure)?

I know that the project depends on the location (I'm aiming for Irvine, but will consider LA if they ask) and that they're typically things that they either needed more manpower for or wanted to consider. IDK what they typically involve in terms of tools/ knowledge/ skills/ etc. I initially applied because I could, only knowing that you were going to work on a project instead of doing tedious debugging on an existing system.

**TLDR;** I'm just curious in what types of work they typically give interns, what it involves, what skills you develop, and how to use that knowledge to tailor a response for why I 'actually' want to work there. I just want more experience, but that's not an appropriate response to these questions (I know it has mostly cater to what the company wants).

Oh and I haven't found many resources about the technical questions they ask you in [topics](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/software-development-topics) like distributed computing and internet topics (but I saw that most people get questions about system design?) What's the best way to get a crash course/ tldr on those topics? Thankfully I'm familiar with the rest of the topics.

Unfortunately, I didn't know what I wanted to do until very recently, and my internships are mostly in risk and process automation. Now, I have opportunities in each field and wasn't sure which one would be better to reach my goal.

1. Rating advisory financial analyst at S&amp;P500 MNC- peer comparison, ratio analysis, M&amp;A valuation, regulation research, monitoring.

From interviews, it seemed like it is mostly ratio analysis, benchmarking, and consulting?, and much less of valuation.

2.  Analyst at mid-size investment management firm - data streamlining, automation, backtesting, economic model developing, assisting investment managers.

From interviews, it was obvious that my programming capabilities were not up to their needs, but was somewhat sufficient. The mix of finance and programming sounded good, but it sounds more like just data management with occasional financial modeling

I have impression that job 1 will allow me to learn and gain more financial analysis experience, but have been reading online that advisory jobs are close to dead-end auditing jobs and a little concerned.I believe that job 2 will help me expand my programming skills significantly, which will be useful in the future as programming gains more focus in finance, but concerned that it might not have significant finance tasks to leverage in the future.

Which one do you think will have a better chance of guiding me towards equity analysis/AM?"

Which one do I choose? I'm seriously going crazy worrying over this.

It is a given fact that most UCL Econ grads go into banking/finance which I am not very interested in given how conservative the industry is, and I feel that I will be a very weak applicant applying for cutthroat spring weeks and internships since I have 0 experience/workshops/knowledge in this field. Economics is an okay subject to me, but I feel that the maths used is boring since it focuses mainly on assumptions.

However, I'm worried about my job prospects if I were to graduate from University of Birmingham. It's not exactly a target school for FAANG, but I believe the tech industry is more relaxed with prestige than investment banking, so maybe I can work my way up. Does anyone here know how many Birmingham Maths + CS grads get into top postgraduate schools (Imperial and UCL etc.), or how easy it is to switch from Maths + CS to just CS? Which degree would be better, single or joint honours?

Personally I find the subject Maths + CS more interesting, because I find purely quantitative subjects easier to study without burnout. However, I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up an unconditional UCL Econ acceptance, especially since my friends already at Imperial and UCL are eagerly waiting for me to join them in London.

I think Maths + CS grads can do most jobs Econ grads can do, but Econ grads have a narrower range of options unless they get a technical Master's degree. However, prestige of university name is a big factor. I was rejected by UCL CS this year by the way. Does anyone know if they accept transfers into 2nd year? Or if any other similarly ranked uni accepts transfers for CS? I know it's a very oversubscribed course, but maybe numbers lessen during first year.

This is a life-changing decision for me to make and therefore I am trying to gather as much information as possible."

I find it challenging to foster casual relationships because it seems like everyone is so obsessed with grades, internships, commitments, or their own personal growth, it’s tough even to find a gym buddy after the semester, or friends to “explore” a new cafe together.

I’m not particularly unattractive, neither is my personality blend and disproportionately focused on academics. I can’t really identify the main problem to work on.

Do you guys have any advice on how I can foster more casual and genuine friendships?

I'm a rising junior and I've been hearing that this is the time to build a rough college list, so I thought I'd ask for some advice!

**Demographics:**

* Female
* Indian
* OH, competitive-ish public school (sends about 15 to T20s each year)
* no hooks unless you count that I'll be the first to go to college in the US
* 150-200k income

**Intended Major(s):** genetics/genomics or computational biology if available, otherwise just biology (not sure if premed yet)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

34 (33M, 33S, 34E, 36R) - might take again since I was really sick during this one

1480 (PSAT)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.9 UW, 4.3 W, school doesn't rank but probably top 10% at least

**Coursework:** APUSH, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Stats (currently waiting on scores)

Junior yr: AP Lang, AP Spanish Lang, AP Physics Mech, AP Calc BC, Honors Anatomy &amp; Physiology

**Awards:**

* Congressional Award Silver Medal - aiming for Gold by December
* Gold PVSA
* Speech &amp; Debate - x2 State Qualifier, few local awards
* Science Fair - have a few from 7/8th grade and then 10th grade
* Honor Societies
* Was a couple points off from USABO semis this year, hopefully will make it next year

**Extracurriculars:** not ranked, just in the order I thought of them

1. **Online Genomic Research** \- Part of a national high school organization, published multiple abstracts, will most likely have a leadership role this upcoming year
2. **Founder/President of school's chapter** for #1 - Organize weekly meetings, teach concepts, group research, host fundraisers
3. **Speech &amp; Debate -** Led a few of my school's events, competed every weekend, taught 10-15 novices - director for state chapter of national speech and debate equity organization
4. **Public Health Internship** \- Worked with 3 other students to establish a malnutrition prevention campaign in underserved communities, year-long project, directly impacted about 150 families
5. **Science Fair** \- Qualified to state fair, couldn't participate in ISEF qualifying fair due to teacher's miscommunication, will most likely lead school team next year and senior year
6. **Physician Shadowing** \- I will be participating in a selective week-long program at a nearby hospital to shadow physicians in multiple fields, hopefully it leads to further connections with these doctors as well
7. **Volunteering**\- 2 years now, about 400 hours, I actually really like interacting with the donors at the blood center :). Might start volunteering at the hospital now that I'm old enough for more clinical exposure
8. There are more fun things I do, but I doubt they're impactful, so these are the main ones lol

Trying to cold email local labs right now to see if I can contribute to research or just watch, but no response yet :(

&amp;#x200B;

I would love some insight on safeties and targets. Reaches are actually pretty easy to come up with, but notes on BS/MD programs would also be super helpful. Right now, I'm looking at:

\- University of Cincinnati (pretty much guaranteed safety)

\- UC's Connections BS/MD (super reach)

\- Ohio State University (safety or target?)

\- Case Western (target?) but this is also kinda expensive soo

\- Johns Hopkins (reach) I really like their research focused environment"

I am currently undergoing my internship as a python developer, and although I am learning a lot from my supervisor and collegues for the past 2 months, I still feel quite inadequate and underperforming when it comes to work. Tasks tha are seemingly simple for the others require me to constantly research and I constantly require my code to be checked after I'm done with it, usually with some changes needed to be made after being checked by my supervisor.
My question is, how do I learn from a giant code base as fast as possible? Reading basic python guides only gets me so far (from what I think) and it's getting sometimes frustrating when I always need help from my collegues to do work that is assigned to me. I understand that experience plays a large role here, but is there anything I could do to help me learn faster?"

If anyone has experience in remote and in person internships, I would greatly appreciate some advice. I should mention that I did request that my relocation stipend be renegotiated to counteract the cost of living, but I'm not necessarily holding my breath on that."

upnd6s,2,2022-05-14,Got a new job but I’m incredibly anxious about it and I don’t know if I’ll be able to live up to expectations,uramichii,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/upnd6s/got_a_new_job_but_im_incredibly_anxious_about_it/,"Hi guys! A couple of weeks ago I interviewed for a Customer Order Analyst position at a global FMCG company.

The job description seemed to match my skills and experience (I recently finished my internship at a multinacional publishing company in their Digital and Customer Support department) and they were looking for recent grads so I decided to give it a shot.

The interview went well (the hiring managers were pretty nice) but to be honest I didn’t think I would get the job since I felt I wasn’t what they were looking for (they just kept asking me questions in a way that, to me, seemed to be saying “you are not what we need now” but I still did my best to answer everything) so imagine my surprise when HR called me on Wednesday to offer me the job. 

She told me that they were really satisfied with my technical skills but that they loved my attitude and my way to approach different situations in the workplace more than anything (they also appreciated the fact that I sent an email to thank them for the interview the next day). She also said that they think I’ll be a great asset to the team.

The pay is great (way more than what I was expecting), plus bi-annual bonuses and an annual “company prize” (sorry, don’t know how to call in in English), private healthcare, hybrid work and other office perks.

So I obviously said yes but now I’m doubting myself. I really wasn’t expecting to get an offer so a) everything feels too sudden and b) this will be my first “real” job with real responsibilities and I’m not sure I’ll be able to live up to their expectations. I start in two weeks and while I’m incredibly happy for the opportunity I also cannot shake the feeling that I’m not ready for this. 

Do you have any tips to deal with this feeling? Thank you so much!

**TLDR:** I got a new job and I’m super excited about it but at the same time I’m not sure if I’ll be able to deliver and the anxiety is killing me."

Recently I’ve had to switch my career due to personal reasons. Because of said reasons I have landed a seat in a,At best decent college for Computer Science Engineering. Academically,I’m almost always in the Top 5 of my class and have landed an internship and a few projects from a local tech company. I wanted to know how realistic it would be to aim for the Top 50 or even the Top 100 colleges in the United States for my master’s. I’ve been told that your undergrad matters a lot when applying for the top colleges ,Hence I was curious as to how realistic it is. Any corrections,Advice and answers are all welcome!"
upopra,2,2022-05-14,Computer Scientist to Protein Design,ComeBackReal,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/upopra/computer_scientist_to_protein_design/,"I am currently an undergraduate junior student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. From my high school years, international math olympiad experiences led me to choose a double major in those realms and specialize more in the Computer Vision field later on. After several internships in CV, I decided to shoot for research labs at the university instead of industry. Once I got the chance to do undergraduate research in the Protein Design project at our university's Data Science lab, it became a bit challenging for me at the beginning without having a proper background in NLP, Graph Machine Learning, and Biology. However, after careful recalibration of my interests, I decided to embark on antibody design development and research more on the AI applications for antigen-specific.

I was wondering since my knowledge is not at best on NLP, Graphs, or even sometimes fundamental Biology, what would you suggest to consider learning/improving if I aim to publish a novel paper in the antibody design area? Are there any suggestions on resources where I could constantly leverage fundamental knowledge for biology, its software (FASTA, PyMOL, ...), or crucial NLP/Graph applications?"

uppme1,7,2022-05-14,GOT THE JOBBBBBB...KINDA,Jasonmac10,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/uppme1/got_the_jobbbbbbkinda/,"So I graduated from University with first class hons in I.T. last year 2021. I have been doing some light technical support work for the past year at this job I got following an internship.

Over a month ago I was interviewed for a job for the role of Data Engineer at this big bank in my country and tbh I didn't think much of it because I know these posts can be so competitive and I didn't think I did the very best on the practical assessment. But to my surprise I was told that I would be getting a second interview.

So I was so excited and hopeful and nervous about the opportunity. The interview went and I thought it went really well, one of the best I think I did. 
They said they would get back to me the following week regarding the decision but they were a lot of delays during that time and I was told to be patient they just need a little bit more time.

When they called again recently I was told that the post had actually been filled but that they were so impressed and really liked me so much that they wanted to make a new post available to me for the role of Data Engineer. 

It was honestly so crazy for me to think that they did all of that for me and that was the reason in the delays in letting me know their decision. I became emotional man because I was rejected a few times before and to think they did all of that just for me....I plan to go and do my very best and show them they made the right decision. 

Any tips on how to prepare myself so when I start in a few weeks time I hit the ball rolling? YouTube series to watch etc. I really want to do well."

I want to do something that combines CS with another field so both seem like pretty good options. I just had a few questions about them

1. Which one of the programs will prepare me better for a future in jobs in software engineering, AI/ML, finance, data science, and environmental work? I want to maybe even get an internship at a place like Climate Corporation if possible.
2. Which one has the better starting salary and bonus?
3. Is CS+X not being in the Grainger College of Engineering a big disadvantage for job opportunities?
4. Will I be able to take technical CS electives down the line? I assume that I will have AP credits for calc ab, calc bc, chemistry, us government, both economics, and all 3 history ap classes. Are those enough to free up some of my general education and math requirements?
5. How hard is it to get into CS+X compared to information science?

Thanks for the help guys! I really want to get in."
upqd62,0,2022-05-14,Would a year abroad be bad for my career?,ermagawsh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/upqd62/would_a_year_abroad_be_bad_for_my_career/,"I’m a first year cs student at a london uni, my course offers a year abroad, a year in industry or an integrated masters. For the year abroad, you get to study at ucla for a year, but the year doesn’t count towards your final grade and you just need to pass the year.

The year in industry is a “gap year” between second and third year where you get to work in a year long internship, and usually you are offered a job after you graduate. This seems like the best option career wise, however I’m not sure if it’s that much better than if I just got a summer internship and was offered a job when I graduate too, so I’m not entirely sure it’s useful. 

I’m leaning towards the year abroad, because it will be a good experience and fun to study in another country, but the main reason I’m not going is because I’m scared it is going to be holding my career back, because when I finish with a bachelors other friends will have a masters or 12 months experience in industry, whereas I would’ve essentially wasted a year not doing anything to progress my career. 
I do have big ambitions for my career in the tech industry and hope to achieve a lot, but I’m also a young student and would like to have a year in California , especially since that’s where I may end up moving to later on in my career as a SWE.

I’m scared that the year abroad will mean that I am behind a lot of others and will lack experience that others have, and I’m looking for advice from you guys, maybe I should take the year in industry or even just do the masters by the 4th year.

So tldr, I’m not sure whether to do a year abroad because i feel like it’s going to put me behind others career wise."
upqfcv,62,2022-05-14,I’m really scared,mg1719,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/upqfcv/im_really_scared/,"My swe internship starts on Monday and I know nothing. It’s my first real, paid internship, but it feels like they had to settle for me since they took over a month to offer me the position from the last interview and the person who referred me mentioned they wanted to host more interviews for my position. 

I reached out to my manager to see how I could prepare, but I haven’t been able to cover some of the topics (golang, nosql, etc.), and I couldn’t go as in-depth as I’d like.

I’m not sure how the internship is going to work, but I really hope that I can meet the team’s expectations. I’m also excited though, so I’m going to cross my fingers and hope I do well! 

Any advice or motivation is appreciated :)"
upqhrp,1,2022-05-14,I'm 24 and want something better for myself,kennytreez,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/upqhrp/im_24_and_want_something_better_for_myself/,"Hello all.

From ages 18-21 I was completely lost in my life. Horrible grades, bad habits, lack of motivation, and in general just being very unhealthy. I changed my life at the age of 22 (I'm 24 now) and finally was able to get past community college, defeat some demons I was dealing with and now I have made my way to a state university. So far, I've turned my life around for the better, great grades, exercise, healthy eating etc. I'm very proud of what I have done and I'm on track to get my degree in communications. So far, I've had an internship with a big city in California in the communications department where I thought I would enjoy my time. 

But I am not. 

The pay isn't the best (70k), and while that's actually not too shabby for a comms degree, the actual salary growth is close to non existent.  The amount of work for this job is.... insane. 

Anything that happens within the city (political scandal, shooting, big arrest, building projects) there is a crazy amount of organizing you have to do. Contacting and organizing meetings for local politicians and reporters can be so tiresome, writing memos, press releases about topics I am not interested in is killing my soul. I observed my co workers around me and they are busting their ass even after the work day is done. Some of my co workers are passionate about this job and enjoy doing press but I have no interest in it at all. 

The political realm is not for me. When you work in this world, you get to see how much political theatre takes place and it bothers me so much. My friend told me about his coding journey, how he pivoted away from his business degree and got into programming. 

I came to the realization this past year that this is something that I should look into. I've been smart with my money... I am on track to have no student debt, I have invested into the stock market since the age of 16 putting away 40-50 percent of my paycheck each time.

I want to start my journey into programming once I graduate. I would like to combine my communications degree, with programming and I want to be very very good at it.

I am motivated, I find programming very interesting, and I want to be able to help my parents out as they have done for me for my entire life. My mom has cancer and I want to show her the world by being able to afford to do so. 

I am willing to shell out money for a boot camp, any recommended textbooks, any resources that will help me get started. I was thinking about jumping into Python or Javascript. 

I have a few recommended resources such as the odin project abd the free harvard cs50 course on YouTube. I also have a ton of close friends who are already very successful in this industry who are more than willing to help out/put in a good word for me. 

I know the road ahead of me is not going to be easy. I know that programming is not easy. But my motivation and passion for this  is through the roof.  Once I graduate, I am moving out of my apartment to save money and move back into my parents house to grind for an entire year or however long it takes and devote my life to this like it is a religion. I will not be working a 9-5, I will be done with school, but I want to learn to live and breathe code. I have had harder hills to climb in my life, and I want to prove to myself and the world that I can do this.

If anyone has any recommendations besides the ones I listed (Odin Project and Harvard CS50) please let me know."

**Letters of Recommendation**

(disclaimer: they showed it to me after they submitted)

AP Bio teacher (8/10): had him twice in freshman and junior year. Pretty solid.

US History teacher (5/10): meh tbh. Called me responsible and prepared, but also quiet.

**Interviews**

Cornell: really good interview as his son went to my school. A lot of jokes.

Princeton: ok. I made it a bit awkward at one point (got a bit emotional but quickly moved on)

UPenn: decent interview. Gave me a lot of tips for my career in general.

**Essays**

Common App: pretty good personal statement. Probably my favorite essay of the year. 

All supplements: wrote most of them within the last two weeks of each deadline. Spent maybe 4 hours on the essays for each college. Ranged from below average to above average. None of them abysmal or exceptional. Don't be like me.

I wrote about 30 essays for college this year and cramming them within a few weeks is not fun considering school and everything else."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Math/CS Teacher -- I was one of her favorite students + we had a good rapport because I and one other student pushed to get into her classes early, so I had her for a lot of classes. 

English Teacher -- Maybe a bit weaker of a relationship, but generally positive. I had them a lot more Freshman year, than once Junior year, so LoR probably leaned a bit more on earlier performance.

College Counselor -- Generally good relationship with them. Probably somewhat generic since I didn't know them too well when she wrote it, but I'm sure it was good regardless. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Interviews**

MIT -- 5/10, I answered the questions decently well, but did not come prepared nearly well enough with questions, so I ended the interview when I ran out, and was googling questions to ask while my interviewer was talking. Only 45 mins.

Penn -- 7/10, I struggled a bit in the beginning coming up with answers, but I settled in and connected with my interviewer a bit more, and we were able to talk about my role in the investment club where I gave a bunch of answers I was much more confident on, tying together my role as investment club president to what I want to do as an engineer. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**

Honestly, the weakest part of my application. I didn't let my parents read them, and my college counselor only read a few of them, so they were unedited for the most part. My common app essay was a generic piece of writing about my relationship to creativity that I would give a 4/10. My UC PIQs were written the day of, 3/10. The rest of my college-specific essays were better, though my ""Why &lt;x school&gt;?"" essays probably came off as a bit generic. I also wasn't really confident with my identity at the time, so I didn't really feel comfortable writing about my transness, so a lot of them probably came across as rather generic or flat, devoid of true emotion and feeling. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* CU Boulder (EA)
* UW Madison (EA)
* UMich (EA)
* Cal Poly SLO
* UCSB (didn't get in for engineering though)

*Waitlists:*

* UCSD waitlist --&gt; didn't stay on WL

*Rejections:*

* Stanford (REA)
* Caltech  (RD)
* MIT (RD)
* CMU
* UCLA
* UCB
* U Dub
* CMU

**Additional Information:**

My HS is a small, independent private school that doesn't offer APs because they feel that they are against the spirit of the school, so any APs I took had to be at least partially self-studied for (or entirely in some cases). College counseling at my school was amazing though, I felt like I could just pop in and ask a question anytime, and they probably helped me for tens of hours throughout the whole process. 

**Final Thoughts/Advice:**

I feel like I went into the process with a lot of misguided ideas and preconceptions about colleges. I thought for sure I'd go to Cal, just across the Bay, and thought that UMich + CMU were safety schools (I hadn't done any research), part of that was because I was determined not to use places like /r/ApplyingToCollege because my counselor said they were all insane lunatics who were overly obsessed with prestige and the minutiae of the process, so I avoided it until after all my applications were in. Early on, I felt like I didn't have the necessary knowledge to be applying to colleges, I wasn't confident enough in knowing where I wanted to go to ED anywhere, even though I probably should've EDed to Penn, looking back. 

My decisions also felt as far apart as possible, if that makes sense. I got into UMich in early January, and then was planning on going and even paid the enrollment deposit until early May, when I got off the Penn waitlist, so I had a lot of time to get used to and attached to UMich, which was a bit of a weird experience, switching from a school I had been so focused on for the past few months to one I hadn't even visited in person. 

Looking back on my entire time in HS, I also just deeply feel like I wish I had formed more meaningful connections with my class and my peers. I don't regret taking the classes and extracurricular experiences I did, but I absolutely wish I had done more socially, especially in my freshmen year. 

Also: entire process is a shitshow, its all random, anything that happens is not a reflection on you. I wanted to remind you all about this because my decisions kind of got in my head after a wave of march rejections, so remember, that college decisions are absolutely meaningless and say nothing about you."
upsw0s,0,2022-05-14,What program should I attend?,skylarrji,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/upsw0s/what_program_should_i_attend/,"**UPDATE: I accepted my offer to Waterloo CS a few days ago, I wasn't expecting this post to be somewhat popular so thank you so much for everyone who voted/offered advice :)**

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone! I'm looking to accept one of the following offers by the end of the day tomorrow (May 15th) and was wondering which program/university I should accept.

For context: I was born and raised in Waterloo (still live here now) and have never lived in a place outside of the city full-time. Although I'm interested in CS/the tech industry, I would also like to explore other options (e.g. arts, philosophy, entrepreneurship, etc.) and see what my passions lie in/the career pathway that I want to go into for the future and have a social life besides spending 24/7 on schoolwork.

Here are the four options that I've been accepted to and am considering, with my own personal pros and cons for each. If you have any additional pros/cons, feel free to write them in the comments :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Also just to preface that I'm extremely grateful for all that I've achieved and am in no way trying to flex, just want to get opinions from people outside of my family/friends before I make a final decision.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The University of Waterloo (The following three programs are all co-op based):**

**General pros for the university:**

\- I know the area pretty well as I've grown up here. If I choose to go to the university, I will most likely live with my parents (I live a 7 min drive from the campus) to save money/for convenience as I haven't fully lived on my own before.

\- Co-op: Even though I'm living with my parents, I would most likely be able to travel/go abroad due to my co-op placements and get a lot of diverse work experiences before I graduate.

\- Many people from my high school are going to the university, which means that the transition from hs to uni wouldn't be as intimidating compared to going to a university that's farther away.

\- $9000 overall in scholarships (part of the scholarship is only provided that I maintain an 80% average in first year)

&amp;#x200B;

**General cons for the university:**

\- Lack of independence: As I've said before, I will most likely be living with my parents if I choose to go here. My parents are on the slightly stricter side which means that I will most likely not be able to stay up super late/socialize late at night due to this. In addition, my parents will most likely do the cooking/household chores for me, which might be a problem when I move out in the future but I might acquire some experience with this due to co-op.

\- Lack of a new environment: As I've grown up here, I pretty much know all of the places around the area and nothing here is extremely new for me. I'm mostly worried that I will be stuck in Waterloo for the rest of my life, which is kinda terrifying since I'm interested in living in other areas as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Waterloo CS Co-op (my top choice atm)**

**Pros:**

\- Flexibility: I would be able to choose from more courses, minor or specialize in something that's not CS-related.

\-  Lots of people: As CS has a bigger class size, I would be able to meet a lot more people and potentially be friends with them :)

\- Lighter course load: Apparently CS students only attend 15 hours/week of classes, which means I'll have a bit more free time outside of class.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

**-** Lack of a cohort: There might be a chance that I'll never see someone again after being friends with them in a few of my classes, and with co-op, it might be harder to maintain relationships throughout/after uni.

\- Math heavy: As CS is in the math department, I'm slightly worried that I will fall behind on their math courses/struggle to the point where I might fail them.

\- Can't transfer to SE/CS BBA easily since they are specialized

&amp;#x200B;

**Waterloo SE Co-op**

**Pros:**

\- Cohort system: I'm in both the CS and SE discord servers, and the SE server seems a lot more active/engaging than the CS server, which might reflect the people that I will meet once I start in the fall. In addition, I will most likely form stronger connections if I choose to do SE since we will have pretty much every class together.

\- Engineering: Iron ring + fourth-year capstone projects seem pretty interesting :)

\- Can drop to CS easily

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

\- Heavy courseload: SE students apparently have to spend 60 hours/week attending classes

\- Lack of electives: SE pretty much assumes that being a software engineer is your ultimate career goal, causing you to take a bunch of mandatory engineering courses that I'm not super interested in/might have a tougher time getting through such as chemistry and physics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Waterloo/Laurier CS BBA (Waterloo-based)**

**Pros:**

\- Get to specialize in business as well as cs: I'm pretty interested in entrepreneurship/starting my own company in the future, so getting two degrees could be beneficial to do that.

\- Get to interact with Laurier's clubs/services: Apparently Laurier is a more outgoing/sociable university compared to Waterloo, which means that I would be able to work on my social skills more if I choose this program

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

\- Pretty much the same as SE, and also the fact that I have to walk quite a bit to go between universities

&amp;#x200B;

**University of Toronto (St. George Campus) CS**

**Pros:**

\- $10000 one-time scholarship (from President’s Scholars of Excellence Program, which comes with more perks as stated in this link --&gt; [https://future.utoronto.ca/scholarships/presidents-scholars-of-excellence-program/](https://future.utoronto.ca/scholarships/presidents-scholars-of-excellence-program/)).

\- Outside of Waterloo, causing me to adjust to being independent quicker and getting to know a new area w/ new people rather than being with people that I've known for years from high schools in the area.

\- With the CS program, I can also specialize in areas outside of pure CS that I'm interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

\- More expensive because I will most likely live on campus (at University College), commute, meal plans, etc.

\- Doesn't have a co-op program in the same way as UW; they have an ASIP program which I think is only one 16-month maximum internship as well as some personal development courses (correct me if I'm wrong): [https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academics/asip](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academics/asip) which means that I'll have to find internships on my own time throughout university

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much and good luck with your own post-secondary plans :)

&amp;#x200B;

I got hired as devops intern and it turned out to be a nightmare. The project I was working on wasn’t designed well, scrum was limited to question ‘how is progress?’ every day, architects and senior devops engineers seemed not to have sufficient knowledge (so I couldn’t learn from any experienced people) my learning path isn’t clear- manager comes to me every month and tells me to learn different thing bcs some other projects open soon. I work in a corporation which is a complete mess, I don’t even know if I like the devops position anymore. I am devastated and I feel like i have wasted 18 month of my life I didn’t really get very familiar with any technology. The only good thing about this job is salary and possiblity to work part time to finish my degree. There comes the question, should I look for another internship but in SWE or should I give a devops engineer role another shot but in different company. Really, I am disappointed like I have never been in my life. I got hired to work bcs I had wanted to gain knowledge faster.

I just graduated from my University with a B.S.B in Computer Information Systems. 

I'm kind of nontraditional in the sense that my first two years of schooling was a pre-med/biology program, with a change of majors during summer of 2020. That's when I changed to CIS. 

In this path, most of the courses were business specific.

The technical courses that I had to take were:

* Programming 1 &amp; 2 (an introductory programming course with python where we learned data structures and algorithms, with the part 2 being a large project involving creating a python program that ran requests from mySQL with a GUI created by qtDesigner)
* Data Communication and Networks (Network +)
* Database Management Systems (which was basically using mySQL and designing ERDs, normalization, DDL, etc)
* System Analysis and Design
* Management Information Policy and Analysis
* (All business students had to take one class that covered Excel and Access and another that covered Word and Powerpoint but I don't really count those).

Furthermore, I also took on a Work-Study Position in the Enterprise Services department beginning August of last year, where I had to respond to user support tickets, assist the director with replacing, repairing, upgrading, and generally maintaining server equipment, mainly switches. I also was responsible for performing general maintenance on the WEPA cloud printer system which I don't really count as anything that can be related to another job, but that's what they had me do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some potential career paths I've looked into were Business or Systems Analyst, Network Engineer, Consultant, Database Admin, and Sysadmin, but I feel like I'm not really qualified for any of that stuff, although it piques my interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I didn't get any internships which I'm really kicking myself over. I really dropped the ball on that one.

What roles would likely be suggested that isn't help desk? Not that I have anything against starting there, but really would like a ""better"" position to start with."

One of them was with BAE Systems and I really wanted to get an internship but I didn't have the experience they were looking for.  And another one was at a startup company and I really liked the company and the products they made but the hours just weren't compatible. Do you guys have any advice on what I should do or know any companies that have flexible hours?"

upvmjm,1,2022-05-14,Good alternatives to quant research?,Concerned-Coconut,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/upvmjm/good_alternatives_to_quant_research/,"Incoming college senior here. I have an internship in quant research at a firm (keeping hidden for anonymity) soon, but I found the readings we were given prior to the internship to be bland and uninteresting.

I come from a math/stats/cs background, where I mostly focus on stats/machine learning. The ideal job for me would be one where I could use the intersection of these three fields. Quant research initially sounded appealing because of this. However, I found the finance aspect to be horrible and soul sucking. I just thought it was not fulfilling, as all the readings focused solely on earning money and not really providing much services or value.

I have a year left in college, and I am at a loss. What jobs are available and are similar enough to quant? Data science? ML engineer? Depends on the firm? And if so, how should we prepare for interviews in these fields/what skills are needed? I am ultimately hoping to return to Asia (e.g. Singapore, Japan) so companies with branches there would be nice.

TLDR: went into quant research, realized I strongly dislike finance, now unsure what careers are available.

Thanks y'all!"

Hi guys, I’m a biomedical engineering major interested in applying to UW MS stats and was curious if I have a strong chance of getting in? I have a 3.7 overall GPA, 3.75 major GPA, and A- or above in all my math and statistics classes. I don’t plan on taking the GRE. I have one internship that doesn’t relate to statistics/analytics, but I have worked on ML projects through undergraduate research and my capstone project. Do you guys think I stand a chance of getting in the program, and would it be beneficial for me to take the GRE math subject test?

Thanks!"

Their messages typically consists of these few lines: it

What's in for you:
Role: Project Leader 
Travelling opportunities
Career Advancement 
Fun &amp; Vibrant Environment 
1 on 1 mentorship
No prior experience needed

As a intern, you will experience thorough technical and people skills training and mentoring. You will also learn first hand, the life skills that will help you mature as you prepare to join the workforce.

I was thinking if you would be interested in an internship/mentorship programme where you can gain exposure to and learn about the Financial Services Industry along with valuable entrepreneurship skills

There are too many messages from them that it’s just getting on my nerves. And when I don’t reply them, they double text me with the same message. Whether you are from AIA, Great Eastern, Advisors Clique or whatever financial advisory firm, please stop harassing people with your mass messages. If i am interested in the industry or i want to be a financial advisor at your firm, I will contact you personally or apply for your job posting.

This is only for the recruitment aspect, and to those financial advisors friends  trying to set up coffee chat / phone call  to sell insurance/ financial scheme, please stop as well, it’s just so annoying. I will approach you if I really need your service. Thanks for listening to my rant."
uq071l,5,2022-05-15,[Uni] NUS BME or SUTD + undergraduate merit scholarship (DISCLAIMER: SUPERSUPER LONG POST COMING UP BUT VV IMPT PLS READ 😭 ITS GNA DECIDE MY FUTURE),Deep_Honeydew_5935,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/uq071l/uni_nus_bme_or_sutd_undergraduate_merit/,"hellooo so i got offered nus bme and sutd along with the sutd undergraduate merit scholarship! really conflicted on which offer to accept so if anyone can give their opinion on this it would be greatly appreciated 🥺🙏🏻 also rly new to posting on reddit i'm praying that this will at least get one response HAHA 😩 some questions that i have: 


1. i rly wna go overseas in uni! in terms of overseas opportunities which uni would he better? i'm aware that sutd offers a fully sponsored overseas trip for freshmore students to asean countries (correct me if i'm wrong) but is it for the whole cohort or only selected students? other than that, in terms of competitiveness, in which uni would it be easier to get overseas opportunities, nus or sutd? and what are the chances of getting SEP in nus especially for engineering?
2. tbh i prefer doing more hands-on projects and ik sutd would probably be more hands-on but just wanted to check how hands-on the bme curriculum is? are there many projects where students are required to personally build models/ lab sessions? i'm currently under the impression that nus bme won't differ too much from sutd in being hands-on since it is engineering after all HAHA
3. any chance of getting a scholarship in nus after matriculation? like faculty-administered scholarships etc, are they very competitive and hard to get? 😩
4. how to get internships besides the compulsory ones? are we required to self source for everything ourselves? and what is the percentage of students who successfully go on internships during their summer break? in this aspect, would sutd be better since they are more industry driven?
5. how to boost chances of getting overseas/ exchange opportunities and internships? 
6. how is student life in general? i think i've kinda gathered that sutd is quite closely knitted due to their small cohort but not too sure for nus bme, is it easy to find friends who take the same modules? would it be more difficult due to lessons mainly being carried out in larger venues and the larger cohort size? i'm quite worried that i might not be able to find friends bc i'm quite awkward + i probably won't be staying in hall (?) so fewer chances of socialising 🤧 also since engineering is generally quite an intensive course, is it possible to balance engineering with other interests such as cca and 2nd majors / minors? just work life balance in general HAHA 
7. is nus bme very computing intensive? also bc i am interested in taking up idp as a 2nd major and i was informed that there would be a lot of programming involved 🤧 are students w/o coding background generally able to cope and do well in programming modules? vv scared for computing bc i tried a bit of html/python in jc and from what i remember i absolutely sucked at it 🙃
8. what is the general weightage of the math/physics/computing/bio involved in bme?
9. for bme, how are lessons conducted? is it mostly lectures and tutorials? what is the prof to student ratio? 
10. would biomedical engineers be at a disadvantage compared to more general engineers such as mechanical/electrical engineers? bc from what i gather it's breadth&gt;depth and i'm not sure how beneficial this would be when looking for jobs 🤧 also are job prospects for biomedical engineers good in sg? it seems to be improving from the recent graduate employment survey 👀
11. how is the career progression of sutd grads? the starting salary is quite high at abt $4k but will there be chances of salary increment? and by how much?
12. any sutd epd student specialising in the healthcare track who doesn't mind sharing how it's like and how it might differ from nus bme? 
13. for sutd scholars, how hard is it to maintain the scholarship? are there many cases of people being dropped from the scholarship due to unsatisfactory grades? 
14. for sutd dai students, anyone mind sharing how dai is like? what do you learn and is there a lot of programming involved? 🥲
15. how are the quality of professors in both nus bme and sutd epd? can they teach well 🤭
16. how are the ccas in nus? are they very competitive and high commitment? would it be easy to get in without experience? 
17. just any advice in general regarding nus bme and sutd!! 



woahhh this is a lot didnt plan to type so many questions but i'm rly blur and confused as yall can prob tell 🤡 sorry for the many many question marks and hopefully i was clear enough in my questions(?) 🤧 no need to answer everyt just pick the ones you can answer!

uq106o,1,2022-05-15,"I started approaching strangers, now I'm scared I could lose the confidence again",yerga227,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/uq106o/i_started_approaching_strangers_now_im_scared_i/,"It started about a month ago that I finally approached strangers (especially women) on campus/the street/wherever I went.

I did as many approaches as I could to get over my fear of rejection. 5-6 a day easy.

After a while though I had 2 bad experiences. Most conversations just run out and that's fine. Got a couple of numbers. Got rejected when asking for a date. All in all good fun though. Just those 2 were kinda bad, because they treated me like I was one of those creepy guys that's just about to deliver some awful comment or worse. I think the next time a woman is that hostile after I've just said ""Hi"" I'll tell her something like ""your eyes are telling me to fuck off"" or I'll just back off immediately. For me learning to approach people has been a lot about knowing when to call it a day before it gets awkward.

Also I realised my students-job in IT is going nowhere and decided to apply for another one. Maybe that plays a part too. They do this thing where they offer students an internship. Only after three months, when you know the ropes, they offer you a job and start properly paying you. They barely had any time for me, so I barely learned anything and was still expected to deliver results. Now they feel I'm not ready for the full job so they want to offer me low-level tedious annoying work until they feel like they have the time to properly show me the ropes. I've had enough at this point and frankly feel a bit scammed.

I have a job interview on Tuesday. They are really enthusiastic about having me. It's going to be fine.

Since those two things happened/are happening my initial burst of enthusiasm and bravery has slowed down a bit.

I don't care about big companies like FAANG, I just want to be able to land my first internship, no matter the pay, just need experience to put on my resume for my second internship in which would hopefully be at big company. I understand that it goes by learning the necessary skills, and then making a few basic projects, and then apply to internships, I would like the following ti be answered.

1. Is there any inexpensive reliable online course or cert that would teach me everything I need to know to get started on making some projects, other than freecodecamp?
2. I prefer to start out with python, what is step by step I should take from learning print(""hello world"") to being ready to apply to first internship.
3. Once I have a few projects and believe I am ready for internship, how should I go about applying for them for the best results? How much and what do I need to know for an internship?"

We got into an argument during the middle of finals and we didn’t talk for 2 days.

She’s been really stressed with school and hearing back for internships during the summer.

We have mutual friends and they don’t think our argument warranted a breakup with everything else being good up until then.

She told me she still wants to be friends and that she’s still attracted to me and wants to spend time with me but doesn’t know if she wants a romantic relationship. We ended on good terms, no yelling, just crying from both of us, more her in the moment.

She’s always spoken super highly of me and I was told by others that she was proud I was her boyfriend. 

I haven’t talked to her in a day now (since we split) as I want to give her space.

Also important note, I am her first boyfriend.

What can I do if I want a chance of ever rekindling things?

My thoughts now are to give it 1.5 months until we’re back in the same city to reach out. We are in the same friend groups and we started friends but I am just not sure if I can emotionally be around her if there isn’t a hope of rekindling something.

I’m not going to let this “plan” control my life by an standards and I will enjoy the summer but I enjoyed our relationship and it’s the best I’ve been in yet.

Also, I did fucking terrible on the MATLAB assignments because I am just bad at MATLAB, and the MATLAB assignments felt significantly harder than the ones in 240 and 241. I would like to go to grad school but I am genuinely worried that this will affect my application significantly, and affect my ability to get internships in the near future.

I have a degree in business and am currently working in Digital Sports Journalism, though the pay is pretty much intern wage and I feel like I’m not learning anything new. I want to keep learning, though I’ve realised just how much I *despise* the corporate culture. Pointless Zoom calls with topics I genuinely do not care about, fake smiles and plenty of ass-kissing. Not to mention to soul-destroying days of just repetitive tasks and staring at a screen; what life is this?

I’ve realised it just doesn’t align with my values. I find it hard to get motivated about something I don’t feel is meaningful i.e making an impact on people’s lives or busting a gut for someone else’s dream.

I’m open to any opportunities as I’m still so unsure of my career path. I’ve always loved sports and I like NGOs, just something which feels meaningful to me where I feel I can make a difference in an area and it’s something really dynamic where no two days are the same and involves travel, rather than tedious tasks and just office based where I feel really uninspired.

I’d really love to move abroad (preferably Europe, I’m in UK) though since Brexit, it’s highly unlikely. The next best alternative is the 2-year Australia visa, though you can only work 6 months at a time for one company, though you could get sponsored. I’d want to keep progressing into something rather than doing the typical hospitality roles etc.

I’m just worried I’d come back age 27/28 and still feeling like I’m in the same position and having to start from scratch, but I’m just so eager to experience something new but I don’t want it to feel like I’m escaping. Im just so confused at what I want.

Anyone else gone down this path in their twenties? I feel like i'm just going round in circles trying to find answers. This route that was drummed into us as teens to go to Uni, get a job, get a mortgage feels… empty?"
uq3ohn,5,2022-05-15,Help: can I estimate the impact of data drift on performance?,madssofia,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/uq3ohn/help_can_i_estimate_the_impact_of_data_drift_on/,"The other day I found an interesting algorithm that caught my attention. It allows to estimate the performance of an ML model in production without access to target data and **fully take into account the impact of data drift on performance**.

Data drift is a change in the joint distribution of model inputs. If the data moves to a region where the model is not certain of its prediction (like close to a class boundary or to a region where the model has not seen enough training examples), the performance of the model (like ROC AUC) can plummet. This means that even if the pattern captured by the model still holds, the model can effectively fail.

The high level intuition behind the algorithm is that as long as the model can reliably estimate its own uncertainty you can actually calculate the expected confusion matrix for every single data point. If you the aggregate those in a big enough sample you get a reliable estimation of performance for a given time period. Of course, if the underlying pattern between the model inputs and the model outputs changes, the algorithm will not detect that, so it’s a not a silver bullet. What do you think about it, worth trying?

I asked if they could move the dates but unfortunately they could not, which is why I had to reject.

I want to go into the next summer with some internship experience. I will be back at my home university in the spring of my junior year. I was thinking about applying for spring swe internships. Although by the time I start applying for Summer 2023 internships, I won’t have completed a spring internship so my experience section of my resume will lack CS related jobs. I was wondering if this made even doing a spring internship worth it. Or potentially that spring internship can transition into a Summer internship for the same company. 

Thoughts on attempting to do a spring internship? Is it worth it? If so, do I apply for titles such as “SWE Intern” but tell the recruiter I am only available in Spring? What are the hours involved with an internship during school? I will be taking 5 classes (4 CS, 1 ECON).

uq95uu,0,2022-05-15,My family blocked me on facebook for seemingly no reason,Aggravating-Turn9320,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/uq95uu/my_family_blocked_me_on_facebook_for_seemingly_no/,"My family has always been really dysfunctional, with my mom being super addicted to weed pretty much since I was born and one of my sisters being schizophrenic and also a drug addict. My dad went to court for child neglect and wasn't allowed to approach me for 11 years so my only family left were my mom and my two sisters. Since I moved in with my mom at age 9 she started telling me I was too ugly, too stupid, etc. She got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis which I know is an awful and painful disease but she's been using that to fuel her victim complex and guilt trip everyone who doesn't bend over backwards for her. As a kid/teen I would get bullied at school to the point where I got really depressed and suicidal, at 15 I told her that I wanted to die and she told me to do her a favor and kill myself. I started self harming and she got mad at me for it, calling me a coward and a pussy and whatnot. At 17 she forced me to give her half my inheritance (after my grandpa on my dad's side died) because I apparently “owed” her since she had raised me. After that she started telling me to either help her pay rent or move out, so I moved out at 17 since I was too young to have $300 a month to give in rent, and she was so furious with me she threatened to kill me and we didn't speak for about 3 years. I found out later that she spent a good part of those 3 years in a mental hospital while I was pretty much homeless and couch-surfing during that time.

Now I'm 25 and I thought we were all pretty much past the drama. I live in a different city from my family so that definitely helped. I'm the only member of my family to make it to university and I always paid my own tuition for the past 8 years without ever asking for money. Even when I could only afford one meal a day I never asked anyone in my family for money. I work hard and pay my bills and got myself a nice apartment. Never asked anything from anyone in my family, the only person who even remotely helps me is my dad who's trying to make up for the fact that he severely neglected me when I was a kid. I helped my mom financially for the past couple of years, sending her $500 every other month to help with her rent and various expenses. I paid for my sister's college and rent and helped her as much as I could when she got diagnosed with schizophrenia. I also have a step-sister but I was never that close to her since she's much older than me (I'm 25 and she's 41).

Anyways both my mom, her best friend and my own step-sister blocked me last night. The reason behind that is that my mom had been texting me for the past month at like 4 or 6 in the morning just to tell me how much she hated X person in our family and how she was gonna cut them out. It got to the point where I would wake up anxious that I got a text from my mom. She did it again the other day but I didn't respond immediately because I was so emotionally and psychologically drained from her drama. I ended up only texting her back two days later, I apologized for replying late and told her that I really wasn't doing well lately (I went through a traumatic event that sent me to therapy recently, started an internship and found out my childhood best friend had died from cancer). I explained that I wasn't in a good mental space and that the family drama was becoming too much for me. At first she was really supportive, she told me she understood and that I should try to relax and take care of myself. Then, about 3-4 hours later I got a long text from her telling me that she should have never confided in me about her problems, that I never cared about her and that she was cutting me out of her life since I seemed to be “doing just fine on my own”. She pretty much told me “good luck in life” and blocked me, I didn't even have a chance to respond. I just saw that my own step-sister blocked me as well even tho I have literally done nothing to her. My mom's best friend also blocked me a couple weeks ago even tho I always got along with him (we're both queer so I always liked him just because he was nice and we had that in common). I sent my mom about $300 two weeks ago and she knows I don't have a car and just started an internship so I can't come see her every time she has a problem, but apparently that doesn't matter as I'm not “doing enough”.

My boyfriend has been telling me they'll come around and unblock me and everything will go back to normal but at this point I don't even fucking care. Excuse my language. I really don't care anymore, I'm so psychologically drained from everything. I don't want them to unblock me, I'm done. No one in my family is sane. They get mad at me because I'm doing well and I'm not as miserable as them. I've been supporting my own fucking parents financially and taking care of my sister since I was 17 but apparently that doesn't matter. My mom always goes from “I'm so proud of you” to accusing me of neglecting her. From the day I was fucking born my own parents neglected and abused me, forcing me to become independent in order to just survive and now they're accusing me of being too independent. I don't even want them to unblock me, I don't care if they apologize.

So now my only family left is my sister who's schizophrenic and always in and out of the hospital/police station. She does a lot of drugs and she steals and she's also an escort so I've been trying to keep my distance with her but now I'm talking to her again since she's the only person in my family who treats me nicely. I'm starting to feel sorry for her because I'm realizing the reason she's doing drugs most likely has something to do with our family being completely screwed up. I'm kind of worried because I'm not sure how life will be without a family. I don't think it'll make that big of a difference honestly, I just won't have to take care of them anymore and I'll be able to keep the money that I earn, but still. I guess you really don't choose your family."

I have 2.7 GPA and this would be my biggest concern for applying.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I graduated from the University of X with a Bachelor of Science in June 2015. Since graduating from university, I started my career as a backend engineer in one of the biggest companies in Japan. As I move towards senior positions, I realized that having solid knowledge of computer science is critical for leading projects and teams. Courses such as algorithms, information security, and software analysis in the OMSCS program grabbed my attention and will satisfy my desire to enhance my understanding of computer science and progress me further in my career.  
&gt;  
&gt;I entered the university without a major and did not know which path I should choose. From the moment I set foot on my first programming course, I was developing my interest in software development. Studying computer science was about problem-solving and sometimes quite challenging. My speed of consuming material was slow compared to other peers, and therefore I was often struggling with managing time. However, I always analyzed what could be better from the previous semester and pushed myself to make continuous improvements. As time went by, I could manage classes well and achieve the best possible outcomes.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a part of my specialization program, I was employed in the Faculty of Biology IT Department for one year. Responsibility of my position was with developing web applications such as enrollment, survey, and research tools and maintaining the system infrastructure of the department. My daily tasks involved not only programming but communicating with faculty members and continuously exchanging feedback for the projects. These internship settings taught me various software skills and knowledge as well as communication competency.  
&gt;  
&gt;After graduating from university in 2015,  I was offered my first job in the Membership Department at X, providing user-related services to its businesses. As a junior backend developer, I developed and maintained an ID platform application. Sometimes, some of the projects involved research on core computer science skills. One of the projects was to update user passwords with a new hash algorithm. It required me to study cryptography and discuss it regularly. After 2 years of experience, I changed to the advertisement department to experience the big data field. The system I worked on contains the process of collecting, transforming, and sending user behavior data. My tasks required a solid knowledge of databases and query language. Lastly, I am currently leading iOS mobile and backend API development. Since clients are mobile-based, understanding networks is crucial, and I was glad that my knowledge of networks from the university helped a lot.  
&gt;  
&gt;My academic and work experience guided me toward my core passion which is utilizing computer science as a means to lead teams and projects. The next step in what will be a career-long journey of personal growth is for me to deepen my understanding of how computing systems are built. Despite a lackluster undergraduate GPA, I have a proven track record of pursuing my goals relentlessly, and I do not doubt that I will succeed in graduate-level coursework. I am drawn to Georgia Tech’s successful reputation in the OMSCS program, offering extensive online CS courses and reasonable tuition fees. I see the opportunity to study in the OMSCS program as not just a step in my growth, but the next formative learning experience that will refine my understanding of computer science and propel me to become a successful lead engineer."

uqeiif,3,2022-05-15,how to escape an abusive home,tiredndepresso,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/uqeiif/how_to_escape_an_abusive_home/,"Hi,

I (23F) come from an abusive home. While my father is verbally abusive with everyone in the house, he's only physically abusive with me.
From 18 til now I've been living abroad for the most part but during covid I came home because my mother was very ill and I had to take care of her. This is when the violence escalated leading to altercations including a time he strangled me against the wall. This really triggered my ptsd because it's also what my rapist did.
Anyway, after that I left again but now I'm back because I'm doing an internship in the neighborhood.
Here's the problem, being home gives me high levels of anxiety so I can't sleep and I'm underperforming at work. But renting an apartment where I live is very hard without someone to guarantee your payments which my father and family refuse to do of course. He's also withholding my money so I'm financially dependant on him and my internship paycheck doesn't come in for another 2 weeks.

I dont have friends that could host me here and I may have found a place but I can't afford it until he gives me my money.  Also, most of my family here defend him and say that's just the way he is and I should keep my head down.

My mother said she would help but as usual she does nothing and shuts down my ideas to avoid 'drama'. What should I do? 

(Sorry for the chaotic note I'm a tad emotional)"

Like big time. Covid and a bad breakup and my depression, you get the picture. I could make plenty of excuses but it's ultimately my fault.

I have no job lined up for this summer, no experience in my field, and all of my grades are lower than I expected this semester so I dropped below the 3.0 I was trying to hold (technically I can get a 3 if I get an 82 on my CS final but that's a coinflip). I have things like robotics and AP classes and good GPA from high school but I highly doubt employers/potential internships will care about anything like that.

Long story short, what can I do right now to get some experience under my belt. I know I've pretty much missed all the deadlines I should have done something by. I have the money to make it about a month without moving home or taking a job in retail.

I've seen comments about ""making your own projects"" and whatnot, which is great, but it won't financially support me. Is my best bet to get something unrelated to my field like retail, and then get an on-campus job next semester? Should I have any hope whatsoever for internship opportunities? Where do you even go to get things like that? I feel absolutely lost, any help is super appreciated.

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

uqli05,9,2022-05-15,[Uni] NUS vs NTU Computer Science,spicychickenrice,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/uqli05/uni_nus_vs_ntu_computer_science/,"I just received offers from both NUS and NTU, and am in a dilemma of which to go to. 

NUS offer:
-Computer Science

NTU offer:
-Math and Computer Science Double Major
-SPMS advancement fund scholarship (fully subsidised school fees + $3000 overseas allowance)

I’ve asked advice from people around me, and am torn between the two, unable to decide which to go to. 

So far, these are reasons that other people have given me on why I should pick one over the other. 

Why NUS&gt;NTU:
-NUS has better teaching quality
-Better internship opportunities (not sure about this but, is this rlly true?)
-Higher employability because NUS is more recognisable and is seen as a “better school than NTU”, also due to NUS ranking 4th in the world for CS, while NTU is 11th.
-More programmes to help students build their portfolio (again, how true is this?)
-Better S/U system

Why NTU&gt;NUS:
-Less competitive, hence, it would be easier to stand out amongst the crowd
-More gentle learning curve, as NTU takes more time to strengthen one’s foundation


For me, I am most concerned about the better opportunities that NUS offers to build my portfolio, and how NUS can make me more employable. Is it really true that NUS is much more elite as compared to NTU in this aspect?

I’m hoping to gather as many opinions on why one is better than the other."

Hi Everyone,

I am a computer engineer working in Construction in Canada. I have 2 years of experience (1 year intern, 1 year current job)

I make roughly 170k as an engineering graduate which is insane entry level. (12 hours, 14 plus days straight, 5 days off afterwards)

I hope to work in the space industry, and was accepted to a masters program for AI and embedded systems engineering. This admission is valid till July 2023.

A normal engineering job with less hours and more flexibility would likely pay 85k per year. (I had a job offer at a bank for high frequency day trading)

Am I possibly making myself unemployable in the electronics industry by working pipeline construction? 

Any advice is appreciated!"

uqqsw6,2,2022-05-16,Issue to remotely deploy powershell script as admin,Skinny_deer,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/uqqsw6/issue_to_remotely_deploy_powershell_script_as/,"Hi guys,

So I recently got in an internship as sysadmin and for one of the project is to create a script to deploy on different computer or server.

There is several requirement for my script depending the situation :

**- Admin right since it's need to install a soft and most of the user don't have any admin right**

**-I can't use any solution to deploy the installation package since my internship won't allow it**

**-I would like to stay on batch or powershell script to make it easier to maintain by the other coworker** 

I will explain my actual situation and my need :

I have my main script in powershell **(Let's call it PS1)**  : it  check if there is the desired soft already installed on the remote computer if not then launch a batch script**(let's call it B1)** that will  check if there is an old soft installed ( the soft I need to install remplacing the old one) then uninstall it if possible then install the new one

If the desired soft is already installed my main script should launch an other powershell script**(let's call it PS2)** that will do this :  check the version of the desired soft already install on the remote computer and compare with the version I want to install , if the installed one is older then install the newest else It will just do nothing

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is the following :

All my script are working are working well but there is a case where it's not working

If **PS2** isn't on a shared network but instead locally on my computer when I try to execute it remotely it's fail. No issue for the batch script that why I still don't understand.

My main script use the command Pexec to remotely execute the batch or the other powershell script since I need to use admin cred to make the install process work without any issue.

Here is how I call the execution of **PS2 :** 

    .\PsExec \\$_ -accepteula -i -h -u domaine\adminUser -p ""Password"" PowerShell -Executionpolicy Bypass -File '\\IP\Path\PS2.ps1'
    }

This one is working without issue but for some case I need my **PS2** script to be localy on my computer and then I tried this way 

    .\PsExec \\$_ -accepteula -i -h -u domaine\adminUser -p ""Password"" PowerShell -Executionpolicy Bypass -File 'C:\Users\myusername\Desktop\path\PS2.ps1'

But sadly it's doesn't work like this and return the following error : 

The argument « C:\\Users\\myusername\\Desktop\\path\\PS2.ps1 » of the parameter -File doesn't exist. Give the access path to a file « .ps1 » for the argument of the parameter  -File.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I use something else than PsExec ? 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for my english I'm still not use to correctly explain my issue in other language 

Hope you guys can help or guide me to the solution

Thanks in advance

As the interview came to an end they casually dropped the bomb that they have a training bond. I really can't believe my ears at that moment. Ang dami ko nababasa dito na red flags daw ang training bonds. I told them I'd think about it and then they asked why am I so reluctant of the training bond. I said I don't have a clear vision of what the position might entail and I still haven't seen the terms for the bond.

After that, they asked me my expected salary. I said 24k is the lowest I can go given that it is in NCR. I am also from a big 4 school so that was also a factor of my expected salary. I do know my worth and from my internship and freelance experience I can make up for it since I believe I have the skills. They then said they can't afford me and thanked me for being honest. I also thanked them for being upfront and not wasting my time.

So here I am, kinda second guessing if I'm aiming a bit too high as a fresh grad. Do I need to lower my standards/expected salary? Do I just shrug it off and move on? Any tips for these kinds of situations while job hunting?"

He can be exhausting at times but in the end we all know that this guy knows his topic.

I respect this guy and want to be like him. I want to know everything about my rights and dutys at work so noone could ever lay me off or demand me to do stuff I'm not supposed to do. Laughing in their faces when they try to scare me with termination etc.

I want to adapt the mindset that I trade my time for money and and not to be an volunteer worker.

Am aplicat pentru internship-uri pentru vara aceasta și am primit câteva oferte dintre care cele doua pe care le consider sunt urmatoarele:

-QA Engineer la BitDefender, contract pe 3 luni (Firma foarte bine văzută, echipa pare super)

-Graduate Programme Deutsche Bank (Din câte am citit și mi s-a spus voi lucra prin rotație cu mai multe tehnologii, atât pe Frontend, Backend cu oportunitatea sa rămân pe ce vreau după). De asemenea, contractul va fi pe perioada nedeterminata, iar salariul este cu 700 de lei mai mare decat la BitDefender plus alte beneficii. 

Ideea este ca sunt tentat sa aleg opțiunea 2 și sa merg la Deutsche Bank, în special pentru ca eu vreau sa merg pe Software Development, nu pe QA. Știu și ca Deutsche Bank e mai cunoscuta cu mult la nivel internațional însă nu cunosc atât de multe despre cum este acest program de internship care apoi se tranzitioneaza spre o poziție de junior. Dacă este cineva care are idee despre cum este acolo și de asemenea un sfat în ce privește alegerea mai buna dintre cele doua, I am reaching out for help 🙏."

Hey All

I am a sophomore soon to be junior in college for math but I recently am also trying to major in Comp Sci for SWE(5 year program), i know for developers they can make websites as projects etc, but what can I do to put on resume when it comes for internships?

I know
Python,Java,Javascript,HTML,CSS

During my summer I’m just getting headstart in learning new languages and courses that i’ll take in fall like Data Structures/ Algo etc. I had a goal to make a website and a chrome extension but idk if that would benefit the area i’d interested in(seems more towards software development)

What should I be doing? Just practicing problems ?"

I didn't even know I'm a mid dev because I didn't notice it in the contract. When I did, I feel like I should be paid more.

**Why I want to ask for a raise**

* In my first project, learned a new language, handled admin side of website, have new devs and interns in just a couple of months.
* Assigned to a new project. Second project was more stressful, features were big. handled admin side again. Have been commended on how I fast I learned the language they're using. 
* Praised on my presentation skills, on both projects. Upgraded template that the team is using to this day is from me (Tbh, idk why they didn't do this one since its easy). 
* Volunteered to upgrade an internal project, which required me to learn the software and completed it within two months. 
* Because of that Im assigned to another related project, which means I am currently in two projects. 
* I noticed that my coworker has been treated better than me with less work. Been given better role, assigned to be a team lead or was it a department lead (not really sure). When I compare what work I've put in, I feel like I don't get as rewarded as him hence the next section:

**Why I'm considering to get a better job instead**

* Before I was hired they told me: 6 months probationary &gt; regularization but by the last month of my contract, I was confused why nobody was reaching out to me but superiors were asking me for requirements prior so I was sure I was going to be a regular. It was delayed for 2 months, I think but when the time came, They told me it was actually 6 months project hire &gt; 6 months probationary &gt; regular. Which is not what they said.
* My regularization was delayed for 6 months. 
* Also, I'm not sure if I should bring this up on why I should get a pay raise, I was blind-sided when I was assigned to the second project. I felt wronged actually. I found out that the second project needed a senior dev, but my company assigned *me*. A dev not even a year into learning a new language from the first project, got assigned to this new more demanding one. The second project was confused why I didn't know much on the language they were using and they talked to my company about it. Basically, my company didn't tell me anything, and they told the second project that I'm an experienced dev. So, I was really stressed at the time in meeting deadlines on a major feature (you can imagine how stressed and confused I am on why they gave me such a big task when I was still learning). 
* When I told this to my family, they mentioned that there was a hint of sexism going on. Guy co-worker on first project was getting better treatment. On second project, I was being assertive on a better method to help me create the feature but when I told my team, they said ""that's the way it goes here"", brushed off my ideas, made me do their dirty work, but when senior guy dev told them exactly what I said everyone's like: ""oh yeah that's right. We should do that""

**Why I want another job**

I will still try to ask for a pay raise btw if you guys think I should. I think I can squeeze in with my current job a part time job or something flexible but I'm hesitant bc I'm on the process of migrating to another country and I'm not sure if resigning to the second one with less than a year with them is a good idea. 

Thoughts?"
uqxus7,2,2022-05-16,Advice for self-taught career pivot to software engineer as an unrelated engineering grad,Cliff-Booth-1969,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uqxus7/advice_for_selftaught_career_pivot_to_software/," So, I am currently a student who has just finished my fourth year in a 5-year master's of architectural engineering program focusing on structural engineering. In the past year or so I've really began to feel like I've made a mistake choosing this career path. I perform very well in school at the cost of hard work and dedication to my classes, though as I continue to take more advanced classes, I am really losing interest in the material and have really derailed from my start of college where I had an interest in architecture and math/science. As I have done more research into the actual career of a structural engineer, I have been heavily discouraged by the overall work-life balance I have read and talked to other engineers about at my current internship. The amount of liability, stress, overtime, and lack of flexibility that seems to be coming my way has made me scramble to attempt to re-think my career path. Through plenty of research of related fields, I feel like a career in software development/engineering could be a very good fit for me because I have loved computers and gaming since I was a little kid and to this day still spend plenty of time working with computers primarily through architecture/engineering focused software (Revit, CAD, ETABs, etc.). My only experience with coding comes from high school robotics classes, though it was never too in-depth and I have forgotten most of what I learned. After plenty of research I downloaded python last night and planned on beginning my self-teaching for an hour or so on [learnpython.org](https://learnpython.org/). I really began enjoying it and ended up running through tutorials there and on youtube for about 3 hours and plan on doing at least an hour every day this summer while I'm away working my internship without piles of school work. I plan on graduating next spring with a master's of architectural engineering degree and most likely accepting a position as a structural engineer as I don't expect to be at an entry-level ability of programming to apply for software engineering roles. I am hoping to make a career switch within my first two years out of college.

TL;DR

For those who are civil/architectural engineering grads who have switched into software engineering careers, do you think it is wise to make the career switch directly after college if I am certain I no longer want to become a structural engineer, but might work in the field for a few years to make money while I prepare to switch careers? Would it also be pointless to attempt to get my F.E./P.E. if I know I will not continue this career path? My work ethic is very high and I am certain I will be able to teach myself enough coding to land a full-time tech position within the next couple of years. Any advice on how any of you were able to pivot career paths would be very helpful.

Thank you for any advice!"

In addition, I have relevant work experience in program support in the environmental sector. Indeed, I worked as an intern in (this organization's department) for seven months and supported the team with tasks relevant to biodiversity and health. I was particularly involved in the coordination processes of the (project), and I was very pleased to finally meet you and other colleagues in the (event) we organized in (country 1 in Europe) last March. 

Moreover, through my work in the fundraising sector, I gained insights into projects aiming to conserve endangered species, protect oceans from plastic pollution and overfishing, and promote biodiversity in agriculture. And thanks to my former position at the (organization 2) in (country 2 in Central America), I collaborated with non-governmental organizations on projects related to sustainable development, ecological restoration, and human rights. This position also allowed me to participate in the (event) with the official delegation of (my country). During my stay in (country 2), I also demonstrated my ability to write political and economic reports,  organize events, collaborate with different partners, and work effectively as part of a multicultural team. Finally, my volunteer involvement in various youth associations strengthened my organizational skills and my sense of initiative. 

I  am very enthusiastic about the possibility of joining your team again at (the international organization) and using my skills and dedication to support the projects of the (department). I could start working remotely immediately if necessary and then relocate to (a city in country 3 in Africa) very quickly. 

I remain fully available for any further questions, and I look forward to hearing from you.

ur1bht,84,2022-05-16,[University] Transitioning to 11 Years of Poverty: A Reflection of 2 years in Medical School (As a Poly Kid),UniRejectee,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ur1bht/university_transitioning_to_11_years_of_poverty_a/,"It is often believed that as a polytechnic student — it is harder to get into university, let alone medical school. But I beg to differ. 

Let’s break it down together.

Out of the 1000 or so poly graduates who possess a relevant diploma to apply for medicine^(1), let us assume that a generous 20 per cent have met the minimum GPA requirements ([\&gt;3.82 as of 2022](https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp))). Of these 200 students, some could have found their calling in a non-medical field - leaving perhaps less than 100 people to compete with^(2).

Furthermore, the hands-on pedagogy and internship opportunities in poly equip us with a helpful advantage. From phlebotomy to microbiology and laboratory diagnostics, these experiences and knowledge give us a greater appreciation for all the work that makes patient care successful ~~and more BS material during the interview.~~

~~And with a bit of affirmative action for the necessary inclusivity,~~ I would say our chances of getting in as a polytechnic student are comparable, if not slightly more, than the average JC student.

Indeed, there are definitely other polytechnic peers who needed to scale higher mountains and overcome greater adversities to reach where they are. But I would not dare to claim that for myself.

My GPA in polytechnic was carried by a friend who only became my Final Year Project (FYP) partner after losing a bet that I would not eat a bowl of chilli flakes — something which I ultimately did (undoubtedly the best decision ever). Fast forward to med school, I definitely would not have survived either if not for my friends who shared their entire OneNote with me…

Like the Rat who was carried on the back of the Ox in the zodiac race, I am only where I am because of the people who were placed in my life (and are now sadly stuck with me).

\* \* \*

In contrast to the sense of direction and motivation I had in polytechnic, there was less of it once I entered med school. Not because I did not cherish the opportunity given to me, but simply because I found myself no longer with a goal. Intently focused on getting in, I had never thought of what I would do next if I did.

Gone were the never-ending assignments, reports and project submissions that were present in polytechnic. Instead, there were close to none in the first two years of med school. As a polytechnic student who was more inclined toward hands-on learning, the stronger emphasis on rote memorisation took a while for me to get used to.

After all, it was only handling and spilling a urine sample on myself that I learnt, with some consolation, that urine is sterile (if taken mid-stream).

As an innately lazy person who was no longer pushed by a continuous stimulus, my life in med school could be summed up as such:

 *With lectures at twice the speed, a month is enough.*

*Why try hard when I just want to pass?*

*With high yield notes, two weeks is enough.*

*Hey, ‘big picture' is no doubt all they can ask.*

*With practice papers, a week is enough.* 

*Just a few, and I’m probably ready to go.*

*With three days left, that’s more than enough.*

*Besides, how far can I really be behind?*

*STEMI, ADH and FBP2…*

*Oh f\*ck, oh no, what the shit do I actually know.* 

*Please Lord, save me, and I swear on my soul…*

*No more last-minute cram — I’ll do as your will says so.*

*With this self-induced ordeal over, rest is what I lack.* 

*After all, I do deserve a pat on the back.*

*A week or two? Or perhaps even more?* 

*With lectures at twice the speed, a month is more than enough… (right?).*

**TLDR:** Slack ➔ Panic 2 weeks before exams ➔ Exams ➔ Rinse and Repeat

Well, as the common adage goes: *If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do*[*\[1\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law#cite_note-5)

However, I do realise that while ‘easy’ to pass, it was way harder to be a competent physician. Studying 50 per cent to pass would not save the patient if what they required was the other 50 per cent that I totally did not read up on. And I acknowledge that, at times, the bare minimum was all that I aimed for. There were, of course, instances where I could have tried harder but didn't - both in learning and participation.

Admittedly, the first two years of medical school have been a honeymoon period. From designing a website and creating resources for poly students to tutoring primary school kids every weekend, I took the time to pursue other non-medical interests instead.

Most memorably, my friends and I helped install emergency buttons in the homes of elderly living alone during the semester break. A paid ‘CIP’ to talk to old people while actually doing something tangible to help? That was everything I could ask for.

&lt;Insert ~~obligatory~~ paragraph about some wholesome/poignant patient interaction&gt;^(3)

Could I have done more in terms of taking up medical and school-related commitments? Definitely. But do I regret all the stuff that I have done in the past two years? Definitely not. One way or another, they have helped to develop me holistically as an individual and (hopefully) as a physician.

Reflecting on my journey thus far, I am ever grateful to those who have supported and held me accountable whenever I needed it. If I were to be asked what my greatest takeaway has been, I guess it would be how to initiate and maintain a parasitic commensal relationship with everyone that I had the great fortune of meeting.

I only hope that with the opportunities and experiences given to me, I can continue to improve as a person, however slight, not only for my friends but also for my future patients. 

\* \* \*

^(1)Based on the estimated cohort size of all accredited and relevant diploma courses from the five polytechnics that are eligible to apply for medicine.

^(2)Please take my estimation and ‘educated’ assumptions with a pinch of salt.

ur1isa,44,2022-05-16,White Male with good stats and weak (but maybe unusual) ECs gets interesting results for engineering,tablerocker,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/ur1isa/white_male_with_good_stats_and_weak_but_maybe/,"

**Demographics:**

Gender: Male

Race: White

Residence: Missouri

Income: 150k+

School: semi-competitive public

Hooks: possibly geographic? Idk

**Intended Major(s):** mechanical engineering

**Academics:**

Unweighted: 4.0

Weighted: 5.0

Rank: 1/367

Honors Courses: I took everything honors for 9-10 and then did IB diploma for 11-12

**Standardized Testing:**

ACT: 36 

IB Scores: 5 in Global Politics and 6 in ES&amp;S 

ECs:

1. Varsity Soccer 4-year starter and team captain sr year, organized and ran the team’s offseason program the summer before sr year

2. Math Team - did a bunch of math contests and I was selected as team captain for one of them 

3. FBLA - state champion and several-time national qualifier,  VP of my school’s chapter

4. Played guitar for 6 years and banjo for 2

5. club soccer (won a few regional tournaments)

6. Aircraft mechanic intern at local company

7. Co-founded club to tutor athletes (did for 1 year then the school basically took it over)

8. Played in a local band from 7-10th grade

9. Took small-engine repair class at local community college (Fixed a tiller and two chainsaws)

10. Volunteered about 30 hours with habitat for humanity

**Awards:**

1. Went into more detail about my FBLA awards
2. Went into more detail about my math contest awards (4x aime qual, top 10 at smaller national math contest)
3. National Merit Finalist
4. National Honor Society Member
5. Academic All-state (soccer)


**Rec Letters:**

1. IB HL Math Teacher - 7/10. I didn’t participate a ton in class but she ran all the math contest stuff I did and I think she liked me decently well
2. IB ES&amp;S teacher - 8.5/10. I loved his class and participated a lot and I think he liked me pretty well. He also writes very personal recommendation letters so I think that helped
3. Counselor - 7/10. I didn't know her too well so it's always difficult but she did make me fill out a form that had me list out my passions/ECs so I assumed he talked on them. We also sat down and talked for an hour about my interests and goals for college and stuff and she seemed genuinely interested

**Interviews:**

Olin: 5/10. Was my first (and only) college interview so I was nervous and I  definitely didn’t talk that smoothly and I got someone’s pronouns wrong but I still think I made some good points and gave some legitimately good answers.

**Essays:**

*Common App - 9.5/10. I wrote it about how music played a role in several influential moments of my life. It was super unique and well-written and was honestly one of my best pieces of writing ever I think

Ut Prosim Essays (Virginia Tech) - 7.5/10. They were not super deep or insightful but pretty well written i think

Olin Supplemental essays - 9/10. I wrote one of them about my desire to work in the outdoor power sports industry (making it electric) and how it would positively impact the world. I wrote the other one about my time working at an aircraft maintenance shop and how it inspired me to pursue a more hands-on education (this one fit really well with the school’s values).

**Initial Decisions:**

*Admitted:*

Alabama: Obviously expected to get in here but still excited. Their NMF scholarship is ridiculous and their engineering program is surprisingly good (especially if you get involved)

Colorado School of Mines (EA): this was nice. Loved the location and they had a ton of cool hands-on stuff. Ultimately wasn’t worth it money wise compared to Alabama though

*Waitlists:*

Virginia Tech (EA): When I opened this one I just laughed. I thought this was a safety/low target. Overall though I wasn’t that upset

Olin College of Engineering: this one hurt. I literally spent 2 full weekends falling in love with it (for their interview process) and then got smacked with this

*Rejections:*

None

**Updates:**

April 15: got accepted off the waitlist at Virginia tech. Ultimately though it didn’t have much to offer that I couldn’t get at mines or Alabama so I declined. 

May 1: committed to Alabama. I was honestly very excited to be going here and I’m sure it would have been awesome.

May 3: got accepted off the waitlist at Olin. I was absolutely shocked and it took me awhile to process. Me and my dad went on a quick visit up there and it was exactly what i hoped it would be like. Committed there on may 5 and I’m hyped for next fall.

**Conclusion:** 

I think a good list will yield a good result no matter what happens and that was definitely true here. Having a safety you’re legitimately excited about going to makes the whole process a lot less stressful. Also, I ultimately got into every school on my list which is pretty cool. I’m not sure exactly why that happened but I was definitely able to write better essays because I applied to so few schools."
ur2fci,2,2022-05-16,I realised it really is me against them,-Still-Alive-,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ur2fci/i_realised_it_really_is_me_against_them/,"I get jealous very often and i have to work harder than anyone else everytime i do something. Some people are just blessed with luck, likability, friends, looks, talents. The only talent and also flaw that i have is that i'm very perfectionistic. So i hate my looks cuz they're not perfect i hate most of my drawings cuz they're not perfect. And i feel like it's a battle between me and everyone else if i find a friend, over said friend. I have to compete with others all the time. I have to fight so friends won't replace me with somebody else i have to fight and protect my spot all the time. And i got this thought that maybe if i'm better than anyone else i can finally find peace cuz there'll only be few to fight me for my spot. So now i'm the best at my maths, english and arts class and (rn i'm in spain for a school internship with a few others) rn i'm the best at spanish in the group of people that came along.

For reference, I'm in Brazil and tech internships often lean into 1-2 year periods.

The reason I won't be able to request another 6 months is because I'll be  graduating in that time, and I won't be legally eligible for most  internships as a non-student. I brought this matter to my Product Owner  and she asked me to keep her updated, however I got a feeling it won't  lead to anything. My former tech lead suggested I pressure the company  with an offer from another company, or just an actual talk about how I  like the company and I would like to keep working there, but as a  full-time employee there seeing as it's the only way possible. I thought about talking with my current tech lead as well.

The pay isn't all that good (especially since it's a national company), but  I've been liking my team and I would spend more time there no problem.  Should I start sending out resumes already or is there a sound strategy I  can use to get my company to full time me?"

I’m changing majors to Computer Science at the end of my term (end of June). WGU has a system where you earn your credits essentially as fast as you can take and pass the equivalent of finals for a course, whether that’s an exam or a project/essay.

I’m about halfway done with my IT degree, and I’ll be probably about 35-40% done with the CompSci degree once I transfer.

My goal is to graduate next July, and I’m very confident it will be within the next 18 months.

In the meantime, I’ve been self teaching programming while working on the IT degree. I’m fairly comfortable with C# (feel good about syntax and whatnot - haven’t done a large project yet). I’ve recently started to work through freecodecamp to learn HTML, CSS, and JS.

As I work on my degree, I’m going to be building a portfolio of projects I work on. I’ve heard from some WGU grads that a lot of the projects required for some of the coursework can be used in the portfolio, so I’ll throw those in there, and I plan on building a personal website once I finish with freecodeacademy.

So I have a few questions. Firstly, is there anything else I should be doing to prepare myself both for actually getting a job, as well as being prepared for it?

And secondly, how realistic is it that I could land a job before graduating, ideally remote? I would like to move, and I’d be able to if I landed a job. I just signed a lease for a year on my apartment, and I’d ideally like to move them. I would expect myself to be equivalent to somewhere around finishing my junior year and hopefully have a few projects in my portfolio. If not an actual job, where should I be looking for internships? In the past for non-CS jobs, I’ve just used Indeed. Are there better resources to use for internships and/or general CS jobs?"

ur3lnl,1,2022-05-16,Should I switch courses? Having a crisis,Infinite_Beginning_4,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/ur3lnl/should_i_switch_courses_having_a_crisis/,"This will be a bit of rant, so TLDR is at bottom.

I am a second year student who is taking PPE (entry was AAA to give context as to what uni I am at), and I have spent last 6 months of my life having a mental crisis about if I should switch courses or not.

I realised half way through the year that PPE is definitely the wrong choice of degree for me - I consider myself a mathsy person and took maths further maths physics and economics for my A-levels. I chose PPE as I went to uni with no idea what I wanted to do as a job, so I thought that PPE would be a good option as it is very broad and (I thought that) it didn't close off anything. However, the course has had negligible maths content, and I have realised that the careers that I would be interested in pursuing after university would most likely be STEM and programming related. So, PPE doesn't seem relevant at all to anything I would be interested in going into. Despite this making my degree feel very pointless and ruining my mental health, I have managed to drag myself through it so far and am on a high 2:1 at the moment.

I have spent half the year trying to see if there is any way for me to switch courses to a STEM related joint honours, but I have found out that that would be impossible.

My options are as follows:

1. I could stay on my course and then do a year in industry I have managed to secure as an analyst from July. Then, after my year in industry, I could drag myself through final year and maybe come out with a first, if I can motivate myself properly. Then I could potentially do a masters that would be relevant to something I was more directly interested in going into. However, this would involve me dragging myself through a year of university for a course which I am fairly sure I would dislike, meaning motivating myself to get a high grade would be difficult, and I don't know how easy it would actually be to pursue careers I would be interested in moving into. Also, the masters I could apply for would be limited as I wouldn't have the a STEM related degree, and many masters I would be interested in seem to require them.
2. I could finish my second-year exams, and then switch to the first year of either mathematics or a related course at the same university (I think I might be able to get the money to self-fund first year - this is relevant student finance would not be available for this option), bang out loads of work and aim to get a high grade in it. I could make sure I do stuff relevant to what I wanted to go into during this summer, and get a relevant summer internship during second year summer. I could then go into industry or apply for masters which require a STEM subject. Doing another undergrad after this one seems like it would be very expensive and somewhat pointless, so it seems like I should either make this choice now or never.

Currently the second option appeals to me more - I have always enjoyed maths and believe I would enjoy the course. It would be a more obvious career path for moving into STEM and programming related jobs than completing my PPE degree, and I would have more of a sense of purpose in doing the work if I believed it actually helped me move into what I want to go in to. However, it comes with the obvious downsides of costing a lot more, and involving another 3 years in university instead of a year in industry and then final year. This could make it harder for me mentally as I would feel like I'm starting from the beginning, and I see everyone else in my year group moving on and getting jobs.

I have been thinking about this now for a while and there seems like no obvious choice, so I am hoping someone here might be able to provide some helpful advice or point something out I haven't considered.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I don't enjoy my degree and it isn't relevant to what I would enjoy working in, so should I stick it out or spend money switching degrees to something more relevant and would enjoy more."

ur4bz9,1,2022-05-16,Feeling Lost,Peesanthar,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ur4bz9/feeling_lost/,"Okay, this is gonna be a long and rambly one so bear with me please

I'm currently a 19 year old student studying in Central Coast California. I'm originally from Orange County and I mention this to provide some context, but I have lived an extremely fortunate life. I have never had to worry about anything being provided for me, and I have the most incredible parents who are loving and willing to both teach me and provide me with things I want. However, I've always suspected I had ADHD since I was young, but due to having ethnic parents who didn't believe in those things and being too young to understand anything, my cries were never heard. 

As far back as kindergarten and 1st grade, I always have remembered myself as being different. I would always say the weirdest and cringiest things, which often had 0 pertinence to the conversation. I was also exceptionally impulsive and jumpy, and although I was getting extremely high grades and was viewed as bright, I felt out of control and was seen as such. 

Fast forward to middle school, I really started to see myself being shunned by social expectations. My only friends, who were much smoother and better looking than me, instantly left my side once they received their first dose of female attention. I felt backstabbed, and often retreated to corners of the school to sit alone during recess and lunch. I slowly started to look at myself and my friends who were enjoying themselves much more than I was, and I started to obsess over every fabric of myself. I began to dress nice, I changed my hair, and started to try and be more outgoing. Eventually, I became the funny, but annoying kid; a cool place if you want attention but detrimental as I felt I was trapped within the gray area between popular and unpopular. Obviously, I realize now that these were childish things, but it had led to my wariness of others and began my masking. 

The same was mostly true through high school, but as the demand increased and natural intelligence could not carry me any longer, I began to succumb to feelings which I know now are part of my ADHD. I struggled academically, but always managed to stay above a 3.5 GPA weighted. However, I managed to find a group of the most amazing friends, who along with ethnicity, shared similar senses of humor and interests to me. 

In college however, I was alone. I had no parents to help, I was in a rural area, extremely different to the wealthy and flashy area I grew up in. Also to mention, I am a huge fan of cars, they have been my hyperfixation for years as I feel as if the only time I can ever escape my ADHD is when I am driving. Orange County is filled with things to capture my attention, and the prospect of a luxurious life with my friends and family has in turn always heavily appealed to me. 

Throughout all of my alone time, where I was extremely depressed, I once again took a deeper look at myself. I started to practice emotional regulation, and became incredible at it. I was able to step back in any situation and evaluate how I should proceed emotionally and tangibly. I also started to harvest my extreme motivation to live my dream life. I've always operated under the perspective that my parents have worked so unbelievably hard to give me the opportunity to succeed, and to not do that and more would be disappointing, especially with all of the resources I have been blessed with. 

Anyways, I began to work my ass off in everything I did. Due to the depression I was facing from being alone and getting cheated on by my girlfriend back home, I never really felt my ADHD symptoms at all. I was locked in as if it were life and death. I eventually managed to secure myself an internship with the NBA, which I was extremely happy about. During that summer internship last July, I came in on a mission. I was working alongside a close accomplice of Kobe Bryant, and having that aura around me definitely pushed my motivations. However, I began to get comfortable due to my depressive state waning. I lost my touch, I could not focus or motivate myself to do anything. Looking back on my life, I can safely say that pre-meds, the only times I have ever found myself getting anything done is during a period of extreme stress. And when I have gotten things done, they tend to be great.

I screwed up my internship, disappointing one of my heroes, and came out of it regretting every single moment. Once again, I took another look at myself as the school year started. I started evaluating the real possibility of ADHD and was eventually put on Adderall XR in December of last year. It was amazing, I felt in control and was getting things done. 

However, (sorry for the long buildup, this is the part I really wanted to ask but I felt like I needed all this context) while I was working my ass off and networking like crazy, I still am finding it hard to see what it is I want. I have seen that I have a lot of trouble gathering up motivation and putting my all into something if there's obscurity behind it. I spend all day thinking about ways to be successful, drawing up hundreds and thousands of ideas and pathways to success daily. I have put my entire focus into my career, as I've operated under the mindset that I'd rather work when I'm 18 and party when I'm 25, not the other way around. I hope someone else can relate to at least the feeling of confusion and misdirection when trying to achieve something. I apologize if this has come off in a poor way, but I'm simply trying to get all my thoughts on paper and if anyone has any suggestions on steps I can take to work towards this goal in a smarter and less stressful way I would truly appreciate it , along with any other possible success stories! Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

:TLDR

I had a lot of stuff from my childhood that has fostered an extremely hungry and motivated individual with ADHD who is getting lost in his own head on what he should do to reach the success he's dreamed of."

We all know that LinkedIn can be a valuable tool for professional development, but I wanted to share just how much it's impacted my own career.

I graduated university right in the middle of Covid, with ~3 years of level 1 helpdesk experience working at my school (among some other unpaid internships and work done in high school). It was a good gig and started at $12/hr. Eventually I hit $17/hr. 

I spent almost a year looking for work, and made it to the final interview rounds at a few companies, some of which were big names. Ultimately, I never locked anything in. I made sure to connect with the hiring managers and always asked for feedback which was all the same: I killed the interviews, had a competitive resume, but didn't have enough experience for the positions I was applying for (Sys Admin roles, generally). 

Eventually, I was DM'd on LinkedIn by a recruiter looking for a Level 3 Helpdesk Engineer for a large computer manufacturer. After a brief interview process, I locked in that job making around $58k a year (a great boost from the $17/hr position I previously had).

After about a year, I started looking for new work, mostly to scope out the market. I put myself as ""Open to Work"" on LinkedIn and was basically immediately contacted by a hiring manager from one of the previous companies I interviewed with.

Another brief interview later, I accepted an offer for a Linux Systems Administrator position at 112k/year with Secret Clearance. 

In short, LinkedIn certainly facilitated this process and enabled me to create the connections required to land some great roles. Keep your profile up to date and connect with everyone you can; you never know who will reach out!"

I love data science, machine learning, the complexity of the algorithms and the beauty of the solutions and its impact in the real world. However, today I just felt so disappointed in myself. I had an interview with a startup ceo, he didn't have a data science so apparently he was looking for one, or maybe someone who can get the job done at least for now as he mentioned the starup is growing up. Everything was going great during the interview till he asked me about the projects I did. I only did one and that was not enough for him. Genuinely, I was ready to learn more and more during the internship, I was seeking knowledge and was really enthusiastic about it. But I think that was not enough, so he gently rejected me. I don't blame him for nothing he was really respectful, but I lost respect for myself and I began to think I am a looser.

In addition to my Bachelors, I also want to get my Masters in CS afterwards depending on my financial situation post-Bachelors.

Aside from a Masters, what else should I focus on when pursuing a SWE career, particularly things that I can do while in school?

ur8fjp,1,2022-05-16,Past due balance with the university for the second time and loan disbursement?,glo-del,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ur8fjp/past_due_balance_with_the_university_for_the/,"I’m currently in a situation where I need to pay off a past due balance to the school.

This past academic year (2021-22) I received significantly less aid than I did the year prior, and my out-of-pocket cost nearly tripled. I was able to make the first payment on the payment plan back in the fall but quickly fell off because I could not afford it as a full-time student. I tried applying for loans and scholarships and was in a really tight spot. By the end of the fall semester, I owed $4,500 and was locked out to register for the spring semester.

Because I’m an out-of-state student who is completely responsible for taking care of myself at college, I faced the risk of being homeless by the start of the spring semester. This was because I wasn’t registered for classes which made me ineligible to stay in the dorms and the student accounts office refused to lift the registration hold with a past due balance. After being annoyingly persistent, they shared that if I could get a parent to fill out a parent plus loan from the fed government and get denied, I’d receive $4,000 in additional aid (fed loans). But, to receive it they’d have to lift the hold and enroll me in the spring. Yay! Problem solved, right? No.

The fed government only disburses loans equally between both fall and spring. So only $2,000 came off the fall past due balance and the other half would be applied to my spring balance ($6,000). By the end of the spring semester, I would have originally had a balance of $6,300. But, after working my ass off to get $2,000 paid off, the balance is now down to $4,300. I shared with them that I'd be able to pay off an additional $1,500 by the end of the summer with my new internship and even showed them the offer letter for proof. But now I’m back in the same position as before with a past due balance and I NEED to register. Otherwise, I lose my internship which pays the bills and my graduation date gets pushed back.

I moved off campus to reduce the bill that I’d owe the University after finally finding a place that’s way cheaper. Since my family’s income hasn’t changed, I’d actually be owed a refund in the form of loan disbursement based on my EFC after filling out FAFSA and intended to use that loan money to pay them back. But, the loans won’t even be released to the school unless I’m enrolled, and they’ve refused to lift the hold.

I know they already did it once and it might be crazy to ask again, but this time I finally have a tangible way to pay them back. My refund will be twice the amount I currently owe, and my other scholarships cover the entire cost of tuition and fees, so it’s not like I’d owe them again for the upcoming term - I’d finally get caught up.

As a side note, believe me - I’ve already tried everything. Cosigned loans with parents have been denied, parent plus loan was also denied, and I’m constantly applying for scholarships. I could work until I could pay it off but my internship is my source of income and without being enrolled in college, I’ll get kicked out of the program. Would it be impossible to get them to agree to lift it? I told them I’d fill out any necessary paperwork to authorize them to apply the loan disbursement to my balance first.

Any help/advice would be appreciated!"

* Gender: Male (Sigma)
* Race/Ethnicity: White (Latin American)
* Residence: BRASIL NUMERO 1 DO MUNDO PENTACAMPEÃO  **🇧🇷**  **🇧🇷**  **🇧🇷**  **🇧🇷** 🏆🏆🏆
* Income Bracket: High (no aid)
* Type of School: Small private school (graduating class of \~65) unknown outside my city
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): Legacy at Cornell (granddad PhD) and Northwestern (dad MBA). Not sure that even counts, though.

**Intended Major(s)**: Aerospace where it's offered, MechE otherwise.

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 9 out of 10 UW (school doesn't weigh)
* Rank (or percentile): Top 5 out of 65 (approx.)
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: No
* Senior Year Course Load: Uhhh regular Brazilian HS course load?

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT I: 1510 (770 math, 740 english) taken twice (superscore)
* ACT: 27, did not submit obviously hahaha
* SAT II: 770 Math II, 800 Physics
* AP/IB: Nope
* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): 140 Duolingo

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. \#1 Paid internship at an energy solutions company, worked in finance and data science, but primarily research on expanding into renewable energy. According to my supervisor I helped them start their wind energy sector earlier than expected!
2. \#2 Credit courses at Cornell (simp alert), took Calculus I (calc isn't covered in Brazilian high schools) and an astrophysics course, got A- and A+ respectively, total 7 credits (all online).
3. \#3 Volunteer service: Installed thermal insulation in precarious homes in poor communities near my city. Also helped distribute basic needs kits (food, hygiene, blankets, etc) to the inhabitants.
4. \#4 Led some independent research (not published, just a little side project because I was curious) on the effects that high schoolers' life habits have on their academic development and performance.
5. \#5 Aerospace engineering summer program at Syracuse (online).
6. \#6 Made many short films with and without friends and colleagues over just about all of middle and high school. It's a big hobby of mine and I even won a little award.
7. \#7 Summer program at Yale, studied physics, engineering and chemistry.
8. \#8 Took optional extracurricular robotics, technology and entrepreneurship courses at school.
9. \#9 Designed and built a Stirling engine (turns heat from a candle into movement).
10. \#10 Piano lessons.

**Awards/Honors**

For context, here in Brazil we have this test called the ENEM (National High School Exam). It's like our SAT but it is way, way worse. It takes 10 hours (two sections, 5h each) to complete and it covers every discipline taught in high school. Thrice a year, my school held some mock ENEMs, which I took 7 times. I was a bit of a fool to never participate in any competitions outside of school, so they make up the bulk of my awards section:

1. \#1 5 times (4 consecutive) first place (of 60) as the highest scorer of my school on these mock tests.
2. \#2 The other two times I got second place.
3. \#3 2 consecutive times highest math score of my school on the official (non-mock) ENEM.
4. \#4 Best documentary award at an inter-school film expo.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: 9/10, I've known her for like 4 years and we've talked many times so it was a great letter.

Physics teacher: 10/10. One of my favorite teachers, we were quite close, fantastic letter.

Film teacher: 7/10. Unusual choice for a STEM applicant but film is probably my main interest outside of STEM and I wanted to demonstrate that. We were quite close and even now after I graduated, me and my friends are working with him to make one last short film before we go our separate ways for college.

**Interviews**

Northwestern: 6/10, stumbled on my words several times and now that I think about it some of my answers were just downright silly, but the interview had some great moments.

Columbia (yes, I had the audacity to apply): 9/10. I learned from my mistakes from the NU interview and this one flowed super nicely and I got to talk a lot about my interests besides STEM, which is great because Columbia encourages interdisciplinarity with its core curriculum and all that. Felt amazing afterwards.

**Essays**

Wrote about how my passion for engineering evolved alongside my passion for film and how they intertwined in fun ways. I liked it a lot.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* *Pennsylvania State University EA*
* *Purdue University EA deferred (bruh?), later accepted*
* *Case Western Reserve University EA*
* *University of São Paulo (got that 6% acceptance rate clout 😳)*
* *Small business/STEM focused private school near where I live*

*Waitlists:*

* *Boston University RD, later rejected*
* *University of Notre Dame RD, later rejected*
* *New York University RD,* ***still waiting!***

*Rejections:*

* *Cornell Univeristy ED (pain.)*
* *University of Michigan EA*
* *Georgia Tech EA2*
* *Carnegie Mellon University ED2*
* *University of Virginia EA*
* *Johns Hopkins RD (why did I even)*
* *Northwestern RD - dad got really sad :(*
* *University of Pennsylvania RD - delusional*
* *Columbia University RD - beyond f-cking delusional*

That's how it be for internationals...

**Additional Information:**

After visiting all my waitlist and admit schools (except Penn State, sorry PSU), I've decided to commit to...

Case Western Reserve!

""What?!?!"" I hear you cry, ""He chose Case over Purdue for Aerospace?!""

Yeah. For many reasons. I'm personally a fan of being able to get to know your professors better, and the tighter-knit environment and lower class sizes facilitate that massively. Also, the difference in the graduation requirements for the MechE major and the Aero major is just 3 courses so I can go for the dual major without too much extra work. And if that doesn't work out, switching majors is a breeze there.

I'm still a bit bitter about that rejection-to-admission ratio as I expected things would work out a bit better for me, especially after a gap year, but then I remind myself of how great a school Case is, and seeing the amount of high-stat applicants who got rejected/waitlisted there makes me feel better about my acceptance. It makes it feel like a real clutch.

Still waiting for that NYU waitlist (ultra crapshoot, I know), but I'm honestly super happy that things worked out nicely in the end. CWRU 2026!!!"

I've been having a bit of an issue with my current internship.

I have an AAS in a field equivalent to CompE and I'm currently a second year in an EE &amp; CS. I have a lot left to learn but I'm no spring chicken in certain subjects. 

This is my second internship and it's, sadly, been a bit of a clerical nightmare more than an engineering one - which is fine. I am aware of the potential office work that comes with engineering and the company doesn't produce the most \*exciting\* work, so this is somewhat expected. 

(For the most part, I was mostly looking for experience to put on my resume since I live and go to school in area with limited opportunity)

**The problem is this**: I started this internship early and have been working for a month now. I have constantly asked for more work, since I finish the clerical stuff REALLY quickly, and I started to feel like I was really annoying my supervisors and direct manager so I eased off. 

When I was first brought onto the team, I was told I would work on a programming project so I have been waiting patiently (apart from occasionally reminding my supervisors that I'm ready to start programming whenever). 

Fast forward a few weeks and a new and very pretty intern is brought on. She is an EE with little to no programming experience. On her FIRST DAY she is put to work on the programming project that I was supposed to be working on, since day one.

She's cool and none of this is her fault but it was insanely obvious the engineer spearheading this project has a huge crush on her and is disinterested in having me work with him, instead. His loud flirty giggle can be heard throughout the warehouse. I genuinely think this is unfair especially since I am literally an EE CS and she has, admittedly, no programming experience.

I can't help but to feel like there is some fishy stuff going on and I need some advice on how to handle this situation. I don't want to take any opportunity away from the other intern but I also feel as if I am being robbed of industry experience. I would like to bring this up to management **but in a professional manner**.

I have constantly been in communication with my direct manager and other supervisors about my willingness and readiness to work and it was my direct manager that put her on that project, asap. I don't want to be confrontational about it and I think it would be more productive for me If I go to upper management about potential work. However, I feel going above my managers head would be unprofessional. 

I am at a loss on what to do. On one hand, it has already been unproductive to talk to my direct manager about potential work but I dont want to rustle any feathers by becoming confrontational or going above his head on this. 

What would be the best way to handle this?"

Open to any school suggestions

Current ""junior"" (I have 3 classes left, but want to take all 4 years of college so I'm just taking a lot of credit fillers/GPA boosters the next two semesters) double major in math/computer science at a large T50 (for CS/math) state school in the US.

3.34 GPA overall; my math major GPA is \~3.6 (All As and Bs) and my CS major GPA is \~2.8 (yikes)...I have 4 Cs and a D in 300/400 level classes so I figure that's a pretty big strike against. If I'm being completely honest, I am usually pretty lazy when it comes to the big projects and failed (&lt;50% credit) on a lot of them. Doing exceptionally well on exams and being able to slam out the ""easier"" projects in like 2 hours right before they were due was the only reason I passed.

I TA'ed for an intro-ish data structures class this last semester, I have 2 noteworthy research experiences and 1 internship; I've been with one bioinformatics group for about 4 years (since high school) and across 2 universities (remote work), with 3 middle-author publications and one first-author under review. The other was for a summer doing AI work, but the lab didn't pay undergrads and the grad students generally weren't great to work with. The internship was 7mo and with a mid-stage SF startup in the dev tools space; I have an ok amount of open-source contributions from it  (\~2500 lines of production code) and my manager seemed to like me a lot.

Do I have any chance at a funded MS or should I stick to my original plan of just getting a regular job after college? One of my bigger motivations is just to have a bit more time outside of the corporate rat race, and hopefully do some fun research or TA while doing the MS."
urbwlh,2,2022-05-16,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (5/16/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/urbwlh/weekly_job_qa_thread_5162022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 121st installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I have a dilemma to work through. I am a fresh engineering graduate and I’ve been offered two positions, one as a summer intern for company A and another as a full time engineer at company B. 

Company A is located in an area I would prefer to live in long term: there are significantly more opportunities in that area, I have distant family and friends in the same area…I would generally be happier there. Company A is also a leading company in my field of interest.

Company B is a reputable company but is located in a small town a flight away from any of my friends/family. There’s not much else going on in that area except for this company. It provides secure and steady income, but I know I will eventually want to leave the area. 

I’m at a crossroads, if company A was offering me a full time position I would accept in a heartbeat, I’m not sure if it’s worth risking unemployment at the end of summer. Hoping for some solid advice, thanks a lot."

&amp;#x200B;

I've mainly worked with soft dev in the past(2 previous software dev internships) and disliked it, I don't enjoy building websites and apps if its not for my own sake. I've also done a machine learning internship where I loved doing the work I was doing, creating a sentiment analysis algorithm to classify a company's forum text and ive done more ML related side projects then anything else ever since. So I am interested in that. I've also done a lot of security related stuff in the past by doing CTF's and mainly fell in love with cryptography(creating certain algorithms to hide info and breaking already existing ones through the use of math).

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my interests as of right now are NLP and Cryptography and I've also enjoyed working with CV but I have no clue weather Computer Engineering or math is better for that. I know for a fact math's courses are better for them and I really enjoy math's flexibility in terms of courses, and I dislike hardware and sciences so this should be an easy decision. But my parents do want me to do Computer Engineering and its more prestigious among people so I just thought I should get some opinions before committing.  


For reference my goal was always to do CS + Stats or CS + CO depending on what my interests would be in later years but sadly that isn't an option for me(UW admissions are too hard lmao)."

I was brought in to replace a teacher that is leaving and to start taking the Cambridge courses for the students. I am the youngest there and all the teachers are all close to my mother's age. There are only 3 male teachers and the rest are all female including me. But on my third day of work, I heard rumours going around about my dressing on that day being inappropriate, even though I wasn't confronted about it by any of the teachers who had seen me or was in the room with me. I had followed the dress code to a T so the whole situation was just uncomfortable and I confronted the Vice Principal about it the following day. She said she hadn't seen me but had received a call from a certain teacher reporting my clothing. When I asked my colleagues that I have established a rapport with, they said they saw nothing wrong and in fact didn't even notice anything. I had a very difficult time after coming home on the day of the incident, as it triggered a lot of childhood trauma for me including being bullied by my teachers in school for my hair. (there was nothing wrong with it, it was just a bit on the short side and the teachers wanted me to ""control"" it by oiling it and using every accessory possible to manage it) 
I wore traditional Indian wear as we are required to, with full length sleeves. At my old job I would wear casual jeans and some times my clothes were body-fitting but I never received any complaints. Even though most of the student and staff are strictly Muslim (not prejudiced, just stating the facts, I live in the Middle East). Everyone was concerned with their jobs and we all only spoke about work and art. 

I kept my eyes and ears open after that incident and picked up a lot of small problems like: we are not allowed to take photocopies so that they can save money; on Thursday I was asked to be ""respectful"" to all the teachers especially the male teacher who would be taking over as the department head (I have a reputation for being too formal, so I don't know where this is coming from) ; teachers pointing out which students could be dating each other; having to sacrifice weekends to help with extracurricular activities for the school, etc. The whole culture of the place sets off alarms for me because it is so close to my schooling and I had such a terrible experience with school. I am working with the aim that I will be a solace for the kids who have a hard time like I did, but I would first have to remind myself that I am in control now😂

Where I am concerned is, whether this is the right environment for me. If this is the sort of mindset I will be dealing with, it's not for me. I am more interested in the subject and doing my work efficiently and coming home ASAP because I want to work on my art and plan for my masters. I sweat bullets every morning when I wake up, thinking about going back to that place. I was given the understanding that they were open-minded and learning focused but this incident and these few other minor things I noticed tell me it's all about the money and their reputation. I have nothing else lined up and I felt horrible when I had decided to leave my old job. They wanted me in the college and I enjoyed working with the students. Maybe if I stuck it out they would offer me a more permanent role but now I cannot take up an intern role anymore. Its gotten to the point where I got sick and am at home recuperating.

The kids are pretty great. I haven't had any trouble from them. They listen and work diligently. I never wanted to be a teacher but circumstances have pushed me to this point. My mother has also been teaching for many years and is the sole bread winner of the house now and she tells me it is my call even though I know that it's better to keep the job because the extra income is going to take a burden off her. I just don't want to sell my soul for a bigger pay. 

Seasoned professionals I seek your advice."
urfk4r,26,2022-05-17,Projects for CS incoming freshmen,Aggravating-File-580,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/urfk4r/projects_for_cs_incoming_freshmen/,"Hey Guys! I am an incoming freshman attempting to build up a strong resume this summer to help me get an internship next summer. I need some advice on what projects I could do to aim for big tech internships. My idea is that if I prepare my profile to be strong enough for big tech, I will have a higher chance of getting an internship (from anywhere) as a freshman.

So, so far I have: 

* Developed an arcade-style mobile game with swift
* Developing a personal website with JS React (not complete but I started and I am 100% finishing)

I am mostly interested in Software Engineering but, like everyone, I am also interested in AI/ML. What languages, skills, and stacks should I familiarize myself with?

To land at big tech this early, what are some of the more impressive and difficult projects I could do within a summer? I have a decent amount of programming experience now (though still very novice I'm sure) and I am very open to a challenge. 

Here are some project ideas I had: 

* Another swift game (but more in-depth): probably medium difficulty for me (already have experience since I already developed the app, but I could go deeper)
* Tic Tac Toe Game and Bot with HTML/CSS/HTML: probably very simple and can be completed in a day (already have experience with these languages)
* Python Pathfinder App: probably decently difficult. Don't know too much about this besides a YT video I saw on a demo of it.

Are these prospective projects impressive enough to land big tech as a freshman? And since I'm pretty sure the answer is no, what are some projects I should take on (that are decently difficult and impressive).

I would appreciate any advice, thanks!"

urfzuy,2,2022-05-17,I genuinely feel so burnt out and I can never relax anymore. I’m sick of life.,Affectionate_Sir9525,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/urfzuy/i_genuinely_feel_so_burnt_out_and_i_can_never/,"Recently, I feel like I’ve entered into a loop of feeling extremely burnt out and just sick of…well, living life. 

I’m a college student who transferred like 4 times and im graduating 2 years late. Not that it’s a bad thing to graduate late, but I am so damn burnt out of school that I genuinely don’t care about my grades anymore. I could fail out and I honestly don’t think I’d care. I spent the last month pretty much stoned 24/7 because I felt too lonely and I had cut myself off from everyone I knew at school because…I don’t know. I didn’t feel like the friendships I made at college was worth maintaining? Maybe I’m just sick of people in general? Whatever it is, I don’t feel even slightly motivated and honestly all I feel is dread when I think that I still have a whole year of stupid college in front of me. 

Then there’s finances. I’m literally, completely broke. I spent all of my aid money from school on weed and other dumb shit because I’m an idiot and I don’t know how to or care to save money. What’s the point? Now I’m back at an awful food service job for the summer and now my summer feels like there’s nothing to look forward to because i got put into 6 days a week because they’re understaffed and think I’m just a pawn who could just fill in the schedule while they take forever to find a new employee. I’ve worked a job for pretty much every semester and every break since I started college and the only time I didn’t was literally this past school year. I’m so sick of having to work these stupid jobs that only serve to drain the happiness out of my life. I’m so burnt out of working jobs that I don’t care about but it seems like it’s all I can do. I try to look into internships and I get overwhelmed by all of these applications that require me to put in way too much effort for a Company that I don’t give a single damn about.

On top of that, I’ve been trying to improve my mental health for the past 5 years of my life. I’ve definitely improved in the time span, but that doesn’t mean that I feel good: it just means that I don’t want to constantly die anymore. But I’m so burnt out and tired of trying to keep my head up and keep going like every damn therapist keeps telling me. I don’t understand how a mere 45 minutes a week is supposed to help when I spend the rest of the week hating myself and my stupid ass life. My self esteem has never really existed and it feels like my own head always tells me to hate myself. Plus, I’ve had a creeping suspicion that I have undiagnosed ADHD, but when I told my therapist about it all he said to me was “will knowing the answer really change anything?” And just dismissed it. I tried looking into how I can get tested but the American healthcare system is absolute trash and it’s impossible to find anything affordable. 

I’m just so burnt out. I’m getting sick of living life."

Does the guy who refers you have to work in the same office that you are applying for? Does he need to work in the same country? For example, if I apply for an internship at Google Singapore, can I get a referral from someone working at Google California.

Secondly, should I ask for referrals after I apply for the position or before? Is there a referral section in the application that I have to fill in? Is there anything required from my side?

Thanks a ton."

3. is the NUS IS curriculum okay for a total beginner like me ? will they teach us programming/ coding from scratch or am i expected to know how to code from day 1 and self learn the basics on my own throughout the 4 years? 

4. If i stay in a hall, having hall commitments and keeping up with studies for NUS IS ( being a total beginner), will it be too hard to cope? 


5. are the internships at NUS IS easily acquired? i am really curious how the nature/ culture of doing and finding internships at nus differ from SMU internship culture ( i heard that ppl do at least one internship per year ).

6. is there still a bellcurve for NUS IS? ( my bad for being so clueless, but i feel safer asking to be sure, because since im a total beginner at computing, im afraid that the bellcurve will end up working against me :/ )

2. i am actually really interested in business too, and if i go to SMU ill be double majoring in business. considering this point, am i better off studying IS? 

3. IF i am better studying IS, is the transfer from CS to IS possible after i accept my cs offer at smu and change mid year to IS? 

4. is double majoring in business with a CS degree abit too hard? am i underestimating the cs workload at smu by thinking that ill have time and energy for biz second major? ( fyi im not those kind of big brain students who can take h3s.. just an average student who is willing to work hard)"

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyone on this sub doing a nice paying remote job? How did you take it?

Please provide a roadmap if possible, many more people will get benefit from it.

Like for FAANG jobs the roadmap is like:

* Learn C++/JAVA/Python (any 1)
* Learn DSA
* Make projects to show on CV
* Grind Leetcode, give mock interviews etc

I didn't believe him because it seemed so far away and unobtainable. 


After barely passing Applied EM (which I should've taken last year), I have finally graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering (Power &amp; Renewable Energy Concentration) Cum Laude from my university's Honors College after 4 long years. I cant describe how happy I am. I haven't had a vacation in 4 years. My first summer, I worked part time 4 hours on campus giving tours, then would drive to a 4 hour physics 1 class. It lasted all summer because I did it again that same summer with physics 2. My second summer, I took 10 credit hours and worked remotely part time doing IT. My most recent summer, I only took 6 hours, but worked full time at an internship in Field Service Engineering.


I secured my full time offer in October of 2021 and will be starting at the end of June as a Substation Engineer at an above average salary for my region. I volunteered to step in to an IEEE officer position this semester doing professional development events and share my skills with other students. I definitely had time to socialize a little bit as well (a couple times a month). I went to some football and basketball games, I went out and drank with friends, and I played a lot of video games. Im so grateful to be graduating in 4 years, as I know people so much more intelligent than myself who are taking an extra year, or don't have a well paying job (or one at all). I know how lucky / blessed I am to have done all this by 22. Shout out to every nontraditional student as well, I saw some older grads bring their kids to graduation which was very cool to see. They were also the best students to befriend in class. 


All this to say, graduates are not paid actors. You will get there one day. I will sincerely miss my time at college, even the sleepless nights and hard times. I bet that's hard to imagine right for you all, but it'll happen faster than you think. I hope to be an active alum and recruit for my company eventually from my alma mater, but it wont be the same as being an undergrad. Im not a paid actor, and neither will you be when you graduate. Good luck to the rest of my future engineers.


If you have any questions or want any advice, I'd be more than happy to answer :)"

The thing is that I have a feeling that I might also use my pc for workstation tasks like video editing and photoshop in the future when necessary, but I don’t need 16 cores like the 5950x because I will be using my pc MOSTLY for gaming and occasionally of productivity tasks.

I’m also concerned about next gen Unreal Engine 5 games that will be exclusive to the PS5 and Series X/S. 

I always thought that in 7 years games might be taking advantage of more than 16 threads found in the 5800x3d as well as the next gen consoles with optimization to the point where PCs need to make that up with more CPU threads found in the 5900x and 5950x.

The effects of such a relationship vary.

Narcissistic relationship damages the victim:

• Anxiety

The victim is left with fear or anxiety about being associated with new people. They face separation anxiety, making them panic when they aren't with their abusers.


• Loss of sense of self and self-worth

Narcissistic abuse is brainwashing, leaving the victim having a sense of self-loss. Constant self-doubt, there is shame and embarrassment because they feel they aren't good enough. A sense of confusion while making decisions.


• Depression

After being gaslighted, you may feel worthless and isolate yourself worsening the depression.


• Physical Symptoms

Headaches, stomachaches or body aches are common. In some cases, insomnia or even nightmares that haunt you for long. 


• Cognitive Problems

Memories of traumatic events are known to interfere with concentration and focus, you may experience short-term memory loss.


• Post-traumatic stress 

The trauma of the relationship triggers a fight or flight response, leading to anxiety attacks when those memories are triggered. You may want to avoid some people or places and be on high alert always.


• Inability to forgive yourself

Many victims tend to believe that they probably deserved the treatment of their abusers and that there's something inherently wrong with them. They suffer from low self-esteem.


• Emotional Liability

They face either sudden mood swings or are left emotionless. They experience depolarisation, feeling that everything around them isn't accurate.


• Stuck in a cycle

Many victims have their abusers contacting them in an attempt to get them back to have them.


• People Pleasing

They tend to become people pleasers to feel they are liked by others for confirmation.


• Self-destructive

They may indulge in Self-destructive behaviour or addictions as a way to numb the emotional pain.

It may be difficult but try to reach for help and therapy. 

Take care!

uronnl,6,2022-05-17,"Is this a ""good"" solution to the Shopify Data Science challenge?",NervousTumbleweed,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uronnl/is_this_a_good_solution_to_the_shopify_data/,"A colleague of mine recently shared with me a ""Data Science Challenge"" Shopify requires applicants for an internship program to complete. 

I'm not a data scientist. I am an analyst with some experience in Python. I would like to one day maybe advance my career towards data science as opposed to just analysis/visualization. 

This being said, I have *no idea* if the solution I have come up with for the challenge is ""good"" enough. Is it ""Data sciency-y"" enough? Is this in the general ballpark of what they might be looking for? 

I have included the text of the challenge below, as well as the python script I wrote as a solution. 


&gt;On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

&gt;Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
What metric would you report for this dataset?
What is its value?


The data was being skewed by two stores: One that regularly had exceptionally high order amounts, and one store with an exceptionally highly priced model of shoe. A possible better metric would be Median Order Value, or you could still use AOV, controlling for the skew caused by the outlier stores. 

The script I wrote calculates a new column ""Cost_Per_Item"" and then converts this new column &amp; the ""order_amount"" column into z-scores. 

I then create new dataframes containing outliers (determined on the condition that Cost_Per_Item or order_amount are at least 3 standard deviations from the mean) and edit the orignal dataframe to exclude these same outliers. 

The script outputs AOV and MOV prior to removing outliers, what the outlier Shop IDs are, and the AOV/MOV after removing outliers. 




    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from scipy import stats


    df = pd.read_csv(""shop_file.csv"")

    df = df.set_index(""order_id"")

    df['Cost_Per_Item'] = df['order_amount']/df['total_items']
    AOV = df['order_amount'].mean()
    MOV = df['order_amount'].median()

    print(AOV)
    print(MOV)


    outlier_orders = df[(np.abs(stats.zscore(df['order_amount'])) &gt; 3)]
    outlier_items = df[(np.abs(stats.zscore(df['Cost_Per_Item'])) &gt; 3)]
    df = df[(np.abs(stats.zscore(df['order_amount'])) &lt; 3)]
    df = df[(np.abs(stats.zscore(df['Cost_Per_Item'])) &lt; 3)]

    AOV_clean = df['order_amount'].mean()
    MOV_clean = df['order_amount'].median()

    print(outlier_orders['shop_id'].unique())
    print(outlier_items['shop_id'].unique())

    print(AOV_clean)
    print(MOV_clean)


Edit: Thank you greatly to all of you have have left feedback! I am extremely appreciative."

Context: So a little bit about me l. I’m a first year student studying software engineering up in Canada(McMaster). We aren’t a T20 uni like Uoft but we are one of the biggest in Canada for research(medical sciences). That probably won’t matter much for apps. 

My gpa currently is a 3.85 and I think I can maintain around a 3.7-3.8 throughout my undergrad. I’m already doing an internship related to cloud computing and AI at a big engineering company. Throughout my undergrad I’m planning on trying to get big internships at faang companies and get about 20 months of experience. The problem is I don’t think I’ll have any research experience when I apply. Due to my financial situation I’m probably going to have to stick to coops.

Would it still be possible for me to apply to top cs masters programs. Any tips/advice would be appreciated :D

P.s I want to work as a machine learning engineer"

I'm a third-year undergraduate Economics student (3.2 GPA), doing a concentration in Economic Data Analytics, and minor in finance at a top 10 uni in Canada (the hardest uni in Canada to get an A). I'm pretty good with math, econometrics, coding, and stats. I score highest in these types of classes because I actually give a shit about them, but in electives I got bad grades (hence the 3.2). If I retake 3 electives and score A-, I would have a 3.3 GPA and could get it up to 3.5 - 3.6 before I graduate. I'm in a pretty prestigious investment club as a Quant Analyst at my uni, along with several other extracurriculars including a varsity sport and completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

I'm pretty well connected, have family and close friends in finance.

I haven't done any internships yet, but have worked part-time at a major bank as a teller to pay for uni. I'm planning on doing an internship in the fall if I can get one. 

I still don't know exactly what kind of analyst role I want to do after I graduate, whether that's becoming a financial analyst, Quant Analyst, risk analyst or data analyst, but I do know that I want to work with numbers, computers and be a problem-solver. Is there a specific job that my qualifications line up with? 

I was looking at quantitative financial analysts job descriptions and noticed that almost all positions require a masters degree in stats, math, comp sci, quant finance, data science, or econ. How difficult would it be for me to get into any of these programs, and which one would you recommend for a person who doesn't know what kind of analyst role he wants at this stage?

Additionally, what's the main difference between a CFA and CQA other than just the technical side of things. Would it be better for someone who has a math background to do a CFA, or someone from a finance background to do a CQA? Or would it be best to specialize? 

Any help, advice or feedback you could give me would be greatly appreciated! :)"

I’m always worrying. About grades, exams, internships (and if it isn’t one thing, it’s another one), social life, everything

I really need to stop doing so.
I’m not living in the present most of the time.

The only time I remember I was truly completely relaxed was on Christmas, my favorite holiday (but it costed me a bad grade) and last summer when I was traveling with my friends.

The thing is, you could tell me to study less, I’m sure that would work. But I really want to do a semester abroad, and in my college I can only do it if I have really good grades.
And that’s the only way I can study in the US: I really tried to take a gap year in high school but in the end I couldn’t live with people I knew and my parents couldn’t pay the whole sum (you can’t imagine how much I tried to find other solutions, I still can’t understand why it didn’t work out)…
And I tried to go to college in the US (I think I had lost a bit of my motivation with this one because of the pandemic, I was a bit depressed so my applications weren’t enough)…

Now I’m always thinking about internships and ECs and stuff (they’re all things I like doing btw) but my mind doesn’t switch off.

I have an exam in 2 days and the only thing I can think about is how I’ll try to convert my internship (from this summer) in credits so that my score is higher and I can get a higher place in the ranking for the semester abroad.

The problem is that if I think about the credits stuff, I don’t study and if I don’t study, I get a bad grade (so I’ll be in the same place in the ranking anyway)

Well

I have an internship this summer at a good tech company and I am confident I can get a return offer. I took the physics classes to graduate with a B.S already but honestly, it's really tempting to just graduate, take the spring to travel, and get the hell out of here.

What are your philosophies on graduating early? If I stay then I get to enjoy college a bit more and get a slightly nicer degree. Do more research, and study more for interviews. If I leave then I save (and make) a lot of time and money."

That comes out to one semester in the spring. I am 20, so I would be graduating a year and a half early (did a lot of college classes in highchool). I have an internship at Google this summer so if I get a return offer the opportunity cost is pretty high to go spend 20k on another semester and also not be making that money. 

I am interested in grad school, and I dont think the B.A would be good enough to get into top grad programs but I am very open to getting a masters as a transition to a PhD if necessary. (I wouldn't do this until after a few years in industry).

I would probably take the spring semester to travel and then start work in the fall as opposed to summer and early fall off start work in the winter.

Am I stupid for even considering taking an extra semester?"

&amp;#x200B;

My son is currently in 8th grade(High school in Fall), very passionate about CS and has been coding since 6th grade with Python and has won a couple of hackathons , built his own website, built a version of wordle for lil kids( so no more words like ""Epoch"" :)) and several other mini projects including training a AI car to avoid speed bumps. He is more interested in backend programming than front end, so not really into App dev, but is now learning unity.

I am looking to see how he can showcase some of his passion projects for his college application. I know this is early, but CS is such a competitive major and he is of Indian descent. He has a great github profile, has answered lots of questions on stackoverflow etc. He is not one of those kids who will do things for the sake of a college application , although he is a straight A student and strong in Math and plays soccer at the pre MLS level. I have find ways for him to turn all his great work into something that can be showcased for college applications.

Any thoughts/ideas/recommendations? He is taking a Python for Economics class in UCLA this summer, I was hoping that we can find other recommendations for good summer programs that will show well on his app. He will also intern in a start-up this summer doing some API work.

I love how passionate he is about programming , but I would like to support him as much as i can to help him land in a great CS school. Thank you all in advance."

I'm looking for some advice and peace of mind, I worked in help desk for over five years, I've always been active and passionate  about the field, finding work, even paid internships before I graduated.  Six years ago my grandma got sick, just when I was applying and getting calls for sysadmin jobs, she raised me so I decided to take a break from the field to care for her until she died in 2020, I financially  relied on my partner who's database developer with a decent salary.  After some well deserved rest and volunteer work to heal the soul I'm  going back into the game, I've already passed the first part of the A+ core exam which I needed, I'm a Linux user, haven't touched a Windows  machine in years, I'm using the A+ aside from building a homelab to get up to date on that front. My plan is to go all the way to Server+ to have a base to stand on then start looking for a work as a sysadmin (I  plan on taking more certs to specialize in mixed environments).  I've read of a lot of people ""working their way into sysadmin from help  desk"" and I've heard of recruiters throwing away resumes if they see a gap in it. I haven't been able to  sleep well, I'm worried that because  of my gap I just wont get an opportunity. And I really hate help desk  work, I don't want to go back to it, it's boring, it doesn't challenge me, I always have to do everything cause my coworkers are mediocre plus the salary is shit (we are planning to buy a house, the prices in my  area are ridiculous almost the same as NYC and the overall cost of  living is even higher). My partner is encouraging me to take nothing less than a system administration position, but I'm afraid that a woman being considered for a sysadmin position after a six year gap, even with  certifications and running a lab from home, is unrealistic. Should I  start from help desk again or should I try and try for sysadmin until  someone gives me the opportunity? One of my partners arguments is that he  knows of people who have learned nothing, nor have improved their skills in years and still they are doing fine, that with all the work  and effort I'm putting I can do better or just as well and I should not settle for less. He also told me he's willing to support me until I find THE job, but I really want to go back and start pulling my weight. Aside from the certifications, I'm taking the AAUW (American  Association of University Women) Work Smart Salary Negotiation Course.  I'm leaving the link here in case someone needs it. I think men can  benefit from this information too. And it's free.

I turned 26 a month ago and I don't think i've been truly happy since, realizing I have not done anything with my life. I graduated university in the summer of 2018, in a degree (business administration) I had no fun doing but I thought that was normal, school can be tough and boring. All I wanted to do was work in the sports industry, it's basically all I think about and do with my time now which is extremely sad. I had a great internship at a governing body for soccer spanning 4 months right out of school, there was no opportunity to get a job afterwards with them but the experience was amazing. The future looked amazing but here I am 4 years later with no job and no life. I then got a job to work at a sports club as their sports administrator in early 2019, it was a long story but I basically only lasted 3 and a half months at this job before needing to leave. I was extremely depressed from having to commute 2 hours each way on transit and the work environment was very toxic with a lot of shit talking behind peoples back. 2019 went by and I used the excuse that I was depressed as a reason to not work, I just sat on my mom's couch watching tv and playing games thinking to myself 'you have so much time who cares'. When covid hit, I used that as an excuse for why I couldn't find a job. ""no one is hiring"" I would tell my mom. It was pretty insane, I actually started to believe my own bullshit even though I was hardly looking for work at all. So basically from March 2019 - May 2021 I did absolutely nothing with my life, it honestly kills me thinking about. in May 2021 I got a summer job coaching and organizing my local soccer club up until September of last year. It felt good to be out of my mom's house more but the moment that time past I got right back into the comfort of not working, and here I am. May 2022 back to where I was in March 2019. 26 years old, barely any experience in any field, still just wasting away.   


My dad passed when I was 10 years old and I never really coped with it. I started smoking weed when I was in grade 9, 14 years old, and have been smoking consistently since. I decided a month ago I needed to actually fix my mental health and stop smoking weed. I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed me zoloft. I was pretty convinced I had ADHD (and still think I do) but he wasn't sure and instead started me on anxiety medication. I am not a happy guy but I try to hide it. I didn't grow up in a household that gave a lot of affection and affirmation, and now I feel like I starve for it. I haven't been in a relationship since 2019, a few flings here and there but I feel like I get attached extremely easily to whoever might give me attention. my self esteem is very low, I talk poorly to myself in my head (practically live in my head 24/7), I a little chunky (6'3, 210 lbs with love handles) and I started aggressively balding within the last few years which has affected me alot more. My uncle, a bald guy, has told me to shave it off and just accept being a bald guy but its hard to do that (aggressive norwood 3, with thinning up top, if anyone knows what that is). The balding has really affected my esteem as well, I wear a hat 24/7 now to try and look appealing to anyone I might see out, but I even wear it in my house in case I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror. I swear just nothing is going right for me in life or mentally. I feel like because of the last few years I have developed more social anxiety, I have no idea how to talk to people at all. I have a few friends still that I golf with here and there but past that I don't see many people past my family, who is obviously not the biggest fans of me.   


Lastly, my family is getting pretty tired of me, fair enough I understand why 100%, but it sucks feeling this awful. I have no goal or path in life, The idea of sitting behind a desk in a cubicle from 9-5 makes me want to just end it now. I used to excel in drama classes and I always wish I had pursued that but my mom always told me not to and I went into my degree cause I didn't know what else to do. I have no idea what I want to do in life so it's hard to actually plan a path out, and with how comfortable i've got not talking to anyone and just sitting on a couch all day  it's becoming hard for me to get out of this as the days go by. My friends have all left the small town I live in, cause of jobs and such, so I really feel extremely low. My mom and uncle are starting to get extremely angry with me and telling me to get a manufacturing job or something that pays well but again it just all sounds so fucking depressing (and I have a herniated disk im going to physio for so it feels like it would just ruin my back). I dont know, this turned into a bit of a ramble and i'm sorry for that. I take everything so personally, I feel like i have the thinnest skin and just spend hours over analyzing the smallest things people say to me. I got offered a job at a dispensary in my town but the pay is $15 an hour, my family doesn't want me to work it since i'm trying to quit weed and the fact it might affect future jobs if they see marijuana on my resume. It also sucks to think about me working a minimum wage jobs while people I went to school with and friends are working these great jobs in the city, living in their own places with their girlfriends and wives, talking about thousands of dollars of investments they have (while I owe thousands on my credit card and have $100 in my checking account) and how they are doing and  just having more shit figured out. I'm tired of disappointing myself and my family. Any advice is welcome"

I have a lot of Angular experience from a previous internship and college so I have been allocated the task of being the solo dev on our companies web application.

The application has scaled rapidly over the last few weeks, and I'm getting concerned about the state of the frontends codebase. I've basically been left to my own devices without any experience in large scale architecture.

What is the best way to approach this without causing it to be a total mess? I've taken a look at design patterns and try to reuse components as much as possible but the application is being made up as we go along by management so its hard to stick to anything concrete. 

It's for use within the company so they are fairly relaxed about it but I have already run into a few headaches from spaghetti code as it is. None of the other devs do frontend either so I can't ask them.

Thanks!"
urwt1i,0,2022-05-17,Professional growth in a tiny company / software team,nullzor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/urwt1i/professional_growth_in_a_tiny_company_software/,"**TL;DR:** If I'm given no support for software engineering professional development at my company other than being allowed to use 10% time however I want and have courses etc paid for, how can I get a decent level of development towards becoming an intermediate compared to being at a better company?

I've been a software engineer for 3 years at a small company in NZ, which is more or less my whole career (excluding internships and semi-relevant postgrad study). In my own estimation, I'm disproportionately strong at DSA, R&amp;D, computer vision, but I'm as bad as an entry-level in most other respects. I've had very limited growth and zero pressure to grow in the vast majority of items you'd see on a software engineer compentency matrix such as [CircleCI's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131XZCEb8LoXqy79WWrhCX4sBnGhCM1nAIz4feFZJsEo/edit) or [Sijin Joseph's](https://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/) due to being the sole programmer for most of that time.

I've told my boss I don't want to fuck up my career by remaining at entry-level skills, especially if his startup-like project which I joined at the very start doesn't end up majorly successful as he predicts. It seems like joining any other company, especially FAANG and FAANG-like companies would guarantee both better pay (at the cost of moving overseas) and professional development. I've voiced this to my boss and he's prepared to discuss how he can keep me by supporting my professional development.

I'm under the impression that if I spent 2 years at a FAANG company, it wouldn't be surprising if I managed to reach most of the mid-levels on those competency matrices. My question is, can I still pick up those skills when I have very limited direct support in my existing environment that has almost no set practices and standards? For example, if I request 10% of paid time being spent on developing any CS-related skills I want, is that enough to target my development deficit, and if so, how might I go about checking off those skill deficits in an efficient and methodical way? Are there courses I can do since I don't have an organic environment for learning those?

(Some extra context about my goals / situation. I've lived pretty comfortably until now and I've loved my job. I've been able to play to my strengths and create proofs of concept without doing most of the rigorous proper software engineering stuff that I don't enjoy and haven't focused myself to pick up. However, I do want to achieve financial independence (not quite as aggressively as FIRE though) and I don't necessarily foresee my programming career lasting more than 5-10 years, especially if I don't end up developing a passion for it over the next few years. In other words, I'm in it for the money and I'm prepared to put in the effort to upskill myself to make that happen. Working for a FAANG or FAANG-like company seems like a good option and I'm seriously considering it, but I place a high premium on job flexibility / WLB so I think my ideal place would be to end up in an intermediate role that allows me to be a digital nomad and travel anywhere. Like I mentioned, I'm particularly strong at DSA due to having done competitive programming so I think I'd have good chances.)"
urx082,72,2022-05-17,White STEM Male gets waitlisted at CWRU then gets rejected from their dream school but still makes out very well,PrimalVortechs,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/urx082/white_stem_male_gets_waitlisted_at_cwru_then_gets/,"**Demographics:** White male, \~100k per year, Pennsylvania

**Hooks:** First gen

**Intended Major:** Undecided STEM, bounced back and forth between Earth Science, Physics, and CS

**SAT:** 780 ERW, 760 Math

**GPA:** 4.0 unweighted. School does not report ranks but I'm 13th in the class out of 250 people, was top 5 until COVID hit and then I just found it very hard to care and I dropped pretty far.

**Courseload:** Basically as rigorous as my school offered, with 6 AP classes senior year. Will finish with 11 AP's total (Freshmen can't take AP's and Sophmores are limited to 2).

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EC's:**

* \-Science Olympiad: All 4 years, held an officer position, competed in mostly Earth Science events where I had multiple top 3 placements in national tournaments including a 1st my junior year.
* \-Sedimentation Research: Did an independent research project over the summer into sedimentology and geologic deposits, which resulted in the creation of a GIS database that is now used in the field and to teach students at the university.
* \-Fossil hunting: Longtime hobby of mine, I use online databases to map out fossil deposits in my area so that the fossils can be excavated and preserved.
* \-Karate: Did karate for 6 years, attaining a black belt. Competed in tournaments with several 1st place finishes and instructed youth classes.
* \-Esports Organization: Founded and directed my school's esports organization, created a partnership with a nearby private school to get my school involved in intercollegiate competition.
* \-Work: Worked as a line cook for several years, averaging 25 hours a week during busy months and trained new hires.
* \-Volunteer: Volunteered frequently at my local community center, averaging about 200 hours per year. Helped with managing fundraising events.
* \-Mentor: Participated in a program my school offers that matches upcoming students with established upperclassmen to get them adjusted to their new school.
* \-Tutor: Worked in my school's tutoring club to help other students in a variety of honors and AP classes.
* \-Computer Club: Worked in a club that refurbishes older computers and donates them to families in need throughout the district.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Awards:** NHS, AP Scholar with Distinction, and then some of my best national placements in Science Olympiad.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**LOR's:** Overall pretty good, my guidance counselor and the one teacher I've known personally for several years and have been in excellent standing with both of them. The third, my school's Earth Science teacher, I wasn't as close with but he's acknowledged me in the past as a standout student.

The peer letter of rec for Dartmouth was apparently very good as well, I chose not to read it out of respect for my writer but my peer is probably one of the strongest essay writers in the grade, and everyone he showed it to said it was phenomenal. I gave it to UPenn as well since they said they accepted peer letters in the ""other"" category and I figured it couldn't hurt.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Essays:** Definitely my strongest point, I consider myself to be an extremely good essay writer and almost everyone I shared them with said they were the best they've ever seen for the school's essays, and they all revealed a lot about me that wasn't seen in the rest of my app.

* Common App Essay: 8/10
* Harvard Essays: 5/10 (the longer more open ended one was really weak for my standards and the other 2 were average, I started them 2 days before the deadline and didn't have enough time to work out good topics).
* Cornell Essay: 8/10
* Dartmouth Essay: 9/10
* UPenn: 9/10

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interviews:**

* Harvard: 5/10 - Was with an older man who majored in a completely different area and graduated in the 70's. He was really interesting but we didn't click at all and he kinda just barraged me with questions, a few of which I couldn't answer. The last 10 minutes of the meeting he was having mic troubles that made me sound like earrape so that definitely didn't help.
* Middlebury: 9/10 - We really clicked well and it turns out we shared a major hobby that wasn't even on my app so we got talking about that for a while which led to the interview running over the allotted time.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Decisions:**

*Acceptances*

* *Penn State Main Campus (RD)*
* *Middlebury College (RD)*
* *Cornell University (RD)*
* *University of Pennsylvania (RD)*
* *Dartmouth College (RD) (Committed)*

*Waitlists*

* *Case Western Reserve University (RD)*

*Rejections*

* *Harvard University (REA, deferred then rejected in RD cycle)*

Overall I can't say that I'm not grateful for how my admissions turned out given how ridiculously competitive this year was. I'm still incredibly upset over not getting Harvard since it's always been my dream school, but with how much went wrong it's almost like it was kinda meant to be. I'll probably be majoring in CS, and committed to Dartmouth for their DPlan so that I'll have a huge edge with internships, not to mention they just finished their new $300 million CS facility and I liked the general vibe of the campus the most out of any school I visited."

So I just joined a company last month as an intern . Its a semi big service provider company but they have their own products and I have been assigned to a few teams so far. I work as a backend developer . Honestly everything is great, as a student I get mostly 3-4 hours of work daily . But then there comes some days when I have to sit till maybe 5 in the morning , with the team and do fixes . It's not exactly something that is expected of you but I am too nice to actually say anything . Though it is at times really exhausting . Like today its 4:18 am and I am still up cause they have a deadline and other people are working. Even though I have college tomorrow too.

The main issue is I was interning at a place for last 6 months and liked the environment except for the last month I had to do over 8-10 hours of work , basically full time , but still get paid pennies while juggling college too. So that made me leave the place for good . So compared to this , it is quite better and mostly I get to chill a bit (some days there's no work at all ). But this whole overnight staying up thing is messing me up . I have another person working with me in the backend but mostly he isn't available and I am just too ""heck Ill do it"" type of a guy . Any advices?

I feel like I should leave but I am not sure if I act on the impulse or not.

Edit: I am under a contract of 3 months of work from them also . Will it be stupid to leave if I really do feel like it? And I got it from cuvette , and there they said if I fail to finish the term I might get banned forever . Any suggestions for this?"

I'm stuck in this useless and sick body, that just keep getting sick again and again, I'm tired.

Tired of being unattractive, tired being sick, tired of being such a weakling...

I want that thing too... move forward and being able to make new connections... but I can't. People will always look for the external first, and I never pass any type of test. I just don't know why I've been born... nothing goes right, my mental health is so degraded that I can't explain here, my body is giving up... I can't even feel my limbs, is just this numbing feeling that hurt whenever I try to sleep.

But then again, I don't even blame anyone for not approach me, in this life we have to learn to choose what is the best for ourselves... and with that weakling body, poor mental health conditions, Anxiety disorders and even PE... and on top of that, I'm losing my scholarship due to not getting a internship in time... now I'm without a job and will not graduate too.

urzuaw,3,2022-05-17,"41yo ICT major, 1yr to go, with a lot of trajectory questions, regarding past experience, internships, certifications, etc.",zeronormalitys,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/urzuaw/41yo_ict_major_1yr_to_go_with_a_lot_of_trajectory/,"I have a year left on my program and I'm starting to nail down which direction (I think) I want to go in.  I have some questions regarding internships, the help desk thing, and possible other stuff, but let me give some background to consider.

So I've stated that I'm 41.  In my previous life I started in the Army as a microwave communications operator/maintainer.  (That experience is hardly relevant, aside from learning troubleshooting(which I love/excel at)).  After 4.5y military, I left service with a lower back disability that's progressively gotten worse since.(also PTSD, and more recently, ADHD)

I did ~15y in low voltage work next.  Starting as an installer (copper, fiber, coax) for all types of customers.  CCTV, security, data, VoIP, POTS, you name it.  Maybe 7 years of that, and I moved to a regional service/repair role for all of these system types, working solo, no office, no boss, self-starter.  In the latter half of that remaining time I spent a couple years as a project estimator, pricing out systems and labor, and designing some smaller ones, eventually moving back to the old service role on account of moving to a new region, but sticking with the employer for a few more years.  A few more years of service work, covid hits, hours dry up, eventually the lack of physical activity finished off my back.  Reentered university to finish getting my degree.

So I have ~20 exp as above.  A year left in school, and I'm trying to decide if I need to try doing an internship, a help desk stint, or if all of that prior networking and troubleshooting experience counts for anything at all moving forward.

I know the experience would help if I were trying to continue on the networking track, but honestly I'm kinda over that end of things.  I'm sure there's stuff I haven't considered.  I did enjoy my Linux admin class.  Does anyone have a strong argument for sticking with the networking track?  Would be appreciated.

I'm leaning towards cyber security, and I understand that it is not really an ""entry level"" thing, but not sure what plan of action would get me there the soonest.  Would love advice here.

I'm also debating my interests in programming, taking a python course this summer, and had a Java class previously.  It's interesting, but I suspect I'm more interested in cyber security.  I have not made the mental decision just yet.  Taking advice here as well.

I'll graduate with zero debt, and owing to my VA disability compensation, very minor financial needs.  Because of this, an internship, or extremely low paying positions would be something I could do (for a year ish?, I could handle longer, rather not), to gain more relevant experience if it will fast track things.  I'd prefer to skip the help desk, because of PTSD I have a bit of a shorter fuse(better every day, but I recognize that it would not be the best fit.)

I would prefer to be primarily/completely remote (eventually, but sooner than later), would like to avoid physically demanding work, as I really just can't anymore.

Internships?  Should I bother given my past experience, would I benefit longer term, quicker entry into Cyber Security field?

Does my past career experience reduce/eliminate the need for the help desk time?

Regarding whatever track you've laid out, what certs would you recommend?

Lastly, thank you in advance for any comments you might leave.  I appreciate your time more than I can express."

Our curriculum is very hardware/C programming focused until junior year, and higher level electives have oop, algorithms, cs, ai/ml options. 




So far I have taken C, Python and data science classes along with iot and android dev experience. I always thought I’d want to be a software engineer because that’s what I guess I like and my experience working with android apps was pretty good. 



But I don’t know if ill like hardware/embedded/low level software related stuff. Ideally that’s what compE is all about and if I want to do the software route I’d have to take software/cs centered electives, do software projects and related internships on my own to aim for a software career. If not then I could enjoy my compE classes without worrying about software electives and my first research/internship is hardware/iot focused so it’d be relevant as well




What should I do? What do hardware/embedded/low level engineers do actually? Why do you prefer this over software dev/higher level stuff? Any advice?"

I’m an incoming undergrad at a T20 school for comp sci. I wanted to start researching possible careers early so I can gear my college experience to lead me there.

I love the idea of being a research scientist. Research has always appealed to me and I love working on hard problems. As a current high school senior, I’ve already published a computational biology paper and plan on publishing another. 

And I mean come on, how could you not look at Gato by Deepmind or DALL-E by OpenAI and not get excited for the future? I want to be amongst those who create these revolutionary models.

However, being a research scientist needs a grad level degree. From looking at careers like Deepmind or Google Brain, a PhD is preferred with plenty of published research. 

The problem is that getting a PhD takes an immense amount of opportunity cost. Not only are you losing at least 4 years of wages (and subsequent gains made from investing that money), you’re also losing the experience gained. All of this, and a research scientist job isn’t even guaranteed and is actually quite hard to get.

Is it worth the opportunity cost to do research throughout college over internships to hopefully secure a prestigious grad school and eventually an RS position? Or is it worth just sucking it up and doing industry stuff from the start even though it might mean being a “code monkey” and not working on improving cutting edge tech? Could I do work similar to an RS (not MLE, that seems like being a code monkey but with extra steps) without a grad degree? 

I know it may be a little early but I don’t want to juggle both possible careers and in the end have mediocre experiences for both."

Hi,

I'm a university student with a good background in statistics and coding looking for a course that is very little theory but mostly practical coding in ML libraries. I've seen many threads and they all recommend things like Andrew's Standford ML course but I'm looking for something alot quicker and something that will allow me to do a full data science project after i'm done. As of right now I've done data science projects that only require me to clean data, web scrape, and create visualizations. I would like to take my projects to the next level by creating predictive models and doing more machine learning related data science that more competitive internships look for. I know the theory is important but this upcoming fall I'm going to be taking a machine learning course at university that covers all the theory but doesn't have you doing practical coding. However, I want to be able to do a ML project before this next recruiting cycle. Right now I got my eyes on Courseras (Umich) Applied Machine Learning in Python. Will this course help me accomplish my goal? How is it? Do you have any other recommendations? Even courses that focus on predictive modeling."

I (21 f) currently attend college three hours away from home. Going to college is a great escape for a multitude of reasons, but most importantly, I get to escape my narcissistic and codependent mother. She is a textbook narcissist and is incapable of admitting she does horrible stuff (she admits that she knows what she does is wrong, but thinks her excuses make up for it). For example: this past Christmas, my mom and dad forced me to sit in their bedroom for three hours and mediate their argument while I was having a panic attack (hysterical crying and hyperventilating and all that jazz). This type of behavior has been going on since childhood. I was the golden child and my mom now treats me as a therapist, all the while subjecting me to screaming rants and abusive verbal assaults. She has even acknowledged in the past that I have so many mental issues because of her. My sister (23 f) has been no contact with my mother for a while considering my sister took the brunt of my moms abuse during our childhood. The other day, my mom began another rant about my dad and soon was screaming into the phone and not listening to a word I said. I finally went off on her and said I didn’t want to hear any more of her issues and that as her child, I’m not responsible for her baggage. She followed this with excuses and saying she always listened to my drama with family, but I pointed out again that I was a teenager and she is a grown adult. She then followed this with threatening to kill herself. I know this is a common manipulation tactic for narcissists to control others, but I was honestly shocked since she has never stooped this low before. I freaked out (I have struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past… which she knows about) and called my dad who didn’t do anything to help the situation. He kept defending my mom as she screamed and insulted him on the other side of the phone. Eventually I just said to not call or text because I needed space.

I am financially dependent on my parents (they pay for college, groceries, and housing) so it isn’t like I can cut them off. I have little savings that are going towards a car, but I don’t know if I can spend another summer with my moms psychotic outbursts. I can’t address her behavior because she will burst into tears, scream over me, and hurl insults and excuses such as “you don’t know how hard parenting three kids was.” Originally my plan was to stick it out another two years and put up with her bs, but I don’t know if I can do it. I don’t have any family to stay with in the area, and I have an internship planned. How the hell do I escape her torment with no money, no car, and no support system?"

I left the US to do my masters in psychology (counseling and social work) in 2019. I hate living in the US and I do not like the culture, yet I had enough privledge to try to become an expat. Now, I am aware nowhere is perfect, and I'm not bashing anyone that likes the US. Its fine if others are ok with being here, but its not a good match for me. I loved Europe and I did great in Uni. I'm pretty studious and was at the top of my class (granted it was a small class at a small international university). I aced finals and got a great grade on my thesis. My thesis supervisor and internship manager both gave me glowing letters of recommendation, and I stated looking for a job a month or so before I graduated from my masters. That was a year ago.

Fast forward a few months and no job, a few interviews but nothing solid. My best friend, on the other hand, got a job within 2 weeks of searching. We both studied together and it was clear I was a much better student... she admitted constantly she wasn't a good student at all and would have flunked out without my help. I'm stull not fluent in the local language, but I was and am better than her, at least intermediate. Still, I had nothing.

After a while, it became clear I wasn't gonna get a job in time to renew my visa, despite the fact I took everyone's advice and treated job searching like a full time job. This is when I started looking in other parts of the country, applying for jobs both in and outside my field of studies, and started getting my resume and interviewing skills assessed. But none of that mattered, and no job in that country meant no permission to stay. I tried everything but nothing came of it. I got an 3rd interview at one point and had to do a half day testing session (4-5 hours) and got a generic rejection a week later. I packed my bags the next week.

I was lucky though; I didn't have to go back to the US, at least not yet. I had a European friend who was very generous and said I could stay with her in a neighboring country as long as I wanted. She was so generous it astounded me, and we got along really well. I got a job seeking visa and was allowed to stay in the EU for another 6 months.

I had a lot of interviews and sent hundreds of applications out. All the interviews felt like they went well. I even got rejection letters that were personally written, and seemed like they sincerely liked me. But not that's enough, or rather I 'm not good enough.

My parents are supportive. I guess I'm lucky like that. They said I would get something sooner or later, and to just hang in there. But as my visa deadline got closer, it became more and more about how I could live at home again and it wouldn't be a problem.

I got a promising interview a month before I legally had to leave Europe. It went better than expected. a week later, the second interview went just as well. the next week was the 3rd, and it was actually fun. they said that they liked my personality and my skills matched what they needed. They wanted to hire me, but could give me an official yes or no in the interview itself, but I would get an answer in 48 hours. That didn't happen. I told them I would be happy to take the job, but as I said in the interview in a week I would legally have to go back to the states (yet I would still be okay taking the job and flying back right away). My first contact at the company, a person from HR who I hadn't spoken to since before the first interview, said they would get back to me before my flight. I had to pack my bags though. it was coming close. I cried so much that week. I had worked so hard to follow a dream that everyone said was possible. They said if anyone could make it abroad, it was me. My parents, professors, and friends all said I would be ok. but I wasn't. 

The company ended messaged me right before I boarded the plane: they had an issue with the hiring process. They couldn't pay me enough to match what HR said I needed for a visa. They said they would explore either paying me more or getting me a freelance position that would lead to a job. They would get back to me soon. 

I got back to the States and moved back in with my parents. I feel like a leach.  I'm 26 years old and have no job and living with mommy and daddy. I have no friends here who I still talk to, and in the last 6 months I've gained weight despite trying to lose it. Meanwhile both my brothers, one older and one younger, are living on their own and doing great. my younger brother even has a house and is married. I have no money to help out my family, and I have a ton of guilt from relying on my parents, so I clean and do every chore I can.

The company gets back to me a bit later. They say I can't work freelance, because HR said no. They said there is a hiring freeze for at least 3 months. If I'm still interested, I can email them then, but they probably will have filled the position by then.

Dad just pats me on the shoulder and says to keep my head up, that things will change. the same thing he's said all year. Mom starts sending me local jobs. I've already started applying here as a backup, but no interviews after a month. The jobs mom starts sending me require less and less as time goes on. Soon, she is sending me work that a high school kid could do, stuff I worked hard at Uni to be able avoid. I apply anyways. Customer service, retail, food, call centers, yet after another month, nothing.

As of today, I have been out of school 1 whole year. I have counted as best I could, and I know the number is off, but I've applied for approximately 722 jobs. of those, I've probably had about 30 or so interviews, about 6 of which I got to a third interview. I failed in Europe. I failed in the US. I failed in my chosen field. I failed in the alternatives. 

Everyone says that it isn't me, that I am enough. To be honest, it's kind of hard to believe that, given the last year. I feel like a waste of flesh to be honest. I also feel cheated because I was told I could do a lot in life. I was always a smart kid in class, and I wasn't a rule breaker or a draconian jerk. I guess I was good at that fake life, school life, but I'm terrible at the real stuff. But I take more pride in the fact I tried to help others and make they see the good in themselves. I tried to resolve conflicts and be emotionally open. 

Honestly, I'm not alive for myself anyone. I've had depression before, and I have thought of killing myself before too. people always jumped down my throat for not wanting to live. They always made me distract myself, which I usually did by applying myself in school. to be honest, university was the best part of life so far, as before that I didn't want to live much either. I'm so done with life, at this point I'm just living because its a bad habit. That, and I've always been pressured by others to live, never because I wanted to. I hate that; it feels like slavery. Feels like I'm supposed to live so that others can be happy, not for myself. Even if my lack of employment isn't my own fault (which I doubt), that means that life is just really really unfair. And who wants to play an unfair game? If I can't have the basics of what I want, I think I would rather quit the game altogether. I think it's time to fold, cash out and quietly see myself out the door."

What should I do?,spoiled_sandi,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/us7951/internship_issue_what_should_i_do/,"Ok, so Im actually trying to finish my first degree in Cinema arts which has taken me a while, and have needed extra classes in order to fulfill the Financial aid requirements which is 12 credits. I was told I could get an Integrated studies degree and because I have a crap of classes I've done for completed minors I could make my own degree essentially. All's I would need to do would be to get an internship and do a capstone. Well, I found myself this gig at my local church that does Live productions and the manager does modules on lighting, design, audio, and video. Well, I thought this would be a perfect internship for me to do over the summer with the rest of my summer courses. I'm taking a fat load of courses which is 17 hours.

Well, I asked the Production manager if I could do an internship with him. He said yes and I would become the first intern at this church. I had to get in contact with my Integrated studies director. The manager is supposed to fill it out and send it back. She emailed him last week on Tuesday and I waited. Classes start next week on Monday and nothing has been really updated. I messaged him Saturday just to get a follow-up and he claims it would be sent on Tuesday which was yesterday. I'm a bit anxious because he doesn't seem to be very organized and I don't want to miss this opportunity. But on top of waiting, I have been getting mixed information from him. I have classes still over the summer and he just figures I will come whenever he feels like it. I have a class at 11:00 am- 2:00 pm on Thursdays and he wants to do lectures at 1:30 pm now he's saying 12 and instead of hands-on training being from 6:30 pm -7:30 pm it's now 5:30 pm- 8:30 pm now? Then shadowing would be sundays was 8:00 am-12:30 pm now it's 8:30 am-12:30 pm.

He hasn't been on time to our previous meetings either and it's kinda frustrating and I don't know what to do. This is a paid internship I start off low and then as I gain the knowledge I will make more money.  Its just hard because he keeps flip-flopping and forgetting stuff and I really really need this internship. I wanna put my foot down and have a set schedule so he cant sit there and change it whenever I also wanna ask him if we could move up the lectures to like 2 pm or even 10 am if he'd like but I don't know if that kinda stuff is allowed. I also feel like I've put him on the spot because he's only had 3 weeks to figure this out and don't want to rush him but if I don't I wont be able to do this internship."

I don't mind M/F roommate, as long as I have a private room. Beyond that, I'm basically looking for
1. Up to 30 min commute to Lexington and 59th
2. Air Conditioning
3. Furnished apt
4. No more than 2400/m, ideally around 2000

The ""/Housing Advice"" part is also just a general ""are these achievable expectations for summer housing"", but that's roughly what I'd hope for. I've seen places like NYU/FIT offering some housing options for students, but have no idea if they're like, super restrictive w/ having guests over or unpleasant, so any advice there would also be helpful because they're definitely affordable.

As a bit about myself, I'm 20M, a junior studying math and CS. I don't have any pets and don't smoke, but don't mind if a roommate does. Hobbies include running, watching movies, video games, and puzzles. I would hopefully be able to invite 1-3 friends over occasionally on weekends, but no big deal if not since I could just hang out at their places instead.

That the salary I currently have is barely ~10% more than the minimum wage (in my country). That we are going to skip the time meant to continue learning (as we were told on the beginning) and go right into work.

I don't know if I ask for too much when I'm just starting, but it does seem unfair.

1. Where he stays, the internet connection is limited and unaffordable for him. This makes it almost impossible for him to connect over a video call where I can teach him. Because of this he can't even watch hour long tutorial sessions. 
2. He helps out his parents with domestic and office work leaving him with barely any time to learn. He says he can only manage to dedicate an hour weekly (yes! 1 hour per week) to do this. 

At this rate with the internet problems and the lack of time quoted it seems unrealistic to learn enough HTML, CSS and JS to land an internship.

Hello everyone!

I am a German law student in my last year of studies and looking for an interesting internship to combine my legal knowledge with my passion for programming and cybersecurity. In the last few years I have gained knowledge in mobile app/web development, electrical engineering/robotics &amp; IT security and worked on my own projects.

The intersection of law and IT fascinates me and I would love to find my path in this field. I'm not sure yet if I want to become a lawyer with a good IT background or an IT specialist with extensive legal knowledge (or maybe both?). Therefore, I am looking for an internship that will give me the opportunity to get a better picture of both fields (ideally in combination).

I talked to a CS professor at my university. He told me that there is an immense need in the cybersecurity field and that gaining legal and technical knowledge is a big plus. He recommended that I contact companies like SAP and Sophos or look for government agencies.I found out that ""post breach management"" and cybersecurity are also offered by consulting firms like BCG, Deloitte, etc.

Now I am having a hard time finding a name for the position I am looking for. The typical internship opportunities are either for ""pure"" law students or computer science students.

Is there an area that covers my interests? Which one would be the best fit for me? I would love to go abroad if possible.

I appreciate any sharing of experience or advice!"

It is not all sunshine and rainbows graduating early. Personally, I was extremely lucky to graduate high school with an associates degree from community college, thats 60 college credits. Then I spend a semester as a business student before transferring to another school for computer science. Because of this its possible for me to go from 0 computer science classes to graduating in 3 semesters. 

But, that means I dont get to take any electives, I only have one summer for an internship, and because my first two semesters were packed filling CS requirements there was no time for electives, research, or interview prep. I really think there is some value in taking time in college to appreciate the intangible ""college experience"". I think you are better off graduating on time but being the top of the class, or interning at the best companies, or doing research than you are rushing a degree. It's like if school is going to take 70% of your effort, rather than using the other 30% to go faster you should use that to be the best student you can be within a regular time frame. 

My entire school career has been spent using my 30% to go faster and I wish I had used it to get a breadth of education, a high gpa, and more experience. And for people looking at a potential 5th year, take it, dont be afraid of any stigma. If you finally found what you want to study then dont rush it in the 4th year. Give it its due diligence.

This is a bit hypocritical, because I actually think that I am going to graduate a semester early with a B.A opposed to a semester later with a B.S. This is because in industry I dont think it matters even a little bit.  And in grad school, I dont think I will have enough time to do substantive research even if I have one more semester. So if either way I will have to go to a master's program to do research to bridge into a phd, I might as well graduate a semester early so that time and money can go to the master's degree."

usgt1o,0,2022-05-18,How should I approach this internship negotiation?,softredrobin,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/usgt1o/how_should_i_approach_this_internship_negotiation/,"Hi everyone! To start, I'm an upperclassman Computer Science major at a university with a co-op program. Co-op is part of my degree requirements. If you don't know what a co-op is, it's basically an internship that I get academic credit for. Some requirements are that the internship needs to be full-time, I have to be paid, and it has to be within a field related to my major.

My co-op search this past semester has been really rough. I've applied to every co-op position I was eligible for and heard back from very few of them, but I finally got through an interview process very recently.

I got offered a really nice co-op for the summer, with a high chance to go back next spring semester also. They're offering me a lot of money, but they also want to hire me as a contractor instead of an employee. Naturally, that would change my tax situation, which is already complicated because I'm still a dependent student. However, as long as I move enough of each paycheck into savings I would be fine come tax season... it would just make things a little complicated to file. 

Because of this, I started looking into the legal difference between the two, especially within the IRS and the DOL. Based on the work they want me to do, I don't think it's actually legal for them to classify me as a contractor instead of an employee. I also wouldn't get the same labor protections as if I was an employee.

I'm worried about how to approach this because I really need this job and I don't want them to like... withdraw their offer or something? We're still in negotiation but I'm not really sure how to go about this.

If anyone has any advice it would be highly appreciated!!"

Moving to a big new city seemed like a fresh start. Going to university also seemed like a fresh start. I managed to make some friends, yes, but still it didn't feel right. Most of the times I don't know how to deal with people. I care too much about what others think of me, about how to please everyone, how to make a good impression. So much that I don't give attention to what I want, and I end up feeling like I don't even know who I am. Even more, most social events leave me so exhausted. I think about the what ifs, about what I could have made differently, about how I am sure that everyone thinks that I am a freak or at least someone who isn't even worth talking to. 

Starting a new job also seemed like a fresh start, another opportunity to meet new people and improve. It's not like they mistreat me, but I feel miserable. I couldn't make any friends or at least people to talk to yet, but the intern who started last week already made more connections than I did. That makes me feel so much behind, like it is my fault for being like this and this is why I can't have a fulfilled social life. Today we had a small lunch break with all the office, and it was just me standing in the middle of everyone, without knowing what to do or where to go, and everyone was talking and having fun. 

Sometimes it is just too much to think about and the feelings are overwhelming."

I would love to have some advice from people who were in a similar situation and managed to deal with it.

So basically I just woke up to reality and realised that I really need to change my life because of the following reasons : 

1) I have always been spoiled by my parents. I have always lived with them. They did and still do everything for me. I never learned how to cook/do the dishes/use a washing machine/do shopping ect. I realise now (at fking 23 years old) that this situation is not normal. 

2) I got a degree and an internship job in the mechanical field currently in my first year of engineering school. I realise when listening to other students that I was never interested in this field and feel like a complete impostor (at school and at work). It feels like my only goal in life was to get good grades at school. After passing the test I would forget 90% of what I just learned. 

3) A large part of my life was wasted by playing video games and watching series mindlessly. I realise because of it that I have some kind of social anxiety and communication issues. My mind goes blank when I talk, I'm hesitating a lot, as if I have something to hide so it feels forced and faked. I only retain half of the information people tell me, I can't seem to focus.

4) I almost didn't talk to other coworkers at my company, I feel so out of place now. There are coworkers I don't even know what they do exactly and It would feel so wrong to ask now after so many months. I tried asking a lot of questions at the beginning but now I don't because it feels like it's about stuff I should know. The impostor symdrome is real here and it's killing me mentally. I scream in my car from time to time, having panic attacks...

5) I lost almost 2k like a fool by gambling. I did a lot of research for advice on what to do/not do and did the exact opposite. I didn't tell my parents.

6) My parents are sad to see me depressed and I'm ashamed of feeling like this after all they did for me.

7) I'm starting to isolate myself, I almost don't talk during the day, even with my parents.

8) I have been feeling suicidal recently, I feel so hopeless and pathetic.

I want and I NEED to change drastically. 

I'm open to ANY help, advice, critics, anything. Where should I start ?"

usi5zt,2,2022-05-18,Is this impostor syndrome or am I just retarded?,RoyBatty234,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/usi5zt/is_this_impostor_syndrome_or_am_i_just_retarded/,"I have been in my first technical job for 7 months now.

My position is as an engineer, although I did not study anything that had to do with engineering at university.

The first weeks of training were quite lax, leaving me very much on my own, and when the first project arrived it was quite a challenge. I had to learn a program to integrate a huge database that was a big mess, and I was pretty much alone in the process. In addition, I also had to create an application (which I had to finish after the project due to lack of time), in other software that I did not particularly handle either. Even though my feeling was that I was doing a very mediocre job, they fixed my contract. We were congratulated for the results obtained and I was given some more responsibility.

I have learned a lot, I am in charge of the technical questions of a master's intern, and so far I have been able to solve the problems that have arisen. I have been made manager of a small project (in charge of a guy who came after me to the company), and in general I receive good reviews. The other day a colleague told me that I work very well (and we had a few beers on us, so I guess he really though that).

Anyone would be happy with this, however, I somehow manage to be my own worst lawyer. If they make me permanent and if they give me more responsibility, it's because they don't have anyone else in the company. If they congratulate me it is because their policy is reward and not punishment. I still feel that I am going slowly and that there are many things that I do not understand.

I imagine that reality is halfway between these two versions, but the truth is that I cannot know. My argument is that at the end of the day, a company is not an NGO, and if you don't work, you get fired and that's it, but I would really like to develop real confidence in my abilities."

Edit/update: The general consensus seems to be that I’m undervaluing myself. Thank you all for the reassurance and perspectives!!

I am a US computer science senior with a 3.77 GPA, one internship experience and 4 retail/food/IT experiences. My goal for graduation would be to have an entry level position making somewhere between 42k-55k as a yearly salary.

I am overwhelmed by the amount of students at my college who talk about how hard it is to get a job in computer science, and that I'm not trying hard enough or aiming high enough. But my hunch is these students are asking for too much, too quickly, are not truly qualified for the positions they want. I am not asking for 60k+ immediately after graduation like a lot of my peers and I do not think most recent compSci graduates are truly qualified for that either. I was once told by a senior when I was a sophomore to ""never take any jobs that pay less than 60k.""

The sense I get is, there is this swarm of students who saw the six figure salary that many software engineering jobs pay and they are busting their ass off to get it or near to it, often unhealthily, and impatiently. They are faking it until they make it and they feel like plastic people when you talk to them.

My philosophy is, I won't know what I even want to do with my career/degree until after I get my first entry level position. I'd like to start somewhere small, with learning and growth opportunities. Maybe by the time I have 2-4 years of experience I'll expect to make more than 60k.

My question is, is it really that hard to find an entry level computer science job that pays somewhere between 42k-55k with my experience? And, is that really a lot to ask?"
usiotj,3,2022-05-18,Non-CS Background wanting to Apply for Spring 2023. Pre-req courses Still in progress through Fall 2022. Should I apply?,MouaTV,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/usiotj/noncs_background_wanting_to_apply_for_spring_2023/,"I have a BS in Physics with a 3.09 GPA from a CSU. I aced my Intro to Programming in C++ class in undergrad, but that is about the whole of my formal CS experience. I have two Python scripts on my github from work and a physics internship, but they are quite basic and unimpressive. Since finishing my undergrad in 2020, I have been working in industrial maintenance.

I want to apply for Spring 2023, but I am barely starting my pre-req CS courses at Foothill this spring. I am taking Intro to OOP in C++ right now. I will take Intermediate software design in C++ this Summer and then DS&amp;A in fall. From reading the application requirements page for OMSCS, my take away is that they will only consider ""post-bacc CS-related FINAL GRADED"" supporting materials. Given the August 10th deadline for spring 2023 matriculation, I doubt that I will get even just my final grade for my summer course in time. The summer course has an end date of 08/05. Given this info, should I still just apply for Spring 2023? And if they were to reject me due to my incomplete coursework at the time of application, would putting in an application for Fall 2023 be easier afterwards? Could I reuse my letters of rec and such? I just really want to start the program ASAP and don't want to delay it for pretty much another year, but I am quite nervous about possibly getting rejected and then having to tell my recommenders that I was rejected. If I get rejected though, I suppose it wouldn't be a terrible thing to take CS10 at Foothill next spring."
usjg6d,13,2022-05-18,Does it make sense for me to start as a Data Analyst,thegarlicknight,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/usjg6d/does_it_make_sense_for_me_to_start_as_a_data/,"Hi all,

I am currently working as a project engineer for aerospace and am interested in moving into data engineering. I have been taking courses for the past 6 months and have been working a side job  as an intern in data analysis/engineering for the past 2 months.

At my project engineering job I've written a lot of vba macros for the past 3 years.  It's what got me interested in programming in the first place. I'm very comfortable in vba/excel.

At my internship, I'm working on querying a database and writing python scripts to extract and  transform the data. It's going well and I feel like I have a decent grasp of sql and python. 

When I read mid level data analysis job descriptions, I feel quite confident that I can do what the job requires (although I would need to brush up on statistics). However, I feel less confident in my understanding of junior data engineering roles.

Would it make sense to start my career as a Data analyst? My concern is that I wouldn't actually get a lot of useful experience out of it as my current job already requires a fair amount of data analysis work. 

I guess my real question is, does it make sense to begin a data engineering career as a Data analyst? Is it easy to take on more data engineering work?"

About me - I'm a Software Dev with 2 yoe (+ extra 1 yoe doing internships) currently in Munich, Germany. I moved from a non EU country to my current company less than a year ago (9 months so far). 

Current TC €64k 

I receive so many messages from recruiters who want to interview me for senior or mid-level roles offering roles with budget of range €80-95k and if I time my interviews correctly, I could go to the top of this range. 

From what I heard, raises or promotions at my current company is pretty much not imaginable as my manager is shit and I got to know that I earn more than my senior colleagues who've been here for years. 

My earlier plan was to grind LC for 3-4 months and start applying to the Tier 1 companies (refer - trimodal nature of SE jobs blog) and in case I succeed, my TC would be 1.7-2x. 

But now, as these companies approach me on LinkedIn, seems I could get a decent comp even without grinding LC hardcore. Should I try interviewing to such companies? as such huge money would actually make significant impact. Should I wait for a few more months?

Some history about me - my past roles outside in the non EU country was also around 8 months each (two changes).

TL;DR - Non EU Dev in Germany for past 1 year, start interviewing now to increase TC or wait and apply to Tier 1 companies or stay here for longer?"

My goal is to become a software dev, but I was looking at my 4-year-plan and I realized that if I continue to do Computer Science it'll take me 3 more years to graduate, but if I continue with just my math major, I can graduate in 3 more semesters. Is it worth it to just do the math major and then do a MS in CS, or should I continue to do CS in undergrad?

Three main concerns I have with dropping my CS major are as follows:

1. A CS degree seems a lot marketable than just a Math degree, and I don't want to not be able to get past resume screenings because I don't have CS
2. UMD is primarily well-known for CS and Engineering, so I'm worried that a Math degree from here won't carry the same ""clout"" as my current CS/Math degree.
3. It'll be harder to find undergrad internships because I don't have access to the big internship fair at our school that only CS majors can attend, and I'll be in school for less time.

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"

uskh5d,5,2022-05-18,Transfer Decision,redmouse26,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/uskh5d/transfer_decision/,"Hello,

I am currently a sophomore student aspiring to be a software engineering or any career related to that field. But I have been currently stuck in deciding for my next steps. 

I recently got accepted at UW Seattle for its ACMS (DMA) major as a transfer student from a community college. I applied for CS Allen School as my first major choice but apparently I got rejected from the CS department I aimed for. Apparently, I also got accepted to the CSSE major at UW Bothell.

In terms of career prospect, what should I decide between the ACMS (DMA) major at UW Seattle and CSSE major at UW Bothell? I initially thought that the DMA program would be closely related to CS but I am worried that I would not be either enjoying the major itself or I will find difficulties in finding jobs with this degree. I have many connections of CS graduates who currently works at big tech companies and I could only find a single person who actually graduated with the ACMS (DMA) major but he's currently working as Quality Engineer (I have done a little research about it but I'm still not sure what it is all about). 

A few things about myself, I am personally not a math person even though I don't often struggle with the concepts. I really enjoy coding/programming in general, I like building stuffs with programming but I also appreciate optimizations of algorithm to speed things up (e.g. data structures) which I believe are the things we learn from CS major. I have even built some fun side programming projects such as websites and Discord bot myself. And as I said, I applied to ACMS as my 2nd choice since I believe it is close to CS and I felt like I would have no problem dealing with the math. I have taken Linear algebra and Ordinary Differential Equations with no issue and I got perfect 4.0 GPA for both. I feel like UW Bothell's CSSE has good reputations but I find some friends of mine struggle a lot in getting internships and jobs. It must definitely be a struggle to get jobs from either school but I have always believed that UW Seattle has greater opportunities in that regard. Also may be unrelated with everything, I am not sure if this would also be a factor but I am actually an international student (from Indonesia) and so are most of my friends (or connections) who I referred to.

Would anyone mind giving some insights to this problem I have? I would really appreciate any thoughts on this. Thank you in advance."

Something like, not doing `file.close()` in python or not using a context manager.

I just found that list again, and I would like to report all of these to the lead.

How do I ensure this comes off as a productive contribution and not nitpicking?

I found multiple typos and broken links and some ""best practice"" violations. How do I give this list to the lead so that it comes off as a ""hardworking"" intern and in a positive manner?

If possible, I'd like to the one to fix these via a PR as well."

I am curious for advice on how to negotiate work in academia.

I am a recent college graduate (USA; STEM field) and want to work with a professor who told me that they are interested in me but will run out of funding in a few weeks. I am fortunate to have alternative means of money available and would love to get research experience in my field during my current gap year. Besides this, I have limited opportunities to get my foot in the door and am willing to work without pay/ as an intern. Since I don't know how the professor will react to this request, I was wondering if it would be out of place to negotiate by suggesting that I offer my work in exchange for a future letter of recommendation and/or some form of authorship on whatever paper is produced from this work. I am planning to apply to Ph.D. programs in the fall, so either of those opportunities would go a long way.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not too familiar with the types of negotiations made in academia, so I am hoping to get some insight on whether this is a reasonable course of action. Any input would be so greatly appreciated as I am kind of floundering at the moment. Thanks!"

Same as my leadership program, but with a different group.

African-American Youth Group (Grades 9-12)

I do business case competitions and community service projects.

Comic Writing (Kindergarten to Present)

This is my favorite past time. I have become a much better artist and writer, and my grades in English have improved from my practice. My professor considers me one of her strongest writers because of my work. 

Theatre (Grade 11-12)

Debate Team (Grade 12)

District Internship (Grade 12, Semester 2)

I got my internship after applying (25% acceptance rate). I'm hoping to be placed into a chem lab my second semester of 12th grade.

**Evals/LOR: (projected)**

Geometry and Algebra II Teacher: 8.5/10

I struggled a lot with math, as evidenced by my grades, but she helped me get through it.

English Professor: 8/10

My professor does seem to like me a lot and does have faith in my ability to get accepted, so I do expect a strong LOR.

Art History Professor: 8/10

I didn't particularly like the subject matter, but I am glad I met my professor. He is encouraging me to apply to Harvard, which I don't think will result in an acceptance, but I promised him I would.

AVID Teacher (AVID I-IV): 9/10

My AVID teacher knows me better than my other teachers since I'll have her all 4 years as opposed to 1 or 2. She's seen my ups and downs and has gotten me through a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Chemistry Teacher: 8/10

She was extremely happy when I told her that I'd be majoring in Chemistry after taking her class.

Counselor: 4-6/10

I don't really talk to my counselor. She's new and scheduling has been kind of rough.

District Admin Mentor: 8/10

My district administration mentor liked me enough to let me stay in a program intended for seniors as a junior. I think that says a lot. Also, he's said good things about me to my mom.

Youth Group Mentor: 9/10

I've known my youth group mentor since 14, when I first met him for an interview. I was a lot less mature at that age, and he's watched me slowly (but surely) become a better person, and I got a scholarship for my efforts to improve (500$).

&amp;#x200B;

Additional Notes:  


UT Austin, T A&amp;M, LSU and University of Louisiana Lafayette are my safeties. I am applying test optional so I do not know how high to reach, but I figure that If I have auto admission to two places then I can make the rest reaches."
usnjzx,1,2022-05-18,Should I take into consideration company reviews when applying for an internship?,I-Addie,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/usnjzx/should_i_take_into_consideration_company_reviews/,"Next year will be the last year of my masters degree and it requires a 6-month internship at the end.

I found some interesting internship offers online, however, when I look the companies up on Glassdoor, a lot of them have pretty bad reviews (bad pay, no upwards mobility, shitty management, too much work...)

So naturally I don't want to apppy there, but I'm getting scared because there aren't a lot of internships in my field (computer science but I want to do something very specific, in a specific city).

Do you guys think I should still apply to these internships even though the companies don't seem that great? After all, I would only be staying there for a few months and having more experience would be nice. Or should I risk not finding anything right away in order to be in a team where I'll enjoy working?

I have to mention that I have never heard of these companies before and my opinion is solely based on a few Glassdoor reviews. Maybe the culture's changed since those reviews were left, who knows?"

The only big company interview I was able to get was for Twitch. Some info about me, I’m a rising junior at a T10 studying math and CS. So far, I’ve had a SWE internship at a startup my freshman year and I’ve done two research projects under professors in deep learning (last summer and sophomore spring). My resume has been reviewed by my schools career service as well. One of the reasons why I think my resumes didn’t go through was the fact that I started applying in November but idk. 

Does anyone have advice on how I can better position myself for at least getting interviews for 2023? And are the experiences I have enough?

Here is my resume: https://imgur.com/a/lfev6yh"

So can this sub help me to prepare. Like anything would help. Basic questions, Some material, Just an advice would be appreciated."

Having spent barely 2 yrs in in-person high school, I still feel like a middle schooler lol.

Anyways, what top colleges do you think I have a decent chance at? I'm aiming for a cs major :( Pls be brutally honest :)) (setting my expectations low)

**Extracurriculars:**

1. Director of CS middle school tutoring org (kids come from low socio-economic bkgds)
2. Captain of debate team
3. Computational Research (breast cancer)
4. Founder of nonprofit related with STEM &amp; underrepresented groups (no, not just another women in stem org)
5. BWSI (summer of '22)
6. Hackathon Organizing
7. History museum Internship, created digital exhibits (focus on highlighting women in history)
8. Student Physics journal Chief Editor (i'm actually so bad at physics, idk how I got here??)
9. Internship at small city org, data analysis w/ focus on inclusion &amp; diversity
10. Girls Who Codes SIP

**Rewards:** (Basically none :( )

1. local debate awards
2. prob ap scholar
3. nhs LMAO
4. prob commended national merit semifinalists (whatever they're called, and oop barely studied for my psat)

**Course load:** 6 APs, (5 APs this year, not feeling too hot about the physics AP I took), 4 APs senior year

**GPA:** 4.0 (thanks to pandemic grade inflation)

**ACT/SAT:** Act 33 (gonna retake this summer)

**Teacher Recs:** prob both mediocre, not very close to either teachers and don't participate alot in either classes, but I do well in them and raise my hand every now and then. (this is prob the weakest part of my application)

Sorry if some of this stuff is vague, don't wanna dox myself. BTW I go to a big feeder public school if that makes any difference.

Also, **(first-gen) asian female** since ik demographics matter alot in cs"

uspz5y,1,2022-05-18,Is Eastern Texas currently a viable job market for a graduate with CS BS,pyral12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uspz5y/is_eastern_texas_currently_a_viable_job_market/,"Hi, I graduated a week ago and I've been applying to jobs for about 2 months now but I'm starting to get concerned, as I've only been turned down so far (no interviews). 

So far from what I've gathered (purely based off what I've been told by my friends) I've been having issues because:

\- programming job market isn't growing atm  
\- I live in Texas (DFW) (Some people have told me that atm if you're not on west coast it's pointless)   
\- I wasn't ever able to get an internship done

I've also mostly been applying for remote because DFW is a really large area (I'm in Denton specifically) because I can't drive for the time being, so most in person positions aren't going to be very feasible. Due to that and some other personal circumstances, I also can't really relocate at the moment. I've also been told that employers utilizing data brokers may know I'm trans and look on me unfavorably. 

I'm also not really sure how much an internship would help, I have a friend who graduated from the same uni as me with the exact same degree a year earlier and with an internship and she looked around for longer than me but still had only a couple interviews and no offers after several hundred applications in the same area so I'm feeling pretty hopeless, I don't think I really would but it really makes me want to fucking off myself, as the alternative at the moment to getting a job is moving back in with my emotionally abusive parents.

Any recommendations? Here's my resume if it helps, sensitive details removed.

usq0nq,1,2022-05-18,"Got dream job, scared of losing it",invadercei,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/usq0nq/got_dream_job_scared_of_losing_it/,"I have pretty severe ADHD but passed up on the diagnosis as a teen because I thought it would make me different (boy do I regret it). I’m extremely creative and it seems like i can accomplish a lot on my own time/schedule, but keeping any sort of a routine, having tasks that i HAVE to do, and staying organized has always been a nightmare for me. I’m 24 and I’ve had over 20 jobs, fired from a lot of them, stay at nearly all of them for no less than 3 months.

I have a lot of different creative hobbies but I got super into graphic design and other computer graphic type stuff almost 10 years ago and I dreamed of working for a certain company in the music industry (don’t wanna name it, very well known) and I had been back and forth thinking I could do it one day and other phases where I considered giving up. I’m couldn’t be more excited to say I got an internship there recently and working here has been amazing, everything I wanted and more with the possibility of working full time after the internship potentially! I’ve wanted this job for over 8 years so I feel great about that… mostly.

I had a decent amount of freelance work in the past, not enough to live off of but it was always fun for me so I figured things would be going smoother here but I feel like I am already starting to notice things that are terrifying to me. You can work from the office or home, and I do half and half but it’s definitely way too easy for me to get distracted at home, and even at the office if other people aren’t there. This isn’t like shift work where your output doesn’t matter a ton, we have deadlines, and by deadlines I mean HARD deadline, this is the music industry and missing a deadline derails the whole company, multiple people’s jobs, the musicians trying to release their music etc., honestly I think missing a single deadline would be grounds for me to not get the full time job.

The other issue is the company has an extremely in-depth and well organized system in place for literally everything within the company. It’s honestly great and super helpful, but knowing myself that’s what scares me, I have a ton of things to keep track of; deadlines, work events, my team members, other teams, nearly constant meetings, incredibly organized file management, a ton of essentially extremely specific rulebooks for certain tasks, and I’m already starting to feel like I’m slowly falling behind, I can’t even keep my emails maintained.
I love the actual work, it’s creatively challenging which I like, but it also means once i’m mentally exhausted my brain just shuts off and it’s hard to power through.

I have no clue what to do, this is everything I wanted and I’m scared I might f*** it up, I have adderal but I forget to take it a lot, sometimes it works well other times it wires me up too much, and if i take adderal (or almost any stimulant) consistently I start to feel suffocated and I just miss how my brain feels without it. If anyone does similar work and has systems in place or tips I’d love to hear it, I honestly don’t have any kind of backup if this doesn’t work out.

tl;dr

got an internship at my dream job, want to prove myself and get hired after but the company is super organized and well structured which i struggle with and im scared to lose the job."

I have no strength for work, study and etc.

Until last month I was working 8 hours a day (sometimes nights) and in college full time, when I had days off in the weekend I would go spend it with my girlfriend.

I was sometimes overworked and stressed but generally happy.

Then my girlfriend got an internship on the other side of the world for 5 months, before she left I lost my job (due to the company I worked for losing the contract, so everyone there got fired) and some days after my car broke down.

I live with my grandparents, they are nice and I love them but they are old and hard to connect with or have a conversation.

My relationship with my mom isn't great.

I don't do friends easily and a year ago I decided to cut a toxic friend from my life causing me to lose contact with the whole group.

I have exam season and a bunch of college papers to do and I'm not motivated to do anything, I barely study (one or two hours). 

I don't take good care of myself, and I'm not trying hard to get a job.

I want to do everything and I really need to, I just... don't have the strength anymore.

Even my mom called me asking if I was ok, and that I seemed off. I lied and said I was fine.

I don't know what to do, I just keep pushing one day at a time smiling and saying I'm fine. I do the bare minimum to get passing grades and send some CVs a day.

I don't have anyone to talk to, the few friends I have don't understand, and my girlfriend who I usually talk about my feelings would blame herself because she left for internship.
She's already have a hard time there and I don't want to make it worse."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor- 0/10: They were terrible at communicating, did not get to meet with them at all throughout the process. I was just hoping for the best tbh

AICE English Lang- 8/10: teacher during my sophomore year; she understands me so well and we were extremely close. She kept her letter secret from me, but I just know it was good. 

AICE Math- 7/10: Did well in her class, was interactive, and she really liked me. She kind of just summarized my resume and added a personal touch. It was nice, but imo average. 

Debate Coach- 8/10: I was very invovled in this activity throughout my 4 years, and I built a very strong relationship with my coach. Loved his letter. 

AP Calc AB- 8/10 I added his letter for my waitlist to Cornell and UChicago. It was brief but pretty solid. Don't know if it made much of a difference tbh but he got it for me very quickly, so I am appreciative. 

**Interviews**

Georgetown- 8/10: I thought it went well, I asked her a lot of questions as well. I kept in contact with her after my deferral and she was very willing to help. She told me she would advocate for me. We didn't really talk about anything other than Georgetown.

**Essays**

Main Common App: I wrote about the meaning of the word home and how the constant moving throughout my life impacted me. I think it was a risk because I feel like it's a common topic but I feel like I effectively presented myself. I worked on it from July to around October./November. 

Supps: Talked about my Hispanic culture/heritage, debate, and my interest in political science for most of them. I suck at creative writing, and I struggled a lot to come up with new ideas. I got very frustrated at some points and would procrastinate. Spent over a month on Georgetown's supps, and the rest varied from one day to a couple of weeks.  

Cornell Supp: No joke, this is the one that I wrote the day before it was due. Very personal, talked about how I did a project about my dream school in 7th grade and how I randomly picked Cornell for the project. Thought it was probably my weakest one, but I think the higher word count helped me out. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Univ of Florida RD, Honors and Research Program
* Florida State Uni RD, Honors
* Univ of Miami EA, presidential scholarship 
* Univ of Richmond EA, presidential scholarship
* George Washington Univ RD, Cisnero's Scholar
* Dickinson College RD, provost scholarship 

*Waitlists:*

* American University RD, didn't accept spot on waitlist
* UChicago RD, then rejected
* **Cornell RD, THEN ACCEPTED OFF WAITLIST**

*Rejections:*

* Georgetown (dream school, deferred EA then rejected)
* Yale RD
* Harvard RD
* Brown RD
* Columbia RD
* Tufts RD

**Additional Information:**

**I committed to UF on May 1st and got an email from Cornell about getting off the waitlist on May 3rd. Such a crazy, random process. I felt bad about myself for a long time, especially during April. I had a hard time committing to a school because I just didn't feel happy with my results. But now I am really proud to say GO BIG RED!!!!! I learned a lot, just remember to stay true to yourself and that you are worth more than a random school. If you don't get accepted, it just wasn't a right fit. As cliche as it sounds, everything happens for a reason. Also, I may be forgetting some stuff lol**"

ussuma,3,2022-05-18,Transitioning from Biotech/Pharma to Tech,ValiantHero,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ussuma/transitioning_from_biotechpharma_to_tech/,"As the title implies, I’m tryna transition from biotech (bioinformatics/computational biology) to tech. I recently graduated from a T15 uni with a degree in biochemistry and a minor in scientific computing, and I primarily conducted research in computational biology, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, deep systems biology, etc. I got a job right out of college to work as a scientific associate doing computational drug discovery work. This involves running lots of molecular dynamics and monte carlo metropolis simulations (using both linux based tools as well as OpenMM). I also have done extensive machine learning work in my research for natural product synthesis. However, my interest in biology and chemistry has waned, and I honestly just like coding, creating new tools, and data science. I’m kinda jaded from research, the salary for the amount of work I’m doing and for the location I’m in is pretty mediocre, and I don’t have any interest in pursuing a PhD for several years just to come back into pharma/biotech for the sake of more money. Maybe it’s shallow reasoning, but I’m just being honest. At the very least I’d rather be a code monkey with better pay than rack my brain after work hours on some science project that might get canceled anyways (yay pharma!).

Because I’ve worked towards a skillset in science and bioinformatics research, my experiences and areas of expertise are obviously different. I’ll list out some info:

• I have primarily worked with linux based tools, so I know a lot about linux, bash scripting, shell scripting, etc. I have also worked extensively with python in my research for machine learning projects as well general data science work. I have also dabbled with R for things like RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis. I did an intro programming course in java, but have never touched the language outside of that context.

• Have done lots of machine learning, have used scikit learn, keras, and tensorflow in my research work.

• My CS coursework is really limited. I’ve only taken intro programming in java, and data structures for scientific computing in python. I also took some graduate level courses in genome science, computational structural biochemistry, and biomedical data privacy, all of which required the use of linux command line/tools, python, and R.

• I don’t have a resume technically. Because I have primarily been focused on research I have a CV, which details all the research work I have done over multiple pages, as well as the internships I have done at pharma and biotech companies.

• I have lots of code that I have saved on my PC and in my research lab, but I don’t have a personal github account. I also just don’t really know how the interview processes work for tech positions in data science or software engineering (for my job they just asked me if I have used python before, but the interview was primarily concerned with my previous research experience, a presentation on my work, and more in-depth discussions of biological concepts and molecular simulation)

As you can see, I’m kind of a mess, but I wanna get my act together and figure out how I could successfully transition to tech. I would probably prefer to apply for positions in data science, but I’m open to software engineering as well. Anything in particular I should really work towards or improve on? How should I prepare for interviews? How should I craft a resume, or can I just use my CV? Are there any languages I should try and learn, or can I just scrape by with python and learn new languages on the job? Any input is appreciated."

I'm a 15 year old girl who's doing highschool while doing a hairdressing formation right now. Since its the last month of school, I'm doing a internship at a real hair salon for 3 weeks and this is my second week.

There is a hairdresser, Travis (50M), working there. First, I want to say that it was mentioned multiple time that I am still in school and I'm 15 years old. Travis is the type of guy who's very friendly and touchy with other people even though I've met him a week ago. 

My first week, all was normal, nothing crazy. But today, out of nowhere, he straight up said to me ""You're so beautiful"". Now that was kinda weird but I shrugged it off. Later that day, he just put his arm around my shoulder like we were old pals and wanted me to come outside with him while he took his smoke break (I do not smoke at all and I was working on something). Conversation was nothing weird but I'm pretty sure he called me beautiful a second time.

I've never really engaged with him before and I'm not an outgoing person so it felt weird that all of a sudden he was all close and ""flirty"" with me.

I might be overreacting but I just feel really weird and freaked out by this. He always felt off to me and now how he acted today isn't really helping that bad gut feeling. He might not mean it in any malicious way, I do know that but I can't help but feel really uncomfortable by what happened today. I told 3 of my friends about it and they all said that he was being creepy and to be careful.

I don't know what to do. On one side, I know I may be overreacting and I don't wanna cause any problems. On the other side, I'm kinda anxious to go back tomorrow as I feel uncomfortable with him.

Any advice?"

\- Accepted: Northwestern, UPenn

**Essays:**

For UPenn:

\--&gt;Please explain your reasons for transferring from your current institution and what you hope to gain by transferring into another institution **(Probably the reason I got in)**: Intro paragraph respectfully acknowledging my current university as a platform for academic and personal growth while outlining the flaws it has. Briefly touched on some highlight EC's that emory empowered me to accomplish. Next paragraph transitioned to why i'm interested in neuroscience &amp; film/media, combining them into neuroaesthetics and defining the field enthusiastically, conveying my passion and drive. Next paragraph succinctly points out how my current institution doesn't support my academic goals. Next paragraph is entirely focused on UPenn's neuroaesthetics program, and how it is the only university with an established [center for neuroaesthetics](https://neuroaesthetics.med.upenn.edu/) in the country. Talked about Dr. Chatterjee and the research specifically, and my previous work on psychoaesthetics and neuroscience research. Concluding paragraph wrapping it all together.

\--&gt;How will you explore your academic....? I made a schedule in my essay clearly outlining the specific classes, research programs, and centers that I wanted to work with. A powerful line i had was ""courses are just courses \[,but\] experiences outside the classroom are most meaningful. Went on to talk about the Netter Center ABCS courses, 60-second lectures on college green describing climate change to the invisible 4-D universe, the science and lightbulb cafe, CURF.

\--&gt; At Penn, learning and growth....? Talked about my very mixed ethnic background and never fitting in, but I created a sense of community with the club for my hobby that i co-founded, bringing together people of different backgrounds. Wrote about how I seek to do the same at UPenn's Greenfield Intercultural Center, Programs for Cross Cultural Awareness, and multicultural clubs

For NU:

Personal statement Prompt 1: I started off the essay with a \*censored\* curse word haha. Went on to talk about my passion for photography and making college vlogs. Embedded some of my photographs in the PDF i submitted. Elaborated on my visual content internship. Talked about NU's Panoramic Photography club, Multicultural Filmmaker's Collective, making college vlogs at NU,

""Why NU?"" --&gt; Talked about NU's opportunities for neuroaesthetics as well and in the same depth as UPenn's essay. Also mentioned URAP, SURG, AYURG.

**My Advice for Essays:** I did praise my current institution, but I respectfully highlighted its flaws and how another institution provides a mechanism to solve it. I was VERY SPECIFIC in my essays, even listing PI's and names of professors, outlining course schedules using their course atlas, etc. As a traditional transfer applicant, we don't have the luxury of outlining a life story or something to show our character in our personal statement–– this isn't like regular applications. You have to clearly rationalize why you \*need\* to transfer. However, use the supplementals to highlight your passions, characteristics, and non-academic sides to your story.

**My advice on the transfer process in general:** Speaking anecdotally and for traditional junior lateral transfer. START EARLY (LORs, college report, transcript, essay writing) Immerse yourself as a student at your target institution so you can specifically outline their resources for your desired academic intentions for transferring. DO WELL IN COLLEGE! As a junior transfer, college GPA (I assume) matters a lot more than HS GPA... I had an upward trend from HS freshman to senior year, and continued it into college. I am sure this played a major role in this cycle.

Edit 2: Brevity/Removing superfluous info

usu863,873,2022-05-18,"2019 my wife with a master's degree in education was making 59k a year teaching elementary kids. Now in 2022, she's making 149k doing project management for IT. Gotta love IT!",grannygonewild69,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/usu863/2019_my_wife_with_a_masters_degree_in_education/,"I'm not complaining, but man, how we IT folk ended up making crazy money doing this stuff is beyond me.  

For my wife teaching is her passion, she loves sitting in a classroom full of loud kids and packing their little brains full of knowledge (I could barely tolerate my own at that age).  She knew she wanted to teach in high school and went right into elementary education in college spending many late nights studying followed by internships.  After finally getting into it decides to go back for her Master's degree when we turned 30.

Me on the other hand, was the dumbass in high school that had to serve out of school suspensions for missing too many days, never got an A on any report card in my life (not even gym class), and took me 4 years to get an AAS degree at the local community college was pulling down well over 100k at 30.

It always rubbed her wrong, though she never said a word, that she put so much time and energy into her passion to make so little while I basically dicked off.  Or the stress she had to carry with meeting ever-increasing policy and administrative paperwork.  Or the times she came home from parent-teacher conferences and I could see her eyes red and puffy from crying in the car after dealing with parents hollering at her.  And let me tell you very few things in life really get under my skin, I'm a laid-back dude, but seeing her hurt like that I was ready to kill someone. I use to go to the basement and beat the hell out of a punching bag just to get the rage out.

So the pandemic rolls around and the district is doing this thing called teaching the teachers to use online conferencing tools for remote learning.  I get roped into it cause I'm a ""computer guy"" and her husband so I go to the district a couple of nights to help out and get everyone up to speed.  Talk about testing my patience, half the teachers didn't even show up, another batch didn't pay attention at all, some just complained the whole time and maybe 2 actually listened.  Anyway about a week into the 2020 school year and she's presenting to the class.  Before this started the district sent a packet and email to all the parents about what to expect, make sure their kid is dressed, be in a quite nondistracting area, kind of common sense stuff I'd think.  The first week there are kids with no shirts on, one kid that keeps playing with his cat, and one that all you can hear is music blaring in the background.  My wife asks the parents to turn the music off so the child can speak and the parent just comes unglued (I hear about all this after wards when she walks into my office) calling my wife a bitch and who does she think she is telling a grown man what to do in his own house, and the virus is just a hoax and on and on.  My wife turned off her laptop and quit.  That afternoon she called the principal to tell her she was done and will be returning the school property tomorrow.

After a couple of months she decided to apply for jobs and within a week was hired to do PM work for an IT firm with a starting salary of 85k.  She gave me shit about the money but almost double salary was a nice perk.  She's already had two promotions and jump right up the latter into a management position.  She can work with people really well and has no trouble talking to groups, which I suppose is important for a PM.

But yeah back to the salaries.  She is still in shock at how much we make and how much she makes. I'm not complaining either, she wanted to splurge with her fat paychecks and buy us a new travel trailer to replace the 1990 hand-me-down we've been using for almost 20 years."

After that they took about 2 weeks to give me the final decision (which is fine) but during these two weeks they were just saying that “we are very keen on hiring you but give us some time to get the contract and we will get back to you in a day or two” i felt they were kind of leading me on.

Finally 2 weeks pass and they ask me to visit the town club to sign the contract, i go there and i see that their “contract” is basically a bunch of tasks that i need to do and i price for each task. They changed the internship that had a fixed pay to a freelance role where ill have to work twice as hard to make the same money from what the internship had paid. I did not want to sign anything as i was thinking of backing out.

After talking about the tasks the boss told me the most random thing “if you dont make a sale within the first month of working here then theres no point of you working here” (i work in marketing) 

This came off as such a big red flag for me because i felt they were expecting too much from me before joining. Im so hesitant to join them cause my previous boss was also like this and was constantly gaslighting me that I’m traumatised from that.

Am i in the wrong here? Or are my feelings valid?"

\*\*Letters of Recommendation\*\*

(\*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)\*

1. AP Chem/Engineering Teacher (8.5/10): I’ve had this teacher all four years and we’re super close. Talked about how he would sneak me into the Engineering room over the summers so that I could make cool robots and other projects. Also mentioned some other stuff about my character and such. 
2. AP Lit Teacher (5/10): I’m kind of a STEM guy so this one was weaker (only asked her because CalTech required a humanities teacher). She mentioned to me that she was “super impressed” with the things that I do and the classes that I took so I don’t think it was bad but it definitely wasn’t anything special or interesting. 

\*\*Interviews\*\*

Northwestern: 10/10 loved this interview. My interviewer produced one of my favorite childhood shows and we just personality matched really well. At the end of the interview, he told me that he thought I was a good candidate and went on to show me props that he still has from that show. 

Yale: 8/10 I really enjoyed my yale interview. We were laughing throughout the majority of it and I think that, regardless of my admission decision, my interviewer gave me some super amazing and applicable advice for making the most of the next 4 years. 

Harvard: 5/10 My interviewer was super into my business and kept mentioning how she was amazed that a teenager was able to support his family with a business he started himself. She also asked what my least favorite book was. I answered that I really disliked Pride and Prejudice and she responded that it was her all time favorite book. 

UPenn: -999999/10 My interviewer was 10 hours late to my interview and literally laughed at me when I told him that I wanted to major in CS to improve upon assistive technology. He told me that by the end of the interview he would get me to switch to a “realistic major like finance”  

\*\*Essays\*\*

UC Essays(3/10): These were pretty bad. I wrote mainly about experiences that shaped my personality and aspirations but did so fairly robotically. 

Common App (8/10): I honestly really like my common app essay. I wrote about how showing my dad how to use “ok google” (thus giving him access to the internet for the first time) inspired me to explore the intersection of AI and accessibility. I chose to write this essay a little less eloquently so that my voice was able to shine through more. 

Supplements (8/10): Usually wrote about my startup and how it made me realize that improving assistive tech was what I wanted to do with my life.

usy3pj,11,2022-05-19,Transitioning from academia,FlaskBreaker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/usy3pj/transitioning_from_academia/,"I finished my CS degree three years ago and decided I wanted an academic career. Since then I have studied two MScs and a PhD, everything with a focus on AI. I do not have any publication on top conferences but have a publication on a minor conference, a publication on a top journal and have two more publications waiting to be published. Also, co-directed three bachelor's degree thesis related to webdev (and the three of them got really high grades). During my CS degree did a 6 month internship as a a webdev and 6 month as an engineer working with C/C++.

During my 3 year journey in academy I have been on a somewhat toxic environment and have struggled with motivation a lot, so I don't have many side projects right now. This week I've decide to quit and get outside academia (I won't resign to my current contract until I get something outside). Thinking about leaving makes me happy, and I'm motivated to improve my resume.

I think my resume is weak right now (I have to spend sometime analyzing it with these automatic screeners and optimize it). But, until then (as I said, I'm still working full-time and this is prime season so I don't have time or I'm to tired), I'm still cold applying to entry-level jobs in webdev, machine learning or data science through LinkedIn. Should I contact the 6 or so recruiters that contacted me during three years? I replied to all of them and told them nicely that at the moment I was pursuing an academic career. 

In summary, what should I do to improve my chances of getting a job ASAP in this situation? Does the cold talking to someone inside (that you don't even know) so that they you work?"

uszzxt,8,2022-05-19,Struggling to decide if I should return to engineering after 2 years,Minespidurr,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/uszzxt/struggling_to_decide_if_i_should_return_to/,"Hello! A little background: I decided quite late in my education to pursue STEM. It wasn’t until the latter half of my junior year in high school that I seriously decided to take AP courses and do engineering. 

After high school, I took most of the intro math (Calc I, Calc II, Diff EQ, Calc III) and science courses (Gen Chem, Calc based Physics I and II) at community college for two years. I finished (right as COVID hit), graduated, and went straight to my state university.

Shortly after, I had a serious stretch of bad luck that involved a car accident and a death in the family which forced me to withdraw 2 weeks into my first semester of university level coursework. I was very hesitant to do it but looking back, it was the best decision at the time. 

In the 2 years since, I’ve been working in retail trying to decide my path forward, and I guess you could say I’m stuck and very worried.

My gut tells me I should take the risk and go back while I’m still young. I have my transcript there and definitely have a good opportunity to finish my degree with minimal debt in about 2-3 years. However, another part of me is doubtful I can handle the rigor of higher level courses. Call it Imposter Syndrome if you will. I’ve also never had an internship or any real experience. That and I’m going to be several years older than most students. 

Am I overreacting? Is it ok to not have a concrete vision of what company you want to work for and what exactly you want to do with the degree? Has anyone else managed to make a return to engineering at university after a multi year hiatus? What was the hardest part of coming back and what kind of advice would you give someone in my position?"

ut0vna,3,2022-05-19,Should I graduate? If not what do I do in my senior year of college?,jzhang45,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ut0vna/should_i_graduate_if_not_what_do_i_do_in_my/,"I'm asking here because I need some advice.

To give you guys full context, I'm a CS + Math double major who could've graduated this semester (as a Junior) but since I do not have a job or internship lined up, I might stay another semester or year to get a dual degree.

I think people like my dad want me to graduate early to save money but my mom and my uncle don't since they tell me it's somehow bad for employment (as in employers will find it sus). Full disclosure, I am in-state and I do have a lot of scholarships so I'm not spending too much but saving a few thousand dollars is a good thing I guess. My uncle is also a Software Engineer who has hired new grads so I guess some of his opinions are valid.

If I don't graduate early I'm in sort of an epiphany as to what I will do. I know that my main priority is to do whatever I can to get a job. This means I'll be working on side projects and grinding Leetcode pretty much all summer and maybe doing parts of it during the school year.

However, there is also an aspect of my college experience that I've neglected, which is having a fulfilling social life (ie having the confidence to talk to girls and ""be a leader""). My initial goal was to take useful and hard CS classes like networking and maybe a graduate class on computer vision but one of my closest friends told me it wasn't worth the struggle and I should really be focusing on ""building my game"" my last year so ""I won't die alone"". On the other hand, a few of my close friends also encouraged me to take hard CS classes despite my struggle in classes like Operating Systems.

Some of the hard useful classes at my University have actually helped a lot of people with their jobs.

So the question I have is: Should I graduate? If not, do I build my game up or take hard useful CS classes?

EDIT: Perhaps a better question to ask is, is it worth the struggle of taking a hard useful class (despite previous bad experiences with similar classes) or is it worth doing something else?"

Compania 1 (din alt oras):

\- Mobile development (android, ios, hibrid) - imi place (cel putin android+java), in anul 3 tot in domeniul asta o sa mi fac lucrarea de licenta 

\- pana acum am mai facut niste chestii doar in android studio + java

\- Internship 3 luni - training - code review, sfaturi, proiecte - dar nu lucrez direct in productie

\- numar mic de angajati, programul usor flexibil

\- salariu - 1700 lei net + bonuri de masa (400 lei)

\- posibilitate de a continua cu ei 

Compania 2 (din orasul meu):

\- Software development (C++, QT) - nu mi displace, sunt dispus sa invat

\- pana acum am mai facut niste chestii in C++, dar nu am mai folosit QT

\- Internship 3 luni - training, dar lucrez pe proiecte care ies in productie

\- numar mai mare de angajati, e destul de cunoscuta, programul destul de flexibil (stiu concret)

\- salariu - 3000 lei net

\- posibilitate de a continua cu ei 

In momentul de fata ambele mi se par optiuni ok, dar as prefera sa strang ceva bani vara asta (dupa sa continui chiar si cu program 4-6h in timpul anului 3). Pe viitor, cred ca m-ar atrage mai mult o cariera in mobile dev, dar ma gandesc ca momentan orice experienta e buna pt CV.

Participated once in a national level competition as a club and won several awards for that- 2nd overall) (2 years)

3) Organising committee for our school’s first ever inter-school STEM competition- head of the logistics team, manager of one of the sub-events 

4) Maths tutoring + programme for underprivileged: 
  A) Joined a tutoring programme that connects each volunteer to one underprivileged kid, to tutor them in a subject of that choice. I’ve been teaching maths (briefly, English) to one student for the last two years, and her scores have improved significantly.
B) About 8 months back I joined the core team of the organisation as one of the managers. So far we’ve held a ration drive, a Christmas donation drive, and are working on some more projects.

Other than this, I play the guitar. I started taking the exams last year and I’ll be taking grade 4 in a few weeks.

Awards: 
- Recognising Ramanujan (national maths competition): top 8, rank not given 
- Caribou maths competition: Top 11% internationally
- CEMC Pascal contest: I registered individually so I was I eligible for some of the awards- I got a certificate of distinction which put me in the top 25%)

Summer activities:
- 10th grade: Learned Java at the beginner level from a local teacher

I participated in a program in 9th grade as well but that was completely useless and a complete waste of a good amount of money.

Before COVID, I’d been playing table tennis for around 4 years (however the awards and all won’t really count for anything as they’re all from before 9th grade). Our school has recently restarted team training after COVID so I will be doing this again.

As for my grades, I would say I’m pretty good. I‘ve consistently been ranked amongst the top 3 of my batch of around 220 students for the last three years. I’m currently in a CBSE school but I’ll be going to an IB school in the next AY.

I haven’t given the SAT yet but I will soon- I’m working towards a 1550+ and I think that with enough practice I’ll be able to get that.

Partly due to not getting the correct guidance in 9th and partly due to my laziness for a few months during the pandemic, I’ve not done something spectacular that really reflects my interests. 10th was when I really got into computer science but because of the board exams I just couldn’t get a break from studying. I only took a few online courses during this time and took up some projects (they weren’t anything major though, basic projects that were more for my own exercise than anything else).

Sorry if this is too long lol, my main questions are these:
- How good are these ECs? Assuming I continue at this same level, what kind of colleges (UK or US) should I be applying to (as any- a safety, a reach or a target)?
- What activities would you suggest (I know that there are many posts on this already, but most of the ECs mentioned there are hard to find in India. If you know of such extracurriculars- research or internships or competitions, I’d really appreciate it if you’d let me know)

Thanks a lot :))"

Compared to others', my resume is really weak.

My first and only prior job experience was during high school. The only achievements I have are related to high school and my community college.I have a 3yo and took a gap year after high school to adjust to the major change in my life. I don't think that's relevant to my resume but I could be wrong. Child-raising is the major reason I am looking for a remote internship and I'm a bit worried a company will ask questions like ""why can't you be available during ""x-x"" times?

Anyways. I feel like my chances are pretty slim. If I don't include high school achievements, there will be nothing else on my resume. But as for formatting, is my resume okay?

Hi everyone, I feel completely unprepared/overwhelmed here as it is my first live technical/coding interview for a data analyst position and I really, really want to make an effort and good impression as it would be a life changing/dream job and I am willing to put in 10+ hour days to prepare as best as I can. Also, I’m currently on mobile so I apologize about the formatting of it’s a little off.

My problem is that I haven’t used (SQL, Python) regularly in almost two years since I graduated. My first and current analyst role only uses Excel and PowerPoint and this is the reason I have been looking for other positions (Covid impacted internships and many opportunities). I really enjoyed using Python and SQL and want to get job experience to further my skill set. The company I’m working for really helped the recruiter push me to the next round of interviewing since it is in the same industry and he immediately set the next interview up.

This will probably be super basic things to the majority of you, but it’s hard for me to get an idea of the best route to study for this. They gave me a small list of possible areas I will have to show the manager in a live coding interview and I would really appreciate it if anyone could steer me in the best direction for me to tackle these things.

Notes from recruiter:

	1.	Questions around A/B Testing
	2.	Understanding of Python and SQL: There will be a live coding exercise in Python and SQL. Make sure you ask questions and understand the problem before starting. Communicate your thought process. This will be important. This will be a straight forward data manipulation exercise in addition to some SQL queries

*Some example type questions below:

	•	Given a dictionary of dictionarys of a JSON blob,parse particular entries.
	•	Calculate a 30 day rolling profit
	•	Parse event logs and return count of unique*

I’ve been going back over all the basic SQL and a lot of it is coming back to me, and I’ve been refreshing myself of using numpy and pandas in Python as the recruiter said they use those often. My big issue is memorizing the syntax for both without using references during the interview. Does anyone have some general tips for me as to how I can best prepare myself for this? Like I said, I am willing to put in as much time as I can to prepare myself. Even if I bomb the interview, I still want to give myself the best chance to impress them, and worse case scenario it’ll be a good learning experience. Thanks."

ut8so3,12,2022-05-19,Signing On + Part Time degree is it worth in my case,Holiday-Plan8883,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/ut8so3/signing_on_part_time_degree_is_it_worth_in_my_case/,"Hi Redditors, a little bit about myself, I am currently pursuing my diploma in cyber security and I am in my third year. I am not sure whether or not I should sign on given my reasons.

Financial-wise, my parents are well off and can afford my university fees. As for my current GPA it is around 3.3-3.5. Best case I could go to SMU if not I will go to SIT. Here is my reasoning for signing on and would like to know your point of view/opinion on it.

Personally, I feel that I would like to retire as early as possible. I do not plan on having kids, this will cut down a lot on the amount I need to retire. I also do not spend on any luxury goods and do not go out AT ALL, further cutting down on the amount needed for me to retire. Furthermore, I do not plan on getting a driving license let alone a car. I am contented with staying at home, playing games, gyming at home and spending time with my family.

Back to signing on, I feel that by signing on the C4X specifically (which is cyber security, related to my diploma) I will not only be able to start earning 3.5k-3.7k with only a diploma, I will also be able to gain more experience compared to peers that went to uni. I understand that many of the Singaporeans here have pointed out whether the ""experience"" working in the army or not is useful/transferable, I personally think that even if it is not transferable, I can still be able to get some experience out of it and put it on my resume(Feel free to let me more about the experience in C4X).

Since my goal is to retire early, I plan to sign on and take a part-time degree. The part-time degree will allow me to promote in the ranks faster and not stagnate on a specific rank, increasing my pay.  During my signing on years, I also plan to also invest in safer/braindead investments like the ETFs which historically have a return of around 8-10% per year, I will also be dedicating a SMALL percentage into risky investments like crypto. I feel that with the combination of investing, working (gaining experience in my field) and getting a part-time degree, I am able to out-pace my peers who went the uni route. Do not get me wrong, I do understand that in the private sector after a certain amount of seniority/experience, no doubt the private sector pays more compared to the army, but that is not my goal. My goal is to retire early.

Comparing the 2 routes I would take: (More leaning towards taking the 1st route to retire early)

1. Sign on + part-time degree at 20y/o. By 26y/o, I would have earned 200k+ (Excluding expenses which I doubt will be a lot since I do not go out AT ALL and my family cooks). Most of it will of course be invested, giving me a reliable passive income. This 200k is what i would EARN through signing on, this excludes the compound interest I would gain from investing and the signing on bonus. No debts. Signing on, SAF will sponsor for the PT degree.
2. The second route would be at 20y/o, serve NS 2 years, 3-4years degree depending on which uni i go. By 26y/o I would probably not have much savings or close to like 10k ish? which is not really much in the grand scheme of things. I would also have quite a little experience, but the experience I gained through the degree internship would be valuable as it is in the private sector. At 26y/o, I come out to work in the tech industry (because thats the sector I am currently in and would want to study in uni). The fresh graduate pay would be probably 3.5k to 5k(can be a hit or miss depending on how one markets themselves and what company they work for, a lot of factors in play). As for debts, I am not sure if my parents would pay for my uni fees.

Comparing these 2 routes, through route 1, at 26y/o - income would be roughly 4-5k( as I have finished the PT degree by then) with lets say 150k in ETFs. That would be 15k in passive income per annum. Which sums up to 5k-6k ish per month for income, with no debt.

As for route 2, I would only have my income from my job which is dependent on how I negotiate for my salary. Which would be around 4k (I do not think I am too much of a high achiever to get a 5k salary as a fresh grad). As for university debts, let's assume for THIS case that my parents would pay for it, so it would be 0.

Hence, by comparing the 2 routes, at the age of 26y/o through route1 I would have A LOT more invested and would have a higher salary. The compound interest from the investment would really start going crazy at this point. However, in the long run, I assume route 2 would most likely provide me with more income as I work in the private sector since graduation?? It would be quite hard to compare the amount earned in the senior years between the 2 routes because route1 has compound interests + regulars have alot of bonuses(combat pay, experience pay, long service award pay) and free healthcare  whereas route2 has job-hopping to increase salary + salary in private sector are generally higher.

I also heard a lot of people saying that the army/public sector moves very slowly, the technology is very outdated, etc. I also heard that working in the army would be more slack and also braindead (not sure if it is true for C4X). I personally do not mind this because if it is slack, it means I would not be stressed at work and can focus on studying my part-time degree or upgrading myself through courses. After experiencing my poly intern, I also feel that corporate life isn't for me. I am very anti-social and have anxiety so networking isn't really my thing, and would prefer just working in the army compared to networking, interviews, job-hopping/hunting, etc.

In conclusion, I feel that signing on and doing a part-time degree is more suited for my goal which is to retire early, preferably by 35 with 700k\~ in investments which is enough for me to retire. Even if it is not, working a further 1-2years would not hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say at the age of 35, my life goals have changed and I have decided I do not want to retire early, I feel that it is still not the end of the world, I have enough money to get by and can get a job in the private sector from the courses that I will learn while working/signing on.

I understand a lot of Redditors here have a grudge against signing on :D Please do not rip my asshole in the comments. No hate comments please!

I appreciate any advice that is given, also it would be nice to list your pros and cons in regards to my scenario as my goal is to retire early. If you have went through a similar route, feel free to share! THANK YOU."

ut9dh9,4,2022-05-19,Should I take a summer internship?,Jaws0607,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/ut9dh9/should_i_take_a_summer_internship/,"My teacher/advisor wants me to take a summer internship with a company that works with our university. I’m not very good at my major (i major in computer science) and my teacher said himself this past semester that I need way more practice coding and that I’m behind my peers. I don’t really want to pursue a job in this field anymore, and am thinking of pursuing a game testing job which falls under my major, but doesn’t involve coding or being to good at computer science. I also just really don’t want to take an internship because of my social anxiety and because I’m an introvert. I’d rather stay at home all summer doing whatever I want, rather than stressing over an internship that might not even help me. My family and teachers say I should do it though. What do you guys think?

TLDR - should I try to pursue a summer internship even though I don’t feel prepared for it, have social anxiety, and would rather keep my free time this summer?"

I would probably have at least 2 yoe (plus 1 yoe of internship experience) before applying master.

I will be applying as a domestic student and hold a BA in CS (not Bsc) with bunch of coops (and research experience) from a top 3 univ (core CS curicula are the same as Bsc but Ba is more flexible and cheaper).

Does anyone have list of part-time program ?. If the program is in person-only, I may have to find software job in that particular city which is doable but I prefer to stay in my current place as I'd have to take chances with the WLB if looking for a new position. I'm located in the prairies (not AB) so my option are kind of limited within the area.

Could probably consider full-time too for program like UofT MscAC"

utaolz,1,2022-05-19,24F - Unsure about the employment opportunities and my future,rotxtoxcore,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/utaolz/24f_unsure_about_the_employment_opportunities_and/,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24 and recently just got my SSN/work permit. I developed some skills in my local college as an accounting undergrad but wasn't able to finish. I was president of two clubs and executive board on three others. I interned three times in the accounting/finance field for small to medium sized companies. I did a lot of activities and had lots of hopes for life, but it all came to a stop suddenly. I have my resume ready in hand. About a year ago, I interviewed with a local firm but they couldn't hire me because of my status. I am thinking about going back into the field, or computer/office jobs in general, but really I just felt burned out - and the exhaustion from past internships crawls back. I admit that if I actually get a job back in the field I really shouldn't complain in this economy, but it's one of those cases of ""found out what I don't wanna do in college"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Two years have gone by - because I wasn't able to legally work, I was hustling for side jobs including cleaning and babysitting, while suffering from depression because I felt hopeless for my situation and life in general. Now that the government has finally issued my work permit after two years of long wait, I have doubts of getting back to the market. I'm not sure if recruiters would understand the reason why I wasn't able to work. Part of me wants to learn a new trade, a new skill etc, but I'm not sure if I have a lot of abilities outside of office work as a short, slim girl. I saved up about a little less than $10k and I do want to utilize that in the best way possible, even if I start from scratch. Sidenote, I recently was injured on my knee so I do have a minor disability (I need one crutch to walk), and I'm not sure how that will affect my interviews and chance of employment. Please if you have any thoughts or inputs, criticism etc I'm all ears. Thanks"

utcir2,62,2022-05-19,Review from Alumni and Warning for any Future and Current Students in the Cybersecurity Major,UberZachAttack,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/utcir2/review_from_alumni_and_warning_for_any_future_and/,"Now that I officially graduated from the College of IST and majored in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations with a minor in Security Risk Analysis, I feel that I have a moral obligation to post about my experience. There are many flaws within the major that me and my peers have experienced that will be covered in this post.

In order to be transparent, I would like to go over some of the biases that I have so anyone reading this will understand the place I am coming from. Firstly, I spent one and a half years with Zoom classes so there might be slight differences in the future but I still believe that this post will be applicable anyways. Secondly, I currently hold two security certifications specifically within offensive security (eJPT and PNPT). Thirdly, I was heavily involved with a club that competed in cybersecurity competitions and developed advanced cybersecurity skills. Lastly, I spent most of my free time doing self-learning and participating in other competitions on my own. My perspective is coming from a more technical and involved standpoint than most of my peers. I have tried my best to remove any emotional biases that I might have within this and aimed to be objective throughout.

Also, I have shared what I have written here with some of my friends and peers within the major and many echo the same concerns and sentiments in this post.

**Background**

It is worth acknowledging that the cybersecurity major itself is relatively new, and that flaws in the initial creation of this major are to be expected. With that said, the graduating class of 2022, my class, was the first to ever enroll into the major during our college application. The graduating class of 2020 was the first class to ever switch into it. Before this, there were two tracks within the SRA major. The first being the ‘Intelligence Analysis and Modeling’ track, which is SRA today, and the second one being the ‘Information and Cyber Security’ track, which was made into the cybersecurity major in 2018. It is my hope that this post will provide an inside perspective on the initial years of the cybersecurity major in order to give more insight to current and future students within the major and hopefully improve and innovate the major in the present and future.

**Major Curriculum**

Amongst STEM students at Penn State it is common to hear that the College of IST’s curriculum is easy compared to other technical majors. The college is often thought of as a place for computer science refugees escaping Math 140 and 141. As for the cybersecurity major, the hardest math classes that you have to take are Math 110 (Business Calculus) and Stat 200. The major does not rely on classes outside of the college to weed out any students that will not be able to make it through the rest of the major. There are very few classes, with the exception of the capstone and a couple of major required classes, that tests the students skills and resilience. It appears that the major is actively trying to keep as many students in as possible. However, this is admittedly a moral dilemma for the College of IST because of its small size and desire to grow. The college must decide between making the major more rigorous and accepting a large quantity of students (in addition to the fact that it is a huge advertising boost for the college).

All of this is compounded with how the assignments and labs are designed and structured within each course. A majority of the time the labs do not apply what is taught in class, but rather they inform students of exactly what to do and do not elaborate on the skill being demonstrated. A common trend in labs is that they require students to copy something and then paste it within a certain tool or prompt just for students to screenshot the results and then submit that for a grade. I feel frustrated that the labs spoon feed content to students when they have such an immense potential to be a place where students can work on developing skills relevant to our field.

I feel that these issues are made worse by the balance of courses required for the major. Below is a course breakdown for major related courses for cybersecurity ([based on the suggested academic plan](https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/information-sciences-technology/cybersecurity-analytics-operations-bs/#suggestedacademicplantext)):

* Cybersecurity related classes - 6:  Cyber 100 Computer System Literacy, Cyber 262 Cyber-Defense Studio , Cyber 342W Cyber Incident Handling and Response (Writing),  Cyber 362 Cybersecurity Analytics Studio, Cyber 366 Malware Analytics, Cyber 440 Capstone
* IST related classes - 12 (Not including 495, internship credit): IST 140 Intro to App Dev  -  IST 242 Intermediate App Dev -  IST 261 App Dev Design Studio (Java Programing),  IST 210 Organization of Data,  IST 220 Networking, IST 230 Discrete Math, IST 432 Legal Environment of IST, IST 451 Network Security, IST 454 Forensics, IST 456 Information Security Management
* SRA related classes - 6: SRA 111 Intro to SRA, SRA 211 Threat of Terrorism and Crime, SRA 221 Overview of Info Sec, SRA 231 Decision Theory and Analysis, SRA 311 Risk Analysis in Security, SRA 365 Statistics for SRA

The suggested academic plan clearly shows that a majority of the required classes are IST / SRA. Because most of the technical skills are taught in the six cybersecurity courses (5 realistically due to the nature of 342W), I feel that we are not being equipped with the technical skills we need for our future careers. In addition to this, students are not taught programming languages that would be beneficial to the field. The cybersecurity major is only required to learn three semesters of Java. The students should be programming more and taught languages like Python which are more applicable and prominent in the industry, as well as focusing on scripting and automation more than application development principles. There are other languages that are also prominent like C, Bash, and Ruby but Python would be the most beneficial.

I feel that all of this is made worse by the fact that there is a lot of information overlap in the courses. I found myself being retaught a concept in a 300-400 level IST/SRA class that was already covered in a 100-200 level Cyber/SRA class. There is a plateau of information after the first two years. These classes also do not try to apply what you learned previously, then only reteach the concepts you learn in a different context. I feel that the cybersecurity curriculum needs to be more standardized and that the higher level classes need to challenge students just as much as the lower level classes.

**Professors**

I want to preface this section by saying I will not be sharing any names of the professors that I feel are not qualified enough to instruct courses within the cybersecurity major. There are some professors that taught some classes that I was in and found them to be beneficial. However, I will be describing what I and many of my peers experienced within their classes.

I feel that the professors employed by the College of IST do not meet a standard of professional experience needed to be effective instructors. To my knowledge, most professors only have a background within IT either through academia or within the field. There is also the fact that some of the professors have to teach outside the scope of their class in order to fill in the technical background knowledge needed for the students. Other times, it is that the professors are only here to complete research and don’t have to focus on how they teach. Currently, there is not one single professor that is actually from the cybersecurity field that I know of. There was only one professor that I met that was within the field during my time at Penn State. He did forensics for the police and was OSCP certified, the gold standard for offensive security. He was also in the process of creating a pentesting class for the major. Unfortunately, he left the college and pursued a career in the field. I am unsure of what happened regarding the circumstances of why he left, but I still wish he was teaching at the college. That professor gave me a taste of the expertise I have wanted to see from the college, and I hope that more professors can be hired with similar qualifications.

One personal example that I would like to share is from my time in Cyber 366 - Malware Analysis. To begin, I felt that a majority of students are severely underprepared for this class since the cybersecurity curriculum does not expose students to the languages used within the course, C and Assembly, at any point before the course. Students are expected to suddenly jump from Java to C and Assembly within a single semester. That is made worse by the fact that the professor that taught my class, who shall remain anonymous, is regarded as one of the worst professors within the major. Because the students were severely underprepared and the professor did not teach the subject effectively, this resulted in every assignment being pushed back a week due to students not understanding what to do (and not being spoon fed). To add onto the issues listed, someone with actual malware analysis knowledge was taking a different section of the class during the same time I took it. From what I was told, it was clear that the professor copied information from online and had no familiarity with the subject. This greatly shaped my perspective on how I was going to be taught throughout the rest of my future semesters and gave me realizations on past ones. I should also add that two TAs from that course section left during the course of the semester from what I heard.

**Application Focuses**

In my opinion, there are only two useful application focuses. These being Application Development and Law and Policy. This is due to application development being able to give more coding experience which is sorely lacking in the curriculum and law and policy for anyone that would like to become a lawyer or consultant within cybersecurity.

The other 3 are quite useless. I was going to add Geopolitics to the useful list due to the ability of getting an easy SRA minor with one extra SRA class (by taking the two 400 level SRA classes) but I was told by an underclassmen that the college is no longer allowing that pathway. This is due to the fact that many of the classes required for the minor are already within the cybersecurity major. As for Economics and Healthcare, they are not applicable since you don’t really apply that to cybersecurity (besides learning about HIPPA through the Healthcare focus but that could be covered in Law and Policy anyways). Those application focuses only add extra classes that aren’t described in a cybersecurity context.

**Course Capstone**

Cyber 440 is one of the best courses in the major from an objective standpoint. From every other standpoint, it is just like the rest.

The class forces students to look for answers on their own and to apply what they have learned within the labs by simply providing a dataset for analysis. However, the execution of this with the curriculum was poor. Since everything leading up to this class was handed to the students, almost everyone has no clue what to do. The labs were challenging, often requiring two to seven days to complete. I was looking for this from the labs, but I feel that it was far too late to implement and was not beneficial to the students.

To give an example of the difficulty of the labs, students’ only experience regarding forensics was in IST 454 - Computer and Cyber Forensics. The final lab of IST 454 was to guess the password for a ZIP file without the use of password cracking tools. Within the capstone, one of the first individual labs is to perform an analysis of an actual system image. To give you an idea of the magnitude of difference, the IST 454 final lab was a couple of text documents. The capstone lab is 100 gigabytes of data to look through.

Because of this, the students that were more involved in cybersecurity extracurriculars and had more technical skills were forced to help everyone that didn’t know what to do. This was a common trend with many of the assignments.

For the final group project, groups were assigned and students had no say in who their group members were. This was intended to give a more realistic situation to what you might encounter in your professional career since some people might be an expert, or some might be intermediates, or some might be not knowledgeable on the subject at all. However, because groups were composed of varying skill, many of the more advanced students carried a brunt of the workload while the less experienced students tried to help where they could. Everyone that I have talked to has had at least one person being completely useless for the final project. Within that group of people that possessed technical knowledge, they spent most of their time teaching the other group members, those that would contribute, how to do the project.

**2 + 2 Plan Students**

I wanted to add this section for anyone that is within a branch campus. From what I gathered from my peers that did the 2 + 2 program, they received even less in regards to what is taught at University Park. That being tools that they weren’t taught or things that they were expected to know in class. In a sense, the branch campuses are getting a watered down version of everything in addition to what is described here.

**Recommendations**

In the off chance that there any faculty and staff within the College of IST that are in the position to influence the way the cybersecurity major is changed, here are some of my recommendations:

* Create more technical cybersecurity courses. This could be tied into the creation of new application focuses listed below.
* Redesign the assignments and labs. Apply the knowledge taught instead of spoon feeding it. The way the labs are designed for the capstone would be a great reference for how to model new labs.
* Hire professors with more applicable professional experience. I know this will be quite hard since all of the industry professionals are already in careers that take up a lot of time.
* Create application focuses that would teach topics such as incident response, offensive security, network security and administration, forensic investigations, security operation center analysis, malware analysis, risk and compliance, etc.
* Only use IST/SRA courses that are related to cybersecurity and reduce the amount of information overlap. Ensure that the information that is taught early on in the curriculum will be applied in an effective manner in later classes and not retaught.

I understand that these tasks are difficult and take time to be placed into effect. However, I do believe that the items that I have recommended will fix all of the issues that I have described and will offer more to the major.

**Conclusion**

If you finally managed to read all the way through, I applaud you. If you are someone that is going into this major or an underclassmen already within it and read this, you have more commitment than half of the people that are already in the major. All of this might be burdensome to know that most of the coursework is redundant and stagnant and that the professors are under qualified to teach. My hope is that this will help prepare you for what is to come.

If you can get past all of the issues plaguing the major then here two things that I recommend doing:

* Do some extracurricular activity that is useful. You don’t have to worry too much about good grades since the major is not overly demanding. This can either be joining a cybersecurity related club, becoming an LA, using platforms like TryHackMe or HackTheBox, or doing CTFs.
* Find a topic that you are introduced to through the major and study it on your own. You have to embrace self-learning. Every person that I have met that was competent in the major taught themselves on their own. This is not just a major thing, this is big within the industry. If you are unwilling to adapt and don’t continue to learn, then the cybersecurity major is not for you.

For all the issues I have faced while pursuing this major, I would not have been able to gain the benefits and experiences if I chose a different path. It is quite conflicting since it has been a double-edged sword. On one hand I had to deal with all the problems while pursuing this major while on the other hand I was able to do so many things that were a positive experience. These include things like finding my drive for what I want to do, studying topics that I was introduced to in the major on my own, meeting and making some great friends, and participating in things that I wouldn’t have imagined.

If there is one thing to take away from this for anyone going into or currently in the major, do something more than what it provides.  You will be sorely disappointed if you don't."

This is my third week and I am expected to finish my internships by August. 

(CW sui thoughts at the end of the post)

Majoring in ECE has been a lifesaver for me when I was struggling after graduating highschool. I voluntarily went to choose this path. But I am mentally ill. Ever since I started I felt like my symptoms worsened. All of the professionals I saw told me so, and are worried about my well-being. 

It's currently 4 am where I'm at and I am currently beating myself up for passing out and not prepping a lesson plan for today. I feel like I've made so many mistakes within the three weeks I've started that I know for sure that I'll fail my internships - my time management sucks, my focus is skewed, I keep prepping lesson plans at the very last minute, and I constantly feel overwhelmed. Everytime I go back home from school I immediately pass out from exhaustion. And if I fail my internships I feel like my life will be really over and I will have no other ways to keep living/going. 

Not to mention even though my coworkers seem nice I feel like everyone secretly doesn't like me, or they're doing it just to be nice, or that they're secretly talking about me behind their backs.

I really want to be in this field though. I know what I signed up for when I went for this. I plan to dive deep into special education or mental health so I can help children that really need it after I'm done interning.

But I just feel hopeless. I feel like I always keep making mistakes. I feel like I'm going to fail this for sure. How can I help other people when I can't even help myself. I've been having passive suicidal thoughts for the past three weeks. 

This post sounds like a mess but I'm just rambling what's in my mind. I'm sorry."

So this January, a year and half after graduating college, I finally landed a full-time, remote job as an operations coordinator. In college, I had a slew of office internships, but they were all concentrated in the entertainment industry where I was mostly reading scripts and attending to various administrative tasks as needed. 

It’s now my 5th month at this new job (a tutoring company) which is for the most part, high pressure and very detail oriented, though my team is pretty nice. I handle clients, administrative work, and additional research projects on the daily and sometimes feel overworked/overwhelmed. The company is small. There are 7 of us total on the admin side and everyone else works part-time as a tutor/counselor. 

I feel like I’m constantly making tiny, silly mistakes which are pointed out to me by our CEO who is essentially copied on every email. Today, for instance, I copied the wrong client on an email who works directly with our CEO and the CEO seemed slightly pissed. An easy fix in my opinion, but I hate appearing borderline incompetent all the time and it’s really eating at my sense of self-worth and confidence. My anxiety is also bad now and every morning I wake up full of dread. Other examples - earlier this week, I approved a report that had an incorrect name listed in the header. Last week, I forgot to send one email (from a batch of like 14). Or a few weeks ago I emailed someone when I had been specifically asked to text them lol. 

I feel like all of my mistakes are all small and somewhat unique. I try my best to take my time and review things before sending them off but I just keep making mistakes or overlooking small details when doing my work. I also feel like my coworkers do not run into errors as often as me. The other ops coordinator went to the same school as me and has a very similar background but she’s stellar. 

I’d like to stay at this job until the end of the year given that it’s remote and pays okay, but I want to know if anyone has advice? how do i improve at this? I keep making resolutions to be better and more self-aware and try my best but I’m still slipping up like once a week :/"

I just took the GRE today and want to get a start on determining what programs I actually have a good shot at. The program would need to be online and be able to be completed within a year, unfortunately. 

Undergrad: B.S. Mechanical Engineering from Idaho State University

GPA: 3.38, (3.6 Major)

GRE: 156 Q, 158 V (Unofficial)

Work Experience: Starting as mechanical engineer for the Air Force in July.

Internships: Various internships with national laboratories, I did quite a bit of independent design work on the last one. 

Research work: Worked as an undergrad research assistant for my department most of my four years there, worked on aerospace projects the majority of the time. 

The schools I was mainly looking into were like Georgia Tech, Colorado-Boulder and Purdue, but these seem like quite the reaches with the GRE I just took and my GPA. I was thinking maybe North Carolina State would be a good option? Are there any schools that I should look more into, or should I retake the GRE?

I developed some skills in my local college as an accounting undergrad but wasn't able to finish. I was president of two clubs and executive board on three others. I interned three times in the accounting/finance field for small to medium sized companies. I did a lot of activities and had lots of hopes for life, but it all came to a stop suddenly. I have my resume ready in hand. About a year ago, I interviewed with a local firm but they couldn't hire me because of my status. I am thinking about going back into the field, or computer/office jobs in general, but really I just felt burned out - and the exhaustion from past internships crawls back. I admit that if I actually get a job back in the field I really shouldn't complain in this economy, but it's one of those cases of ""found out what I don't wanna do in college"".



Two years have gone by - because I wasn't able to legally work, I was hustling for side jobs including cleaning and babysitting, while suffering from depression because I felt hopeless for my situation and life in general. Now that the government has finally issued my work permit after two years of long wait, I have doubts of getting back to the market. I'm not sure if recruiters would understand the reason why I wasn't able to work. Part of me wants to learn a new trade, a new skill etc, but I'm not sure if I have a lot of abilities outside of office work as a short, slim girl. I saved up about a little less than $10k and I do want to utilize that in the best way possible, even if I start from scratch. Sidenote, I recently was injured on my knee so I do have a minor disability (I need one crutch to walk), and I'm not sure how that will affect my interviews and chance of employment. Please if you have any thoughts or inputs, criticism etc I'm all ears. Thanks"

So I’m a 3rd year student (well now 4th year student - yay!) and I have been looking for an internship for a while. I think I started back in March but I haven’t had any success. I won’t lie the 1st batch of applications had not the best Resume or Portfolio and I realized this after the fact. But I have since re-done my resume as well as my portfolio and added a website - and again I applied for more and essentially never got even close to an interview. I figured it had to do with my projects and their layouts so once again I have made huge updates and uploaded new projects I finished this semester and I feel much more confident on them. But the thing is now there doesn’t seem to be any openings, specifically in the Texas area (Im willing to move if helped by company) - so now I’m messaging people directly on LinkedIn (which I should have done from the start) and asking to see if there is openings in their respective companies. 

So my question is, do you know of anyone who is hiring or are you hiring?

But I’m kind of stuck now because I need to move out asap from my parents for my sanity and safety. So I’m getting the first thing I can whether it be an internship or entry level or customer service or as a server at a restaurant.

utmelc,1,2022-05-20,Need advice about sub-letter,Fruitspunch_samurai4,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/utmelc/need_advice_about_subletter/,"Hey everyone, 

I’m renting a property (a 3 bed townhouse) in North Carolina managed under a somewhat large property management company, which doesn’t allow sublease/subletting without permission (You guys probably know where this is going).

My lease term (that was transferred from a previous tenant) runs from January to July, but I wouldn’t be living there May-July since I’m heading out of the state for a summer internship. So I looked for someone to take over my lease in a local housing Facebook group so that I won’t have to pay rent for 2 places at the same time. 

The first time I posted I didn’t get much of a response, but the second time, I had a person (let’s call her H) DM me. She said she needed a place ASAP, that she had a clean rental record and blah blah blah. I was relieved to find someone to take over since I was really desperate. I asked when she was looking to move in, and she said “tomorrow” and that she’s packing her stuff in her car as we speak. Did think that was kinda weird, but me being desperate and dumb at the time passed it along. She said she was looking for a place for her and her partner to stay until they were financially stable. I interpreted that to mean that they wanted to move to somewhere cheaper so that they can save money. 

Since they needed to move in ASAP, I thought that maybe for the month of May, I’ll just have them pay me the rent so that we won’t have to deal with the lease transfer process (fatal mistake). 

Fast forward about a week after they moved in, I get texts from H in the middle of the night. I didn’t see them till the morning, but it turns out that another girl who just moved in (this girl had her lease transferred from my girlfriend who was living with me in the townhouse) relapsed on drugs and went crazy (screaming, running up and down the stairs, assaulting a person that was with her and sending her to the ER).

After getting in contact with the third roommate (who my girlfriend and I stayed with during our time there), we find out that the leasing company said they cannot do anything about A  and that we would have to file a police report (which the third roomate did). A has now decided that she will be moving out, but since her lease does not end until July, she will keep some of her stuff in her room and come pick it up when the lease is over. 

Now, during this whole thing, H has been saying how she doesn't care what we do as long as we kick A out. At one point, she even said she would take over my lease if that gives her more legal power to get A out. When I told her that I am fine with her taking over the lease, she back-tracked on her words and said that she is unemployed, has bad credit, and does not have a guarantor who can sign for her. Also, she says that she does not want to sign the lease if A is not moved out, and that she would rather find another place. Now I am getting more suspicious of her. I give her the next best option (which she already mentioned before): to refund her the money and have her move out. She said if she is able to find a place by June 1st, then she will move out. Now she is saying that she does not want to move out and that she is an ""at will tenant"". She, however, will not get over about A and will not feel at rest until A is completely out and not tied to the lease. She is even admant about adding chain lock to the doors even though we cannot have her doing that to the property. I’m worried that while I’m out of state she would do something crazy and get us both in trouble. 

I honestly want to just kick her out and bear the fine of letting someone stay under my lease. However, I am worried that if I do that, then the landlord would take legal action on me for violating the lease. 

This whole thing is just a mess, and I don’t know what to do. But ultimately, I just want to know if it is possible to kick H out legally since she is not a leased tenant. Obviously, I would refund her her money and giver her a weeks notice.


TLDR; can you kick out someone who is staying in your room under your lease and is paying you rent monthly?"

I literally spent the past 3 hours trying to figure out how to get a string out of a list and print it and I could not figure it out and still can't and it's 2 AM. But in python I know instantly how to print an item from a list out. I feel so dumb. I need to learn C# because I have a internship that uses it I'll be starting in like 2 weeks.

Is this normal to struggle this much learning C# compared to python? I learned python much quicker. I just feel very frustrated with myself and stupid."
utmzbn,2,2022-05-20,How to go about writing a resume when you have experience in someother field and you're applying for some other field? Considering the resume is for a 12 month undergrad apprenticeship.,MusicProductionDude,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/utmzbn/how_to_go_about_writing_a_resume_when_you_have/,"So I'm currently 19 year old and just entered the college. Since my childhood I'm into music and during 12th grade I got my first internship as a music producer.

I started working as a techno producer after leaving that internship after about 10 months and am also currently working as a freelance music producer.

At the age of 11, I built a YouTube channel with about 10K subs as well. 

So I've written all of the above in the experience section of my resume. 

One thing that I want to ask is, as my background is in media production (Audio, Video and Graphics). And the apprenticeship I'm interested in applying for is from an automotive company where my role would be in Brand Experiences (basically branding and marketing side of the company).

I wanted to ask, should I include my previous work experience in my resume or not?

And how should I title myself to be? Generally I write that I'm a media producer, foley artist &amp; UI designer. (As I've experience working in all of the domains mentioned above). But I'm not sure how should I go about telling the recruiter what I am exactly as the position I want to apply to is totally different - (brand experiences).


Any suggestions would be extremely helpful!

Thank you"

We're final year students who have been giving exams since February, non-stop (I'm not kidding) because covid had pushed back the 5th sem final exam schedule by a month last December. 

So we spent Feb-March giving practical finals and theory finals (all subjective-essay exams with 400-800 slides/pages worth of content per subject). After that, we got a 'holiday' of literally 4 days before jumping into our 6th (final) semester in April, where we had lab records to submit every SINGLE day and an assignment every ALTERNATE day (not hyperbole). May started and we've already given another 2 sets of exams (6 pracs + 6 theory, stem kids have practical exams which eat up 'study break weeks' so we're forced to do last minute catching ups). 

And even as we are in the middle of this, it's announced that final sem exams are starting the 1st week of June... like, huh? So I'm on my last week of college already? How? 

Professors are taking 10+ hours of classes every day, even on weekends, and are still struggling to finish the syllabus in such a small time. Nobody is giving a singular fuck about how much stress we're under, how we haven't been able to catch a break for half a year, how it's unrealistic to infodump an unrealistic amount of coursework non-stop for MONTHS and expect us to catch up without actually giving us any time to self-study at all. No time for part-time, projects, internships, heck- we haven't been able to go out as a group for leisure in ages. I haven't picked up my paintbrush since Feb. None of my friends have indulged in a hobby in forever.

 It's like life is passing me by at turbo speed. And once everything ends, just like that, my college life is over."

As my title says, I'm being terminated--technically because I'm leaving for a graduate internship (but they were supposed to hold my position for me, but that's another story). Since starting this position two years ago, I have been bullied relentlessly by two older (late 50s-mid 60s) women in our 4-person office. Here's a quick rundown of the reasons I've ascertained that my coworkers hate me:  


\-I'm younger (in my early 30s)  
\-I am a parent (kiddo, age 4, who I sometimes use PTO to watch when sickness hits our household)  
\-I am going back to finish my second master's degree (I started it in 2013 but couldn't complete because of lack of internship opportunities at the time, so that's why I'm leaving now)  
\-I was formerly an intern with this agency  
\-I actually use my PTO time instead of self-righteously hoarding it and stoically coming to work when I'm sick.  
\-I am part of the LGBTQ community (but pass as straight due to marriage. Only hit their radar when I was invited to participate in a state-wide LGBTQ advisory panel for our governing state agency)  
\-I wear my hair short (see above LGBTQ comment and note that bullying worsened when I cut off my hair)  
\-I am trained and provide a service in something that no-one else in the office has training in and thus they cannot oversee or control my work for this aspect of my job.  
\-I am a genuinely nice and happy person who does not bring any of my own shit to the workplace, so I'm nothing but respectful, yet private, all the time (they claim I have no personality because of this)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there are other reasons too, but these are the main ones. It has not been uncommon to be regularly criticized, policed, harassed about my decision-making, second-guessed, belittled, and stonewalled.

This came to a head in January when, in a staff meeting, the elder bully (who had been off due to illness and I, taking direction from my director, continued my work and had to do some of bully's duties to do so) started SCREAMING at me and banging her fists on the table, telling me how terrible I am and how she will NEVER EVER have a professional relationship with me. As a previous victim of abuse, I had a breakdown from being treated this way. Many of our interactions have triggered prior feelings of my prior abuse in me, but this was overwhelming. 

As we have no HR department, I filed a grievance with the board over her behavior and, in my frustration, issued an ultimatum to the board that she should not remain after treating me so poorly for so long and escalating to this behavior, or that I would leave. She is technically my subordinate and is not credentialed to do the actual job that my field entails. I was set to be the successor to the other bully, who is due to retire in the next 8 years) and I am the only person in our rural area who is credentialed to do this job. Everything that I've done academically and professionally has been to benefit this agency and provide security to both myself and the agency.   


Needless to say, things didn't get better after filing a grievance. Now that the agency has actually terminated my position, I feel very strongly about letting the board know that their toxic workplace is driving away people like me who really, really want to work here. I could technically reapply for my job when I'm done with my internship, but signing on for more years of this--I think not. The fact that I wanted to unalive myself during all of this made me realize that my mental health has taken a nosedive since working here and no amount of financial security, convenience, or career experience is worth it for me, personally, at this time. I will move to another area in order to seek out better jobs.  


So, is it appropriate to let the board know of the extent of the dysfunction in this workplace so they can better deal with it before the next hire? Or do I just walk away and say goodbye and good riddance? I don't believe I'm getting an exit interview because small nonprofit is weird and unprofessional sometimes. Thanks in advance for any insight you may have."

Since I can remember, I’ve always dreamed of working for a MNC in a field I’m passionate about (very competitive), and took every route I could take as a teen and worked extremely hard to set myself up for this. 

However, as we know- make plans and the universe laughs, I became independent at 20 and needed a paid internship to support myself. I had applied for months with no word from my dream internships, and finally received a great opportunity in the start-up world with some fantastic mentors and the promise of growth. 

I worked with this start up through college and now work full time. I have put blood, sweat, and tears into this position, and done very well, but the entire time have known it is not the industry for me, nor my strength in anyway. They have been rather sneaky about the “promises” and “growth” that had got me into the position, and due to other recent events- I am crawling out of my skin knowing for sure I do not belong at a start up. 

On the plus side, I have great hands-on experience with almost all functions of a business as I have worn many, many hats. And specifically, have excelled in the field I want to pursue and found it’s my strength. 

However, I’ve been applying to large companies I would love to work for and dedicate my career to for about 3 months now, and have not as so much gotten an interview. My resume gets sucked into the portal never to be seen or heard from again. I would love to follow up/show my professionalism and dedication to a recruiter, but with their portals I have almost no visibility into who is viewing my applications. I have adjusted and perfected my resume about 15 times now based on research, and have gotten internal referrals- but still, not so much as an email.

I have received interviews that went very well at smaller companies, but as I’d like to get experience at a larger firm (and because future roles require experience in corporate) I’m hesitant to join a small team again. 

My strength is not in my resume, but rather my communicative skills that shine in an interview setting. 

Any advice, or tales of those who have done a similar transition, to help me on this journey?"

I'm trying everything I can to learn more about the tech so I don't feel like a complete bum once I start. I wasn't the brightest programmer during university and I actually struggled a lot but with a lot of hardwork and dedication, I managed to graduate with a 3.4/4 GPA. However, I feel like I really don't know much (I understand imposter syndrome is a thing).   


I'm currently going through Clean Code and after this I will be going through Effective Java. While reading these books, I will be watching some youtube videos about Git to learn more about it as in my projects, I really just push and pull.

  
The internship I will be doing is a software engineering role at one of the major banks in Australia.

  
The tech stack I was told i'd be doing is the following:  
\- Java

\- Javascript

\- AWS + Azure

\- Jenkins

\- Docker

We did a lot of projects in Java and some Javascript during university. Others I don't really any experience at all.

I have a few questions:

1) I’ve heard that BS doesn’t allow me to graduate earlier and that BA is the way to go if I want to finish it early, but isn’t it just the same thing? Either way, I will need 120 credits to graduate. Am I missing something?

2) I have two options: finish college in 3 years, or finish in 3.5 years. If I take that extra semester, I can have another summer internship between years 3 and 4, which I heard will boost my chances at getting a high paying job out of college (I’m going big — I want at least 120K out of college. I know it’s difficult but I figured that someone has to be that outlier, so it’s going to be me. I would also be happy with 150K or 200K, but I know how difficult that is). However, if I finish in 7 semesters, I’ll have to wait for half a year before starting graduate school. On the other hand, if I finish in 3 years, I’ll have a head start for graduate school, but I won’t have that internship. Which option is better?

3) I can choose to either have no minor, or minor in data science OR math (I can minor in anything but these are the ones I’d be willing to do). Which is the best option if I choose to minor? Should I minor? Is it worth it for getting a high-paying job?

Thank you."

One of these opportunities is my dream internship and I was interviewed for it today. I think the interview went well and I was really excited about it. But last week I interviewed for another opportunity and just now I recieved an email that they're offering the place to me. It's also a really great opportunity and kind of similiar to the one that I really want but it was kind of my backup plan...

During the interview today I asked them how long I would have to wait for the results and they said they'd get back to me within a week or maybe less. My question is, how long is it okay to wait to reply to the offer I recieved? They didn't mention anything specific. Just that they'd wish me to ""confirm soon"". I would be a fool to not take the opportunity cause it's a really good internship but I don't know if I could live with myself if I also then got offered my dream internship but had already agreed to go somewhere else. I really don't know what to do. I guess I can wait a few days but I can't wait forever. I  should probably be happy but I'm just so stressed. I've literally had nightmares about this for the past few weeks. That I get offered the other opportunity and agree to it, only to have to decline the offer from my dream job."
uu5m5i,45,2022-05-20,(25F) Do you think it's financially reasonable to move to Toronto? or am I burning away money?,KeanuReeves923,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/uu5m5i/25f_do_you_think_its_financially_reasonable_to/,"**Background**: 25F, have been living at home with my parents in South Western Ontario forever and through university (I did a business and math degree, and working towards my CPA). I've only really had short term internships in dt Toronto, which I absolutely loved as it gave me free time, explore the city, and get independence/freedom away from home to develop myself.

For the past few years all I've been doing is working or studying. I've just come to hating my life with no social aspect. Maybe it's also because of the pandemic, and having to study for my professional exam, but I don't feel like I lived a life, since in my spare time, all I prioritize is studying (university, or my exam) and then working in the day. I graduated in August 2020, and this has just been the reality of my life since 2020. I feel a lot of FOMO because I've never lived away for school, or travelled or made any new friends or grown any hobbies due to things being closed up due to COVID, or just that none of the friends I have are in town (most are in GTA/dt Toronto) and are in other phases in their life. Further, I got into a car accident two months ago (luckily no one involved or hurt, which totalled the car, so I don't even have a car right now to go out and actually do things (public transportation isn't very close to where I live). I could ask my parents to drop me off places, but you can see how that'd be an issue when it also comes to dating lol

**Career/financial position**: I paid off all my debt after graduating, don't have many expenses except for cellphone bill. I'm grateful to have been able to save literally 90% of my income last year by living at home last year (I also don't buy food or clothes or things often). I worked as a financial analyst for a job in town for a little over a year working from home last year earning 55K pre tax, but recently changed jobs and now earn 72k for a job more in finance located in dt Toronto (but I live at home and WFH still). It's demanding work, definitely not long term, but it's good experience to say the least for my age right now while I have the time and no family/spouse obligations.

**Dilemma**: Do you think it's worth moving to Toronto? I know eventually i'll have to commute to Toronto for my job once or twice a week, and the commute by train is 2 hours one way. My manager hopefully will be flexible to it, but I'm not certain. I know this isn't my forever job, and I want more work life balance, but again, it's good experience. If I move, I know i'll drop SOO much more money on rent, groceries, transportation seeing how everything is so much more expensive makes me worried on savings potential. But it'll give me time away to do my own thing and I wouldnt need a car. On the other hand, I can continue living at home, saving and working, and look to buying a new car, but that'll be an investment in itself. I will also have more to save up so that I can actually go on trips. I don't know if or how long i'll be at this job, and if, from a social and mental health perspective it'd be good to leave (seeing that being at home the past years with parents who stress me out and make me feel anxious), or whether it's just a result of all that I missed out on. Also, I'm not sure whether my current salary is even enough to survive there in Toronto!

**TLDR**: Is it a good time to rent/move to Toronto given my work is there and for my mental health, or am I better off just living at home, and changing jobs to a place that has a lower COL? As someone who is always trying to ensure savings and being financial secure for the future, seeing the impact of gas prices, inflations, housing prices go up and up, I feel so screwed, even with how my career is going. But I also don't want to ""miss out on my 20s"".

**EDIT**: I should also add that my dad sometimes puts pressure on my to buy rental property in town as a means to safeguard earnings long term, but that is going to come with a lot of responsibilities, a mortgage and so much more if I tie myself to that right now in my life and in south western Ontario. I 1000% know if I bring up moving to Toronto, he's going to think I'm an idiot, seeing how I'm wasting away money on rent, and everything."

I graduated with 0 internship experience because I had to take summer classes after transferring majors halfway through my college career. I had huge imposter syndrome after graduating despite graduating with a ~3.4 GPA and was extremely anxious, depressed, and burnt out. I applied to roughly 300 job listings after graduation and only heard back from one and was extremely discouraged. I’ve spent the last two years bettering myself by getting treated for my depression and picking up hobbies such as coding a Discord bot, learning html and css, learning piano, etc. I’ve also been working a part time job for the past year and a half. I finally feel comfortable enough in myself to start a career but I’m worried my two year gap and lack of any relative experience is a huge hindrance.  

Should I be applying to internships or is an entry-level position still possible? Should my resume still consist of software/skills I learned in college even if I’m probably rusty? Do I need to address my lack of experience and two year gap in a cover letter? Any advice you could offer me would be a huge help to me as I start to get back out there. Thanks!"

I'm 26 years old, currently a CIS student interning at a county health department in the Midwest. I'm halfway through the internship with 3 months remaining. I have one semester of college left with a 3.05 GPA but I've been on the dean's list 5 times. (Was an engineering student that got weeded out with Calc 2, which is why my cumulative GPA is 'low' ).  

**Some background**

My Computer Information Systems focuses on Programming, Database Management and Web Development. I've learned C++, C#, Java, Python, SQL, Oracle, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Bash Shell Scripting. A lot of my curriculum mentions DevOps and Agile development a lot, which seems to the paradigm now. 

My previous ""IT relevant"" experiences were my 2 summer IT internships at a school district and being a lab proctor at University's computer lab. IT procedures I'm familiar with are; computer imaging, configuration, screen replacements, answering tickets, setting up computer hardware, troubleshooting software. I have two certificates from Coursera for Google IT and Python but they aren't worth mentioning to employers.   

Currently, I answer IT tickets in the ticketing system. I add and remove users in active directory and google org. I also manage IT equipment. With everything going on in the world currently, I'm tasked with moving people's IT equipment whenever there's a hire, retire, promotion, merge. The work is fine, but I don't feel that I'm contributing much. I don't want to just coast through life, of course I still have to eat and pay rent as well. 

I'm not the smartest as I was weeded out of engineering school. I understand mathematics is fundamental to computer science and am reading books such as Paul Orland's *""Math for Programmers*"" and ""*Automate the Boring Stuff*"" by Al Sweigart. I want to improve and hone my skills.I have a strong desire to work with robotics, 3d printing, data analytics and prosthetics. Mainly I want work with robots that can improve the environment as my senior project is on tracking carbon footprints. I'm thinking about Robotic Process Automation or DevOps. 

**TL/DR:**

Need to focus and choose a career path where I can grow and contribute to the workplace and world.

**How can translate my interest and skills into a lucrative and impactful career on the Venn diagram?** 

I hope my post wasn't a mess."

Well I’m ecstatic, for the last year now I have been a metal fabricator at a company. Waking up at 3:30am, working 10 hours, Monday-Friday. It’s been interesting to learn everything over the last year but the quality of life in that position was less than desirable. So about 2 months after jointing the company, I found IT and posted in here inquiring how to break into the industry as many people do. 

I have been studying after work for probably about 3 hours a day on average just learning as much as I can about the inner-workings of IT, doing homelabs and small projects to get hands on experience. So far I’ve only got the Google IT cert under my belt and I’m studying for the A+. I planned on getting try A+ and then looking for a helpdesk job before 2023 was the time limit I set for myself. 

About a month ago one of my coworkers told me that there was an internal posting for an IT internship, I didn’t believe it. Ran over to the computer and looked and there it was. I’ll spare all the details, but I showed face to the right people, was told to put in my resume and then had my formal interview. About a week later I had the interview, it went great! I was excited but I knew there was about a month and a half before the internship started so I waited patiently. 5 weeks go by, radio silence. Then, today, I went and followed up with HR and asked if there had been any progress and I’m told my replacement in the shop was just hired! I got the internship! I start after Memorial Day and I couldn’t be more excited

A huge thank you to the people in this sub as it’s played a big part in keeping me interested and on track with my studying. I’m on mobile right now so if the formatting is weird I apologize, but I couldn’t wait to share the news"
uu6vbr,43,2022-05-20,For students that transferred to a 4-year university to complete Bachelor's after getting an Associate's at a community college : how many years did it take you to finish your Bachelor's?,Cryptic_E,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/uu6vbr/for_students_that_transferred_to_a_4year/,"So I just got my Associate's in Engineering and I'm transferring to NC State this fall to get my Bachelors. After all credits are transferred over it looks like 58 credits will count towards my Bachelor's in ME and I'll need 71 left to complete (129 total).

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping to finish in 2.5 years but it looks like my only options are either 2 years or 3 years because of a 2 part series of senior design class whose first part is only offered in the fall and second part is in the spring. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I try to do it in 2 years (Fall/Spring/Fall/Spring) I'd need to take 18, 18, 18 and 17 credits to do so. I'm not sure how hard this would be though because pretty much the only classes left are all engineering related courses. I took all my GEP electives at community college. My other option is to take an extra year and have a more relaxed and lighter coursework (\~12 credits per semester). I just don't know if I want to do 3 more years though. I didn't count summer because ideally I'd like to use that time for internships.

&amp;#x200B;

My question pretty much is how common is it to finish Bachelors in 2 years after transferring from a community college? I would've preferred 2 years but it's looking more like it'll have to be 3 years."

I discovered this sub just near the end of last year &amp; it has given me more insights than I was able to gather on my own by researching online. Now I'm in a condition where i need to ask for advice explicitly instead of going through the posts here.

I'm considering applying for the Fall 2023 cohort, I've started my prep already. I am looking to apply to MS Information systems related programs (MIS/MSIS/MISM/MSITM). My domains of interest are Data Analytics, Big Data &amp; Software Product management which I've been exposed to at my current job.

Based on my peers from college and seniors from a couple of batches older than me, I've only heard of a handful of unis with these programs like NEU Boston, ASU, UCB, UTD, CMU.

I would like to know from redditors on this sub about more schools with great programs in Information systems which don't enjoy that much online popularity. The aspects I'm primarily looking at are - 18-24 months duration, tuition fees below $30k or availability of scholarships, promoting internships rather than thesis.

I'm currently holding down a job at a bar after graduating college in December, applying to jobs all over the place and waiting for one to bite. One bit. A software company called Geacom here in Duluth, they'd be hiring me first as an intern to train me (paid of course), then re-hiring me as a full-time SE once I'm all good and skilled up.

I talked to my boss today and she told me ""don't let them get you for less than you're worth.""

""I don't know how much I'm worth.""

And therein lies the problem. I'm a 24yo recent college grad in Computer Science and a Math minor, and besides coding mods for games and being my mother's dedicated IT specialist for years, I don't really have any field experience that hasn't come from an academic setting.

I know Geacom wants to pay me a salary instead of hourly, but I have no idea what to ask for or how to negotiate. I see this as my first ""big boy job"" so to speak, so naturally I wanna make sure I'm getting a fair deal. 

Many of you I'm sure have been in this situation, in the same way that hopefully many future people will find themselves in it and maybe find this post for help answering a question that I myself didn't think to ask; How Much Am I Worth?

It was my first and only full-time work experience right out of college (only other full-time job was a Summer internship during college break) which lasted just shy of a year at 11.5 months- During that time I realized how much of a positive impact the job's remote work benefit had on my work/life balance and I really don't want to go back into an office ever again.

I'm now on the job search grind and will likely move back with my parents within the next month since my apartment lease terminates and it would be a waste of money to renew if I couldn't find a remote job with my skills/work experience. I know a lot of these jobs are software engineering-oriented, however I don't have the skills for them.

So I've done a little bit of research and have considered changing my career path by going into front-end or back-end web development via completing an online full stack development boot camp. I already have some familiarity/a head start with coding and computers having learned the basics of Python in high school 5 years ago (but haven't used since), C++ my freshman year in college, and a hint of MATLAB. I remember finding these programming languages interesting except MATLAB 😂 and was fairly good at them/liked creating things but didn't consider continuously learning them/more programming languages with how my time was taken up by other things. I'll also add that I'm an organized person with an eye for design which are factors in gravitating towards this field.

What I'm getting at is now that I have full-time, engineering-adjacent work experience, would I be a good candidate to be hired for remote front-end or back-end development once completing a boot camp and making a portfolio? Does this sound like a reasonable plan? This is assuming I don't get a remote job soon and decide to spend a few months at home completing a full stack development boot camp.

Any advice is appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Background on me:  I  worked a variety of food management jobs throughout college (Panera, Universal, etc) and then became an insurance agent shortly after graduating with a B.A. in History and no plan.   Got insanely messed up with that customer service hell scape and decided to go back to school (WGU) at age 26 for my CS degree.

  
I was blessed that I was offered an entry level role at 27 by a former coworker who was starting a small company and worked in that position as a glorified excel intern for a year before the company folded.  Then, in 2021, with 3mos left until graduation with my CS degree, I was hired on as a ""Graduate Software Engineer"" at my current place of employment- my first REAL job.  Just hit my one year mark a few weeks ago.  **I know for a fact that my place of business valued my ""soft skills"" and understood they can teach me hard skills.  I emphasized my communication and leadership experience and that's what got me the job in the end.**  


My role was created for me and the title is just that.  I was brought on to take the basic tasks of my direct supervisor so he could be promoted and take on more advanced things.  At this stage, I have a couple tasks that I am solely responsible for that are 100% proprietary at my company.  I change various things in some of the Javascript scripts I work with, but I'm talking like swapping colors or changing URL values.  


Maybe a summation of my responsibilities is that I click these buttons when this person has this problem.  My fear is that I don't really know what I am evolving into though.  I'm not a software engineer as I don't WRITE code, just mess with someone else's.  I have written 2 or 3 basic scripts to make calls to AWS, but nothing resume worthy.    


I am thinking about how to make the next move in my career and beginning to prepare myself and I'm just not sure what I need to be doing...I don't really like writing code.  I think I'd be a good team leader and organizer and what not, but my issue is that I'm not too sure how to advance my skills for another department or company when I work with so much proprietary info.    


Here are just some helpful things:

\- I work in Salesforce clicking buttons to upload new things to make our emails go out with the right template

\- I REALLY enjoy SQL and would like to know about some paths down that road - maybe in data science

\- I don't think I have the brain for coding - I can follow it, but don't enjoy it; totally willing to do it, but wanting to see if there are other options

So, if you were me, what would you be doing to make yourself more marketable as an employment prospect to a company and what would you call yourself?  I can give more details as needed.

uuaw08,1,2022-05-20,Need Advice: should I reach out to my old employer/mentor?,ChintasticTruth,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/uuaw08/need_advice_should_i_reach_out_to_my_old/,"About 6 months ago, I gave in my notice to my old job. This job was the first job out of college and I was hired after being an intern. In totality, I’ve been with my small team for 6 years. 

They’re all much older than me (27M) and they were really nice. They were all women too, so it felt like I had a lot of moms. They taught me a lot about my job and helped me move forward. But 6 months ago, I decided it was time for me to move on. Can’t be at one job forever! I gave a 4 week notice because our team is niche within Finance. They countered with a promotion and huge salary raise, to which I declined. 

I start my new job and at first, I didn’t like it so much. My former boss gave me a call to check in and I told her and said I’d consider the promotion. I didn’t verbally accept it but said I’d consider it given the terms that were once promised. However, after much thinking, I realized I should stay at my new job. Not wanting to waste their time, I emailed my boss and said something along the lines of “I apologize, but I decided to stay.”

She was, of course and very appropriately so, disappointed. It was a mistake on my end for sure even though I never formally accepted the position. My other “mom” texted and said that I had let down a lot of people and burnt a bridge with the company and it’s people. That one hurt. But I understood. She vouched for me and I made it seem like it was her fault in a way. I apologized once again. 

I was wondering, should I reach back out to them? Not for a job but to reconcile? They were really a pinnacle team of people in my career and they’ve done a lot for me so it feels wrong to just burn those bridges."

I have literally no preferences on what I want to do, I just want some kind of internship in the CS field for the expierience that I can put on my resume. This includes anything from helpful books, to websites, to important languages, or even just popularly used ideas like object orientated coding in python. Anything is how I would find someone who is willing to give a highschooler an internship. Is linkedin a good place (obv I will do everything after parents consent). Thank you all for help."
uucem3,25,2022-05-20,The Pumpkin Question,leoofalexandria,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uucem3/the_pumpkin_question/,"  

“Time’s up John.” I try always to make it my clandestine mission to shut the Casio timer I’ve set for 60 minutes off before the 80’s style alarm rings. I don’t want the patient to hear an alarm signaling the end of their session. They know they are paying for my services, sure, but there’s no need to have such an abrupt auditory end to it.

He scoots up on the couch, using his elbows to move to a sitting position. John wipes his eyes and blows his nose with the same tissue he’s been using for the entire session. As with most sessions, he seems relieved (in a good way,) and thanks me. I say the pleasure is all mine as I always do. And I genuinely mean it. Funny that about 90% of my clients choose to lay down on the couch I have in my office. I never tell them to. I have two very comfy-looking chairs (in my opinion) for their sitting pleasure.

But I understand. I didn’t have to go through over a decade of schooling to understand that when people are laying out their deepest fears, insecurities, pains, and uncomfortable truths, that they don’t always want to look at a stranger when doing so.

I shake hands with John, and he’s on his way. He’s doing well. I cannot disclose what he’s here to talk to me about of course, but he’s come a long way. I can disclose this to MY therapist, Dr. Long. The idea that a therapist needs a therapist is somewhat of a cheeky joke, but I can tell you that most of us absolutely do have our own psychiatrists. It’s a career that I absolutely love and have a burning passion for. Something I’ve always wanted to do. But holy Chimichanga, I’m going out of my Mind-A if I don’t talk to someone about other peoples’ problems. And I get to put my own personal issues out there as well.

Twenty minutes north of a drive in my solid RAM truck and I’m at Dr. Long’s practice. It’s always a pleasant traverse. I work in the city and he’s just on the outskirt of said city. I guess that’s “making it,” when you can have your own private practice in a more suburban area closer to your own home. By the lake. Don’t get me wrong, I’m more than happy for him and he absolutely deserves it. Not only is he my therapist, he is my mentor. He helped me through school, advised me on my thesis, and then agreed to personally see me every Tuesday and Thursday. Not many mentors will do that. He’s even given me the “family discount,” for our sessions. Which is just full price. A joke, I guess. I’ve never got it, but one day I am sure I will. 

On my drive I happened to notice a door with a black cat Halloween decoration on it. “Happy Halloween,” it plainly said. The cat’s face was very grumpy. Ala Garfield, I’d say. I suppose this was the joke, as cats aren’t happy about anything. Nothing out of the ordinary, but.. it’s August. August 1st, specifically. No one puts Halloween decorations out early. And no one keeps them out after. It’s the one holiday that I’ve seen where decorations come the hell down on November 1st. Halloween is the kickoff to the holiday season but it’s like we want to move on to cheerier turkey and Santa related holidays as soon as spooky season is done.

“Hey Sport!” Dr. Long shouts. I almost fell down the three steps leading to his practice. I was so engrossed in the off-season Halloween decoration that I didn’t even realize I was already standing outside his office. 

“Sh-shit, I’m sorry Dr.” “I was just spacing out.” I shook my head, trying to focus up on my therapy session. “No problem at all my boy, you always had some issues focusing at the task at hand!” With this, Dr. Long lets out a huge belly laugh. He knows I graduated near the very VERY top of my class. I was certainly no slouch. Speaking of Santa from before, this guy resembles him to a T. Especially when he laughs. Younger though, his long hair and beard still have a good amount of brown, but they are quickly losing the battle to the white hair army. He’s of course a big man also. The first requisite to being a Santa doppelganger. It still makes me chuckle that it’s more accepted if you are overweight as a Doctor if you are in any field of Psychology than if you are a physician, general practice, or even a surgeon. I know that even I take a pause when I’ve been treated for minor injuries or getting a physical when I see a fat Doctor walk in.

The session goes as it always does. I unload what’s been on my mind from my own clients, and then I tell him what’s been bothering me lately. Usually, it’s working through parental issues. Standard stuff.

It went well. I never get to emotional, just want to shed the bit of weight of what I’ve heard from my current sessions. I don’t know if other therapists have this issue but sometimes, I just have to tell someone the crazy things I’ve heard. And I can’t ethically do that to anyone else in the world. Unlike my alarm clock method, Dr. Long has the hour session down to a science. I can tell when the time is just about up when he takes his glasses off. Unlike the majority of my own clients, I don’t need to lay down on the Freud couch. 

Sitting on the brown leather chair, more uncomfortable than it looks, I start to rise to my feet. “You uh.. want to talk about the pumpkin thing Terry?” I stop myself from cracking an awkward smile. “No.. not this time Dr.” He smiles politely. “I told you Terry, we’ve been colleagues now for a couple years, you can call me Kyle.” I smile back and nod, shaking his hand. “Next time, Dr. Long.”

My real name is Tortoise Maclemore. Odd. I know. My parents were hippies, short answer. Still are, I suppose. They followed that Hindu thinking that the world is on a turtle, or Tortoise’s back. I hated the name as a child. I couldn’t shorten it to Tort, that sounded even dumber. The closest thing I could think of was Terry. Even as a 10-year-old I tried to make that stick, and it did. My parents won’t call me that, but everyone else does. Maybe one of the reasons I went into the medical profession. I wanted to be as far away from their whacky hippy ideals as possible.

I flipped my desktop calendar to October 30th. Less than 20 hours until my least favorite holiday. The whole month of October has held some stress for me. People go nuts during the 10th month of the year. They dress up like ghosts and evil people. They put pumpkins on their stoops and lawns. They cut into the oversized fruit with glee, carving wicked faces of all kinds. Illuminating that face with fire. I guess I associate those damned fruits with some of the worst times of my life.

When I was finishing up my undergrad in Central Michigan University, Fire up chips, I was robbed and beaten pretty badly outside of my dorm room. Just a few years later, as I was finishing my doctorate at PENN state, I was suspended from my internship doing research at the children’s hospital. The official allegation was that some nurses felt uncomfortable around me. To this day I’m not sure what that means. I profess my innocence to this day and never did anything of ill-will towards anyone. No one went missing if that’s what you’re asking.

To take it back to childhood, I got lost inside of one of those mirror mazes when I was about 11. It was at the county fair, during Halloween of course. It seems silly now, but I was really panicking. I could not find my way out of that demon maze. All I could see was myself over and over and over again. The lights kept dimming. My parents.. I don’t know where they went. Probably getting loaded with their dumb hippy friends. I somehow found my own way out, hyperventilating and puking my little 11-year-old guts out. I think I’ve determined this is the moment I wanted to explore how fear and emotion affects us. Being a psychiatrist was the perfect career goal.

Even with my history of awful Octobers, I still don’t know why the pumpkin makes me feel so terrible. Even with a Doctorate in Psychology and Psychology I still don’t have a definite answer. I was never touched inappropriately by a pumpkin as a child as far as I know.

Fascinating too is the term “Jack O’ Lantern.” There are no other names that fruits go by. An apple is an apple, unless candied, I guess. A watermelon is a watermelon. But when a pumpkin is given a carved-out smile, we call it a Jack O’ Lantern. There are a couple different schools of thought as to the origin of this. One is that the early Americana Revolutionaries carried pumpkins with candles inside, making it a cheaper alternative to actual lanterns. The other is that some guy called Jack was taken pity on by the devil. When he died, he was neither accepted into heaven, nor granted access to hell. The devil allowed him to roam earth with his prized turnips. Lighting them to guide others. Weird, I know.

Another session with John. Halloween. He’s doing much better. He’s accepting his upbringing with his parents. It wasn’t as bad as he’s imagined.. “Time’s up John.”

I decided to walk home. I enjoyed the smells of the nearby lake. I thoroughly loved the way our trees have changed into fire-like colors. I didn’t wholly love the kids with pumpkin t-shirts but.. I’ll let that one go.

The jack o lanterns are rotting. It’s time to put them to the curb. It’s December, after all. It’s.. December?

I called Dr. Long. No answer. I left a voicemail.   
 “Hey Dr.-.. Kyle. It’s me. I’m seeing more and more pumpkins. I don’t know what the hell that’s about. I know it’s October and all but.. I think.. no, it’s almost Christmas. Why are there pumpkins still around? I need to get into this with you finally. Text me back when you can fit me in.  Before our usual appointment.”

I’m sitting here in my modest ranch home. Sipping a Canadian Whiskey backed up by a white claw. Girly to some but comforting to me. The nurses at the Penn State children’s hospital loved them.

A knock came from my front door. Metallic in sound. I quickly put my drinks away, don’t want to have that out to see for whomever may be at the door. Oh good, it’s only Dr. Long. Kyle.

“Um.. Dr Lo-. . Kyle.. what are you doing here.. at my home? He smiles his familiar St. Nick smile. Full of warmth and acceptance. He lets himself in, taking a seat in my dining room. He slaps his knees and then motions for me to sit next to him. I do as he motions.

I stared at him for a moment. Probably too long to be called a moment. “You wanted to see me, Terry.” I shook my head, coming back to the here and now. “Um, yes. Yes, I did. I’ve been having some real issues lately. I don’t know why this has gotten worse.”

“What’s gotten worse,” he slowly spoke.

I gave him a look that said you know what’s gotten worse. “The pumpkins, Doc. They’re all over. Usually after Halloween they’re gone. I don’t even know what happened. Yesterday was Halloween, today is almost Christmas Eve.”

He pondered. He crossed his legs, his corduroy pants causing friction that I hoped wouldn’t start a fire in my home. Who wears cords anymore? “Well,” Dr. Long pondered, stroking his brown-ish goatee. I think you can’t comprehend what you’ve done to elicit these pumpkin-demons quite yet. You have to tell me what happened, Terry.”

I squinted my eyes. “What do you mean, what I’ve done. You know me better than anyone. Not even my stoner parents know me as well as you do.”

He laughed. Not a scoff, or an impolite laugh. A laugh that was comforting. He played like he was on my side. “Terry. Tort. Tortoise.” He took a deep breath. That’s the only thing you haven’t made up. I get why you would hate that name.” My blood started to feel like it was slowly freezing. I couldn’t understand why.

He continued. “Most people, men especially, blame their parents, mothers especially, on any little issue that finds their way into their lives. Before I continue, I’d like to ask you one question. Is that ok, Terry?” Again, my eyes squinted, and my nose scrunched in confusion. “Of course, it’s ok,” I stated.

“Ok good.” Dr. Lugo uncrossed his legs and took the “teacher’s stance.” Leaning forward, elbows inside of his thighs, hands clasped underneath his chin. Crazy blue eyes staring at me.

“What happened to those nurses at PENN, Terry.” 

He of course gave me no response, as he’s done every time that I’ve asked this question. I’ve been assigned to interview Mr. Maclemore since his incarceration, and subsequent transfer to the Forensic Center. I had no issue traveling the extra 100 miles every week to see him when he got moved. It’s truly fascinating.

“One more time Mr. Maclemore.. Where are the bodies? You loved them, didn’t you? Or did you feel like they were making fun of you, disrespecting you, making you feel worthless?” I have not gone quite this hard on him yet. His reaction is impressive. I can see the rage under his face, but he keeps his calm. My notetaking is interrupted by a knock at the steel door behind me. Visiting is over, even for professional visits.

“Anything Doc?” the Hulk of a correctional Officer known as Bill asks me. He’s one of the long-time C.O’s here. Seen a lot of criminally insane. “Nah, Bill, same as always.”

I hand in my visitors pass and get my court-ordered paperwork time-stamped on my way out. 

After our initial interview I saw how much he wanted to become a psychiatrist. He was not too far away from that goal. I thought it might help if we indulged his desire and let him pretend that he had led a different life after the implacable “Penn State Nurse slayings.”

Terry’s trial will be starting in about 11 months. It will start on Oct. 1st. A trial of a man charged with pre-mediated first-degree murder. A trial that I’ve tried to prevent. He is guilty. That, I am sure. But he didn’t pre-mediate anything. I don’t know why yet, but those damned pumpkins coinciding with the entire month of October did something to him that we might never know. He’s got a fantastic mind. He regales me with his weekly “sessions,” of his patients. Truly a fantastic mind."

Can DM for more details but I basically gave a scenario where my fuck up resulted in us pushing close to the deadline so I had to fix it. He said if it happened often and I said something like ""This is our 2nd project together so the first one was messy too"" So it pretty much showed I didn't learn... despite me saying in the original answer I did the same approach to future projects. First project was just 3 people not knowing how to code in the language, but I don't think he realized that even though I said we still weren't used to it by the 2nd project (looots of Googling for libs)

I also didn't feel comfortable with my interviewer. He seemed like an overworked dude who was trying to get through his daily checklist, but I can feel a lack of interest from the start (why was I even invited T\^T not that he had anything to do with it). He wasn't an SDE and didn't work with interns so I guess that's another thing. The flow was weird since he just let me talk through the entire STAR structure and had his follow ups go back to the start of the scenario. (edit: I don't mean to make the guy sound bad, he just seemed worn out on a morning at the end of a work week LOL)

I did what felt like a lc easy and went over the time. He even let me ask questions after. But yeah, he let me finish the problem and we were 5-10 min over time. I just felt so bad about it so I was the one who apologized for going over.

Guess I'll solidify my fall quarter classes 😴😪"

I just graduated from Columbia with B.A in Computer Science. I am going to take a year break and then apply for master of comp sci program at UC Berkeley and Stanford. As of now, I started working for Datadog as a software engineer. During school, I did internships as a software engineer at Wells Fargo, Johnson and Johnson, and Tesla. Also I was a teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics. What worries is my gpa which is 3.2. Do you guys think that I still have a chance to get in? What do you recommend me to do next one year to strengthen my application? 

None of them require GRE; so do you guys think taking it would help? 

Thank you."

uufzud,0,2022-05-21,Is internship experience in other countries helpful for international student landing jobs in US?,TeaRed86,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uufzud/is_internship_experience_in_other_countries/,"Hi redditors! I will be trying to describe as precisely as possible so I can get accurate feedback.

**My Backgrounds:** I'm now doing my master in Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science. I had a summer intern experience for 2 months in China, and now my advisor wants to refer me to Japan for 6 months to work as an intern in the company's research center. (Both of them are not my country).

**My Plan:** After finishing my master in my home country and the internship in Japan, I'll go to US to do another degree, which is a master of engineering. This programme will take me about two semesters to finish, first semester to take courses, and the second one to do internship. After graduation, I will try to find a job in US.

**My Problem:** 

1. I'm not sure how helpful the experience of internship outside the US is?
2. After finishing all things I mentioned above (two years master in my home + 6 months in Japan + 1 year in US = 3.5 years), I will be like 27 years old. Am I too old for starting my first full-time job?

Thanks in advance!"

uuhiom,2,2022-05-21,What does it take to get into a top MS CS program?,T10-,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/uuhiom/what_does_it_take_to_get_into_a_top_ms_cs_program/,"Hello! I'm a freshman at a US top 40 public university studying Computer Science. I plan on attending grad school for a MS in CS after my undergraduate. I am a first-gen and so I don't have guidance for most career/academic things which means I had ZERO clue on how difficult undergrad admissions would be and was super unprepared to face so many rejections. So I hope to ask you guys some questions in order to be more prepared this time! (Plus, I'm an international student so planning years ahead is quite important...)

For context: I'd like to think I'm currently doing fairly decent for my first year. I've been an undergrad RA at a neuroscience lab assisting with Python coding since August 2021 (so it's not CS research, but it's what I could land), but I hope to find an actual CS related lab this Fall/Spring once I feel I am ready. I will end my first year with a \~3.8 - 3.9 GPA. I will be doing an embedded SWE internship this summer at a F500 scientific instruments company. I hope to land big tech / quant firm internships for summer 2023.

**Questions**

* What does it take to get into MS CS programs at schools like CMU, Stanford, etc.? And how do these expectations differ from non-thesis to thesis-based MS CS programs?
   * GPA? Extracurricular? GRE? LoRs? Research publications? Industry internships? Research experience? What do they care about the most?
* I also have the choice of going down the path of doing my school's BS-MS program (4+1 years). However, I'd like to attend a stronger/elite CS program for an MS. Do you guys think this is worth the extra year? (without considering finances).
* What are the best MS CS programs (non cash cow programs)? Thesis based? Non-thesis based?
* If you were to repeat your undergrad, what would you do differently and why? What do you wish you had known prior to applying for MS CS programs?
* Any general advice?

Thanks!!!"

These are the career paths im interested in, in order, though honestly mle and DE are pretty close together to the point where they should be tied. 

1. MLE
2. Data Engineer
3. General SWE

Im pretty sure I would like to pursue an MS, as it seems it’s necessary for stuff like MLE, but also I’ve heard that it would accelerate career progression, and it only takes a year to complete (maybe 1.5 years if I decide to move a little slowly). I am considering graduating from undergrad a year early so I would still be spending the normal time in college, just graduating with a masters. 

In the fall, I’m going to be entering my third and final year, graduating with a degree in CS (BA) and a minor in either statistics or data analysis (probably DA), which of the three masters programs do you think would be the most beneficial for my possible career goals?

1. MS statistics 
2. MS computer science (this one seems the most practical, and also fairly interesting) 
3. MS data science (this one seems the most fun/easiest) 

I’m currently leaning more towards MSCS because of the greater career flexibility it would afford me in comparison to the DS masters, but what are your thoughts? They also all cost relatively the same.

Also, would I still qualify for summer internships for summer 2023 if I intend on graduating spring 2023 and doing a masters after? I currently do not have any internship experience which is unfortunate, and dont think I can get one this summer as it’s too late, unless I grab an unpaid internship.

Thank you guys for the input!"

uuigbu,1,2022-05-21,College student feeling lost when trying to work on my own,asdfjkgd,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uuigbu/college_student_feeling_lost_when_trying_to_work/,"Hello all,

I felt motivated to write this post because I’m at a point in my education now where I have to get serious about trying to find internships.

For some context, I just completed my second year of college meaning I have completed the “core” classes (intro to programming, ds &amp; algorithms, etc.) and can take a more selective approach to my upcoming semesters.

In these core classes, I feel like I have definitely gained a good basis of computer science. I’ve been exposed to a number of different languages including Java, C, Ruby, OCAML and a bit of Rust/Assembly. Because of this I figured that it should be no issue for me to apply what I’ve learned into interesting projects that I can put on my resume, however I am finding that this has simply not been the case thus far.

When trying to actually build something on my own, I feel completely lost. In the vast majority of the “projects” or homeworks I’ve been assigned in my classes so far, we’ve been supplied a template or skeleton for the project we’re supposed to write, or largely guided descriptions, which I feel gives an opportunity to practice topics but isn’t very helpful to the way I learn in general.

I think while I understand the basic concepts of programming, I don’t fully understand how to combine them to make something on my own without being provided a skeleton with already titled functions.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? If so, how did you overcome it? Are there any tips or areas you all could direct me to actually start building something on my own? 

I’m feeling super stressed as I currently have no notable projects or experience on my resume to set me apart from other applicants, and with a busy summer planned with a summer class and other commitments I would love to start working on something soon.

Maybe I’m just overthinking and should start with something small, but even coming up with project ideas is another issue.

If you read this far, thank you so much! Any feedback would mean the world to me. :)"
uuin3n,61,2022-05-21,"I've got an admission into a good US university for MS CS , but the cost is too high...",Alex55936,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/uuin3n/ive_got_an_admission_into_a_good_us_university/,"Hello everyone! I'm in a serious dilemma here. I have recently got an admit from a good(although not very good) US university (UT Arlington)  for MS in CS for fall 2022 term. A little background on me, I've been preparing for this for almost past 4 years. But now that I have finally received the admit, I'm having second thoughts.


 There are mainly two reasons for this. Firstly, the total costs for masters is going to be about 45-50 Lakhs . Now this is the worst case scenario which is assuming I don't get any assistantships or scholarship or neither any internships during the masters which could reduce these costs significantly. But I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for the worst case scenario which is 45 Lakhs loan at 10.5% interest rate. A Little more background on me - I come from a really weak financial background, my father is just a  just earns about 40k per month. Also he has no savings as most of it got used recently in some construction work.  Now for the past 1.5 years I have been working as a sw developer in a service based firm and have savings of about 4Lakhs. And that's all we have. Although my father is ready to take 10 lakhs from his PF,  which I really don't want to do but I don't have any other option . If my whole family pushes too hard then we can probably manage to get by with the Loan. But our condition with be extremely vulnerable as my father's monthly earnings will be spent paying interest of my Loan. 


Sorry for this long rant, but here is the thing, on one hand If a get a good job in the US(anything above $70k or 50Lakhs)  after masters then all is good , I will payoff my Loan in 3 years of OPT and if I get H1B extension then will also save a lot . But If I don't then all hell will break loose on the whole family. I've calculated and it comes to about 50k payment per month for 15 years . So either I get job quickly in some years or end up paying more than 2 times the Loan amount over the span of 10-15 years. This is totally nightmare stuff which is actually keeping me awake at night. 


The second reason for my dilemma is that if I drop the plan for MS then I can continue my current job and comfortably switch in some time and eventually land a good paying job here in the next 5-6 years. This situation is much more comfortable although not as much lucrative as the best case scenario in the 1st situation. 


What is your point of view here? What should be my best course of action now?

I request you all to provide some suggestions, advices or insights. 

Thankyou in advance!!"

I'm a french IT student, soon going to enter my fifth and last year and will obtain my diploma at the end of it.


I never liked IT, and by that I mean I never wanted to study in it. But as a teen, people (and my parents) were always on my back telling me that whatever I wanted to eo would never work out and to either be an IT engineer or a doctor. I never really had a choice.

I went for the IT choice since it was the one which seems to fit me the most, and I somehow managed to get to the fourth year of this very pricey school.

Now, looking for an apprenticeship or an internship is so heartbreaking. No one wnats you unless you only live for IT and has worked on so many stuff or are a master at what you're applying for. No one wants to teach you anything and no one has any kind of sympathy for students.


Now, I wonder if its a thing that you can only find in IT or is it a common thing? It's very honestly making me depressed to the point of a burn out, it seems so meaningless. It makes me so hateful, I feel like ive wasted at least 4 years of my life for nothing.

It was my first and only full-time work experience right out of college (only other full-time job was a Summer internship during college break) which lasted just shy of a year at 11.5 months- During that time I realized how much of a positive impact the job's remote work benefit had on my work/life balance and I really don't want to go back into an office ever again.

I'm now on the job search grind and will likely move back with my parents within the next month since my apartment lease terminates and it would be a waste of money to renew if I couldn't find a remote job with my skills/work experience. I know a lot of these jobs are software engineering-oriented, however I don't have the skills for them.

So I've done a little bit of research and have considered changing my career path by going into front-end or back-end web development via completing an online full stack development boot camp. I already have some familiarity/a head start with coding and computers having learned the basics of Python in high school 5 years ago (but haven't used since), C++ my freshman year in college, and a hint of MATLAB. I remember finding these programming languages interesting except MATLAB 😂 and was fairly good at them/liked creating things but didn't consider continuously learning them/more programming languages with how my time was taken up by other things. I'll also add that I'm an organized person with an eye for design which are factors in gravitating towards this field.

What I'm getting at is now that I have full-time, engineering-adjacent work experience, would I be a good candidate to be hired for remote front-end or back-end development once completing a boot camp and making a portfolio? Does this sound like a reasonable plan? This is assuming I don't get a remote job soon and decide to spend a few months at home completing a full stack development boot camp.

Any advice is appreciated!"

Summer 2023 will be my last Summer as a college student, but I've yet to get an internship. I really want to land one, but more specifically, I want to land a one leaning towards the big side.

I'm talking relocation paid for, traveling to the office, and netting me damn near $20k for 3 months. And of course the experience of getting to work in my field of choice. Not neccessarily some huge Amazon/Google/Microsoft type of thing, but a new environment, generous pay, those types of bells&amp;whistles.

I intend to go into front-end development, web dev... whatever that means. I'll be getting into more depth courses in my next few semesters to find out what that really means and if its what I want.

I'll take the experience and money anywhere, but things like financial or medical tech just don't interest me as much as creating user-facing apps and the like.

I am confident in my interpersonal skills, but want to start hammering down the technical skills. I've taken a Data Structures and Algorithms class, but was a few months ago. Retained some vague ideas about things like BFS/DFS.

So the big question for me is, how do I start? Besides attending career fairs, asking around my professors, using my university's materials, what do i need to **study**? For the field that I'm interested in, what's most relevant to interviews? I've only done one technical interview before, and I was unable to complete the question provided, however much I communicated the steps and thought process that wasn't enough. 

I'll have a lot of time to prepare for searching out an internship, using the time from now until I start applying. I want to be 120% sure that I will walk into Summer 2023 interning at a company that'll prove a great experience, a nice resume builder, and well... keep me from being broke. 

Now what?

uuthg1,169,2022-05-21,Today I graduate.,SirProsper,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/uuthg1/today_i_graduate/,"For those who think they can’t do it here is a little motivation. For some backstory, I was a transfer student in the Fall of 2018. I got my Associate’s in Computer Science and was in a program that guaranteed me admission to UMD. After I completed community college, I found out that only my general education classes transferred over and none of my CS classes did. Hearing this news was devastating, but also partially my fault for not double checking the transfer requirements. This was one of my first setbacks because I knew that if I wanted to graduate in two years like my initial plan, I knew I would have to take classes every single semester (fall, winter, spring, summer).

As a transfer it was hard adjusting to the new college dynamic. Even though I had friends that already went here. It was harder to make friends and join existing friend groups since most people had established friend groups since freshman year. Since I had all my gen eds transfer, I had a lot of space in my schedule and wanted to try out different classes that seemed interesting. This however, backfired. Taking the classes that I found interesting ended up being time consuming and challenging which ultimately made my grades suffer. 

While at community college, the classes I took didn’t require as much effort as they did at UMD. During my first year I didn’t realize how much effort and time I had to put into my classes (major and electives). After my second semester I noticed my GPA was dipping and I was getting concerned about my grades. I decided to go visit an advisor to see what I could do about my grades. This wasn’t very helpful to me because rather than telling me that it was best to withdraw (which I didn’t know was a thing at the time), I should try to pass the class. This caused my GPA to drop below a 2.0 because I could not keep up with the course work. So, I was put on academic probation.

Knowing I was on academic probation, I knew I had to do everything possible to bring my GPA above a 2.0. Unfortunately, it was one of my heaviest course loads having to take CMSC216, CMSC250, and MATH240 (alongside a few extra credits to bring up my GPA). I attended office hours every day and joined a study group to help keep me motivated during the semester. Unfortunately, I fell short and failed CMSC216 which caused me to be put on academic dismissal. 

During Winter 2020 I learned about my academic dismissal and tried contacting advisors more information but received little to no information causing me to feel more depressed and helpless. I wasn’t sure on what to do anymore or who to contact for help. All of this caused me to feel the lowest I ever felt, I could hardly leave my room most days and completely shut myself off from everyone. As a first gen Asian male there is this stigma where failure isn’t really an option. So, it took me months to tell my parents about being kicked out of college. Although, my parents were disappointed in me they still encouraged me to finish my degree. 

During my gap year of Spring 2020 I looked into the different ways I could reapply to UMD. Over the summer I decided to apply to reinstate. After waiting for two months and countless emails I finally got my acceptance. After receiving this I knew my mindset and the way I approached schoolwork had to change. I promised myself that I will graduate and not let my parents down again. I knew that I wasn’t going to graduate with my class of 2020. But I still wanted to graduate ASAP because I was the oldest and had younger siblings, so I needed to graduate to help financially support my family.

My first semester back I retook CMSC216 along with a few electives to help boost my GPA. With my new mindset I was able to bring my GPA above a 2.0 and even made deans list. I found studying habits that worked best for me (see advice section). Since I was trying to graduate as soon as possible it required me to take courses every single semester including winter and summer for the next 2 years. There were times that I doubted myself and really wanted to give up. But I kept reminding myself that I needed to graduate not just for myself but for my family as well. 

Fast forward to my final year, I still managed to make Dean’s list every semester and started applying for full time jobs. Since I was taking classes during the summer, I wasn’t able to get an internship to put on my resume. To make myself a competitive applicant I did side projects in my free time to build up my resume. I kept applying to jobs throughout the semester until the start of the Spring 2022. I’ve done over 50 applications and finally got my first job offer. It was good enough, so I accepted it.

I managed to keep that promise to myself and made my family proud. 

After 6 long years today is the day, I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s some advice I learned through these years:

* Always start any assignment or project early. I forced myself to get into the habit of starting my assignments the day they’re assigned. You’ll be surprised at how much more free time you’ll have.
* Office hours. Use it. The thing with starting assignments early office hours are empty at the beginning so you’ll pretty much have 1 on 1 with the TA’s.
* If you’re in a class that you don’t know anyone in, be proactive and ask people in the Groupme if they’re down to make a study group. That’s how I met mine and helped me throughout the years.
* Don’t be scared to talk to people in your class since they’re in the same boat as you. They may end up being your closest friends by the end of college.
* Make sure to take breaks, but make sure you hold yourself accountable. An example would be I would do an assignment then give myself an hour to play video games before starting another assignment.
* Take advantage of easy electives. If you know that you’ll have a difficult semester and you’re worried about dropping in GPA, offset it with easy electives.

**TLDR**: Transferred to UMD from CC and none of my CS classes transferred. Struggled my first year and got into academic probation and fell short the next semester and got put into academic dismissal. Mental health took a toll and had to take a gap semester and changed my mindset. Applied for reinstatement and grinded for two years to graduate as soon as possible taking classes every semester including winter and summer. Graduated with a full time job offer lined up. I wish I could have told myself everything would be okay 2 years ago.

uutzty,346,2022-05-21,PSA: what should you be doing during your CS degree?,EngineeredPapaya,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uutzty/psa_what_should_you_be_doing_during_your_cs_degree/,"Hey!

So I spend some time over at /r/cscareerquestions and I've been seeing a lot of resumes for new grads that are basically empty. They just have a projects section which has their homework projects from various classes listed. Its really concerning to see that CS students seem to just go to class and take tests.

So I just wanted to raise some awareness and let you know about all the options you have available to you *while* you are a student, so that you can take advantage of them and graduate with a resume that will get a lot of callbacks. **Once you graduate you will no longer have access to these, so make sure to do it while you are still in school.**

As a student at a university pursuing CS, you can participate in the following:

* **Lab Volunteering**: Most CS labs need student volunteers to do various technical things. Once you get to know your professors, you can ask to volunteer at their lab if you are interested in their research. You can usually turn this into a paid research assistant position very easily since professors always need research assistants.

* **Research Assistantships**: At most schools, if you get to know your professors well, you can get yourself research assistant positions at their lab and work for them. It's usually available to undergraduates and often a paid position, but this will vary from school to school. It's a great opportunity to learn a lot about a specific niche of computer science (depending on what the professors research is in), and a great experience to put down on your resume.


* **Teaching Assistant/Tutoring:** It's usually available to MS students, but some universities allow undergraduates to be TAs as well so you should definitely ask around. You can also get a job as a tutor for specific classes, so look into that for your university. Being a TA or tutor for your beginner CS course from freshman year is a great experience to put down on your resume.

* **Co-Ops**: Most universities should have some Co-Op program for CS students. They are usually overseen by a professor and your engineering/department advisor will have leads. At my school, you would get credits for doing a co-op so instead of doing 2 electives you had the option to do 1 co-op and get 6 credits for it. Definitely do it if offered by your university!

* **Internships**: The majority of internships are available to degree-seeking students exclusively. I don't really need to explain how important internships are. Your university might have a program to match you to internships or might have career fairs where companies come in and directly recruit students into internships. All of the above experience will pad your resume enough to make you desirable for internship recruiters. Someone who's resume only has homework projects will get passed on for someone who has a research experience, was a tutor, or volunteered at a professor's lab.

* **Clubs/Orgs**: Most universities' engineering departments will have chapters of various CS focused orgs (IEEE-CS, ACM, MSDN, etc.). Volunteering at them as an officer can be a great experience, and they often have engineers from various tech firms within their network come in and give talks, and it also serves as an opportunity to network with these companies and get your resume directly passed to their recruiters.

* **Hackathons/Programming Competitions**: The orgs or CS focused clubs mentioned above will usually host programming competitions and hackathons at your school. There usually also are larger state-level competitions with multiple universities participating, depending on your area. You can grab some of your friends and participate in them. Getting top 3 at a hackathon or competition is more impressive on a resume than making the Dean's List.

* **Networking**: This one isn't as corporate as it sounds. Just be friendly with all your classmates and you'll naturally become friends. Make connections with your classmates, co-volunteers, your professors, and advisors too. You're going to make some of your best friends in college, and they will go on to work at great companies too. I can basically skip to the phone interview at any of the companies my friends work at through a referral. I can reach out to my old professors and get referral letters very easily if I decide to pursue a MS or PhD. Don't be a loner, software engineering is a team sport!



So basically, if all you are planning to do during your BS in CS degree is go to class, study, and take exams: it's not worth it and you will have a rough time getting that first new grad job. When you are paying for a degree, you are paying for access to all these things which ensure that when you graduate, you have a lot of collective experience and are a much more desirable candidate than your peers who have whitespace resumes. Most of your internships will also turn into a full-time offer if you perform well, so you can have guaranteed employment upon graduation.

I didn't go a big tech school, just a public school in Florida where FAANG didn't even recruit from directly. I worked part time throughout college as a math tutor and then a tutor for the intro CS courses. I was vice-president of our local IEEE-CS chapter and organized a lot of events and workshops for all the members. I participated in most of the hackathons and programming competitions my school had and even did a statewide competition. In my sophomore year, I started volunteering at one of my professor's lab which did AI research, and eventually got hired as a research assistant junior year. Through my engineering advisor and another professor who I knew, I joined a co-op program where I built software for a local company. Through the career fair on campus I secured an internship, and received a return offer afterwards. I graduated with a 3.4 GPA but that didn't matter.

I'm not saying you have to go and do all of these, but you should try to do 1 or 2 of them just to learn more and for the fact that it will make your life easier.

I hope all this information will inspire to do things other than going to class and taking tests, and lead to me seeing more impressive new grad resume's on the resume review threads!"

I have taken some Computer Science classes in java at school but am not an expert by any means.

Google CSSI: Google CSSI I believe is four weeks and is online and designed for rising freshmen and I think the stipend is about $1500-$200 for 4 weeks. It is every day for 4 hours 9 am-1 pm and I believe it is project-based and teaches Javascript/HTML/CSS and other cool stuff. It would be fun because you get to work closely with Google engineers.

Microsoft Discover Program: Microsoft Discover Program is also for four weeks but is in person at the Redmond Office and is also designed for rising freshmen and I think the stipend is also very close to Google CSSI. It is also project-based with other people in the program. I think this is a bit cooler because you are physically at the Microsoft Campus and would definitely be a fun experience.

SWE Internship: This company is online and would be a regular full-time internship intended for college students (Junior-Senior) so I do feel a little underqualified. The pay is around $25 an hour and is the entire summer about 2-3 months. The only problem is the internship program is not as well defined or established as Google or Microsoft but the pay and on job experience would be cool.

uuvuuw,2,2022-05-21,my queer female friend is concerningly obsessed with yaoi and mlm relationships,No_Net6496,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/uuvuuw/my_queer_female_friend_is_concerningly_obsessed/,"I (16M), have a school friend who is very into k-pop and yaoi manga.

I’m pretty sure she has an asian-fetish with the way she is focused on east asian men, k-pop idol looking ofc. I’m not sure if she would actually only date asian men, but she surely takes way more interest in them and acts like others aren’t even an option. 

She reads a lot of yaoi, I once asked her if she reads actual bl too and she said she yes, but most of the time it is purely centered around sex. 

The amount she talks about the stories she reads or even k-pop ships is uncomfortable, she can’t really read the room when it comes to her talking about it and if you talk to her she will sooner or later resort to that topic. So you can’t really escape the topic or avoid it as I try to mostly.

As a partly-asian gay person, it has gotten really weird for me over time.  I’m only 25% asian and don’t really identify with it because I grew up pretty white, but apparently I’m asian-passing and I’ve either gotten people constantly ask me which asian country I’m from, or just some kind of racist comments/jokes. 

She is bisexual, but honestly that makes it weirder to me sometimes. It’s right that, queer women sexualising gay men doesn’t make it any better. I think she has a preference for women and apparently she reads gl too, but she never talks about it and doesn’t act nearly as obsessed over it. 

It doesn’t make it better that since yaoi is japanese, it combines the asian and gay fetishisation. Reading it is ok but it feels so, like being put away I suppose with the way that it’s only two cis japanese guys having sex in some toxic setting and there’s barely a storyline or any love. It’s just poor and toxic stories all along, and it’s just kind of sad.

Another moment which I felt a bit weird about was when there was this new asian intern at our school, a lot of people thought he was really hot but it was kind of weirding me out that after finding out his name they kept calling him „the asian guy“. 

I don’t really say anything when she talks about it, because I’d kind of rather just stay out of it. I kind of always really disliked girls who were overly into yaoi, it wouldn’t be a problem to enjoy it, but there’s a lot of fetishisation from those people. They kind of just make me feel intruded and a bit disgusting about myself, and I feel like they don’t even get it. If they’re so much into it they can read it in private.

I think no one wants to bring up that her behaviour is actually kind of problematic, and neither do I a lot. 
I know that, it would be better to tell her bc you’re supposed to educate people on problematic and racist behaviour, and in a way it also kind of is my responsibility to speak  for the communities I belong to. 

I just don’t really feel thrilled about having to be the one to do that, kind of especially bc it involves me, and I also don’t want to hurt her feelings (which sounds a bit stupid), so I’m not really sure how to do that.

I don’t think she’s actually someone who wouldn’t understand and I know she wouldn't end up actually being homophobic. So this is why I’m not cutting her off etc., also really not feeling like that in the last 2 months of school before graduation. I posted this to just, put it somewhere I guess. Basically I think she actually is a decent person but kind of poorly educated and a bit oblivious to certain things, but with potential to change that.

any advice on how to politely confront people with this?"

I've had conflicting answers (both here and by professionals) regarding whether or not a 3 year CS degree (QC DEC) will produce the same job opportunities than a CS bachelors. I'm currently an intern in a startup in MTL (Blockchain related) and have a job lined up as a Java dev in June. But even then, I still hear and get comments about still needing a Uni degree to reach the right salaries.

For context, I just graduated with a 3 year CS Cegep degree (DEC). The program essentially builds a full-stack and I genuinely feel confident with my coding abilities.

I'm very conflicted, circumstances in my life have forced a very real need for money and if I were to go to Uni, it would have to be part-time. I'm just not sure if it's worth the time (Salary only perspective).

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any insight? I would really really appreciate it."

Still on my finals week at the moment and really concerned with what I want to do after graduation. 

I’ve been in a poor mental state since covid hit and I have been meeting a therapist since the start of this year and those issues have really tanked my GPA. We use the UK grading system but i guess my current GPA is 3.3/4? This might become lower with my exams really taking a toll on me.

Anyway, I’ve been job/internship searching in industry and have had 2 interviews so far and I don’t think I impressed the recruiters. For further context, I have no relevant internship or work experience hence why I am very unconfident in finding a place in industry.

I’m thinking of pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics might be a route for me (if we don’t factor financial reasons).
I am quite passionate about data and analysis and find programming really fun. I even took a data analysis elective and enjoyed it much more than my core classes. Possibly looking into universities in Malaysia because i’ve enjoyed by 2.5 years here.

What do you guys think? Would pursuing a Masters right after Undergrad is a good idea? Is continuing my search for  experience much more worthwhile?

I was able to do an internship for a year and a half with a big company in the industry I want to work in but I had some concerns. The work life balance was not great for the full time employees that I worked directly with and the work, while new and interesting at first, became monotonous after a while. I left the company, still interested in the industry, but not fully interested in the full time positions they had shown to me that were available. In that time, I accepted a job with another company in the industry, very small, but more oriented with what I want to do. It is one of my former companies competitors. I was supposed to start Monday but it got pushed back a week(I caught covid). On Wednesday, I got an email from my former boss congratulating me on graduating and letting me know there was a position available within the company. One that is of interest to me, and would also be good for my career as it is more of a mid-level position. He said respond if interested.

My immediate reaction was to just ignore the text, as I have already accepted a job and start soon. The more I think about it the more I debate. I am excited to start with the new company as it is smaller and I should be able to get my hands on more sooner. They also offered me higher pay then the other job would. But I guess I am naturally scared of the unknown. With the other job, I would be working with the same people i did at my internship, but under a different boss. But it would be hard to turn down another job a few days before I start.

I thought about responding to my former boss and letting him know that I did accept another job but I may be interested in other jobs in the future. But I am afraid this will look bad for a few reasons: it will seem like I have one foot out the door at my new job and I don't know how the former company will react to me working for one of their competitors.

What should I do in this situation?

TLDR: accepted a job with a new company, set to start next week and was informed by a former boss that a position is open that I have interest in. What should I do?"

I am expecting to graduate with a Bachelors in Information Technology specializing in IT Management/Administration on Summer 2023 along with a Minor in Cybersecurity. Currently, my only certifications are the A+ and some Cisco Networking Academy Certificates (Network Fundamentals and Cybersecurity).

For the past 3 summers (about a years experience combined), I have been working as a summer IT worker for the school district I graduated in (Pay is $9/hr). I was mainly helping with imaging and upgrading equipment across different campuses. I am doing it again this summer and this time it will count towards an internship credit for my degree. So far, I like the work environment for this district (not too heavy of a workload, campus locations are near where I live, Mon to Thurs only on Summers) and have a good relationship with my superiors and co-workers.

However, the pay only starts around $40,000 a year but the benefits are great according to a former classmate that works there. My plan was to apply for a full time campus technician position if there is an opening when I graduate (the district is expanding and opening schools).

I was wondering if it was worth considering private sector IT positions for higher pay in case no positions are available in the district when I graduate (I can use my co-workers there as references). I have seen posts here of people getting burnt out in private sector positions and I am also concerned about the potentially longer commutes.

**UCLA (Linguistics and CS)**

Pros:

\- Westwood &gt; Champaign imo

\- Better overall prestige

\- More flexibility in changing major

\- Better access to internships due to location (?)

\- Family members live close by

\- Slightly prefer the culture of UCLA after the super intense high school years I've had

Cons:

\- Big one - not as well regarded for CS

\- Potentially harder to get into MS/PhD programs in computational linguistics (?)

\- Further away from my family (from NY)

\- I know 0 people who go there

**UIUC (CS + Linguistics)**

Pros:

\- Well-regarded for my major

\- More practical CS program

\- Really strong recruiting

\- Potentially better for applying to MS/PhD programs in computational linguistics (?)

\- I know quite a few people who go there

\- Cheaper

uv3dxs,833,2022-05-22,FROM A CONCERT COMMISSIONER at ASUCI - Summerlands,AnakinSkywalker2331,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/uv3dxs/from_a_concert_commissioner_at_asuci_summerlands/,"**TLDR: ASUCI students did not cancel Summerlands, the school’s professional staff canceled it over fixable and preventable concerns. $200k and hundreds of student hours down the drain. No in-person concerts have been allowed to happen since February of 2020, which is a disgrace. We need an engaged student body that fights for genuine student control over the time/money we have devoted to UCI. If you are a student interested in taking further action please reach out to me and let’s strategize; we need all the support we can get from you right now.**

Dear UCI Student Body,

I am one of two ASUCI Concert Commissioners and I want you all to know the truth that **THE CANCELLATION OF SUMMERLANDS WAS COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE**, and why ASUCI professional staff and the structure of student government, not individual students or commissions, are to blame. This story is not intended to get tears and hugs from the students, but rather to give you all an accurate understanding of what really went on behind the scenes throughout this year-long ordeal. I hope that you all can channel your anger towards the UCI governance structure as we proceed with some sort of student measure to hold the administration accountable.

**My Intro**

I have wanted to join the ASUCI concert commission since freshman year of APAD and finally got the opportunity to become an intern last year. This year I was interviewed to become a co-commissioner/co-head for this branch, and have co-led it since last summer. I’ve met incredible people like my co-head and commission interns who have taught me so much about building a strong work ethic, and I became more passionate about concerts as we put more time into planning them. Before this year, I felt a similar yearning for concerts to be better, especially during the first year of COVID, and I had believed that ASUCI was apathetic to student concerns when things went wrong. Unfortunately, I realized that while imperfect, the student leaders of ASUCI do not hold as much power in decision making at UCI as it may seem.

**APAD - First Conflict**

My commission came into this fall incredibly excited about facilitating APAD for the student body, the first irl concert in two-years. We were going to help bring back the live music scene and help the student body connect with each other again. As you all know, the year started quite scary, with students coming back to campus infected and spikes in the virus happening around SoCal. APAD had been planned for Welcome Week, but the under the infuriatingly limited paramaters the school imposed upon us, we knew that the event would quickly turn into a super-spreader event. Despite the concert heads’ pleads for social distancing and mask requirements, our VP at the time was unwilling to work with us to make the concert safe, suggesting that we cram upwards of 5,000 maskless students into one big crowd to intermix for multiple hours. After multiple exhausting fights with him and a not so supportive team of professional staff, they finally allowed us to postpone the concert to the beginning of Winter Quarter, so that it could happen in person. We then spent much of the fall quarter re-planning the entirety of the event. January rolled around and to everyone’s surprise, a new spike in omicron cases caused Winter Quarter to be virtual for the first few weeks, forcing us to make APAD virtual. We were absolutely heartbroken by this situation imposed upon us, but we  tried to work within our restrictions to add some interactive components to the event, including meet n greet opportunities, q&amp;a, etc. All of which seem simple but elements we had to fight hard for.

**Racism and “House 949”**

There was supposed to be a NEW  concert slated for the middle of Winter Quarter dedicated solely to hip-hopcalled “House 949.” Our team poured a lot of effort into building this entire event out from scratch and were very excited to be putting this on for the student body. During this planning process just a few months before the event,  the full-time adult staff of ASUCI informed us they could not approve any of the artists we selected and cited racist reasons for doing so. Invoking how the Shocktoberfest floor-seat hopping incident was incited by a Black hip-hop artist (without recognizing how they limited floor-seats by a huge capacity compared to previous concerts), they used phrases that insinuated that the hip-hop genre brings a lot of trouble to our campus, how artists had to be approved through UCIPD, there was a longer vetting process for artists of this genre, and expressed disturbing concern for the types of crowds this genre of music  may bring. The list goes on. This debate was also happening around the time the Astroworld tragedy took place, which made it easy for administration to allege that all hip-hop concerts end up like this. At one point after fighting back, they had us write down two sentences per hip-hop artist to justify why they weren’t “problematic.” No matter what we did to fight back, they decided this concert wasn’t going to happen because of “safety.”

**Sabotage from our Student Services Vice President**

From summer to winter quarter, we were also forced to endure [a corrupt and emotionally abusive ASUCI Student Services Vice President named Joshua Ma](https://www.newuniversity.org/2022/02/07/asuci-vice-president-of-student-services-joshua-ma-resigns/) who mismanaged the planning of successful events for everyone. He put us through a lot of hardship by being manipulative, power-hungry, disregarding and undermining our work, spreading rumors about other ASUCI members and attempting to pit us against each other, etc. He was also the reason a lot of our events were canceled or postponed, due to poor planning on his part. It was not uncommon that he would say he would do things, not do them, lie about doing them, and then force us to pick up his slack, forcing us to scramble. After the other commissioners in the student services office finally came together towards the end of fall quarter and recognized how unfit he was as our leader, we put together an internal review, demanding him to resign to enable an ASUCI SSVP responsible to the student body.

Despite how damaging his leadership was to us, we continued to push forward to put together a good Summerlands for all of you, our last chance for an in-person concert before the end of the year. We worked diligently to ensure the success of this event for more than 5 long months. This concert was very restrictive in terms of budget, as Joshua had [siphoned $120,000 of the money from concert comission right before he left office](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/s0vj1h/article_on_asuci_election/hs4s6nv/). We were not thoroughly debriefed/educated on this transfer, and neither was the senate. We believe Joshua Ma had transferred this money in retaliation for us forcing him to resign. As Concerts Commission bore the brunt of his abuse, our testimonies were instrumental in removing him, thus why this retaliation would make sense. We hoped to use this fund towards Summerlands to secure more for the students or maybe even better artists but pro-staff believed this money that was allocated for the winter concert did not need to be put towards Summerlands because they said our budget already had enough money to accomplish a good concert. We did not want just a good concert, we wanted the best concert possible with all the funding possible to make up for the past virtual ones.

**Summerlands Planning**

Desite the limitations we for Summerlands, we incorporated new elements such as a 4 artist lineup, ASL interpreter, and new ADA-approved accommodations to make sure as many people as possible could enjoy it, whether they knew the artists or not. Finally, we had secured a very well known artist for the headliner (I can’t expose their name due to NDA, but they are quite popular atm), only for them to drop out of the event two weeks before the event. By then, we unfortunately only had limited options to secure a headliner, a process that takes a couple of months. Throughout the entire time I was in this commission, we were never given information on artists’ contracts or why they often sign them so late (days before the event) but we always had a feeling we were being deceived because we had seen other schools releasing line-ups much earlier than just a few days before the event.

**SUMMERLANDS WAS NOT CANCELLED BY ASUCI STUDENTS**

Coming in to Summerlands yesterday: It was finally happening! we secured a new headliner and all contacts were finally signed.We were able to release the artist to the public a few days before the concert. Despite the thousands of negative comments from many of the students, we were relieved we would even be able to have an in-person concert again after the thousands of hurdles and limited budget.

Nervous but excited, we came to the venue on the morning of the event bright and early to set up, prepare goodies for attendees, add last-minute details in, etc. We quickly got alarming news from one of the pro-staff members that because of the drizzle of rain the night before, they were thinking of cancelling the event. I took it very lightly at first, thinking there would be no way a whole entire concert with [a little over $200,000 budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18nR-rod3OZOzYOYjNgE1oQS2wdmCH2u3kAr0qSUWFuY/edit#gid=0) would be cancelled. Yes, the stage was absolutely soaked, and some of the stage equipment were damaged, but we assumed that ASUCI professional-staff (who are responsible for the stage logistics, and students are not allowed to participate in this process to hold them accountable even if we had tried) would take it upon themselves to force the external logistics vendor to figure out a solution by the show’s start. We continued with our day trying to finish every possible detail of the event. At around 11 am that morning, my co-head and I got pulled into the office and informed that the show had been cancelled and we could do nothing about it. We froze in utter shock and fear…

After processing what we were hearing, we went to speak to one of the pro-staff members, who explained their completely illogical rationale to cancel the event. We pleaded with them, showing that the weather forecast showed no rain expected for the rest of the day at all. He looked me right in the eyes and informed me that the decision had already been made by the directors and that it was thesafest thing to do. After trying to argue back, I was on the verge of tears right in front of him while he told us we needed to draft an email to the school. My co-head and I left the room sobbing and feeling helpless. I called another staff member just to be told the same thing again, and the director who was the ultimate decision-maker was not in sight or reachable. Students were not consulted, only told the news after agents and everyone had already been contacted. The concert was cancelled without our consent.

Shortly after, professional staff attempted to force us to set up a booth outside to distribute merch to the students, something we did not have the mental capacity to do while sobbing and trying to process. My commission’s year-long work, the $200,000 budget for the concert, and all of the UCI student’s eager hopes were disregarded and thrown away by the professional staff in an instant because they didn’t want to “risk” equipment getting damaged by the potential rain (which we knew wouldn’t happen, and didn’t happen). The worst part is that the professional staff could have just looked at the forecast a few weeks ago and ordered rain-proof equipment, but instead they cheaped-out and allowed for equipment that shorted out in the drizzle. They could have protected the stage from rain better. There are specific members on the ASUCI professional staff who have displayed an absolute inhumanity and self-service that has enabled the mistreatment of my commission, locked students out of critical decision-making, essentially lit hundreds of thousands of student fees on fire, and then in the end tell us the concert could not have happened due to some very limited liability concerns of equipment getting damaged in the rain.I am furious because this was unfair to every single one of us on campus and ABSOLUTELY PREVENTABLE.

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day, students are the face of this office to the rest of the school, but I wish more people knew what type of abuse of power goes on behind the scenes, and that professional staff actually run a majority of the show. The concert commission does get to help pick out artists, the amenities that students receive, the marketing direction, etc.; but the logistics and actual setup of the event is mostly managed by professional staff. I get 80 dollars deposited into my bank account every 2 weeks while working 15+ hours per week towards concerts, just to be given no choice in the final outcome. I understand student frustration, but it is very reactionary for students to continue to blame commissioners for a “failure of leadership” without recognizing we don’t have control over many processes at UCI, Summerland’s cancellation included. **I hope this post clears it up for you all.** In order for students to actually get the events they deserve, we need more decision making power at ASUCI. There is nothing that morning that would have made us want to cancel an event we put our blood, sweat, and tears into for so many months had it not been the administration who forced us to do so. If we had more control over funding priorities, the show absolutely would’ve went on. This was something taken away from all of us, and I hope students start to direct that blame on to the people who get bankrolled by our student tuition, do not care about following through with events, exploit their student workers, and turn around and put us on the face of it all to deflect the blame every year. Go ahead and talk to the ASUCI professional staff (there are some very wonderful people on the staff who tried their best, but the leadership is rotten), and you will see that they really do not care about us and always defer to the UCI leadership at the top.

**Call to Action**

I want to apologize for you all only getting this critical background now, but please remember that UCI has an oppressive governance structure that represses any sort of dissent against their self-serving rule. The students deserve so much more than a few dollars refund for no in-person concerts this year. Although the concerts commission is hurt by the avalanche of negative comments, we recognize that students’ frustration has been misguidedly pointed at ASUCI students rather than the root cause of the problem, ASUCI professional staff. There are no hard feelings between us and students, hopefully you all can channel your anger towards UCI as we proceed with something to hold the administration accountable. I hope people finally understand the truth so we can take appropriate action, and I dream of building an engaged student body that pushes for actual student control over the time and money we pour into this campus. I call on the student body to push for some platform of radical demands that fundamentally changes the governance structure of ASUCI. **If you are a student interested in taking further action please reach out to me and let’s strategize; we need all the support we can get from you right now.**

uv6c9g,0,2022-05-22,"Do I have enough standing to sue for Medical Malpractice, or any other legal action, against a former psychiatrist?",SummerTimeRain,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/uv6c9g/do_i_have_enough_standing_to_sue_for_medical/,"This is in Texas.

This happened in 2019. I have since learned that what I was experiencing was withdrawal from xanax, which I had been taking daily for 4 or 5 years. I moved to Texas and didn't find any doctors that would prescribe it. I did have one PCP that gave me half a script to help ween me off of it. I called my doctor that prescribed it in Illinois and she filled a couple scripts and then said I needed to find a doctor out where I lived in Texas.


I moved to Texas on New Years day to open a new store. I worked at a previous location and they opened this and I wanted to move so took the opportunity.

Everything was fine, until about March 2019. My anxiety SKY ROCKETED. I am diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder. I thought my anxiety and mental illness was just getting worse. I did not realize xanax could cause withdrawals.

I worked as a sales associate. My only job was talking to people for 8 hours, 5 days a week. My anxiety got so bad that every conversation would give me anxiety attacks. Before I would trouble some times with people I didn't know, but was perfectly fine with people I knew and was around a lot. I couldn't talk to anyone anymore without panicking. Hoping and not hoping they would or wouldnt see panic on my face and maybe stop talking. Knowing that after I finished helping one customer, there was another one behind them. I was going sometimes days without sleep. If I was having a good couple of days, I was getting 3 hours of sleep each night. Literally taking 28 pills of benadryl just to pass out, and it didn't always work. I was having uncontrollable body tremors.

I went on FMLA leave for 3 months. First month I went to an out patient psychiatric unit. Learned coping skills, tried medication, getting to the root of the issue and fixing it. I thought my mental illness was just getting worse and I wanted my life back under control.

When you are done with the out patient program, they hook you up with a psych and a therapist to see. The psychiatrist I got I really only saw for 1 minute at the end of each visit, as he had a intern that primarily delt with me. She would talk to me, go to him at the end, and then come back and tell me what's up. He was legally required to see me even for just a minute and usually it was just bull shit 30 seconds of nice to see you again. From what I can tell, the intern would do a lot of the work and knew what she was doing, and then would double check with the main doctor, and get approval for stuff.

My 1st mistake was saying I used to do drugs. That I was addicted to pain meds and quit it and I stopped messing with drugs.

My 2nd mistake was telling them I took kratom. It keeps me from drinking. It's not a ""drug"" drug, and makes me not crave getting high on other things. It mellows me out. I am a huge advocate for kratom, I have taken it daily for years, I know without it I would be on drugs or drinking every day. It helped somewhat with my anxiety. If my anxiety at the time was an 8, it brought it down to 7 or 7.5. Not much but it helped somewhat.

My 3rd mistake was going to my first visit with an unopened bag of CBD and telling them I wanted to try it. That I heard it can help with sleep and anxiety and stuff. That it's made from weed but IT WILL NOT GET YOU HIGH.

They made me see the therapist and for a whole hour made me list every drug I tried. How old was I? How much did I take? When did you have your first alcholic drink, what was it? What was the dosage.

I am so proud of myself. I have been sober since 2016. I don't do drugs. Don't smoke weed. Have 2 or 3 drinks A YEAR. They started treating me like a drug addict. I NEVER abused my xanax script, and took it as prescribed.

First questions every psych visit was ""Are you still taking kratom? Are you still smoking weed?"" I HAVN'T SMOKED WEED IN 5 YEARS. IT WAS CBD.

They absutely refused to give me any kimd of benzos. Never was it brought up by my psychiatrist that I was potentially going through withdrawals. Nothing they gave me worked. I would come back in and they would just double the MG.

They told me it was hard to treat me because I was taking drugs, and while I was on drugs, they can't establish my baseline anxiety level.

They knew I was on xanax for 4 or 5 years. How will they establish my bodies baseline while I quit benzos cold turkey?

They put in my charts I have an addiction problem.

They also put:
Marijuana Dependency: Severe
Krarom Dependecy: Severe


I bought like the smallest serving of CBD you can get and tried it once. It did nothing noticeable for me so I never bothered buying it again.

Last year I got back on an antidepressant that I first tried with this psych. The first time it was given to me because it would help me sleep, espically mixed with hydroxizine. Which is basically xanax but its really benadryl. An antihistimine. This combo should have knocked me out. It did nothing to help my sleep.

Trying the pill again last year it completely made me pass out no matter how hard you fight it.

The only time withdrawals was brought up was by the therapist, who on one occassion said it sounds like I was experiencing PAWS. Which is a type of withdrawal. So I asked him, I am going through this horrible time in my life, maybe because withdrawals, and you still refuse to give me xanax. Not even to stay on it permanatly. Just help ween me off and alleviate my withdrawal symptoms. Just so I can at least feel better for a little while.

He gave some BS answer about not needing benzos and to get over it without them.

After a couple months I gradually, slowly started feeling better. I still don't know if all the symptoms are gone or this is just my regular anxiety now.

I went without work for 3 months, and needed the doctor to sign paperwork so I could be paid my wages during my time off. It was over $3k. I was depending on it.

She told me ""I talked to (Main doctor), and we agree that it's not fair you get to stay at home and get paid for getting high.""

It was kratom and CBD. Both legal. Kratom is not a drug you would want to take to get high. The other one... it's CBD....

I am going through a bankruptcy that would have been preventable with this money.


Since this whole ordeal, I have heard stories about xanax withdrawals. Done research on it.

Xanax is a drug you can't stop cold turkey. It can cause seizures, tremors, insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks, psychosis, permanant neurological damage, and even death.

From what I have read, this is one of the worst drugs to quit, especially in the way I did. It needs to be monitored by a doctor during the whole process.

I asked the doctors, can I go back on it, until we figure this out. My symptoms are so severe my life is falling apart. I can't sleep, I can't focus, I can't talk to people. I have constant, hour long anxiety attacks. I can't work. I am worrying every moment I am awake.  I can't live my life with any resemblance of normality.

Even if the plan was eventually to stop taking benzos, I was fine with that. But could I take it in the meantime.

They were very firmly against it and said it was because I was taking drugs and ""smoking weed"".

I believe the way these doctors treated me, mainly as a drug addict, that they did not do their job correctly.

At the time, I did not know it was withdrawals. The psychiatrist never told me of this being a possibility.

A psychiatrist should be able to get me as a patient and say, ""Ok, he was taking xanax daily for 5 years. All the symptoms he are reporting are clear and classic signs of withdrawal.""

And:

""I don't want him to stay on benzodiazipines, but we can't let him just stop this medication the way he did, it is extremely dangerous. We will need to ween him off of them and carefully monitor his situation.""

Instead, they gave me Hydroxazine. An antihistamine with mild anxiolytic properties. And Propranalol. To stop my body from shaking when I got anxious. Along with testing out different antidepresants.

After 3 months, well one, I had no money and needed to return to work. But also my symptoms lessend to a degree. Still had trouble sleeping, talking to people was still hard. The worst symptoms were over but other ones still persisted. After going back to work, I wasn't able to stay on for a full year. I just couldn't handle customer service anymore because I had no control over my anxiety anymore.

I am sorry for such a long post. I just felt I should add everything I thought was relevant.

After doing research on benzodiazapine withdrawals, I can state with certainty that that was what I was dealing with.

It is not my belief these doctors took me seriously as a patient because I was upfront and honest about my past issues with drug use, and as such, treated me like an addict, despite me also being upfront and honest about being sober for years.

I feel so lucky I didn't have seizures or permanant brain damage, at least to my knowledge. That I didn't die or need hospitalization.

Quote from an article about withdrawal:

""The abrupt discontinuation of Xanax can result in life-threatening withdrawal reactions. If an individual stops taking the medication cold turkey—without appropriate tapering—it can result in seizures, severe confusion and disorientation, and death.11 Medically managed detoxification allows medical professionals to supervise and support an individual as their body rids itself of the drug and other toxins safely and as comfortably as possible.""

https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/xanax

I want to take legal action against this doctor.

I feel he was negligent. Did not take into account withdrawal, did not notify me that discontination the medication could have severe negative affects on my body, both temorary and permanant. That he did not have my best interests in mind, and showed shocking lack of understanding.

As a doctor, he should have monitored and helped ease my discomfort during a medical emergency.

My whole experience with him just left me feeling that he thought. ""He used to abuse drugs. I will not prescribe him anything with the potential of abuse.""

Is this medical malpractice? Is this something else? Can I pursue legal action against him? Assuming everything I have stated is the truth (which it is), will this have a chance of making it to court and winning a case?

Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read this, I know it is a lot. And to anyone that can offer any advice or insight, thank you so much, too."

uv7xab,4,2022-05-22,losing friends because I don't act the same as before?,Usual_Initial_4548,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/uv7xab/losing_friends_because_i_dont_act_the_same_as/,"Not sure if I'm the only one experiencing this: For every new 'stage' that I'm going into, I tend to become disconnected with the 'friends' I made in the previous stage.

I think a big part is because my mindset about study, work and life has undergone very drastic changes compared to my peers. I went from being someone who spent much time at dance classes (so making a lot of friends there, who didn't care much about school and grades), to being someone who is competitive about grades (thus stopped going to dance classes and making friends that are smarter at my high school). But at the same time this meant that my friends at dance did not understand why I coul give up dance so easily after doing it for 10+ years, so they stopped talking to me.

Then I got myself into law school, whereas my high school friends mostly got into medical school (For those wondering, I'm from Hong Kong so we can study these uni degrees directly after graduating high school) 

Perhaps because of the competitive nature of law school where people are always about  who got a better gpa or a better summer internship offer, I became much more competitive and anxious myself. But for my high school friends in medical school, they are kind of guaranteed to have a job after graduation because of the shortage of doctors we have over here, so they can just basically pass their exams. 

So after I've turned down a gathering invitation in my freshmen year (I explained it was because I was too beaten up by finals and wanted to have a break, they never invited me or talked to me again for 3 years).

There are other instances with my other friend groups, but basically every time when my mindset/ values/ life approach changed from when i befriended them, I would be 'ditched' because I don't act/ think the same.

Has any one experienced this too? Am I  being too unpredictable?

TLDR: my friends don't talk to me because I don't act/ think the same as I used when we first met."

uv9opy,0,2022-05-22,my crush rejected me twice and i feel really sad,DizzyPen1006,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/uv9opy/my_crush_rejected_me_twice_and_i_feel_really_sad/,"so there was this guy that i really liked, he’s quiet and very handsome. We had a few classes together and I finally gathered the courage to talk to him the last week of school. This was my first time ever trying to flirt w someone and my friends were all encouraging me to just talk to him. 
Not even 2 minutes into the conversation he mentions his girlfriend, then goes to the bathroom and doesn’t come back until the bell rings so he doesn’t have to talk with me. I can take a hint and I knew he wasn’t interested. 
Fast forward 1 year later, it’s the end of the school year and i see him after school. I developed a crush on him again and really wanted to talk to him, maybe he isn’t still dating his gf?? I tell my friend to SNEAKILY look over and see the guy, she makes a huge deal and raves about how cute he is and how I should talk to him again. She means well and i LOVE her, but because of all the commotion she makes he ends up looking over cuz the two of us are being really obvious. 
She kept pushing me to talk to him since he was alone, but I got scared and I had also just finished playing outside so I was red and sweaty. i didn’t want him to see me again for the first time in a year looking that way. so i PROMISE myself and my friend that i’ll talk to him the next day, which is the second to last day of school. 
My friend and I plan how I’m going to talk to him for the entire period. but when I see him in the hallway after getting out of class, I got really nervous again. My hands were sweating, my heart was beating, I was turning red, and my voice began shaking 😭 I really didn’t feel like i could talk to him without making a fool of myself so I backed down. 
my friend really hyped me up, so this time i was seriously going to talk to him the next day. it’d be the last day of school AND i’m graduating, so if he rejects me then I don’t have to see him again. 
I was FINALLY ready to talk to him again and he didn’t come to school. I was so distraught and really regretted not talking to him before. 
Well another friend of mine finds his instagram, and it turns out that him and his gf broke up. so i bite the bullet and text him. I tell him that I’ve always thought he was rlly cute and would really want to hang out w him in the summer. I was really nervous but in a good way, and really looking forward to his response. I frantically checked my phone w every notif thinking it was him responding. Well, it’s been more than 2 days and he hasn’t opened the text. I don’t think he will 😞 I just feel really heartbroken because I’d rather be rejected by him then ignored. And i also don’t know if i made him uncomfortable by trying to flirt w him the second time. And I also can’t help but wonder why he doesn’t like me? 
i’ve tried to get into a relationship multiple times and it still hasn’t worked out. I almost feel like a higher power is intervening which prevents me from getting into a relationship 😞

1st crush: he texted me first and we had really fun conversations. My parents found out and took away my phone and put me in homeschool. Then texted him acting like me, telling him i’m not interested and to fear God.
2nd crush: the guy i made this post about, this was 1.5 years later after the first incident. it took a lot out of me to talk to him because I was really traumatized by how my parents reacted w my first crush. 
3rd crush: i was in a summer internship w him, so i texted him after the internship asking if he’d want to hang out some time. He responds the next year telling me he didn’t see my message, despite being active on instagram. 
4th crush: he rejected me cuz he’s gay
5th crush: a coworker of mine, and i fell HARD for him. then one day he mentions his girlfriend because he was talking abt having kids w her in the future. It was rlly hard for me to get over him, and when i finally did, this happened. 

Another thing abt me is that I’m hijabi, so it’s possible I make men uncomfortable w my head scarf. but the only reason I wear it is so I can hav a place to live and not argue w my parents. I just feel really sad because it hurts to be rejected and I just want someone to give me a chance. 

TLDR: I’ve been rejected multiple times by different guys and it’s really messing w my self esteem."
uv9p1u,7,2022-05-22,Help planning for the future considering current state,Stasky-X,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/uv9p1u/help_planning_for_the_future_considering_current/,"A bit of context: I've been working in my current job since I graduated 2 years ago. I'm a sysadmin in a local newspaper at a city 1 hour away from Barcelona.

My boss has been my mentor and honestly a friend, I did my Computer Engineering (programming focused specialization) uni internship there and then I stopped for a few months to focus on finishing uni and then my current boss phoned me personally to tell me if I want a position, since the at the time sysadmin head of dept was leaving (my boss is the boss of the whole IT section and head of programming). His plan has always been clear to me, to learn under his wing and eventually be the head of system administration.

The job is honestly super comfortable: my boss and colleagues are great and my schedule is really good. My job is ""Sys Admin"" but I also automate, program and am free to suggest any changes or ideas I have in mind.

Every other week I have on-calls. Week of on-calls is Mon-Fri from 13:30 to 19:30 (6 hours) at office and then on-call at home until midnight (weekend on-call at home included). Week of not on-call is from 9 to 4 but only Mon-Wed. Which means I work at the office only 8 days every 2 weeks. Apart from that my company offers more than 40 paid vacation days, which means I have a lot of free time, and the pay is okay (28-29k after taxes which will be 36k after taxes once I'm head of dept.). The vacations I can take them whenever I want, so I sometimes use 3 of those days to get Mon-Wed of non-on-call days and get a free full week. This is obviously very comfortable.

According to my boss I'll be head of dept in 2-3 years time if I continue learning as fast as I am. And apart from that, he's giving me some freelance projects of his too (web/app dev for now) for some side income at 25€/h.

My question is, considering the great comfort I'm at, idk if it's worth to look for things elsewhere. I know the free time will be unbeatable, but I wouldn't mind working more if the pay raise would be substantial and the work would be interesting enough. Reading things here, I feel like I won't be able to find anything in Spain that'll be worth it for me, because salaries are pretty low in general, so I've been looking elsewhere and found out about SRE jobs (I was looking for a programming job which could benefit from my experience as sysadmin). Looking around, Zurich and Dublin seem to be the best places for that (at least Google), but I've heard the pay isn't that huge compared to the cost of living in those places and doesn't leave as much as it seems after taxes and all.

Here, once I'm HoD I'll have around 1800-2000k spare after rent keeping my current benefits of free time and vacation days. My questions are:

- Is my conclusion wrong? If so what countries should I focus harder on? I have a huge interest in UK, Dublin, Nordic countries and now that I've read about it, Zurich.
- I'm looking to search for jobs (for now SRE at Google or Meta are priority) to see the market in a year or so... What kind of programming jobs could be interesting to me (I'm not a fan of front-end web/app dev in general, huge fan of scripting or programming code other than designing things, don't know how to explain it) if not SRE and how would I prepare for the interviews?
- If I were to stay at my current job, what's the best way to find side income/projects? Since I have time I'd like to find interesting things to get some money out of it, if possible other than web dev.

Thank you all and feel free to ask anything if there's something not clear."

Pros:
+ Free tuition due to financial aid offered 
+ 5 mins away from my house 
+ Vibrant campus 
+ Much more renowned 
+ I get to study something different from my diploma

Cons: 
- Not a fan of CHS’s core curriculum (Science isn’t my strongest subject) 
- If I somehow find out I don’t like polsci, my next choice major is CNM, but I’m not the biggest fan of their course structure 
- Graded internship that is a bulk of your GPA
- FOMO because I’ve been a high scorer through poly &amp; apparently people like me get the biggest culture shock coming into uni. I might be hella demoralised.

NTU

Pros: 
+ I get module exemptions (3.5 Years)
+ Would prefer to have classroom opportunities/projects where I can add to my portfolio 
+ Comms would be something I can breeze past by, which would be easier for me to score in uni  

Cons:
- 2nd major offered is pretty new : If I accept, I would be under the first batch of students in this course 
- Apparently a number of WKW students often drop their 2nd majors due to the workload (Mine’s a second major, not a double), I’m worried about the workload. 
- 3.5 years of the same thing I’ve studied in poly.
- It’s too far (1 hr commute to school) 
- Financial aid not as good as NUS
- I can’t afford hall stay 
- I’m terrified of their module selection process (STAR wars)

If you guys have any inputs on the things I’ve listed or have any tips on alleviating this anxiety I’m having on uni selection, please feel free to share! My nervous self will be extremely grateful 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼"
uvdgqo,0,2022-05-22,Transition from front-end to back-end internship?,askphysics123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uvdgqo/transition_from_frontend_to_backend_internship/,"I have an offer for Fall 2022 from Arista for an internship in front-end dev. The product sounds interesting, pay is good, and the company has a great reputation. However, I know that I want to do more back-end work because I focused on front-end a lot on my previous 8 month internship. I did apply for both front and back end, but currently it seems like my experience is only able to get me front end work.

Will having this experience be able to help me transition to a back-end role next Summer, or just further pigeonhole me into front-end? I guess it's also possible to ask for a internship return offer for next summer on their back-end team if I enjoy my time there. If I was to keep searching for a different role, based on my job search experience for this Summer, I highly doubt I'll be able to get even an interview for a role in back-end development with my current skillset."

uve2om,5,2022-05-22,How to communicate to boss I'll need to make some serious code changes?,MoneroThrower,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uve2om/how_to_communicate_to_boss_ill_need_to_make_some/,"So I have 3 YOE. My boss put me on a project (a window of an application) that deals with legacy code written by someone who clearly did not care for design, scale or maintainability (the funny thing is, he was a Sr Engineer with 15+ YOE). The code reads like an interns, total spaghetti. It's honestly atrocious. For example, when you resize the window, half of the window's content (controls, panels, other objects) disappear!

My boss is asking me to add a new feature without making too many changes to existing code. The only problem is, that's like asking me to walk into a burning house with black mold and saying 'Hey, just remodel the bathroom, don't change anything else'. Without putting out the fire and dealing with the mold, I'll most likely die from the roof collapsing in on me. Hopefully you understand what I mean.

How do I tell my boss this nicely, communicating that I'll need to make some initial changes to existing code first before working on the requested feature? He seems to think I can get all of this done in two weeks when I'll probably need 3 to 4 if I really want to do this right. I got added to this project at the tail-end of its completion, and there is a 2 week deadline. The attitude of ignoring existing technical debt is rubbing me the wrong way. Maybe I'm wrong here, and I should be making the minimal changes here to just get what my boss wants out (which is difficult, because the requested changes are exposing a lot of holes in the original design of the application)."
uvfy73,1,2022-05-22,my eye doctor thinks i have cancer and im scared,crababab,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/uvfy73/my_eye_doctor_thinks_i_have_cancer_and_im_scared/,"I've had this redness on one side of my left eye for about a year and its started to slowly eat away at my iris.  Inbetween that year my regular eye doctor sent me to a specialist and then after my second appointment with the specialist (a few days ago) he said the only thing he could think it could be is cancer.  Even then he said its atypical and is sending me to Emory for further testing.  I thought cancer usually presented in young kids or adults, not teens (im 15) and my eye doctor said it could be a form of blood or skin cancer.  The worst part is I wont know for sure until they can get me an appointment with Emory and even then Emory probably won't know right away and they'll have to do some kind of tests.  So it looks like there'll be atleast a month or two inbetween now and when i know for sure if its cancer.
And at the appointment with my eye specialist there was like 2 interns and also another doctor there and they couldnt figure out what else it could be besides some kind of cancer.  My mom doesnt think its that big of a deal and compared it to getting her wrist sprained or having c-sections.  I dont think cancer and those things are the same since cancer is a whole ass disease.  My dad is upset with my mom and partly me for not eating only organic food (hes big against GMOs and says they cause cancer) but he wouldnt be able to do anything anyway because hes in another state.  I don't know if I should tell my irl freinds (ill see them again tmr) because its almost summer and i dont want them to be worrying about me.  This suckss"
uvgkz1,17,2022-05-22,[Uni] LSE or SMU scholarship advice pls 🥲,Designer-Use3874,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/uvgkz1/uni_lse_or_smu_scholarship_advice_pls/,"Hi! i’m currently quite conflicted and would appreciate any advice or opinions, esp if you’re from LSE or SMU or just anyone in general, esp since the deadline for local acceptance is tmr.. 🥲 i hope this post isnt too long, but wld rly love to hear any opinions!!

I got offered Bsc of Accounting and Finance in LSE, and a double degree Accountancy and Business Management with ASEAN scholarship in SMU. I intend to venture into investment banks like JP morgan or goldman sachs in future, or just banks in general. money isn’t rly an issue here, but i do feel bad for spending so much on a degree when i can use it elsewhere. 

LSE: 
LSE has always been my dream school and i was pretty set on it until i got the SMU scholarship offer just cause the opportunity cost is higher now (in the sense whr i’m throwing away money from the scholarship and self funding for LSE). i feel like there’s a higher chance of me landing an internship and job in investment banks or just better jobs in general being a LSE student. how they hone and train their students to excel internationally, esp in countries out of Asia is a very appealing quality. the connections i make there and the people who i eventually interact with will more superior as well, plus the idea of studying in london for 3 years is very hard to come by and i guess being a LSE grad will allow me to stand higher chance in better unis in USA for my masters as well. so i’m worried that i may look back and regret not taking up this opportunity if i end up in SMU. i also feel like i’ve personally known no one who got into LSE, but know a handful of people who got into SMU scholarships. another plus is that LSE is 3 years, and SMU is 4 years. 

SMU:
it’s a double degree programme. the ASEAN scholarship is unbonded and pays for my 4 years education with $5.8k of allowance each year, amounting to about $87k in total so that’s great. the title of an ASEAN scholar is appealing, and i think it would land me better employments (to what extent i’m not sure). and i can go for global exchange programmes if i want my overseas uni experience. with the money i save up the money from lse, i can spend more getting a MBA in USA/UK next time although that’ll just be a 1+ year programme. i don’t think the connections in smu will be as great, feels like i’m just meeting people from my primary, secondary sch and JC again, and the experience of SMU and LSE is completely different too. i think it’s the just having the title of an ASEAN scholar that’s holding me back, and the benefits it may provide me when i’m looking for employment (do i stand out/get higher paying jobs just because of this title?) 

in conclusion, now i’m conflicted as to whether this title of an ASEAN scholar with double degree in SMU holds the same weightage as a LSE graduate. as an employer, which candidate would seem more attractive? and which uni do you think is more suitable to hone me into a better accountant/banker or allows me to stand higher chances in investment banks/secure better jobs in general? does a SMU scholar and LSE graduate hold the same footing/get the same starting pay (be it an overseas or SG job) or is there a huge gap in their pays where it’s worth it to spend $300k on a degree in LSE than receiving $23k from SMU scholarship allowance.

is it worth it to give up the title of an ASEAN scholar to go to LSE, or is it better to accept the SMU scholarship? 

i’m rly rly grateful for both options &amp; know that these are still attractive offers at the end of the day but i’m genuinely conflicted. would appreciate some advice from anyone/people w experience!!"

How can I break into CS?,transformerftm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uvivnf/im_in_the_middle_of_a_finance_degree_with_a/,"I am transferring to a university from community college. I can’t change my major because I already have all of my credits for the Finance degree. It would just not be smart from a financial perspective because I would have to start over somewhat. Plus the scholarship I have doesn’t really allow me to change my program of study. So I’m stuck with Finance. I was thinking I can do CS as a minor. I wanted to potentially do a masters but I don’t know if that’s possible considering I looked at my college and they said that in order to be allowed into the CS grad program, I have to have a CS degree. So I feel stuck at the moment. The internships I look at also only allow CS majors. I want to break into the industry but don’t know where to start considering my spot in life."

uvldui,4,2022-05-22,Advice on becoming a pen tester post college?,crypticcybergirl,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/uvldui/advice_on_becoming_a_pen_tester_post_college/,"So I’m an incoming senior in college graduating May 2023 studying Information Technology &amp; Informatics with a concentration in Cybersecurity and a minor in Critical Intelligence. I particularly want to get into ethical hacking/red team penetration testing as a career. I’ve interned for a Fortune 500 company last summer and am returning this summer as a cybersecurity engineer intern. I study ethical hacking via TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and am involved with my schools Cybersecurity club. Also I’m working towards getting my Security+ by the time I graduate. I network a lot on LinkedIn and have 500+ connections. My question is how can I break into this field and get a job? The entry level positions require many years of experience. Should I just enter another field of tech (e.g cloud security, pki, etc.) and then eventually get into pen testing? I want advice on how to do this because my ultimate goal is to be an ethical hacker seeing as how that’s what I constantly study in my free time. Any advice appreciated."
uvlpr2,2,2022-05-22,college is stressful,gdg2016,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/uvlpr2/college_is_stressful/,"i’m trying to play my cards right so i can get a good job when i graduate and be able to support myself, and it doesn’t feel like that’s happening at all. im a rising sophomore cs major, and i finally got my first internship, but it’s only an unpaid one at a startup established through my university. everyone else i know has paid ones at established companies, facebook, amazon, etc.) and it makes me feel so frustrated. there are so many factors that go into getting a good job (coding interviews, projects, networking, salary negotiation, and job hopping) that i don’t know if i can handle it when the time comes. me only having an unpaid internship doesn’t feel like a good sign to me."

White female, first-gen student (both parents have some college but no degree, that counts right?), Georgia high school with \~2,200 students, rising senior

**Intended Major:**

Computer Science, considering a minor (maybe Spanish?)

**SAT:**

Composite- 1490

Reading/Writing- 770

Mathematics- 720

I’ll probably retake in August simply because I’m so close to the whole “5000+” and didn’t really study when I took it so I think I could get it, plus I know my math could be better for a STEM major.

**UW/W NGA and Rank:**

Unweighted- 97.722

Weighted- 102.31

My school does not put GPA on transcripts and I don’t feel like calculating it rn. These numbers do not include this semester’s grades- my UW will probably go down but W will go up.

Class Rank- 3/482

**Coursework:**

10 Honors classes

13 AP classes by graduation- AP World (5), AP Lang (expecting 5), AP Chem (expecting 4), APUSH (expecting 5), AP CS A (expecting 5), AP Spanish Lang (expecting 4 but maybe 3), AP Calc BC, AP Lit, AP Physics C, AP Euro, AP Gov, AP Econ, AP Spanish Lit

About 24-25 APs are offered at my school.

**Awards:**

1. Personal Progress Young Women Recognition Medallion and Honor Bee (through my church, required 80+ hours of service, has been called Eagle Scout for girls)
2. NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Rising Star (1 time), Honorable Mention (2 times)
3. County Key Scholar (high PSAT score)
4. Governor's Honors Program Semifinalist for math (prestigious summer program, maybe could’ve been a finalist but had to drop out for another opportunity)
5. Georgia Certificate of Merit (high class rank)
6. Georgia Seal of Biliteracy (pending, will get if I get a 4+ on AP Spanish exam)
7. Computer Science Career Pathway Completion (3 years of CS courses)
8. AP Scholar with Distinction (pending but will definitely get)

**Extracurriculars:**

1. Beta Club Member, 2016-2023 (completed over 50 hours of volunteer work through tutoring, working with underprivileged children, etc.)
2. Tome Student Literacy Society President, 2017-2020 (won 2nd place in state-level reading bowl, placed 1st and 2nd in multiple literary design competitions)

8. NCWIT BridgeUP STEM Scholars Program at Georgia Tech Participant, 2022-2023 (will attend a selective 3-week summer coding program, complete a 120-hour research internship with student and faculty mentors)

\#7 and #8 are definitely the most important to me.

I also had a job at Papa Johns for about 6 months my junior year.

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

I consider myself to be a pretty good writer and my AP Lang teacher is awesome about reading and helping with students’ essays so I should be set there.

I have multiple teachers who would write really great LORs for me, although I would like advice. GT only accepts one LOR from a teacher. Should it be from my AP Lang teacher who would probably write the better letter or my CS teacher who’s had me for three years? I’ve also heard they like it to be from a core teacher but I’m majoring in CS so idk if I need a STEM LOR.

**Schools:**

The main one is Georgia Tech! I’ll apply EA. I will also be applying to most main public schools in north/central Georgia because I’ll get Zell Miller (pays all tuition), but with the exception of UGA (target, 70ish% chance) they’re all safeties. We can turn this into a reverse chance me too if you want because I’m open to suggestions, but I am seriously in love with Tech’s comp sci program!"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!

uvq30b,3,2022-05-22,How hard is it to get a MS in CS with a BS in Economics?,MadGlobin,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uvq30b/how_hard_is_it_to_get_a_ms_in_cs_with_a_bs_in/,"Hi! 2 years ago I graduated with a BS in Economics from a local university with really good grades. Ever since I started working, all my roles have been as Data Analyst (first as an intern to a regional multilateral bank, then at a consumer goods company, then at a consultant company, and recently at a digital marketing agency). Throughout these 2 years, I have also completed multiple online courses like the ""Data Science"" specialization on Coursera from Johns Hopkins and many others, making me somewhat good at R, SQL and Python, at least for what I need to do on a daily basis. I'm looking forward to studying a MS in Europe (preferably Germany, but I'm open for other options in the region) with the objective of migrating and staying to work afterwards, but, **I'm still debating whether it should be a MS in Data Science or a MS in Computer Science.**

From what I have read, since Data Science is a pretty ""young"" field, there is no consensus on what a DS curriculum should look like. This makes the content of a MS in DS vary widely depending on the university, and there's always the danger of being stuck studying superficial knowledge with peers that have no experience coding at all. Essentially, it could teach me almost nothing new compared to what I already know.

On the other hand, most people seem to recommend doing a MS in Computer Science instead: the curriculum is less prone to big changes depending on the institution, I can expect going in depth into certain topics, and I feel it would be more prestigious/respected by potential employers (and help me to land other jobs in IT if the data science venture fails).

The problem is that, with just a BS in Economics, lots of people say it is pretty difficult to get accepted into the average MS in CS. I don't know how much my professional experience, my online courses, (and also a Math minor I did but my grades weren't great) would help me to get accepted. I'm also looking to get at least a partial scholarship to cover living costs, thus making this enterprise extra difficult.

What are your thoughts on my situation? I would study the MS in CS if no obstacles were present. Are these obstacles that big in reality? Thank you so much."

uvsj0v,5,2022-05-23,Which schools should I apply to?,noname031234,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/uvsj0v/which_schools_should_i_apply_to/,"Hello, everybody

I'm new to Reddit, let alone this community.

As the title says, which school should I apply to?

Don't get me wrong, I'm doing my research sedulously but really wanted to get some advice from other people as well.

I'm an international student studying economics at a top 70 fairly big-sized university.

I absolutely love econ and think I wanna pursue a PhD, postgraduate.

I'm a freshman currently, and my GPA is 3.98.

My high school GPA was 3.82, but I did have 4.0 in my senior year. (I didn't take any AP classes mainly because I came to the US when I was in 11th grade and I knew I was ill-prepared; I was barely dealing with the language barrier.)

I haven't taken any standardized tests, but I am planning on taking one if needed.

my main ECs are musical instruments and languages. (no internship, job experience, no club...very MEAGRE) BUT I might TA intro econ class during my second year and join some econ and classical music clubs..

I've been scribbling some ideas for the essay, and I think I'm going to have a solid one.

A little bit about me is that I'm fairly introverted and enjoy a small college environment. I'm very self-driven and ambitious. I thrive in a competitive setting.

At my current institution, I don't feel like I belong here for a variety of reasons, which I would rather not disclose here, and student to professor ratio is not ideal at all. I've felt like professors I've engaged with so far are rather apathetic(ofc not all of them). The general requirements are too much here too. Also, let's be honest, we all want to go to a ""prestigious"" university.

Assuming that I will have somewhat decent letters of recommendation, which top schools are the ones in which I would fit well AND for which I would have not too slim a chance so as to be worth giving a try.

I've thought of some schools, admittedly the ones that are too good for me.

Here's the list:

Vanderbilt

Northwestern

Emory

Swarthmore

Middlebury

Colgate

Amherst(dream school)

Brown

and

U Penn

Please share your thoughts.

Can you think of any other colleges that I should consider?

Thank you in advance."

I started a new job in March, before that I worked five years very happily with a manager who cared about his employees quite a lot, made sure that everyone (intern to managers) got to attend seminars and trainings, and generally coached us very well.

Cue my new job: they need people who can get things done because they took on new clients last year, then someone who apparently had a lot of skill left the company because they moved. Since January, two people have been let go for underperformance. Their underperformance was addressed, but they did not receive coaching.

My red flag senses are tingly, yet I have received very positive feedback - not much surprise, as I have been delivering quite the numbers. I get a lot of flexibility, if I have private appointments I can schedule them for whenever, as long as after the end of the day, I deliver the results the clients need.

Still, I simply don’t know if the employees being let go is a terrible warning sign or just „reality“ and nothing special. Do you have any insight?"

for purpose of context: parents divorced years ago, living with my mum (only child). not that close with dad but meet up occasionally to have a meal. initially relied on alimony to get by but mum got a job with pay &lt;$3k (shall not reveal the amount) about 3-4 years ago so we’re pretty much financially stable now.

ok so the situation is this. about 3-4 years ago (similar period as when mum got employed but this was after she got the job) my friends and i wanted to go on an overseas trip together (shall not reveal the country in case people recognise me). sought approval from mum but she said no because at that time our financial situation was not that good yet. told her that i would work part time to earn the money for the trip, she was upset at how i wanted to earn money not to help with the financial burden but to go overseas. she said my dad also has a say in such matters. also said no promises but she would try to save so we could go together. okay, understandable. i agreed. (covid happened, my friends ended up not going on that trip)

fast forward to current. same situation, friends and i wanted to go on the trip together. (travel restrictions in the destination we wanted to go to was more lax now) our financial situation is much better now and i also have quite some money saved from bursaries, scholarships, internship pay etc. once again sought approval from mum to go on the trip. she said no, because we kind of ‘planned’ to go together soon in spring next year (no solid plans etc., just the mention of it only). she kind of thought i was abandoning the plan of going with her because now i wanted to go with my friends, which is totally NOT the case. i told her we could go together after i go my friends, then she brought up the issue of money, i.e. the expenses of going again within months.

overall just quite upset because i really really want to go overseas with my friends as i’ve never done that before and i know it will be super fun. i do understand where my mum is coming from and i don’t blame her at all but i just really wanna go on the trip with my friends because it’s definitely a whole different experience as compared to going with mum. especially when i’ve seen so many of my other friends going on grad trips at 18.

i’m also turning 21 this year. i have the urge to tell her that i’m turning 21 and i have the right to make my own decisions, but i know this might just come out very wrong if i bring this up, especially when my emotions are running high. i also don’t want to start an argument over this.

am i being too wistful here?

P.S. it’s my first time posting a rant here so i might have missed out some other important contexts.

edit: sorry i realised i missed out on another context here. am starting uni in august. recently had some issues with dad and alimony so there’s some uncertainty regarding uni tuition fees. am hoping to get scholarship but didn’t have CCA in poly so not really sure if i will get it. but mum didn’t bring this context up during our conversation."

I have some questions and was hoping to get people’s opinions on whether or not this sounds like a good idea.  I would be applying to transfer for my sophomore year spring semester or my junior year fall semester.

I am quite certain I would get transfer credit for discrete math, calc 1, calc 2, and calc 3, as well as the prerequisite course for EECS 280.  However, I must graduate in four years, so I’m wondering if it’s realistic to be able to do this starting with EECS 280 either second semester of my sophomore year or first semester of my junior year.  I could take one course online my junior summer as I would hopefully have an internship then.

I appreciate anyone’s thoughts or advice on this."

1. Texas A&amp;M University College Station - (MS EE - Master of Science in Electrical Engineering)
2. North Carolina State University - (MS EE - Master of Science in Electrical Engineering)

I have already checked for the coursework, research, and opportunities and I feel that both are at the same level.

I would like to get a direction on choosing one among these 2.

My interests lie in signal processing, controls, and a bit of computer vision, and my aim is to get a good amount of course coverage to strengthen my EE concepts and get good internship opportunities. Course duration or weather is not a problem for me.

Unless I want them to.

Context: I live in a 3 person household, my little brother and I with our mum. My mum is frankly bonkers. She continues to beat me up and scream, yell, throw stuff at me, draw knives on me and act like an overall baby. Switch off the wifi, turn off my mobile data etc. (since it's under her account). From Primary sch to Lower Sec, she used to pretend that she was having a heart attack every time my brother and I messed something up. Naturally, us being kids would end up a wailing mess trying to apologise to her and promise not to do it again All forms of communication has broken down, I do not consider her as my mother nor I her son (she said it, not me). She says she treats me like an adult but fails to have a proper conversation and *listen* at least. She actually did the ""nana I can't hear you"" and proceeded to close both earlobes using her fingers. Just because she does not want to listen to me, or in her words: listen to my BS. I have about $2k with my which I've managed to scraped as she took about half my internship monies. Ok, I realise it's used to feed us so I'm somewhat accepting of that.

I am worried about 4 main things:

1. Finding a place to live
2. My little brother living alone with my mum (he still has O levels this year)
3. Paying off university fees after NS, going to SMU
4. Any important documents I need to take in the event I get kicked out? (I have my IC, with O-Level and Diploma Certs on hand, but idk if I've missed anything out)

Anyone have advice on the above 3 topics?

I have yet to receive my enlistment letter (damn it CMPB!!) but my birthday will soon pass. So I'm guessing I'll get my letter once my birthday passes? I've thought about demanding back my internship and scholarship monies (abt $10K) I've collected during my pre-u studies but I feel like that would be too much of a d*ck move. I recognise that she did indeed give birth, food and clothe me, as well as provided me with a shelter so far but her toxic behaviour is honestly too much. She also likes to bring religion as justification as to why I ought to kiss and grovel at her feet since ""heaven is at the mother's feet"". She also likes to tell stories to one of my aunts (her sister) who only proceeds to extend her a rage boner despite not telling the whole truth. I realise as I grew older that her toxic behaviour was not actually ""good"" (before I knew what toxic meant). Every small thing, she would proceed to have a violent outburst. I do not feel at ease living here.

That being said, I'm also scared of leaving my little brother alone and I don't want me leaving to affect his upcoming O-levels. He's not the brightest bulb and I want to give him the semi-peace of mind of at least not going through hell alone. To be honest, this is not the first time she's threatened to do so but this might be the last. 

I will be happy to provide additonal information if here if requested. Thank you r/askSingapore community!"

\-companie poate sa te dea afara oricand fara sa te anunte in prealabil, in caz ca sunt probleme economie, cei cu PFA/SRL ar zbura primii  
\-o sa am KPI's speciali , ceva mai duri odata ce sunt angajat prin PFA/SRL  
\-sa zicem ca o sa am un salariu net mai mare, dar inloc de platile directe la stat, o sa am nevoie sa platesc taxa pt contabila + alte lucruri ( pe care nu le cunosc)  


Dupa aceasta sedinta oarecum am ramas cu mai multe intrebari decat claritati.  
Care este parerea voastra? Pro si Cons  
Multumesc frumos pentru timpul vostru"

Fine. I'll post it on my main account then (this one).

Context: I live in a 3 person household, my little brother and I with our mum. My mum is frankly bonkers. She continues to beat me up and scream, yell, throw stuff at me, draw knives on me and act like an overall baby. Switch off the wifi, turn off my mobile data etc. (since it's under her account). From Primary sch to Lower Sec, she used to pretend that she was having a heart attack every time my brother and I messed something up. Naturally, us being kids would end up a wailing mess trying to apologise to her and promise not to do it again All forms of communication has broken down, I do not consider her as my mother nor I her son (she said it, not me). She says she treats me like an adult but fails to have a proper conversation and *listen* at least. She actually did the ""nana I can't hear you"" and proceeded to close both earlobes using her fingers. Just because she does not want to listen to me, or in her words: listen to my BS. I have about $2k with my which I've managed to scraped as she took about half my internship monies. Ok, I realise it's used to feed us so I'm somewhat accepting of that.

I am worried about 4 main things:

1. Finding a place to live
2. My little brother living alone with my mum (he still has O levels this year)
3. Paying off university fees after NS, going to SMU
4. Any important documents I need to take in the event I get kicked out? (I have my IC, with O-Level and Diploma Certs on hand, but idk if I've missed anything out)
5. Anything else I ought to take note or KIV when I get kicked out?

Anyone have advice on the above 3 topics?

I have yet to receive my enlistment letter (damn it CMPB!!) but my birthday will soon pass. So I'm guessing I'll get my letter once my birthday passes? I've thought about demanding back my internship and scholarship monies (abt $10K) I've collected during my pre-u studies but I feel like that would be too much of a d*ck move. I recognise that she did indeed give birth, food and clothe me, as well as provided me with a shelter so far but her toxic behaviour is honestly too much. She also likes to bring religion as justification as to why I ought to kiss and grovel at her feet since ""heaven is at the mother's feet"". She also likes to tell stories to one of my aunts (her sister) who only proceeds to extend her a rage boner despite not telling the whole truth. I realise as I grew older that her toxic behaviour was not actually ""good"" (before I knew what toxic meant). Every small thing, she would proceed to have a violent outburst. I do not feel at ease living here.

That being said, I'm also scared of leaving my little brother alone and I don't want me leaving to affect his upcoming O-levels. He's not the brightest bulb and I want to give him the semi-peace of mind of at least not going through hell alone. To be honest, this is not the first time she's threatened to do so but this might be the last. 

I am very scared rn but will be happy to provide additonal information if here if requested. Thank you r/SGExams community!"

Some quick background: I am a recent high school graduate who is hoping to start university (Bachelors in Math, got deferred from CS) this fall. I have a long term goal of doing something either in the Data Science or in the AI/ML fields, but for the short-term, I want to get some experience working in some sort of a developer role. I have decent experience with NodeJS and Express, as well as React Native.

Therefore, as someone entering a university with a very strong co-op culture, what can I do right now to improve or maximise my chances of securing a decent, developer co-op within the first year? I'm asking because I have the next few months all to myself that I want to utilise for self-improvement before I get busy with uni stuff.

I've thought of the following, and would love your feedback on the matter as well as any other suggestions that you might have:

1. [Python + AI/ML course from udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
2. Try and land a 2 or 3 month internship no matter what
3. Use my current stack (MERN) (React Native) to build a few more projects
4. Invest time into open source development and contribute to other projects on GitHub

TIA!"

Am very lucky and grateful to have received these offers!

Would like to know more on
- Course rigour
-  School life
-  prospects
- does the DDP mean that time is more packed and losinh out on internship experience(like shorter or smt) 
- got any stories also can share!

 Leaning more towards NTU ACBS vs NUS BZA due to hall life and proximity in case I get rej by hall 🥲, also heard of scary class part wars for SMU? I know these courses are different, but I do find interest in both. I do forsee a steep (like 90 degree steep) learning curve for me to learn programming😵."

It's hard to be proud and happy for them when I'm more knowledgeable than them in everything IT.

The job sounds really nice and it starts on May 31st and I'm still here looking for a place during the internship.

I don't know what to do, I think the car is the smallest problem I might just buy one when I get there but the housing situation is bad.

I have no idea what to do.

Update: found a place and settled in and I start the internship on Tuesday"

I just finished my first year of Mechanical Engineering at University. I am wondering how do I get my foot into companies? Get good internships? Experience in the role? I am currently also learning to code, on-top of the C++ learned in class. Mostly python and soon moving onto java, is this a good use of my time during the holidays or should I move onto something more beneficial, if so then what should I be doing instead?

Thanks in Advance."

Unde gasesc si eu un internship (nu imi pasa de salariu) ca sa nu mor de foame dupa facultate. Pot sa spun ca nu ma duc cu mana in fund, stiu tehnici de programare (recursivitate, backtracking, greedy si programare dinamica), stiu putin OOP (cum sa fac getter, setter, constructor, inheritance), javascript (un arrow function, un map, jquery, sa vorbesc cu server-ul), html, css (scss, bootstrap), si foarte putin sql.

Edit: Evident stiu sa lucrez in C (am incercat sa invat gtk+ ca sa fac o aplicatie, dar e prea mult efort), assembly, dar nu as lucra in asa ceva pentru job."

uw4v7d,1,2022-05-23,CS senior trying to work at a quantitative trading/ high frequency trading firm. Am I on the right track?,silhuhon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uw4v7d/cs_senior_trying_to_work_at_a_quantitative/,"I’m a senior cs major at a state university with a sort of decent project portfolio consisting of websites and games. I’m doing an internship this summer at a small company as well.

I’m trying to get a job at a quantitative trading firm and I know the ones up north like (HRT, Jane street) are extremely competitive. As a student who doesn’t really go to a top tier university and doesn’t have prior internship experience at a FAANG company of some sort, I know it sounds a bit unrealistic for me to go down this route at this point, but this is my game plan so far:

- creating two or three large scale projects related to algorithmic trading or financial analysis
- getting to the point where I can score perfectly in the first round OA (grinding leetcode)
- tailoring my resume around quantitative trading and learning as much as I can about the subject 
- spending a lot of time on my cover letter, follow up emails, etc.

What else can I do? Am I on the right track? Is this realistic?"

uw5r0o,34,2022-05-23,You join a federal agency that can fund experimental programs to help more people become therapists. What do you try to do now?,fichtitious,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/uw5r0o/you_join_a_federal_agency_that_can_fund/,"I am going to be joining a team at SAMHSA that is focused on the [national rollout](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988) of 988. With several hundred million dollars in [new funding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union), the team has some authority to make grants toward creative initiatives that could bring more people into careers as counselors and therapists.

Whom should I try to talk to, what questions should I ask, and what kinds of experimental programs do you think could help the most?

I think there has to be a future where anyone who has the talent and drive can get trained and licensed, even if they can’t afford tuition and years of unpaid training, and where gradually the mental health field comes to reflect the many communities inside our beautiful little country far more than it does now.

Having worked on a suicide prevention line, I’ve seen how crisis counselors who get hired into the work without any educational prerequisites can do incredibly skilled frontline work with the right on-the-job training and supervision. A suicide hotline counselor hired right out of high school or college who serves for a couple of years will learn how to build rapport quickly with people in severe distress, will often guide people feeling suicidal toward insight, and will learn a good deal about the acute experience of every kind of serious mental illness. Hotline counselors would make wonderful therapists! And it is a shame that their only path into the profession is to resign from their job on the hotline, take out student loans, attend grad school, go through internship, and go through clinical supervision. It is especially a shame that their having spent several thousand supervised hours supporting suicidal callers does not count for anything in that process – that the professional system treats them as though they are completely untrained as they enter grad school.

So perhaps there ought to be a federal program that creates work-study opportunities to serve part-time on a mental health crisis hotline, or a [mobile crisis team](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20210903.856934/full), while receiving fully-subsidized tuition and clinical training. Enter right out of high school or college, earn a living while working and studying, and emerge a few years later as an LMHC or LCSW.

It would certainly be easier to meet the 988 call centers’ urgent hotline counselor [hiring needs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/us/suicide-hotline-mental-health-988.html) if a program like this were in place.

How would you try to make it happen? Does the federal government need to offer incentives to states and graduate programs to create these kinds of new pathways to degrees and licensure?

Or are there other trees you would bark up, altogether, to make it easier for people without a lot of money to enter the profession?"

I used to think this was not true for this field but the more I’ve applied and struggled to find internships etc I’m starting to think it may be true.

I think I'm considering getting an  IT certification or summer school (CIS major here) this year, but don't know which one would be more beneficial. 

An  IT certification would be good on a resume but don't know where to start or which one t take since there are so many kinds I could take (will probably research on my own which one to take, but if anybody has any suggestions I'm open to it).

 If I take any summer classes (just only one credit) I might graduate on time (a semester behind due to school transfer), but I heard from a lot of people there's no point in rushing on finishing school on time and I want to kinda take a break from school at the same time after a hard spring semester."

As the title states, I’m pretty lost. I’m working on my first ticket and my mentor is basically having to guide me through how to do every step because I’ve basically just done my data structure courses so far in school. I feel like a normal engineer would take an hour or two on this, but I’ve already spent a few days. Is this normal or am I just really bad at CS?"
uw7y76,17,2022-05-23,They will never change.,deadlyparents,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/uw7y76/they_will_never_change/,"If you go through my post history, you’ll see the constant nightmare I went through in high school. It was really bad. It’s been a few years and I’m doing much much better, but basically I was, in their eyes, a failure all throughout high school and I got beat up and screamed at all the time. Back in junior year of hs, I was fed up after my mom threatened to crash the car and kill us both while crying and screaming hysterically for an hour during a car ride, after I got a 4 or something on one of my APs. I can’t even remember. I was genuinely scared for my life, and I called CPS on them, which brought the police to my house (she still brings this up to this day and taunts me to call the police on her again when I get scared of her screaming). But not only this, my grades were quite trash throughout high school, which incited more violence. And I’m not talking A- or B+ trash. I just didn’t care about some of my classes (like AP bio). 

But it’s been 4 years, and I’m about to be a senior in college. I didn’t listen to my parents (become an engineer or study business at a top school and just marry rich to a doctor, which was my mom’s DREAM for me. My dad just doesn’t give two shits about me cuz he’s deadbeat). I worked my ass off during college in the past 3 years and I got a nice internship as a data engineer and I’ll not be home at all this summer because right after my internship ends, I will be going to Europe (woohoo!). If you told high school me that this would be happening, I would’ve laughed. 

During the two weeks I’ve been back home from school, all I heard from my mom is her on the phone bitching about how “shit” of a job I secured, how her friends’ kids are doing much better than me and how her failure daughter didn’t get a job at XYZ company as a software engineer. What she doesn’t understand, and what I tried explaining, is that their kids are FINANCE MAJORS and I am in a different field that gets paid the SAME FUCKING AMOUNT and I barely have to work, AND I get Fridays off. And I don’t even want to do software engineering (data engineering is database stuff that uses code to do database things) It’s not a race. Not only that, I’m basically 21 and she still rants to her mom about how I don’t “deserve respect” from her because she is more than twice my age. Basically, I made it for myself, but she still treats me the exact same way she did 4 years ago. Screaming. Yelling. Hitting. All the time. In fact, it’s gotten worse because I think she realized the older I get, the harder it is to control me. 

So I guess my point is, work hard for YOURSELF. Don’t get good grades just because it’s gonna make your parents happy (it didn’t make mine) and do what YOU want. Like I said, I did terribly in high school but I busted ass in my CS classes in college and did well. It made ME happy. I sometimes look to my past and feel super pathetic for younger me and wish that I stood up for myself more. I had a conversation with my friend and it really resonated with me; he told me that the choices I make in life that I feel like are right, and make me happy + healthy, should not be determined by whether my parents want it or not and whether it makes them happy, when nothing does anyway. Because once I’m deep into a relationship/career/life choice they wanted me to make once I’m 45 and they’re dead, it’s just gonna make me realize that I did all that for nothing. But overall, I’m doing much better mentally than I was in high school and I hope that things get better for you guys as well."
uw823d,30,2022-05-23,I finally graduated !,Midnighttonigght,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/uw823d/i_finally_graduated/,"The past 5 years of going to college full time while working full time have been so challenging but I finally made it. Last year I didn’t get placed for my internship in time, one accepted me but the day before it began they switched the hours to the times I work and my boss would not change my hours. I have left that job and found one that I could work at after getting out of my internship.

This time around everything went well I got my internship at the first place I applied to. Got to work with children and teenagers that are abused/neglected or abandoned, etc at a child advocacy center. As a survivor, I’ve always wanted to go to one of those centers. I have been working full-time to pay for my bills and apartment ever since my mom kicked me out of high school. I became an “independent youth”, and one of the scholarships I received was for technically being homeless and having straight As. 

I graduated with a 3.75 GPA and start working a job in my field next Tuesday. I was offered an unexpected position, I will be getting a dollar raise. It’s only part-time so I will be staying with my current job to make up for the rest of the hours.

I’m happy to be working with children that are being abused/neglected as I was. I hope to become a Social Worker and help them in the future. 

I don’t know why my brain can’t accept I’m done, and it’s a good thing. I keep thinking I have an assignment I forgot to complete. When I graduated high school it was different because I was ready to leave. Now I feel like I didn’t deserve to graduate. How do you battle this feeling?"

One of the things I’m trying to do is take a bunch of data from every day in one month, then average it out for each individual month in a different document.

For example, I did January 2012 like (‘name doc.csv’!G2:G32), then when I try to do it for February it just goes to (‘name doc.csv’!G3:G33), but I want it to be (‘name doc.csv’!G33:G60). 

Is there a way that I can specify my document to average out across rows, but also say like this month from this year?

**Chapter 9**

Alphon Beton exhaled a deep billow of smoke and started speaking.

""Well, to begin with, the planet Irium, where I was born, is very technically advanced. And not just technically, even socially. No one there has smoked ganja, sold a single joint, grown a single herb in centuries. And that's only because of the very uncompromising attitude of the pigs and the public towards us herbally enlightened people. The public on Irium punished cannabis growers mercilessly, and at one time they were even lynched before they could be brought to justice. It is no better today. A person suspected of growing, smoking or selling ganja rarely survived the pre-trial detention. And the pigs didn't even have to be secret about it, nobody cared. After centuries of such rule, the planet Irium was so completely free of pot that no one really knew what it looked like anymore. The citizens didn't know, but neither did the police.

But then, I was born. I lived happily all my life, until one day I found myself on a practical internship at a space station. I was studying to be a navigator. My friends brought me this strange thing. It was a glass flask with two tubes sticking out. One was narrow and the other was funnel-shaped, filled with something and covered with tinfoil. It was the first hookah I'd ever seen. They hung a resonant thermodiode over it, so that the smoke in the pipe heated up and it became a vaporizer. I kept it running with my buddies until I found out....

...well, that I'm stoned and that's the meaning of my life. Then I got used to regular bong and joints. When I graduated with some difficulty, I managed to find the source of the miraculous substance. I always landed with my slightly used boat in some deserted place and found someone stoned. All I had to do was say, ""Take me to your dealer,"" and I had the goods taken care of. All I had to do was give him a few unnecessary trinkets that looked futuristic and I had enough weed to get back to Irium.

And since no one on Irium knew what ganja looked like anymore or what it actually was, I could sell without fear, no one could prove I was selling ganja. Only people from Earth could tell, but where would you find them Irium? So I had a nice life for a long time, I had a house, a wife and a really cool hovercraft in the garage.

Well, my idyll ended when that ship showed up in planetary sensor range.""

""Which ship?"" Morton asked.

""This one."" Alfon Beton said, tracing a semicircle with his hand.

""To give you a little background, the planet Irium was a typical capitalist system.

Beggars abounded, but everyone had a chance to start their own business and become, say, the head of a large corporation. Competition was rampant, and I myself had to shake a few sticks at competing pot importers to keep my market. Well, it was just capitalism as usual with its bad sides, like industrial espionage, inflation, tunneling, etc. But I had a good thing going.

And why am I saying this in the past tense?

Because the ship arrived and reconnaissance teams were dispatched. And what did they find?

I saw the first reports, filmed some freezer caskets with people who didn't come from Irium.

Then we managed to thaw and revive them. We explained where they were and how we lived. They explained that they were from Earth, and that they would know how to solve our problems of capitalism.

The presidents of the states listened to them, they liked their ideas quite a bit, and so began the transformation of a capitalist planet into a socialist one. What didn't work on Earth, thanks to primitive technology and a thieving population, worked on Irium with the advanced technology. Here, we could actually command wind and rain, and our population is already politically woke. The standard of living of the poor increased, so the giant corporations could no longer enrich themselves at the expense of the working class. Well, it was generally a change for the better, but what does it matter?  The visitors were from Earth.

As the largest importer of pot on Irium, I wanted to bribe the visitors (now senior members of the Planetary Planning Committee) to keep going out of business as a capitalist. So I sent them a gift pack of ganja. Only, because they were from Earth, they recognized the ganja.

That's how the planet Irium found out that the product sold under the trade name ""mindwarp chokeweed"" was actually marijuana. A great wave of anger that had not been expressed for ages rose in the people, and I, as the largest importer of cannabis to the planet, was arrested and accused of narcotizing the population of the planet. And that's a death sentence on Irium.

Well, what was I supposed to do? I knocked out some stranger who looked like me, put him in my place, and ran. I stopped at home, at my luxurious villa, and picked up the essentials and Lenny. Lenny was a pet, think of a space cat or something.

I took my leave from the planet and hid around orbital stations and inhospitable planets for years. That's where I started to look this shabby. When I got caught one day, they beat me up badly and took me to Irium to be executed.

By that time the whole planet had already turned into a socialist welfare planet, and the communists were gratefully hailed as heroes. Their ship was repaired, upgraded with our technology and repainted red. And I escaped for a second time, because they increased my punishment to a live-streamed torture.

But those bastards put a tracker chip under my skin that could find me anywhere. So I took Lenny and ran to the only place I wouldn't be followed. Here. On the commie spaceship.""

""That's like something out of a soap opera,"" said Milly with emotion.

""Well, what do you expect for two grams of my best weed?"" Morton said. ""By the way, where's Lenny?""

Alphon sighed. ""Well there was just one little problem. When I first escaped, I was hiding out on a planet with a methane atmosphere for a couple of weeks. Just me,  Lenny and two stolen breathers.

I'd have stayed longer, but there's these nasty little monsters that eat everything alive or put larvae in it if it's big enough. Well, when I escaped to this ship after my recapture, suddenly something was wrong with Lenny. He wasn't moving at all, and he just meowed occasionally. That's usual for Earth cats, I'm told, but not for Lenny's species. And then he burst all over like an overcooked blood sausage and out came the critter that our young lady here met."" -and pointed to Milly.

""I threw up. But my lower half ran like hell, so I'm alive. So far that thing has probably grown to an earthly six feet long, thanks to the nutrients in those sewers, but I think it wants solid food.

I remember how on that planet those monsters used to throw this nasty poison on the victim, which would instantly dissolve the victim into a puddle of slime. That's how they feed, except that if there's no methane, the slime doesn't react as a corrosive at all. So the insect snake, or whatever I'm supposed to call it, has learned to seek out methane, even by hearing. And I've got a little bit of a stinker here, so the corrosive sort of started to react with the methane and it ate Milly's sleeve.""

""You probably haven't talked to anyone in a while, have you?"" Morton asked.

""It's been almost six months since this ship left Irium. But I had no idea they'd park this close to Earth.""

""And how do you live here?""

""Well, I've been stealing supplies from the commies and living off them. But it's no fun here, when I'm walking down the canal and I fart, I have to run really fast.""

""Why?"" Milly asked

""Because the monster out there hears it. And because it needs the methane to attack with the slime, it seeks it out. It knows that the sound of farting means a source of methane. So be very careful.""

""But something still doesn't seem right about your story,"" Milly said. ""Why is there such hatred of cannabis on your planet? I mean, there are other drugs, like mushrooms and nutmeg and stuff like that.""

""Well, that's very old history."" Alfon said. ""I guess you have enough time if you're listening to me patiently like this. By the way, Morton, there's an ashtray in the box to your right.

Well, once upon a time, centuries ago, my race had clairvoyant, psychic, and psionic abilities.

And a lot of people didn't like that, because they couldn't do nefarious machinations, they weren't even allowed to think about it much, because the telepaths would know and the psionics would stop them.

So with the help of like-minded scientists, they developed a certain virus carrying a certain gene. Then they sprayed this all over the place until everyone was infected. Maybe even the creators themselves, but I don't think that bothered them much. They were into evil, not psionics or telepathy, after all. The virus slightly altered the DNA, which caused a slight change in the brain. A set of brain centers that communicate with each other and keep the psionic centers from activating.

A few people have died from it, but not enough to attract attention. So now the Irians don't have the psychic abilities they used to. Almost, actually.""

""What do you mean, almost?""

""Surely you know the hormone acetylcholine. In your brain, it promotes the transfer of information between nerve cells. And in order for those brain centers in the Irians to inhibit psionic abilities, they have to communicate with each other to some degree just through acetylcholine.

And ganja blocks acetylcholine. That means that smoking only impairs your short-term memory, but it activates my psionic abilities. That's why I know things before they happen. I can travel galaxies with my mind, I can affect people and things far away.

Well, if everyone on my planet could do that, that would be a big deal for the government. That's why ganja isn't allowed there, and why the penalties are so high. But nobody smoked as much as me, either.""

""So you, Mr. Beton, are the mysterious voice I heard? ""Millenia asked.

""Yeah, I used to talk like that sometimes. I mean, I've been sitting here all alone in a little cell for months, so why wouldn't I take a look at other planets? Only I ran out of ganja recently, last thing I could do was to help you in that virtual reality hack.""

Morton frowned. ""So that was you? I thought it was Saint Ganjos.""

""Yeah, I heard a story about Saint Ganjos on Earth, it went something like this:

There was - there was once a rich prince in Switzerland. He lived a degenerate life, spending the state's money, until one day he was walking in the castle garden and saw some strange flowers. He couldn't figure out what they were for, he wasn't interested in the folk making ropes with hemp. And even if he was, these plants were different from common hemp in many ways. They were bushier, shorter, with abundant sticky blossoms, and smelled strangely. The prince had a gardener called in to tell him what these strange flowers were.

The gardener made the excuse that they were just weeds, and that they meant nothing, lest he be accused of witchcraft. But the prince, in his capriciousness, wanted to try everything, so he picked about a quarter of a pound of resinous buds and chewed it all up, washing it down with brandy. After a few hours he began to experience things he had never experienced, and began to see things he had never seen. He saw the insignificance of court life, the intrigue and corruption, and his own debauchery. So one day he gave up his worldly possessions and went into the forest, where he became a hermit and a cannabis grower. Miraculously surviving many inquisitorial trials and witch hunts, he also performed many miraculous feats, such as curing people of glaucoma, anorexia, and degenerative nervous disease, all through the power of cannabis.

After his death, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered over a large hemp field. And that hemp pollinated more, and more, until eventually all the hemp in Europe and Asia had the spirit of Saint Ganjos in it. Since then, Saint Ganjos has been the patron saint of all stoners...""

Alfon Beton had almost finished his smoke drink, and gave in to the mild intoxication, slumping away in slumber.

\*\*\*

Morton and Milly were sitting in the sewer cell, sipping beer from a can and thinking about what they had just heard.

""So now I guess we'd better take a look around the boat to see what's what.""

""Sure Milly, but the best thing to do would be to get some sleep, just like Beton here. We can't get on the ship now anyway, so you better help me with the crates.""

They lined up the crates side by side, into makeshift bunks. They slowly fell asleep.

But not forever. They were awakened by voices and the sound of footsteps in the sewers.

""Hey, Alphon, wake up!"" Morton shook the sleeping Alphon Beton, for the voices were getting closer and closer.

""Zzzz... what?""

""Someone's coming!""

""It's probably a communist reconnaissance unit, they know you're here. In that case, it's lucky I have enough THC,"" said Alfon.

""What, ganja is supposed to save us from armed goons?"" Milly asked.

""Of course, I can psionically suggest to them that the door to my cell doesn't exist.""

""But then they'll notice the hole in the wall.""

""Oh no, I'll suggest to them that it's not a door but a wall, you know what I mean.""

Alphon closed his eyes, whispering something while the voices and sounds of footsteps drew closer.

Already a non-American accent could be discerned, perhaps even downright anti-American.

But strangely enough, members of the search party passed by the door unnoticed.

When the voices finally died down, Alfon opened his eyes.

""We shouldn't be endangering you like this."" Milly said. ""Being here with you puts you in danger. We should go.""

Alfon shrugged. ""Well, you're probably right. But what are you going to do with this ship anyway?""

""We found out that the communists have some sort of teleportation device."" Morton said.

""Yeah, I remember they gave them this technology on the Irium. We use it for shipping and as a radioactive waste remover.""

""And we know they want to use it to take over the Earth. If the Earthlings resist, they just teleport a tiny amount of solar plasma to the centers of resistance, and they're done.  Not to mention the fact that they can destroy all strategic targets. That's how they want to... er, establish communism.""

""And what do you intend to do?""

""We're going to blow this ship up.""

""Then I shouldn't be here, eh? You'd better take me with you. Do you have a plan for how you're going to do that?""

""Yeah, we do. Milly, you're the bigger expert, so explain it to Alfon.""

Milly sighed. ""Well, so we're going to steal the teleportation device, and use it to teleport solar matter into this ship. That'll cause a big explosion and we'll be all set.""

""As far as I know, it should be somewhere on the bridge."" Alfon advised. ""Only that's where it's most guarded. You should have some sort of distraction.""

""And you'll help us?""

""Sure, and then you can take me with you.""

Alyosha Sergeyevich Borisov walked down a long empty corridor. In his hands he held a ray gun, which gave him a feeling of confidence. Sometimes he remembered his good old Kalashnikov, but he couldn't take it with him into involuntary hibernation. He was glad he had at least gotten there, though. In revolutionary days it was easy to get lynched, perhaps by an angry prison guard. Unfortunately, he showed himself too much on the cameras, which turned public attention to his previous (evil) actions. He could only be a red minion, as anonymous as the crowd. When the revolution in 2019

collapsed, he could go on living as a normal citizen. But he didn't. He had to suck up to the Leader at all costs. But that's long gone. It was almost the end of the 21st century and all the ideals of the Party were dead. But none of the space communists doubted that they could resurrect them forever. The Leader gave them the strength to overcome the obstacles and fate itself played into their hands.

For example, Borisov thought, those good Irians, as they thawed us out, listened to the ideals of our Party and even acted on them. The teachings of Lenin and Stalin have finally found a kindred planet. And in their helpfulness, the Irians have equipped the ship of socialism with their state-of-the-art technology. Thanks to their gifts, the great vision of the Leader - the socialization of planet Earth - can now be realized. If only it weren't for the aliens on board. No one knows what they wanted, but by this time, a squad of Strikers should be breaking into their ship. We're sure to find one of them and get the information. Just don't let that mean our agent, code-named Bob Cocott, has failed. Ha ha, an agent of socialism as president of the Wall Street bourgeoisie? How could he fail?

These were the thoughts of the socialism ship's security officer as he walked the halls. Vigilantly and alertly he checked all the turnings and now and then lit a papiros.

Suddenly something stirred in the channel below the corridor. Immediately he pointed the deathray, but nothing could be seen. But there was a rustling sound. Alyosha Sergeyevich Borisov pushed back the sewer manhole and jumped in. His gaze searched the walls, and just as he was about to turn around, something hit him on the head. He dropped his ray gun in pain, but before falling unconscious he managed to grope for the remote alarm trigger.

Suddenly, many lights on the bridge lit up, mostly red. The Leader sat in his elevated chair and listened to the alarm siren with displeasure.

""Comrade Commander Gogolovich, what's going on?""

""The alarm in sector C 18 was probably triggered by Borisov. He was supposed to be on guard there, Comrade Leader.""

""Send in the Striker Team immediately.""

""Of course, Leader. But it may be a maneuver by the invaders to lure reinforcements off the bridge,"" Comrade Commander said.

""Yes, I thought of that too. Have the bridge security hide behind the control panels and be quiet. Wait for them to come.""

""Well, we should be on our way to the bridge now, the soldiers should be on their way to the alert point,"" Morton said.

""But what about the monster in the sewers?""

""I'll take better aim this time. But it might as well be in the ventilation shafts, so we have nothing to worry about,"" Morton replied.

So they exited the sewer hideout and, telepathically guided by Alfon Beton, made their way through the sewers to the bridge.

Meanwhile, Alfon Beton searched the stunned soldier's pockets for the rest of the cigarettes and ran to find another hideout. After a moment, soldiers found Borisov.

""Comrade Sergeyevich, are you alright?"" the commander asked the stunned man.

The comrade did not answer.

""Comrades, let's split up. Two will take Comrade Sergeyevich to the infirmary, and the others will go after the intruders.""

The soldiers jumped into the sewer and disappeared from the author's sight.

uwcv50,0,2022-05-23,Career Advice for a recent grad Engineer- Which job do I choose?,5gamer1,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/uwcv50/career_advice_for_a_recent_grad_engineer_which/,"I just graduated with my degree in mechanical engineering about 3 weeks ago. Before graduating, I worked for a large company in the industry that I want to go into- 8 months as an intern, then they extended my contract to work part time the next semester. I enjoyed the work that I did there, and this is what really got me interested in the industry. There were some red flags with the company, however. First, most of the full time, salary employees in my department were expected to work from around 8am to 6pm or 7pm every night. My department also said the more hours you put in the more likely you would be promoted. I've never been great with a work life balance, so going into this job after graduation did not seem like a great option. Also, while I learned a lot the first few months, once I got what I was doing down, it became monotonous and repetitive. I'll call this company A for the remainder. 

I took last semester off, and focused on just finding a full-time job. I did look at job openings in other departments for Company A, but nothing came up that I was interested in. I was able to find a job with a smaller company in the industry for better pay and I feel like it will give me the opportunity to get my hands on more things sooner. I also like the idea of working for a smaller company, as there is less red tape and it might be easier to get to know people. I was set to start this job about a week ago, but my start date was pushed off two weeks because I caught Covid. I now start next week. 

While I was home with Covid, Company A contacted me and let me know of an opening for a higher level position in there company that they would start me in, doing more sales engineering and customer support engineering. I knew people in this role and it seemed like a really interesting job- not one traditionally offered right out of college. It is also a different boss and different coworkers, although the same type of work. My former boss told me to respond if interested, but since I am starting with company B next week, I decided to not respond as this company may be considered a competitor. The right role was just not available with company A when I was applying. 

I am now debating what the right choice is. I have it narrowed down to 2 options.

Option A: Respond to Company A and let them know that I have already accepted a job. I was thinking of saying something like. ""Thanks for thinking of me for this role. I really enjoyed my time with the company and the department. I took a class this semester that really got me interested in design, so I decided to look for jobs where I could explore this interest more and there wasn't much available at the time that I was looking."" Is it okay for me to say that I would be interested in jobs in the future? (Not really sure how to map out the whole response.) I could then work for company B and gain experience. If I prefer company B, I stay long term. If not I try to apply for jobs again at company A. 

Option B: Let company B know that I am no longer interested in the job(even though I accepted over a month ago and am due to start soon) and apply to the job recommended to me by company A. The cons with this are I am not guaranteed the job, but there should be some other jobs available that I could also apply to. 

My major questions are: should I respond to company A and let them know that I accepted another job, even if it is with one of their competitors(they emailed me over a week ago and said respond if interested. Since I already had a job lined up, I didn't respond but I am not sure that is the right choice now)? Also, is it wierd that I am still considering the offer from company A a week later?"

They've said it can take from 3-6 months.

The problem is because of my internship I've been away from home (where my main desktop is) for about 5 months and will be returning back home mid September. Currently the CPU (5900x) is at an amazing price where its around $200 cheaper than MSRP in Canada. But even if I do buy it now I won't be able to use it or upgrade my pc until I get back home in September. However, I don't know if the prices will remain this cheap (or stock will be available) until September.

So what should I do? Buy the CPU now while the prices are cheap or buy the CPU when I get back home and can actually upgrade my pc with the fear that CPU prices might go up again."

However, I came across this autoML thing in databricks that I found out handles all the ML stuff I need. My first question is would a company favor me doing the ML work using scikit learn and coding or using something like autoML? My intuition tells me actually coding and using scikit. My second question is do I just use regular Python and SQL in the Spark Notebook? Or would it be more impressive for me to use PySpark and Spark SQL?

I do intend to go to SMU but i have some concerns whether i should proceed with the DDP or drop my second degree(IS)

i have read online that the minimum 45 CU for my combination of DDP. i understand that it may take arnd 5years to complete. However i also find the data science 2nd major offered by SOE to be interesting and want to try that out as well.

1) I know that DDP itself is a huge load and requires alot of focus, effort and hardwork to complete. How much more difficult will it be for me to take on a 2nd major on top of the double degree eg data science, and then how many CU will it take to fulfil that? 

2) Would it be wise for me to simply just do a single degree econs with a second major of DSA or do the DDP without DSA?

3) how is the DSA program in SMU? is it manageable and is it recognised outside? Would it boost my chances for employment in comparison to doing the secondary degree?

4) Also would taking a double degree affect my global exposure? would i have enough time to participate in exchange programmes or internship abroad while juggling with double degree?

5) For CCAs, are sports CCAs at SMU extremely competitive or is it manageable? Would going for clubs instead of sports be an advantage as i understand some clubs do play a key role when it comes to employment opportunities?

I’m the oldest 25(f) of 4 girls. We all play sports and it’s the same one . It plays a massive role in our lives. I graduated over the pandemic and missed my last college year playing. There were issues with scholarships due to graduation so I couldn’t go back for a fifth year alongside of my masters being a 3 year program (almost done) and being at another college. Anyway I’ve been at home with my parents since the pandemic. My younger sister is the favorite. She’s always been. She was always better than me at sports and my parents always cared about getting her the best training and on the best teams. My parents barley showed up because they were focused on her. To the point where during one of my college games an official who knew my dad (my dad knows everyone) where he was . And when I said my sisters game he literally joked haha she’s the favorite. Everyone knows . I love my sister but I’m mad. For example my family business had a tough time through the pandemic so I worked there and still do while completing a masters for counseling and studying for licensure soon after which is still ALOT. I hate my situation. My schedule is booked with internship and school and work. I get no respect from my family. They all went away didn’t invite me I was expected to take care of the pets and the house and all the food I bought was thrown away. I cried my eyes out but I had three clients tonight so I couldn’t even deal with my own stuff. My family has taken away pretty much anywhere I can do a session because my sisters moving in from college . My one sister is moving out and I’m jealous honestly . I’ve been trying to look at houses with my boyfriend but it’s a struggle and not really feasible right now. She’s renting for a ridiculous price with her boyfriend but honestly I’m jealous. I’ve had to bring her packages in everyday when they come in and I’ve just been annoyed with this market and just the state of the economy. On top of this, my boyfriend told me after his sister gets married we can get engaged out of respect. She just got married a few months ago and my younger sister is talking about it on social media with her boyfriend . Like hurry up on her story . And I’m just kind mad because I waited for two years for his sister and my parents favorite child is yet again ruining it. How do I cope ? It’s just been eating me alive these past few weeks and honestly my home life has been unbearable almost . I can’t do any of my internship comfortably like I have been for 8 months now. I can’t rent, we need to buy for my boyfriends career he needs space. I know I just need to wait but until then I need to cope."

We have been friends for 7 years. They basically shacked up after their first date (we’re all in college) and I have barely gotten any girl time with her since. He’s all she talks about. I haven’t been able to have much alone time with her since they got together. If I want to see her, I have to third wheel them. He recently left for a summer internship and I thought things would get better. Now she’s texting him and FaceTiming him all of the time, crying because he’s gone, and talking about how he’s gonna move in with her in a year. She’s coming to my family’s lake house this weekend and if she FaceTimes him once I might loose my shit. I’m happy for her that she found someone who loves her for who she is and is quite frankly a simp for her… but I’m jealous and it doesn’t feel good. She’s one of my 2 only friends and I love her so much. It pisses me off knowing that if it were between him and me, she’d pick him after only knowing him for a short period of time. I can’t find someone who is right for me (and likes me back) and I’m lonely. And now I feel like I’m losing my closest and longest friend. I’ve expressed my feelings and she just doesn’t understand why I feel this way. What should I do?"
uwjtr9,1,2022-05-24,"Post College, Stuck in Unemployment",YeehawKara,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uwjtr9/post_college_stuck_in_unemployment/,"Last year, May 2021, I (now 23F) graduated with my Bachelor’s degree, BFA. Of course I graduated with highest honors, special awards, and a double minor. I graduated with internship experience as well as a couple part time jobs experience. I have now been unemployed ever since leaving college. I have applied to over 300 jobs and cannot get a bite to save my life!!! In all of it I have only had 3 companies I interviewed with, and of course I didn’t get those. Nobody wants me at all. I customize every single resume to the job, write a customized cover letter, as well as include additional materials such as catered portfolio if applicable. I have met as an alumni with my alma mater‘s career office so many times to go over my materials and what I’m doing.

Due to lack of work and income I was forced to move back with my parents in their Midwest small town. I went to school in NYC and that transition has been rough. I have even been applying to some “regular” jobs in the small town and still no one wants anything to do with me.

I can’t get a job to save my life. This all feels extremely personal and has taken such an extreme toll on my self-esteem and mental health. I am now convinced something is fundamentally wrong with me and I am a bad person. I don’t know what to do anymore or how to get out of this hell."

uwm1uz,3,2022-05-24,Should I take the offer?,Longjumping_Fly_4662,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/uwm1uz/should_i_take_the_offer/,"A backstory: I just graduated with a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering with a 3.2 GPA from a pretty good University in the US (top 30) and 2 year internship experiences. However, I am an international student, meaning that after 3 years of working I'll need some type of visa sponsorship if my current status do a not change or I go to graduate school.

With that said, I've been offered a position as manufacturer engineer technician from a medical device company (although my role will be more like an actual engineer). However the position only pays $20/hour and is a contract position. 

So I was wondering if I take this offer or keep on looking for different opportunities. The main reasons why I want to look for a different position is that, I feel like with my degree the pay should be a little more (I have school loans which I need to pay, and I don't think this amount will really help that much with that). I also don't know if working as a technician will negatively affect my career in the future (I will like to work as a process or quality engineer in the battery industry). 

The reasons why I feel the need to take the position is that I am not sure if I'll will be able to find another position especially given the fact that I'll have 90 days of total allowable unemployment in the US starting in July before I become illegal. Most companies just don't want to hire international students. 

I honestly low key hate myself now because I could easily have done much better in school and get a better GPA and improve my chances of getting hired, but for one reason or another I didn't think that will be an issue and didn't really care much about it....like going into my senior fall I had a 3.4 GPA, but I ended up graduating with 3.2.  My advice for anyone here (especially international students) give your education all your efforts and energy.

So if I can get some advices, that will be great!"
uwm3sn,65,2022-05-24,Should I go through with my option to study at IIM Bodh Gaya or should I rewrite my CAT exam?,acharismaticjeweller,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/uwm3sn/should_i_go_through_with_my_option_to_study_at/,"I recently received an admission letter to IIM Bodh Gaya and I'm confused on whether or not I should go for it. Out of the list of IIMs in India, Bodh Gaya is ranked the second lowest. I also got added into the Whatsapp group for IIMBG converts and I'm not sure about the general quality of the crowd that I'm going to have to study with. Bodh Gaya is also located in Bihar, and I'm concerned about the xenophobia and prejudice I'll possibly experience there as someone from the South along with the fact that I barely know how to converse in Hindi. I can moderately understand it when it's spoken to me, but English is what I primarily communicate in. I'm also afraid of being ragged, bullied and humiliated, being someone who is introverted, nerdy, sensitive, sheltered, inexperienced and unresourceful compared to most people in my stream. The campus tours that I've seen online make it seem like the overall facility isn't that great.

My parents really want me to go. They said they were willing to spend all of their money on it if they had to. I, too, am not sure if an opportunity to study at an IIM is something that I should gamble with. My only qualifications is that I've scored a 95 point something in my CAT exam, and my percentiles till UG are good enough because they don't drop below 80. Yet, I do not really have any faith in my overall academic ability right now because:

a) I suffer from chronic Tinnitus, which makes it incredibly difficult for me to read, learn, think or study. I have to put in 5 times more effort than the average person in order to focus and concentrate.

b) My performance has always been inconsistent, irrespective of how much faith I put in myself. I always feel like I'm rolling a dice. Sometimes I do exceptionally good, sometimes I'm decent, sometimes I mess up real bad. It's pretty much arbitrary which one of these it'll be if I chose to write the CAT exam again.

c) I'm extremely poor at giving interviews. My interview with IIM Rohtak literally ended with the interviewers insulting me for my lack of subject knowledge, so I don't know if I will manage to earn a seat even if I do well in the examination.

Despite all this, I have this nagging feeling deep within me that says ""Is this the best you can do?"". I'm not saying that to sound boastful. I suppose I'm just naïvely optimistic. I have been severely disappointed by all of the institutions that I've passed out of until now, and I've always had this desperate desire to, at least for my MBA, study in a prestigious institution. It seems to me like my parents are only pushing me for the IIM tag more than anything else, but wouldn't any person with half a brain ask me what IIM I'm from rather than frothing from their mouth at the mere mention of the first three letters? When I shared information about the placements at IIM with one of my teachers, he said they seem fine and that the IIM brand will always hold a good package.

There's a more obscure aspect of this that I already touched on but wanted to elaborate. During my undergraduate, I got the opportunity to work as a sales executive (ಥ\_ಥ) at a wealth management company. I had a very bad experience in my time there because, for some reason, it was presupposed that I will be knowing Hindi. Except for a few teachers, almost all of the training for the job happened in Hindi. Even in my college, Hindi was the predominant language of communication between students, but I assumed it was a unique phenomenon and it never bothered me much because my circle of friends spoke to each other in English and the teachers never spoke in Hindi unless they were engaging in banter with the students. I was completely taken aback when this culture carried over to my work life too. It was one of the primary reasons I quit the job within a month. From my very limited experience with the converts of IIM BG, and the fact that it's situated in Bihar \[which is a place that I've only ever heard bad things about\], I feel like I'll be experiencing an amplified version of the same inexplicable Hindi culture that was present in my college and internship. If this is really the case everywhere in this stream, my better option, to feel like I belong, would be to do my MBA from a foreign university. To reiterate, English has always been the language that I most effectively and frequently communicate in.

I know that that it's ultimately my choice, but I'm only asking for some bare minimum guidance and feedback that'll better help me make this decision. Thanks in advance."

The problem is that i'm not very good at anything, i just know our specific web apps. 
Also the career, despite being good and safe, isnt that interesting or well paid (becoming executive and working 16h/day every day of the year isnt my dream lol).

I've been recently offered a super junior position as a React developer, basically an internship. I feel like it would be really bad for couple years, but long term it could give me way better results, from better pay to full remote. 
Also after the test months i would almost go to the same pay that i have now, the problem is that it includes moving to another city so starving for few months while learning like a madman (idk react but it looks like the best option in front end right now).

I have basic knowledge of Java, Selenium automation,C,C++,HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Data Structures from school but can't attend classes right now. I'm taking a break because I can't afford tuition, can't get anymore financial aid or loans, no scholarships have gotten back to me, I recently lost my job, no money ,have alot of debt and about to be behind on rent and utilities.
  
While I thought I might be able to at least get some sort of entry level front end or QA position, everyone's turned me down and I haven't been able to get any internships either. I feel desperate enough to just take a bootcamp or someone that would pay me while learning if guaranteed a job but is it too late or if not what bootcamps could I look into? If not, worst case I would have to work at a warehouse or something and study when I'm at home. I've started studying a lot of online resources like Scrimba, FreeCodeCamp, etc to make up for not being able to take classes right now and have been learning pretty quickly.
  
I've read that entry level CS jobs were oversaturated and also a lot of companies are doing hiring freezes or layoffs due to the economy. I worry that maybe I just won't be able to find anything at this point and just need to whatever random to get by for now."

I’m also coming in to college with a good amount of credit so i’m projected to graduate in about 2.5 years. 

Because i’m projected to graduate early and I wanted to get into a sort of niche/newer field (AI for accessibility), I was thinking that it’d be a good idea to spend a couple of years in grad school and get my masters/phd at 22-23. 

But this semester of hs I took Dual Enrollment Multivariable Calc, and Linear Algebra and Differential Equations and got a C in both, bringing my transfer gpa down to a 3.5. 

Ive been hearing that it’s really hard to get into reputable graduate AI programs with low math grades so I was wondering if it was even worth it at this point to try for grad school? Will anything I do in college “make up” for my low linear algebra and mult. calc grades? Will they care that i took the courses in high school? 

(also, idk if this changes anything but I’m also going to be applying with at least 2 industry internships in AI under my belt. One was at a small company during hs and one is a faang offer i have for after my freshman year)"

-Been a Clarinet player for 6 years now (started in middle school but my school doesn’t have a band) (I’ve been in All-County but this was all in middle school 🥲), self-taught Ukulele but haven’t practiced in years, and saxophone but also haven’t practiced in years

-I really want to intern at my local elementary school for senior year next year but I’m not sure if it’s possible for me. If not I’m hoping to maybe get a job or volunteer at an independent bookstore in my town :) 

*Also noting that my HS school is small and since it’s an Early College HS we don’t have many opportunities for EC’s like traditional HS’s*

**Essays/LOR:** I’m still not sure what imma write about but I’m confident in my technical writing skills. As for LOR, I’m definitely going to ask my English IV honors teacher and my Civics/Economics teacher, and hopefully my HS advisory/counselor

**Schools I want to apply to next year:** 

-In-state: UNCW (lowk dream school, amazing English program), UNCC, Appalachian State, UNCC, not sure where else yet

-Out-of-state: NJCU, CCNY and Hunter (both CUNY) since I have family there, and I might apply to NYU just to satisfy my younger self who was in love with the school (even tho I would love to go 😭😭), and the rest I’m not sure but I do sometimes dream of going OOS.

*After graduating college with my bachelors I’m hoping to teach abroad in Japan to teach English so maybe that’s a hook!*"

I changed uni after 1 years to another so every one of my friend they are like 25 to 30 , they are hired by the biggest companies , and on the other side i am still not sure after spending 5 years in uni that i can even pass a basic entry level coding interview ( even if yoi apply for devope you have to clear them first)
 
 I never worked so hard in my life and i am disappointed and ashamed that when i had the time i was doing shity stuff not focusing on the important stuff.

Now i am just stuck , worked hard in devops but still its not enough , cant go back to the designing filed , cant even apply as a basic cs intern as i am at the same level as someone who is in his 3 month of 1st semester.  and has 0 logic cant even solve a basic question

Need help or motivation  or maybe if you wanna make fun of me of you can take this as a lesson!

I've been following this subreddit for quite some time now and it has helped me immensely. I wanted to ask for some advice of my own as after this summer I will be at a crossroads.

Basically, last summer I worked a SWE internship at a fairly well established company with solid pay (was virtual due to C19). Soon I will be doing another internship with the same company this summer. However, once I finish the internship this summer, I'm not sure if I should try to pursue a different company (FAANG in particular has me interested). I'll be graduating this coming December and I am not sure what to prioritize when it comes to a New Grad job. For instance, the job currently pays me slightly on the high end of 5 figures. However, should I try to prioritize a job that might pay me more? Should I try to find a job that has a location that I would like? Maybe a job that I may/may not enjoy more? Or should I just stick with this company for a few years to establish myself?

Any wisdom would be greatly appreciated."

uwuu7r,10,2022-05-24,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (5/23/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/uwuu7r/weekly_job_qa_thread_5232022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 122nd installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I’m currently living near my hometown, which I always have with the exception of going away to college and some internships out of state. 

My career here pays amazingly well, but..... I am just so bored and uninspired by the people surrounding me. I have no good friends. Any of my close friends moved out of state, and those still living here are either jealous of me or bad influences (lazy, miserable, alcoholics, drugs, unemployed, severe mental health disorders, etc.) I don’t say this to be mean, but knowing it honestly brings me down too. 

As far as romantic relationships, attractive men are hard to find here, whether in public or on dating apps. I’m starting to get depressed that I’ve dated SOOO much in the last 10 years. I never have issues getting dates, but no one has been “the one” for me for all different reasons, which is super discouraging.

I think the only reasons I’m staying in my hometown are 1. I don’t want my parents to become upset, bc they are divorced and lonely entering their 60’s  which makes me sad and 2. I make great money in my career here plus in a very low cost living area and 3. I can’t tell if either I’m the problem and need to change my ways in order to be happier, or I truly just am in a crappy place that I need to remove myself from. 

I also believe the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. I just really don’t know what to do. I keep getting signs that I don’t belong here but maybe there’s something wrong with me that I can’t figure out myself.

# Travel

I have been traveling for the last four years, including last year when I started this program. Of significance - I hiked 400 miles in Spain while I was interviewing Sep - Oct. I walked 13 - 21 miles a day with a 20lb backpack and did not consistently prep due to time constraints, bad internet connection, or fatigue. I downloaded Grokking Algorithms on Audible but it was virtually impossible to follow along just by audio alone and instead made me dizzy. 😂

While doing the hardest thing I've ever done, I was bold enough to take 3 classes and do 20 interviews on the road. I scheduled my interviews based on my expected walking mileage and if I would be somewhere with good enough wi-fi to handle a video Zoom call. **It was crazy risky.** Many people told me not to do this if I cared about my GPA or interview success, and they were somewhat right - there were several interviews that I could have done better if I had not done this and instead prepped more.

If I only had a few interviews lined up... maybe I wouldn't have gone on this trip or if I did, maybe I wouldn't have landed a single offer. I recognize that I was very lucky to have had multiple companies in my pipeline. If I did bad on an interview, I treated it as practice and motivated myself to keep going. I have no regrets that I chose to do this, but I still think it's important to let others know that what I did was risky and that I was lucky.

I can probably write more about what this was like if there’s interest. This year, I am traveling much less this year due to my internships, but still quite a bit (my workplaces are/were aware).

## Course Planning

I agree with others that 261 and 325 would be helpful but I started interviewing before taking those courses. Instead, I think you are able to start preparing for interviews as soon as you first start to learn how to code (yes, as early as 161). In regards to electives - I know many people recommend taking Parallel Programming or Cloud, but my goal is to finish this program as soon as possible. That means taking the electives that did not have burdensome pre-reqs or a crazy workload. I ended up taking 464, 352, and 381, and I am very happy with that decision. 381, in particular, is my favorite course of this program because you learn Raku, Ruby, Racket, and Prolog.

Beyond specific courses though, my time at OSU taught me how to organize, structure, and comment my code. During an interview I will define functions, add docstrings, write comments and run test cases. It takes a bit of time to set up but I always receive positive comments about this.

## Interview Prep

Most of the companies on my short-list had a LeetCode style of interview process, and this influenced how I prepared for my interviews. I tried a few different things. Codepath (more below) helped me in the beginning, and then afterwards I began to follow Blind 75 or this [list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) and watched video solutions on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NeetCode). Sometimes I checked AlgoExpert, Educative, or LeetCode (I have subscriptions to all three) for solutions. I would spin up PyCharm and have a specific project folder where I test solutions out. I have actually ""solved"" very few problems on LeetCode itself. For specific interviews, I will only look at problems tagged with that company (Leetcode Premium feature).

A few of my interviews were focused on my ability to write programs with multiple classes and functions based on a given set of requirements. For one interview, I had to prepare a program in advance, and during the interview, I was given additional requirements so I had to modify or add to my program during a screen share. LeetCode does not prepare you for these types of assessments – instead I leaned heavily on what I learned in courses like 162.

## Programs / Hackathons / Conferences

* **Codepath Technical Interview Prep**: Highly recommend this. Last year I would have said the virtual fair is the #1 reason why you should apply but honestly I think the networking, weekly assessments, and forced pod activity were better drivers to my success - it made me study more than I had the self-discipline for.
* **Rewriting the Code (RTC) Interview Prep**: I'm not sure if they are doing this again this summer. I was placed into a small study group and received a free subscription to AlgoExpert. The study group was not as effective because we were not forced to meet however I thought AlgoExpert is very good so I did benefit overall from this.
* **Lyft Early Talent Access (ETA) Program**: A 2-month summer program consisting of helpful webinars about Lyft's interview process. It prepared me very well for the actual interview and does expedite the process for you if you are selected for a mock interview. (I may write a post about this.) There's an upcoming [webinar](https://www.untapped.io/app/discover/events/a/a/557bab71-d596-4505-8c51-b092419725e7) for this summer's session on June 1st.
* **Wells Fargo Junior Leaders Conference**: I applied in June, had a phone interview with an engineering manager, and was selected to attend the two-day virtual conference in August. The conference was focused on building leadership skills and I really enjoyed it (free swag too!). At the end, I interviewed for a swe internship position and received an offer in Sept. If you are interested in banking/finance technology, I highly recommend looking into this!
* **Beaverhacks**: I helped organize three Beaverhacks and participated in one. Not only did this provide me with great networking opportunities with teaching staff, alumni, and industry professionals, recruiters would always ask me about this. (It was also really fun!)
* **Internhacks**: Collaborated with six students from around the country in order to build a full-stack app in 7 weeks. We won two awards and this became one of my portfolio projects. I had more experience than my teammates on building full-stack apps so this was a leadership and mentorship opportunity, which I leveraged in behavioral interviews.
* **Grace Hopper Conference**: I received a scholarship to attend last year's conference virtually and will be attending this year's in-person via scholarship as well. (There are many scholarship opportunities out there, including through OSU, ACM, Anita B org, etc). One of my offers last year was a result of connecting with a recruiter from Grace Hopper so I feel very strongly that if you can go, go. If you can't though, there are MANY other conferences out there, including those hosted by OSU!

## Acknowledgements

I say this with genuine appreciation: this program has changed my life, and I have the OSU community on Slack, Discord and Reddit largely to thank. I won't bore anyone with platitudes except to say that I hope we continue to strive to make this an empowering and inclusive space to learn and network so we can all reach our goals, whatever they may be."
ux0rgc,0,2022-05-24,Scared of technical tests,1661dauphin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ux0rgc/scared_of_technical_tests/,"So I'm finishing up a year long CS course next week and I've been applying to jobs steadily over the last few weeks (would have applied sooner but needed all the educational experience I could get as I've had no internships and I'm looking for full time post graduation work now). I knew how to code very basic things before the course but it has given me some good projects under my belt, a degree, and more education than I could give myself. 

Anyway, to my happy surprise, I've heard back from almost every company I've applied to, despite feeling like I was punching up! So I'm glad they like my CV (possibly). The problem is when they start sending technical tests. I feel like a total flop since the problems usually take me a good few tries, even the ""easy"" ones. Even some Leetcode easies feel a bit ridiculous to me sometimes. The sample Hackerrank test was easy, but even getting certified in *basic* Java was a really difficult test for me there, so I'm *very*
worried about companies' technical tests. I'm really not trying to make a fool of myself. This one company even has a whiteboard interview after I pass the online technical (god willing) -- their online one is just a screening, probably to weed out incompetency, but am I really incompetent if I can't convert roman numerals to ints in 10 minutes? (don't laugh) Is that normal for junior positions? 

I'm wondering if anyone has advice: is this the norm, just suck it up and practice loads so the problems become more familiar?
Or would the vast majority of companies not put juniors through many technical tests and keep applying?

Thanks in advance and I hope I'm not coming across as whining. Just intimidated. Thanks!"

I know how to write an algorithm using pseudo code, and can write a functional code in C (already imolemented AES, some side channel attacks, worked alot using the gmp library for RSA, ECC..).
However, I am not happy with my level nor my background and i wish to improve my skills, and write a more presentable code that I can proudly put on my github profile. I am also looking to expand my job pool by expanding my knowledge in embedded software development, since my internship and my only relevant work experience centers around embedded systems security. I prefer to read books that go into details, but i don't mind youtube vidéos.

My class rank is very low due to my sophomore year grades not updating (105/445 students, 4.22W/3.81UW). I've always had a shitty mental health and this year it's gotten really bad, so my grades really took a hit after COVID, although I don't think this is an excuse to slack of. Even still, I think I'm making a comeback.

1460 SAT (770M 690EBRW, planning to retake this June, hoping for a 1500+). Also took the ACT and got a 29, not submitting that, nor am I retaking.

15 honors courses, 7 APs, 7-8 Dual-Enrollment courses at local community college (counted as APs). 1 AP Soph year, 3 Junior, 3 Senior. 3 Dual Enrollment (or 2 idk one course was weird), 2 during the summer, and 3 during senior year. Taking AP Psych, Stats, and CSA next year.

Awards/Certifications: Anticipating AP Scholar, maybe AP Scholar w/ Honors. Our school didn't let us take APs during freshman year, so I only have 4 APs currently (AP CSP, AP Calc AB, BC, APWH). Only exam I've gotten results for is APWH (4). Certified in Intro to Python and AutoCad. Other than that just basic DECA Awards that don't mean anything. Also will probably get Summa Cum Laude (probably means nothing).

1. Founded a club which deals with hypothetical/conceptual topics, mostly astronomy. Small club, few members, no major accomplishment.
2. Volunteering as an English/STEM teacher for high schoolers in my home country this summer.
3. Internship over the summer, CS related.
4. 200+ Volunteering Hours

7. Key Club member (no significant accomplishments)
8. DECA Member (no significant accomplishments)
9. Tutoring Job
10. Did NFTs/Crypto, but no significant accomplishment (turned $40 to $1.5k? lol)

My LORs will be mid I think (didn't really form close relations w/ anyone, basically wasted the past 6 years of my life), but I'm anticipating my essays will be pretty good.

Looking for schools that are reaches, but not impossible for me to get into (like HYPSM/T10s/Gt/UCLA/UCB/UC Hicago), regularly/ed/ea. Also looking for targets and safeties. Don't really care about external factors (like location, but preferrably near NYC/New England), mostly just want prestigious schools that are good in CS and have a high starting salary and maybe high silicon valley presence, and not outrageously expensive (like nyu/oos ucs). Also would love schools that let you easily switch into cs and have an astronomy/less competitive major that I have a higher chance of getting into.

Schools I'm def applying to: ASU, UNCC, UNC, NCSU, VT, UMich, Duke, Dartmouth, Cornell, UIUC, UMD, UW-Madison, Purdue

ux58os,2,2022-05-24,Incoming 4th year University student debating between Masters or going straight into Industry.,Solaratoz,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ux58os/incoming_4th_year_university_student_debating/," 

Hi y'all. I'm a student currently studying computer engineering at a university in a bit of a dilemma on how exactly my future career path is going to pan out.

I chose computer engineering because I heard it allowed you to go into hardware or software once you graduate and go into industry and during my coursework I enjoyed both. My initial plan was to always pursue a master's degree in computer engineering and thus I grinded really hard, maintained a high GPA, did research, etc. to get into a Master's program for computer engineering. However since I focused so hard on school I didn't really apply for any internships like I should have.

However as of late, I'm not sure entirely sure I want to be pursuing this option any more. I think by this point I really don't enjoy working in hardware anymore and I find working as a software engineering/CS job to be what I want to do when I go out into industry. This being the case, is pursuing a master's in computer engineering even a good idea at this point? It seems a decent amount of my coursework for grad school will involve hardware design (Verilog) and stuff like GPU programming. The heavy hardware focus isn't really appealing to me as someone who wants to go into software.

But since I focused too much on school/GPA/research that I didn't get any internships I'm not sure how likely it is that I get a decent paying CS job once I graduate.

What should I do? Do I stick with the master's program and slog through another year or so of grad courses with heavy hardware focus just to get the degree? Do I ditch the master's program and just spend the summer trying to build projects/resume items/leetcode to try and line up a job for right after I graduate?

I'm expecting to graduate in March 2023 if I don't do the BS/MS program at my school and graduate June 2024 if I do.

Any advice will be appreciated :)"

ux5yl0,9,2022-05-24,Advice on where to REA/ED in the early round?,PositivePicture2005,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ux5yl0/advice_on_where_to_reaed_in_the_early_round/,"Hi, I'm currently a rising senior and I'm trying to decide where to EA/REA/ED for college apps. I'm mainly trying to balance strategically applying REA/ED to give me an advantage vs making sure I don't aim too low and end up regretting it.

I'm an Asian male applying for math + CS, and I'm hoping to go into quant finance after college. My four choices basically are to REA/ED nowhere (in which case I'll EA MIT, Caltech, and UChicago), REA Yale, ED UPenn (CAS), or ED Cornell (also CAS).

I have decent stats (3.98 GPA, 1590 SAT, 36 ACT, 15 APs), strong awards (USAMO, 2x USAJMO, USACO Gold, USAPhO), and fairly standard/cookie-cutter ECs (research, internships, tutoring, leadership in a few clubs, a sport, etc). My essays will probably be average to somewhat above average, and my recs will be also pretty average. So basically, I feel like I'm a strong applicant, but I have nothing that stand outs and I basically blend in with all the other STEM-focused asian males.

Given this, I'd really appreciate some advice on what I should do during the early round, since I'm very conflicted right now. I'm currently leaning towards applying Yale REA or UPenn ED, since my chances at making one of HPSM are pretty low but still nontrivial- so I don't want to regret aiming too low with Cornell ED, and I also don't want to regret not applying ED/REA somewhere. In particular, Yale REA appeals to me, since Yale is apparently ""recruiting"" STEM olympiad people and I also get a shot at HPSM and CMU during the RD round; on the other hand, applying to UPenn ED actually gives a direct boost unlike Yale REA, and my school has a good track record with UPenn (I think we sent 6-7 people there this year).

Does anyone else have any advice on what I should do? Thanks!"
ux7vs9,3,2022-05-24,Should I quit my job and how do I do it when my boss is being hostile?,forresearchproject,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ux7vs9/should_i_quit_my_job_and_how_do_i_do_it_when_my/,"Hi this is going to be VERY chaotic and long. I'm just incredibly baffled by what happened today and I don't know what to do, but I do know that I need to leave as soon as possible. 

To Preface: I work for a small (~12 people) nonprofit that is part of a larger organization, and we have a Board who doesn't really give a shit about anything, but their job is to essentially hire/fire the President &amp; CEO (who is my boss) and make sure we're doing well financially/keeping up with our mission. I started this job as an intern 3 years ago, and this was my first-ever internship. I am now somehow working full-time as the manager of my one-man ""department"". There's an annual conference that our HQ hosts, and this year it's in TX. My boss asked if I wanted to go and said it wasn't mandatory. I respectfully decline, and they were okay with that. 

I've been thinking about moving on to another job or going to grad school for about 1 year now. My internship was a baptism by fire: nobody taught me anything, so I depended on myself a lot to learn Adobe Creative Suite and other highly sought-after skills in my profession. My boss, even though she hired me, worked with me for 3 years, and wrote my job description, has admitted to not knowing what I do. I am the only person who does the graphic design, social media, and other marketing for everyone across 3 different offices in the state, so I'm always slammed at work with no support. Every time I ask for any sort of professional development or say that I have a lot of work for one person and would like some help, they always give me a pep-talk or brush me off without addressing my concerns. I've been secretly applying for jobs and interviewing on and off for a few months with nothing panning out yet. 

Fast forward to today. Remember how I told you my boss asked if I wanted to go to the conference and I said no? Well, I heard her telling my office mate that I was going with them and 2 other coworkers. 5 minutes later I received a ""Sign up for the conference today!"" email from my boss, so I call them to remind them that I'm not going. I hear what I thought was conversation between them and someone else before they say hello. They sound completely normal on the phone: happy, etc. I say hello and ask if it was still alright if I skipped out on the conference. Their demeanor changes to just confused. They ask if I was alright and I say of course, and I explain to them that there is a reason that I didn't want to talk about right now (because I thought there were people in the car with them), but I would discuss with them later. After a long pause, they ask ""Are you trying to leave?"" I didn't know what to say because I wanted to be transparent with my boss, but I didn't want to have this discussion over the phone with other people present; however, there was a long enough pause for a non-verbal ""yes"", so I just say ""Yes. I'm so sorry this is awkward."" and explain that I just think it's time to move on. 

I can tell they're slightly offended, and they say that we need to discuss this during our weekly meeting, which was 3 hours from then. I say okay and we hang up. I can tell they're upset but I'm kind of confused already as to why? So the meeting rolls around and they call me. I pick up the phone and again they sound perfectly happy and normal. They asked what I was working on and I explained that I'm starting to work on a few flyers for upcoming events we're hosting. Perfectly normal conversation. Then, when it comes time to talk about our conversation from this morning, their demeanor COMPLETELY changes. They are upset with me because I ""disrespected"" them by calling and being ""flippant"" about ""quitting over the phone"". I understand where they're coming from and where this miscommunication happened. I let them finish before I apologize for making them feel that way. I had a lot of respect for my boss and I was mortified to learn that I made them feel disrespected, although I was blindsided by the change in demeanor. I tell them that I hear them and I apologize for making them feel that way, and try to explain what my intention was: to have an open and honest conversation about how I think my life might be going in a different direction which is why I didn't want to go to Texas. I didn't know if I was going to be around and I didn't want to waste the organization's money by lying to my boss and saying I wasn't planning on leaving soon. I also wanted to let Boss know as soon as possible so they can be ready to start hiring and don't have to scramble when the time comes for me to leave. Maybe that was a stupid decision on my end, but before today, Boss has never given me reason to not trust them with something like this. I also mention that I could have sworn I heard other people in the car with them and they say that there wasn't (although there was whispering when we hung up), so I write it off as them listening to a podcast and apologize for how I handled the call earlier and said ""Maybe we shouldn't have had this conversation when you were in the car, and had this conversation face-to-face instead. We could have done that better."" They completely ignore my apology and tell me that I need to ""acknowledge"" that I made them feel unappreciated and disrespected; they also threw in a nice little kick in the balls: ""I invested so much in you."" 

I was completely taken aback. My boss has never really helped me when I needed it: every time I asked to hire another person (intern, equal, boss, etc.) they shut it down because we didn't have the money to, but then turned around and allowed my office mate to start searching for 2 new people to work under him. They raise their voice continue to tell me how disrespectful I was, saying things like ""You know, if this was any other organization, you'd be fired already"" and telling me to ""choose my next words carefully"" and telling me that they're ""working on the budget for next fiscal year, which included salaries"" and how we were ""supposed to have a completely different conversation today"", which makes me think they were threatening to fire me and/or take away any potential pay raises. Every time I apologized and tried to reiterate my intentions and how mortified I was I made them feel that way, they would interrupt me and tell me that I needed to acknowledge how I made them feel. After the 4th apology, I took a deep breath and said ""Boss, I don't know how else to convey to you that I truly am sorry, and part of apologizing is acknowledging that I did you wrong"" It's at this point I'm starting to think that a lot of their strange anger towards me is just personal matters surfacing: a coworker once told me about their concerns for our financials and the fate of our office. 

So they moved on to how I blamed everything on them at the beginning of the call. I think back to my ""Maybe we shouldn't have had this conversation when you were in the car, and had this conversation face-to-face instead. We could have done that better."" and told her that I felt like she was putting words in my mouth because I didn't say THEY needed to do something different; I said WE need to do something different, meaning that I also messed up in the moment. They didn't like that answer. So they move on to me wanting to go to Grad school. They told me that grad school only made sense for a coworker who recently decided to quit to get their masters degree (something boss was completely okay with). They asked why I was leaving. I said I just wanted to expand on the skills I taught myself here, and either grad school or working with someone who is proficient in the programs I use was the best way to go in my opinion. 

They are raising their voice at me, using (what I perceived as) threatening language, and completely disregarding my attempts to make this right. They keep berating me and ripping into me until finally I tell them that this conversation is no longer professional. It is starting to become a confrontation and that they need to take a deep breath. This goes on for around an hour until I felt completely drained and decided to throw in the towel with this conversation. I apologize again and tell them everything they want to hear just to get them off of the phone sooner so I can cry in peace. Miraculously I never lost my temper or cried. I just kept my cool and tried to calmly stand up for myself when necessary and steer the conversation back to just that: a conversation. Finally, they decide that they're done, so they just say ""lets just reset this conversation."" Like, easy for you to say, Boss, but alright I guess. 

Their demeanor changes back to the boss I know: kind, happy, kind of trying to be helpful, etc. They ask how they can keep me. In my head I'm already thinking about quitting tomorrow. They continue on with business as usual, asking me to draft a thank you letter to donors, and then we hang up. I cry and draft my resignation letter. 

How do I peacefully quit? This is my first professional job, and I've always given a 2 week notice. I'm thinking that I need to go through our Board chair, tell them that I'm quitting, telling them why, and giving them the letter to give to Boss, stressing that I absolutely do not want to talk to Boss after today. I'm genuinely concerned that presenting Boss with my resignation letter would set them off again or rehash this. I'm not afraid of Boss really, but I just really don't feel like being berated again for no reason. I know I was thinking about quitting anyway, and I didn't like this job, but I really wanted me leaving to be as easy as possible. I wanted them to be able to quickly hire someone again whenever I decided to leave. I constantly give my all to this nonprofit even when they don't deserve it, but now I feel like I have to leave for my own mental health and professional growth. 

Professionals of Reddit: What do? 

Tl;dr: For 3 years, I've been the only person at my organization that does my job. I've asked my boss for professional development and/or support bc of long workload multiple times with little to no help. Today when asked why I didn't want to go to a conference, I confessed it was bc I was thinking about leaving. Boss went on emotional rant and threatened to fire me/take away a potential pay raise. Is there a right way to quit though our Board chair without talking to Boss?"

4. For those of you with a Korean or Chinese background, are there any local online communities where I could connect with people at Waterloo?

Thanks so much in advance :)"
uxbv7k,4,2022-05-25,Disillusioned with programming: just boring grunt work that happens to be well-paid?,GlitteringDivide1366,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/uxbv7k/disillusioned_with_programming_just_boring_grunt/,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share a few random thoughts here with you and perhaps get an alternative viewpoint on this. Recently, I’ve become more and more disillusioned with what programming is and what is possible with it. When I talk about programming, I mean the conventional kind: frontend, backend, iOS/Android, games etc.

First, briefly about me: I’ve been programming for 7+ years and already did several internships at big tech companies. I also just completed my CS degree. When I started out, I was really intrigued by the possibilities of programming. Facebook, Google, Twitter were all amazing products that I loved, and I wanted to learn how to build them. Well, now that I know roughly how all of these web/cloud technologies work and I could actually build my own platform similar to these, it just seems that they’re all really doing the same thing and not really contributing anything interesting to the world. Essentially, most apps can be summarized by “move data in and out of a database and then display it in some fancy way”. Facebook and Twitter fit into these categories, although they obviously have a lot more to them like bot/spam detection etc. Same is also true for Airbnb, YouTube etc. The only fundamental problem they solve is how to scale, which is usually not too hard nowadays with tools like Redis, Kubernetes, Message Brokers etc. The only really meaningful part seems to be the “meat” of the problem: for Google it was PageRank and now the more advanced search algorithms they use, for Uber it’s the matching algorithm to maximize driver efficiency, for YouTube it’s the recommendation algorithm, for FB/Twitter it’s Algorithmic Feed/Suggestions and spam/bot prevention, etc. Essentially, to me it seems like we as Software Engineers are just reinventing the wheel every time we build some fancy Next.js app to do something that’s already been done thousands of times in a similar way. The only really interesting things to do seem to be related to math, which I did not study. I know a bit of it, but just the typical CS undergrad curriculum. How do I resolve this conflict within myself? Or is programming really just dry and mundane grunt work to make the ideas of other, much smarter people a reality?"

I am 22 years old and a recent graduate. I currently work as a remote intern at a startup company and I have worked there for the past 8 months. The work has helped to learn web development concepts but I am currently looking for new opportunities.

In my plate I have two offers but I was looking for some guidance on which to go for. 

One is for a local company that is offering 50k for the first three months as a trial period and then 60k if they like my work. I believe that I would fit well but I do not believe that the tech is challenging enough for me to grow in.

On the other hand there was a company that I applied for in their new grad software engineer program which is a decently known finance company. They said that they like my skillsets and would offer an 8 week paid internship (20 an hour) instead of the junior position.

I was wondering in your opinion if you could give some guidance on what I should go for. Since I changed my major one semester before Covid I always felt like there are gaps in my knowledge and I believe that an 8 week in person internship would really help. The tech stack is also something I believe would be great to learn. On the other hand if they don’t give a full time return offer I’m scared of going back to square 1 and having to explain to interviewers why I couldn’t get a return offer. Also the 50k/60k would be a huge jump compared to my current salary and it would hurt to say no to that.

Pls help"
uxdknk,11,2022-05-25,Research Project Idea,Sad_Avocado_4711,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uxdknk/research_project_idea/,"Hi! I will be an EECS junior in the next fall semester. After having some industry experience (one internship last summer, one this upcoming summer; both in backend/fullstack dev), I think directly working after undergrad might not be for me and wanna try something new like a research opportunity (in any field really, system related ones might be more aligned with my current experiences but ml interests me a lot like all other students lol). 

However, all my previous experiences are centered around web dev using Java or Go, and I also haven’t taken many senior courses (only 61a b c and 170). Although I got A/A+ in them, it doesn’t seem like it would help me in conversation with prof/PhD student.

To make up for it, I’m thinking abt doing a more involved side project this summer to show case my interest and pick up some useful skills (more importantly just be noticed by researchers). 

But I don’t have any idea of what kind of project will be liked. So I wanna ask if anyone did something similar to get a research position and mind sharing some ideas. Any comment and input is greatly appreciated! 

Also if anyone used the DARE program, do you have any comment on that (does people actually get picked, is the competition high)?"

I'm interested in programming, and since my degree was focused on it, it's not something new to me, and SRE seems to fit.

My questions are:

1. How can I prepare for it? I know of Google's book and plan on reading on that. I'm using Leetcode and Hackerrank to practice more programming, but is there some kind of program or application I could try and do that will help me learn concepts helpful for the interview?

2. I'm looking to apply for Google first, and then try others like Meta. What other companies are recommended for positions like these?

3. What country offers the best QoL and positions for that job? I've heard Dublin and Zurich are the best places for Google SRE in Europe, but I've heard both these places are very expensive (although Zurich doesn't tax much). I'm interested in London too, but don't know how good does the income in these places compares to CoL and if it's even possible to try and go live in London after Brexit."

I would prefer having a degree in either Finance, Economics or Stats. I want to transition into Data Science.

The problem is, my GPA is very poor-5.3,  no previous experience, no internships or no projects (lmao). 

So I thought of completing some udemy courses before applying but I doubt if that makes me eligible and my resume stand out.

Internet is filled with vast information so I wanted to make sure for last time whether my chances of moving abroad can be turned into reality.

Because if not, then I would like to give up that thought and look for jobs here. I don't want to waste my time anymore thinking that moving abroad is doable for me.

 I want to move to USA or Germany, because of good pay &amp; quality of life. It'll be a bonus if I could make this happen in this year itself.

I wanted to apply for an Embedded Software Engineering internship. For some background, I am more familiar with programming (such as C++, python, Java, and a little bit of Assembly). Currently I am interning as a Validation Engineer in a automotive manufacturing company where I write test scripts in CAPL, a C based language. 

My question is what topics should I familiarize myself with before applying to this internship? Also, I'm assuming I should get good at C, so what are some good resources to practice and understand C? I am currently doing leetcode in C, but it's pretty hard to find explanations for some of these coding problems.

Thank you!"
uxi095,1,2022-05-25,Are programming jobs actually that bad ?,doctorcharlie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uxi095/are_programming_jobs_actually_that_bad/,"Hello, i have posted this question elsewhere, but figured this place would be better.

// PREFACE 

(Don't have to read) \*//

To preface, the question kind of impplies that programming jobs are bad for everyone, that is just a poor choice of words, but I am unsure as to how to word it better.

So basically, I am a pretty big nerd, and have been one since i was a teenager. I have always dabbled with computers and certainly know way more than your avarage joe. I managed to code my own (pretty simple) e-commerce store within a few weeks, just by googling and stackoverflowing. I have however never really done any serious coding for fun. The only time i did was in school or out of necesity. 

When i went to college, i chose Biochem. Bad decision. I really liked calculus, physics etc, but hated the actual bio and chemistry parts, haha. When i was in my third year, i did an internship and figured - hell no, i can't do this. So i dropped out and started the e-commerce store i was talking about earlier. It did well enough, but eventually i slipped into a pretty shitty state of deppresion. I am just very bad at motivate myself, unless i have an ax above my head. I was an extreme workhorse in school, easily studying for 12 hours every day, but became the most lazy, sloppy piece of shit in the last two years.

This sent me into a state of panic. I am really unsure as to what to do, and i know the only way to slip out of this state is to get a job. I won't be able to start any kind of bussiness with my current level of motivation. So i came up with a plan.

I would like to attend a bootcamp. Firstly because i have dabbled with coding before and found it decently fun (not my life calling though) and secondly because you can attend jobs that have actual perspective without getting a college degree, which is pretty rare where I am from. A lot of other jobs are manual shit jobs.

// ACTUAL QUESTION

After making the decision to start persuing programming i started googling around if work as a programmer is doable without being obssesed with coding. Don't get me wrong, i find it fun, but it's not my life calling. I have hobbies which i care more about.

When looking around the internet, i started noticing a lot of cynical ass gatekeeping though.

Scenario: Someone asks what it's like to be a programmer

Reaction: Some coding vet swarms in and just shits on the guy. Starts talking about how coding is a terrible job, about how you will soon be envious of the guy mowing the lawn etc.

I am not trying to sound like i gave up on pursuing happiness, but i feel like a lot of these people don't understand what a job is. There's a very specific group of people who are just 10/10 in love with their job and that's great. But i just don't feel like that is realistic for everyone. There's people working 10x more strenous jobs, getting a 4th of pay as a programmer - and they are doing it. I feel like this mentality that your job has to be something that you'd do all day, even if you didn't get payd is super ''sunshine and rainbows'' and will ultimately drive someone, who just doesn't have that kind of passion, into insanity. I have spent 1 year sitting around home, being jobless and depressed because i was trying to think of something which will make extremely happy and get me paid. But i feel like persuing coding, which i find PRETTY fun is a pretty good option, considering the avarage wage and number of job openings for a coder. 

You can live a very fullfiling life when you make decent money, have a job you don't completely hate and take care of your friends and family imo."

DISCOVERY

Senen'Das Vanue was sitting at her terminal in the NERAN scientific observation post. The current shift was a skeleton crew, as always. Getting a masters in astronomy with a minor in ship engineering and landing a job with one of their planet's largest space exploration wing of the government she didn't think that she would be in the boonies of her system. The farthest outpost they had established and it was a glorified satellite dish. To be fair it was several satellite dishes listening for transmissions from the nuclear research probes they had sent out for any evidence of life amongst the stars.

""*Sigh* If we haven't heard anything from the deep space probes since they were sent out over 100 dacs ago then there isn't anything out there... It's just us in this local group of stars."" Senen laments the screen in her boredom. ""At least in a few days I can request a transfer over to be a engineer for one of the shipping wings. At least I'll be doing something more than just listening to static and beeps... Wait, beeps? It's never beeped before."" She types at her terminal to isolate what she was hearing and after a few seconds discovered it was on all frequencies. She sighed again. ""Probably just a quasar being picked up... Can't wait to hear this pattern for the next week.""

The beeps continued and droned on into a discernible pattern. Short and long beeps toning away from her terminal and into the empty air around her. ""wait a minute... Quasars don't sound like that..."" The beeps continued in the pattern being toned out from the speakers. ""Is that... There's no way."" On her terminal she pulled up one of the programs she was told she would never have to use. It was a simple Vern to text program that used the mic in her terminal to decipher any Vern standard code she may come across. The tone continued and the program got to work. Within seconds Senen was staring at her screen in disbelief. ""It's Vern standard code? There's no way this is real."" The code was put into text that she didn't read all the way through before she was out of the room and down the hall heading to her supervisors quarters. This was big.

------------------------------------------

""Senen... There better be a good reason why you woke me up."" Delal'Ve Arct rolled to face the Vishan woman that was standing in her doorway clearly flustered and out of breath. 'Did she run all the way here?'

""DEL! You have to see this!"" Senen screamed from the doorway of her quarters and quickly jumped at her to start to drag her out of her bed. ""C'mon this is huge!""

""OK! OK!! I'm coming! Seriously, is the star dying or something? Feels like you're gonna rip my scales off."" Being dragged out in her underwear she didn't even have much of a chance to grab her shoes before she was being pulled through the facility she was in charge of. 43 individuals in total including the 10 maintenance workers, 5 security, 5 university interns and the 3 cooks.

""No! This might be terrible or amazing! I don't know yet!"" The excited Vishan kept pulling her supervisor to the primary observation room. Huge sprawling windows from floor to ceiling with blast shutters rolled to the top to let gravity do the hard work if there were ever a dangerous meteor shower or extremely high levels of radiation that would warrant the steel and concrete shutters to be dropped. As Delel was being dragged further into the room where at most five individuals sit at a time looking out to the massive satellite dishes made out of craters on the surface of Xen, she begins to hear beeping. Growing louder as they approached Senen's desk, the Vishan became even more excited as she saw what was on her terminal. A repeating list of characters were on the screen translated to text from Vern standard.

""Is this it?"" Senen looked at the slightly older woman with wide and confused eyes, her dual layered eyelids blinking in disbelief.

""Del, we're receiving a message in Vern and I was translating it when I ran to get you. I only saw one part of the message."" She points at the screen but Delal doesn't even pay it any mind, thinking it was being sent from inside the system.

""This was worth waking me up for, because...?"" Delal just wanted to get back to sleep. Life was boring enough out here even when her higher ups ask if she can don their heavy and cumbersome enviro suits to take soil samples from a new crater.

""Del! Just read it!"" Senen wasn't having any of it. Supposedly this was extremely important for her to be this excited. So Delal humored the younger woman and leaned in to read the text that was displayed on screen.

""This is... OK so that couldn't be translated to Entaric then... and her captain... This doesn't make sense, Senen."" She looks her left back at Sen

""Read the second part!""

""What is this...we come in... No way."" All at once what Senen was showing her hit her all at once. 'This isn't right! No this has to be some prank from a kid with an old radio back on Stenar. 'There's no way this is real.'

""It's been on repeat since we first started receiving it, whilst I was trying to tune it out I triangulated it, that's why I dragged you here. It's coming from upper orbit on Xen. I think that's them. That one bright spot."" Senen pointed to the same starry sky that Delal had seen for the past three dacs. There was a new star. Del could only stare at the new light shining amongst the countless others. ""Del? What do we do?""

There was no way to prepare for this. How could they? For the longest time everyone thought that travel to other planets outside their system was impossible and that the possibility of alien life was gone from everyone's minds in the scientific community and proof to the contrary was literally calling to them in Vern. ""Del?""

Delal turns to her counterpart that she had worked with for the past dac and could only answer with a big smile. ""We have someone calling, we should let them know we hear them.""

Getting to this point has taken so much work and I couldn't be more proud of myself. I've grinded away at school for 3 years, and spent half of last summer doing an FPGA project which ended up giving me this internship. I loved every second of that project, often times staying up very late at night, just as I would if I were playing some really fun video game when I was younger.

I'm just so stoked because I discovered this interest at the end of sophomore year when I learned about FPGAs in digital logic 2. Then my brother got me an FPGA for my birthday, and I was able to explore it further. I took my curiosity and slowly developed it into a career path. The entire summer, I'd wake up, work on the FPGA project, post any questions I had to r/FPGA, work out, go to work, then do as much as I could on the project until I felt tired and went to sleep. It kind of sounds miserable looking at that routine, but it was so much fun to get into that rhythm and learn something cool every day. Those at r/FPGA were such an outstanding source of help and I really can't thank them enough. I made a lengthy thank you post when I finished the project in September of last year.

I'm also so grateful to have my older brother, a professional EE currently. He showed me that it was possible to make something out of these ambitions coming from a single mother in a rural area. Massive inspiration. My mother as well, breaking her back to support us.

Then there's my school. I couldn't be happier with my choice. Every single teacher I've had (in my department) has been so god damn supportive and inspiring.

But I'll start the day after memorial day. I can't wait. Ever since I breezed through both interviews for Astranis, and got the offer in mid September of last year, I've been waiting for this. I almost wished I waited until December to apply so it wouldn't feel like I've waited this long for the internship (not actually though haha). As much as I look forward to this, it's definitely scary. It'll be the first time I've worked 40 hour weeks, and it's something with a lot more at stake than just washing dishes at a college dining hall lol. Like this will be big boy shit. I'm confident in my ability, but man being ""alone"" in the real world is scary. Either way, this is going to be awesome. I can't express how much I've been looking forward to this for the past \~9 months. It's been too damn long and I'm so ready to take the largest step yet, career-wise.

Using an interest and skill I have to help develop satellites that connect the world via internet? I honestly can't think of much that gets me more excited than that.

I had to let this out, I cannot wait"

uxk9vx,6,2022-05-25,Is it worth it applying to new grad positions with a year left of school?,Missing_Back,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uxk9vx/is_it_worth_it_applying_to_new_grad_positions/,"I have about a year left of school (taking summer classes, then the fall and spring semester). I work a part time web dev job at my school. All throughout college I put off looking for an internship, and now I'll graduate without one. So I'm trying to get ahead of the curve with applying for full time positions.

Right now I'm doing an hour of leetcode daily and trying to maintain a decent GPA. I have 4 projects on my resume. Should I just put my head down and keep this grind going, and start applying towards the end of the year/early next year? Or is it worth my time to try applying to stuff right now?"

uxlgke,4,2022-05-25,I have got admission offer at a good US University for MS in CS but the cost is too high ... what should I do?,Alex55936,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/uxlgke/i_have_got_admission_offer_at_a_good_us/,"I have previously posted this same thing on r\developersindia and I got excellent responses there, so if you're one of those people then thanks a lot. The reason why I am posting this again here is because there are a lot of NRIs (supposedly) here in this sub and I want get their perspective on my predicament. Thanks in advance!! 

Hello everyone! I'm in a serious dilemma here. I have recently got an admit from a good(although not very good) US university (University of Texas at Arlington)  for MS in Computer Science for fall 2022 term. A little background on me, I've been preparing for this for almost past 4 years. But now that I have finally received the admit offer, I'm having second thoughts.


There are mainly two reasons for this. Firstly, the total costs for masters is going to be about 45 Lakhs . Now this is the worst case scenario which is assuming I don't get any assistantships or scholarship or neither any internships during the masters which could reduce these costs significantly. But I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for the worst case scenario which is 45 Lakhs loan at 10.5% interest rate. A Little more background on me- I come from a really weak financial background, my father is just a school teacher and just earns about 40k per month. Also he has no savings as most of it got used recently in some construction work (we are building our first home, up until now we were living on rent , didn't even own a house) .  Now for the past 1.5 years I have been working as a software developer in a service based firm and have savings of about 4Lakhs. And  sadly, that's all we have. Although my father is ready to take 10 lakhs from his PF,  but I  don't want him to do that . If my whole family pushes hard then we can probably manage to get by with the Loan. But our condition with be extremely vulnerable as my father's monthly earnings will be spent paying interest of my Loan. 


Sorry for this long rant, but here is the thing, on one hand If a get a good job in the US(anything above $70k or 50Lakhs)  after masters then all is good , I will payoff my Loan in 3 years of OPT and if I get H1B extension then will also save a lot and will probably be set for life. But If I don't get the job in US then all hell will break loose on me and it will most probably also affect my family. I've calculated and it comes to about 50k payment per month for 15 years . So either I get job quickly in some years or end up paying more than 2 times the Loan amount over the span of 10-15 years. This is totally nightmare stuff which is actually keeping me awake at some nights. 


The second reason for my dilemma is that if I drop the plan for MS then I can continue my current job and comfortably switch in some time and eventually land a good paying job (15-20 LPA) here in the next 5-6 years. This situation is much more comfortable although not as much lucrative as the best case scenario in the 1st situation. But choosing this option will make all my 3+ years of hardwork and struggle meaningless.



 For past 3 years I was focused on and worked hard on getting an admit in a good US university,  that's the reason why I didn't get good job in the first place after completing my bachelor's. This is the reason why I'm not able to move away from this idea of doing MS.  Some of you might look at this as the sunk cost fallacy and I agree. But there's another way to look at this , atleast in my mind. All my life I've been hearing, watching people saying that there's no gain without risk,  so many times that at this point it has almost been romanticised. I'm not a person who lives by slogans, but deep down a voice in me says what if it's true, what if it's just like a filter to check who has the courage to make it big in life. My mind is all messed up right now, it is constantly producing arguments in favour and in against of the situation. 


If anyone of you have ever been in a similar situation in life then please lend me some of your insights.

I would like to know what is your point of view here? What should be my best course of action now? Should I stay or should I go? 

I request you all to provide some suggestions, advices or insights. 


TLDR :-. I got admission offer in a decent US university for masters, but the overall cost of attendance is too high for me. And due to my weak financial background, taking huge loan is also extremely risky. So I'm unable to decide whether I should  take the risk or not."

The first one was a help desk and general support job with an intro to some sysadmin systems like Active Directory, SCCM and Powershell. My current internship is now in a company that had a hand in the cloud, as a provider, but I am in a general intern role, working with every team throughout the term. My education is also another dilemma bc I recently applied to do a two degree program, Degree in Networking and Systems and Degree in Cybersecurity, and I’m not sure how that will pan out but we will see! Anyways… 

My main dilemma is with AWS certs. Do I go all out while I’m in college and get an AWS cert and try to get more experience in my early career. Or, the other option is waiting till a devops opportunity falls to my feet and I will be working with AWS (thinking hopefully the cert is easier to get after the experience). Let me know what you guys think and if you all can share any experience you had, thank you!!"
uxm56i,427,2022-05-25,The Swearing Jar,CornerCornea,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uxm56i/the_swearing_jar/,"There is Gacy's clown palette, right? Someone puts it on, they start hearing voices. It's said that the two people who tried it on last, a young intern and an officer having an affair, both died. One that same night with a gun shot to the head and the other later in an institution from refusing to eat. Then there's the infamous 1911 that can be heard clicking in its bag of blood on the shelf, still trying to cock itself. There are others aren't there, mostly bagged and stored in police custody, with some evidence rooms packed with more haunted gilt than Ed and Lorraine Warren's museum, never seeing the light of day until they're shown in one of those straight to TV documentaries.

Cursed things created in the last 100 years, because, it's not as if evil sleeps. Not as if in the absence of God in the past millennium means that the Devil is gone. If anything, it means the present reign is now. And what happened to my family was any other page in these uncertain times.

Though it didn't feel that way when it happened.

Mother and I were sitting in the kitchen nook in the morning, a three piece window cut in diamond facets with a wooden bench that peered out to the lawn. It was my favorite place in the house. I was a little girl then, and asking her silly questions about life and love.

""How do you die a thousand times,"" I asked.

Mother brushed my hair away from my face and said, ""You love the wrong person twice. The first time you die nine-hundred and ninety-nine times. The second time, only once.""

""Then I shall never fall for love,"" I answered jubilantly. ""For love seems painful.""

Mother smiled and looked into my eyes, ""If love is pain. Then come here let me hurt you,"" as she drew me close. 

That afternoon, my father abandoned us. He had run off with his secretary while I was at school, taking anything that wasn't bolted down except for the twins and I. It was also the day that Mother started speaking into the cookie jar.

It hadn't always started life as a cookie jar. I don't know what it had been before but I had a feeling that it was much older than it looked. The thing was made of thick clay that was fire burnt. Its belly was round and could have been a pot at one point. It was deep too, enough for a child's forearm to disappear beneath the rim. The pale orange lid didn't match at all, it seems to have been added later. The jar had sat above the shelf near the fridge so that the twins wouldn't be able to reach it. As they were always scraping the bottom for chocolate chip cookies, and according to Mother were beginning to resemble tiny cherubs.

I had come home that day, unaware of the scene that I would be walking into. I opened the front door and dropped my bag off near the coat hanger. Before I could announce my return I hear a thick crunching of bones splintering down the hall to the kitchen. It sounded like when our neighbor's horse ran through a gopher field, its front leg snapping as the beautiful thing came crashing into the dirt.

Back then, our neighbor, Old John, came running out to the pasture. Nearly sinking into a hole himself before he was able to kneel next to his beloved companion. He took one look at the mangled leg and brushed the horse's hair, ""You'll never be able to run again."" I feel as if the horse understood him because it started crying. Later, Billy Braxton from school told me that horses are too dumb to cry. That water only leaves their eyes to clear debris. And that I was stupid for believing such a thing. The old man too, for not putting the beast down.

That sound was once again clear as day in my ears as I walked toward the kitchen. The pictures on the wall shuddering in their frames as I passed. I could see a picture myself in one of them, juddering, making both of our lower lips tremble.

When I stepped into the room, the twins huddled around my knees.  I could feel their tiny bodies shivering as I watched Mother pound the cleaver into the butcher's block, missing several times and sinking the blade into the wooden countertop.

She was whispering and cleaving, waving the steel in the air at times when she pulled her arm back and dropped it down like a hammer.

""Stop.""

She looked up. Her eyes swirling in anger for the disruption. And in that moment I wanted to flee. To drag the twins with me if I must, but her stare chiseled me stone cold, unable to speak another word.

In a blink, that look disappeared from her face, and I could once again recognize the woman in front of me. Though I couldn't shake what I had witnessed. Who was the woman that had been staring at me earlier, and who was this woman now? Which one was real? Which one was fake? Or were they both real?

Mother's look softened, ""Come on,"" as she reached for the cookie jar on the shelf, and turned it over. The chocolate chips rained from the mouth and onto the table. ""Take one,"" she beckoned. The twins ran toward her, their fears forgotten for they were young and resilient.

I was still hesitant to approach as Mother opened the refrigerator and pulled out a pitcher, the scratched red lettering read Strauss, ""Milk?"" She poured four glasses without waiting for an answer. She stuffed her half cookie into her mouth, brushing off the crumbs from her fingers before reaching into the jar to wipe it clean with a rag.

""When I was little, your grandma had this swear jar in the kitchen. If anyone spoke a word that they shouldn't have. Then they were to leave a hay penny. Your grandfather and uncles broke the rules most often and were always found digging - down to the lint in their pockets to pay up."" She put the jar onto the table. ""I thought we'd start it back up.""

""But we don't have any money, mommy.""

She stroked Joe's hair, ""I know love. That's why we'll only swear into the jar. So no one can hear what we say. That's how we'll pay this debt.""

""I can curse?"" Susie piqued as she took a bite out of a cookie. The other cookies in front of her, each with a single bite taken out.

""You can say anything you want into the jar. Watch."" Mother lowered her head into the hole, disappearing her nose and eyes below the rim until her entire face was sealed tightly against it. Her chest heaved as she screamed into it. But all I heard was the 'woh woh woh' vibrations of the clay kicking against the counter. It reminded me of whales being recorded underwater.

After several seconds, Mother put both hands on either side of the jar and pulled it away which caused a large suctioning noise that made Joe laugh. When her face reappeared, I could see the rim marked welt, still crimson around her face. She stared back at us with her eyes wide and renewed elation, ""See? I feel much better. And it wasn't horrible, was it?""

Joe and Susie shook their heads.

""I couldn't even hear what you were saying,"" Joe assured her.

""Me neither!""

Mother turned to look at me, and I shook my head a little.

""Good,"" she smiled. Putting the lid on and putting the jar back onto the top shelf in the corner.

From that time on, mother would take the jar down and scream into it instead of showing us her anger. And after she had done so, she seemed all better. There were even times when I would see her sitting at the dining table, the jar opened, its lid rolling back and forth from the tip of her fingers as she spoke to it like an old friend. Telling it of our misdeeds or moments of our lives, and even some of our secrets.

That changed one Spring when Mother started leaving the house midmorning. She seemed happier, and the jar was seen less often on the dining table.

We lived in a small town so word spread quickly that Billy's dad, Mr. Braxton and Mother had been spotted entering the local theater during the matinee on various days of the working week.

Five months later they got married before the baby started showing. I never got to meet my little sister. She had come prematurely and didn't make it. Mother named her Cornelia, and buried her in the yard next to the cherry tree.

This seemed particularly hard on Mr. Braxton, who had lost his first wife during the birth of their second child. He turned to the bottle and spent many late nights out at the edge of town, leaving his son, Billy, with us. The twins didn't seem to mind Billy too much, but I couldn't get a single sentence in with that crude lad. He was always shouting and hammering away whenever we spoke, so I had nearly given up making peace, instead, I threw the nastiness right back at him.

As the nights wore on and Mr. Braxton's drinking got worse, the swearing jar spent more time on the dining table. Then one day, Mr. Braxton came home early, his clothes reeked of alcohol as he stumbled inside. His face a bloody red from the alcohol, as he dropped a glass onto the floor. It shattered to pieces. I gathered the twins up the stairs before they cut their toes. We huddled near the banister as we strained our ears below.

""I told you it wasn't me,"" he slurred.

""What are you talking about,"" I heard Mother say. ""You're drunk again.""

""I'm good,"" he says. ""Down here. I'm all good. It's you whose filthy,"" he spits. ""Mary-Anne's just given birth. Healthy bouncing baby boy,"" he hiccupped. ""And it's mine.""

""How could you do this to me,"" Mother pieced together. ""After John ran away...""

""Ran away,"" Mr. Braxton scoffed. ""You're still going with that?""

""After John-""

""Oh shut up! And go tell your lies to your god damned jar."" I could hear cupboards opening as a glass is set on the table. ""Billy,"" the man yelled. ""Bill?""

""Get the hell out of my house,"" Mother demanded.

""Gladly,"" he managed. ""Bill,"" he called out again. ""Big Bill,"" he shouted before climbing the stairs. He rounded past us without even glancing down. ""Bill,"" he shouted as he threw open multiple doors. But they were all empty. ""Billy,"" he shouted again as he went back to the kitchen. ""Where's my son,"" he roared. The pots and pans hanging from the ceiling shook and clattered as the dining table shifted on its legs when I peered into the kitchen.

""He's not here,"" Mother growled.

""Where's my boy,"" Mr. Braxton grabbed Mother and rung her shoulders. ""Where is he!""

""How should I know? I'm not his mother!""

Mr. Braxton let her go and stumbled backward, laughing, ""That's something you're right about.""

At those words, Mother started throwing things at him.

I scurried back upstairs when a pot flew past me and crashed into the hall. I could hear them struggling for a bit and the deafening boom of the fridge falling flat on its face before an inaudible wail emerged into a full on siren. It was so mind numbingly loud that I had to cover my ears, the twins were crying when I closed my eyes. My heart drummed in my chest, beating itself as if trying to escape out of my throat and away from this noise when it began to sound like crinkled parchment being pummeled in the kitchen before it suddenly stopped. The noise dropping dead silence unto our house. Completely gone. Even the walls stopped shaking.

When I found the courage to walk downstairs, mother was on the kitchen floor. Every cabinet and drawer was thrown open, all of their contents were  strewn on the ground or stuck in the walls. Mother's dress was ripped on one side and the jar sat between her legs. I watched as she got up and righted one of the shelves and placed the swearing jar back in its place. The jar looked the same as it always had, except for one key difference. The lid on top of it was now beet red.

Locals would later report to the Sheriff that they did perhaps see a man drunkenly stumble toward the creek where Bill often hung out with the other high schoolers. A quarry workers said he saw several men throughout the day wading through the shallow waters; one of those men even looked as if he was searching for something as night fell.

All I know is that I never saw Mr. Braxton leave our kitchen, and no one would ever see him again. Many townsfolk assumed he drowned. Others think he left town after he sobered up once he realized what he had done to my mother, leaving with his Christian shame.

When Billy got home that night, his stuff was packed in a suitcase on the porch. The door wasn't locked but he never tried it. Billy took his stuff and left. I heard he caught wind that his father may have been spotted in Moro County at a bar. It seemed plausible enough so the boy hopped a train going in that direction.

Around midnight I went downstairs and found Mother sprawled on the kitchen floor. All of the lights were off, and only the moon laid on her figure. She was bent over the jar, speaking into it. Crying to the endless bottom as she couldn't bear to lose another man. I listened as she blamed herself for love and filled the jar with her blistering tears.

After that, Mother was never quite the same. She was curt with me and even doted on Susie, but her hugs never felt as warm again. Even her food began to taste different, when she had once been a wonderful cook before.

""Joe,"" her voice was stern these days with him. ""Are you ready?""

""Yes mommy, I'm all-""

""What did I tell you about calling me mommy,"" I could see her eyebrow raise dangerously. ""You're the man of the house now. You need to start acting like it.""

He was all but seven then, the year was 1983. Summer had come and gone and the seasons were falling into winter. I watched as he sniffed the snot building in his nose back into his throat, as he swallowed it down and nodded.

""Susan,"" she called out. Her voice softer when my sister appeared, ""Susie, do you want anything while we are out?""

""Where are you going?""

""To the market.""

Susie peered from between the balusters, ""Could you get me some tangerines? I like the small round ones with the leaf still on them.""

Mother smiled, ""I'll get you six oranges.""

""Tangerines mommy, not oranges.""

""Tangerines,"" she quoted back.

I watched as Mother took Joe with her. He was never out of her sight these days. Whenever she left the house, he would accompany her. Other than school, he was chained to her side. I watched as the two of them disappeared.

""I'm bored,"" Susie spoke from behind me. I nearly jumped out of my skin. I had been skittish for several weeks now, feeling like eggshells beneath me.

""Want to play outside?""

She smiled and nodded.

We got out to the yard and played tag for a bit, but that is only so much fun for two people. So we eventually started picking through the grass for any loose objects left over from the Civil War. Old John had once found arrowheads at the corner of his lot.

I was searching through the field when I saw a gopher appear.

I was reminded of the gnarled leg of the horse, but I screamed because of the finger clenched between its two yellow stained front teeth. The disconnected joint was blue and rotten, the sinew falling off the bone, yet the gnarled fingernail had continued to grow even after death. It twisted vividly backwards, seemingly curling at me to come closer. I watched as the gopher disappeared with the finger back into its hole.

""Did you see that?""

I nearly jumped out of my knickers when I felt Old John's breath on my hair.

""Did you see that,"" he repeated.

I shook my head.

""You saw it. I know you saw it."" He took off his cap and wiped his brow. ""That was a man's finger, weren't it?""

In two days everyone in town seemed to have heard about the finger. We couldn't leave our property without getting dirty looks. Mother waved it away and loudly quoted James 1:26.

It wouldn't be 2 days later when I was woken during midnight, that I realized how far word had spread.

The screen door croaked loudly as it opened. I could hear the heavy boot steps fall as they headed toward the kitchen. I could hear Mother's voice...and then Billy's. They were yelling by the time I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes.

I got downstairs and looked into the kitchen as the yelling stopped. Mother was standing with her back against the fridge, her hands wrapped around the swearing jar. She had a nasty look on her face as she broke the red lid, and letting it crumble into the jar.

The house shook heavily, cracking the ceiling above me, sending dust below. I felt a pull come from my chest, it was like the drain at the bottom of a large pool. The frames on the wall tilted toward the kitchen, and I could see my horrified reflection in the glass as I screamed, but even that was eaten by the void. The walls clattered and utensils flew out of drawers as I grabbed the railing on the stairs.

My hair licking the air when I looked up to see Billy's head completely inside the jar. I could tell he was screaming by the way his chest was heaving. The veins on the side of his neck turning green and blue as they thickened with blood. His feet flailed pitifully against the ground. I could see Mother's silhouette behind him, holding the jar as she watched.

The mad gleam in her eye, shining as Billy's shoulders were tucked square against the lip, causing the suctioning to subdue for a blink.

And then the crunching began.

It was unlike anything I have ever heard before. At first his collar bone collapsed, and then his chest. I could hear his bones breaking as his tendons pulled and pushed their way down his torso toward his feet as he was sucked inside the jar. His skin stretching like an overfilled garbage bag, I saw a piece of his skull travel to where his stomach had been, its edges straining against the skin, screaming as his insides ballooned to his foot. Then the entire thing squeezed down in a popping noise, and made a pallid pink lid that sat on top of the swearing jar.

I ran up the stairs as Mother called after me, ""Can you come into the kitchen,"" she said. ""There's something I want you to look at.""

I locked myself in the twins bedroom and hid in their closet, watching the scraping of Mother's feet as she paced awkwardly outside. Banging on the wood from time to time before her footsteps disappeared.

I waited until morning as Susie began to stir, before opening the door. For the next few days Mother sat in the kitchen, never moving, the jar on the table. It was broken to pieces.

Eventually the Sheriff and his Deputy came to the house and took her in as a suspect for Mr. Braxton's disappearance, and later Billy's when he wasn't found.

When I knew the counts against her wouldn't stick, I asked Old John to dig near our house where we found the finger. And sure enough, he uncovered a body. It was my father's.

That happened more than 40 years ago and I had long put it behind me. But when I was watching the local news today, it featured a traveling artist that had come to town, they were known for restoring antiques. One of the techniques they employed was 'Kintsugi', a Japanese method of pottery repair that involved the use of gold as a bonding agent. It wouldn't have been a big deal if I didn't recognize the woman in line, holding pieces of a broken jar in a plastic bag. An eerie smile plastered on her face as she turned and looked straight into the camera.

My phone vibrated as a text message from Joe appeared, ""Did you know they let her out?""

I (24M) graduated college last fall. I am currently working an internship that runs through June 1st. My internship is remote, so I have been living with my parents to save money for a few months.

I recently accepted a full time position in my career field that begins mid June. It’s about a 40 minute commute from my parents house. 

My initial plan was to commute for the first couple months and feel out the new job. Then, after those couple months, I’d look for my own place out closer to my job.

Recently though, I’ve become discontent staying at my parents. I love my parents, but the house is often messy. They also own a dog (who I love), but he sheds everywhere. And I mean everywhere lol. You can’t put on an outfit without it getting caked in hair.

On top of this, I’ve been looking for a fresh start after college for a while now. I made quite a few mistakes in my time there, and have been slowly and steadily building myself to be a better and more consistent person. Although I feel like I have made huge leaps in working on myself, I still feel attached to my old self and the mistakes I’ve made. Hence the wanting of a fresh start, somewhere completely new and on my own.


I’m just looking for any kind of opinion or thoughts on the situation. I know the best thing to do would to be wait a few months before getting my own place. But I’m not sure how happy I would be in those months just waiting to move out. I feel like I will and should just ride it out, though.

I know it’s hard to gather the full insight from a Reddit post, but I would love to hear any feedback or suggestions! For reference too, my money situation is okay. I could comfortably afford the first few months of rent without receiving any income. But after that, I would need an income to afford it (which is why I think it’s best to wait on moving out, so I can 1) understand my job and how I like it, and 2) save money)."

My experience is limited, a few years of using SQL as an analyst (select queries, cte's, temp tables, window functions, some stored procedures), a brief internship as a DE (Azure environment but all I did was create and alter a few tables).

I know some Python and am working every day to improve all my skills but it seems like there's nothing for people who have &lt;1 year/2 years experience as a DE.

Every job says ""5+ years experience"" - I've found three entry level positions and thats it!

Where are the jobs?

Also, would it make sense to create a GitHub account just to show my code? And is there any tool or application that will allow me to integrate Git for free? I was thinking it might be helpful to prove I know how to create branches/pull requests/merges, etc.

Funny side note - recruiters call me relentlessly wanting to apply me for those 5+ year experience jobs and I'm like ""dude I dunno AWS, barely know Azure environments, and consider myself barely competent at T-SQL"" I'm honest with them and they don't care, still want to forward my resume to the hiring manager."

I recently landed a few interviews in network engineering + systems admin + information security at some really amazing (and dauntingly huge) companies, but I’m terrified of bungling them because I don’t know enough of what they expect me to.

The last networking course I took was a year ago so I don’t remember much, but the interviews are in a week so I think I’ll have enough time to study the essentials.

What are baseline skills will the interviewers expect me to have? Will I need to know Windows Powershell prior to the interview? Or like every port number ever?? These are probably silly questions, but I just really want to get these internships.

I learnt some basic JS and saw some more Advanced stuff like API calls and Async JS. I'm good at HTML though.

Long story short, I feel frustrated.

React is too hard. 

There is another intern though, who will work on the same project as I will. And thankfully, he is waaaaaaaay better than i am. even though he's almost same age as me. He started coding at a very early age (10 years old). when I only started at 18. 

Anyway, I probably won't contribute a LOT to this project, but I'm thankful for this internship, even though I don't fit in at all (everyone at the enterprise is waaaaay better and more experienced), but that's the thing. The reason they are better is because they have been doing this for longer period of time.

I only started programming three years ago. these people have been studying and working on projects for waaaaaay longer.

Right now, I'm probably nowhere near those people, but I know for a fact, after a few years, more projects, more hundreds of hours spent coding, i'll get to that level too.

uxqudl,6,2022-05-25,How do you deal with no breaks? Prospective Math Admit here interested in a potential career in CS,Bittah_Demon,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/uxqudl/how_do_you_deal_with_no_breaks_prospective_math/,"Prospective Intl Waterloo Math student here. Applied for CS but didn't get in.. still considering Waterloo due to the tech connections + I do in fact want to work in either ML, Start Up Culture or as a Quant ) in the future so learning Math isn't not good as long as I can do a computing minor. My goal for my degree is to learn about Thereotical CS but at the same time set myself up for even a traditional (albeit boring) career in traditional careers such as SWE which would need alot of programming. Apparently I just need to grind a bit of leetcode and onlinecourses in my freetime and CO-OP should provide me enough prep to survive even if I want to do a career in CS, right?

Well, I found out.. you gets have 3 terms of 4 months with no long breaks? What the fuck? For context, my alternative program is NUS CS and we have 3 summers off (our program is 4 years).. at most we spend 2 summers doing an internship (I also got into a 1 year program tho which allows me to work at a start up abroad, so make that 3 internships for me). On top of that.. we still have 5 weeks of Winter off, so it's not like we have no free time (Yes, we might be supposed to do side projects but.. atleast that's on our own time, you know?). I'm kinda confused - what's going on in Waterloo? I hear even your student terms are apparently INSANE (which makes sense since you cram... 4 years of modules in 3 years i guess), so when do yall relax? I have been reading alot of the subreddit's top posts to find out more and the answer is usually.. ""welcome to adult life?"". Is this an exaggeration or really how things are?

For more context about me, I do have Aspergers and quite severe Anxiety. Even the NUS workload does sound hard for me as I do struggle with motivation, but on the other hand I know how worthwhile Waterloo is, especially as someone who wants to work in America in the future and not Singapore."

Hi,

I'm based in NYC and was able to WFH since March 2020 due to the pandemic. I was planning to leave the city for awhile during that time but I just renewed my lease right before the shutdown.

Still able to WFH and my lease expiring this year and raising to a higher amount, I decided to stay in Michigan with family while searching for a new apartment planning to be back in NYC once I find a place..

I was honest, gave a heads up to my boss, informing I was being priced out and would stay out of the city for awhile. Now, people are asked to come in once a month, myself being unavailable but still logged in for team meetings and not falling behind on my work.

Yesterday, I was informed that my position is being eliminated and I'm being let go. Seems like a bad excuse as they hired interns for full-time jobs. My co-worker believes since I left too that I'm being let go. Has anyone here been left go for working remote? Just curious as I'm still trying to wrap my head around this.

Thanks in advance!"

I applied for an IT internship and they just reached out asking me to complete a 60 minute assessment. I don’t know what to expect? They did say to have calculator and scratch paper ready. The requirements described are pretty basic and nothing I shouldn’t be able to handle. 

I did some digging and the HR rep went to my school so maybe this is why I’m getting the Chance."
uxribx,3,2022-05-25,College Student Struggling With What I Need to Look For In a Job,OutsideTop13,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/uxribx/college_student_struggling_with_what_i_need_to/," 

I'm currently a college student that just finished my 3rd semester. So, I'm not incredibly skilled, but I'd like to get out of the fast-food industry now that I have some more experience under my belt and have something that relates to what I'm studying - like an internship. I'm planning to major in Computer Science and Business Administration, with a minor in Cinema &amp; Media Arts. On top of that, my experience mainly relates to having some pretty in-depth knowledge about the tech industry, which includes planning and building dozens of computers by now and having worked on a few YouTube projects in various roles, but nothing really big - so I have a decent amount of experience in Davinci Resolve, and very light in Premiere Pro. I *am* certified in Microsoft Excel, so I have experience in all of my areas of study.

My main problem is what do I look for? I'm not entirely familiar with the job market, as the job I've had for the last couple of years has been a result of me knowing the owner, but after a shift in management they reached back out to rehire me, so I have some decent experience and am reputable enough. What types of jobs am I supposed to look for as someone with my qualifications? If any? With my knowledge, would it be a good idea to put myself out there? I can't seem to find many jobs that I qualify for, that are part-time, in my area / remote that seem a good fit for me. A salesman for tech looked to be fun, but there weren't any part-time positions near me. I live in a kind of rural area, at least enough so that Best Buy, the closest store that sells computer parts, is a \~45 minute commute. I have some pretty fast internet and a powerful pc with lots of SSD storage at home, so I was looking at some remote jobs, like a virtual assistant, but at least where I was looking they don't seem to pay a whole lot more than what I already make, and require more work. That's another question I have: Should I look for a bump in salary, or would it be worth it enough to just get out of food and get into something I'm interested in?

Where should I look for jobs? I was filling out my Indeed resume, and I scored pretty high on a lot of the assessments. Experts in Typing, Computer Skills, Excel, and highly proficient in Technical Support. Are there any basic IT certifications out there that I can try and get to boost my resume? Sorry if this is a long read, thanks for making it this far! I'm just a little lost on this whole thing. Also throwaway because some of this information is a bit personal, but I'd appreciate any advice! Thanks!"

&amp;#x200B;

Student at a large university. I'm a transfer, and older. I used to fly airplanes, but I don't think its that relevant to CS. I'm going to take the summer off to deep dive into computers and ""get good"". Honestly, I don't really care for CS or ECE, it's just the only thing I see myself doing, I'm tired of working crappy jobs for no money and being a disappointment to my parents. I'm willing to put every effort, regardless of cost to physical health, mental, or lack of social life. That's my super power. I'm not very smart, but I try my best, and that's all I can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: I build and overclock, decent understanding of Windows, some Linux, some Mac, relatively good at figuring stuff out. I like legos. I like to see how things work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: Mentally insane and could probably give up and be on disability. Bad at taking care of self. Computers frustrate me and make me angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me what I need to get better at over the summer so I have a chance at being competitive with the other students. 

&amp;#x200B;

What more can I do to get a head start?

&amp;#x200B;

Do internships matter? What about projects? I could make a flight sim, but other than that, I don't really have any interest in anything, let alone CS or ECE. I'm just doing it for a paycheck, the opportunity to isolate myself from the work and still work, and so I can finally prove to myself that I'm not a failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, have a good day, peeps. :)"

Im a recent graduate with very perfect grades,  1460 SAT, and many APs under my belt. Unfortunately I fucked up bad and have to go to community college for at least 1 year. I have 2 options: I can stay  for 1 years and transfer to a better school. No strings attached there, they take all my credits and I’ll have a degree within 3 years. My second option is to transfer after 2 years to an EXTREMELY good computer science program. This is guaranteed admission so long as I meet the program requirements for the 2 years. However the catch is that I will have to repeat many classes throughout the 2 years because they don’t take any previous AP credit! If I were to go down this path it would take me 4.5 years to get my degree. I have checked the average pay of alumni after graduating and there is about a 20k difference in salary but the 4.5 program offers a lot more internship opportunities and access to some of the best professors in the nation. I have asked everyone I know and still cannot reach a conclusion. Thank you for your help."

uxt3a0,6,2022-05-25,Leaving job after 1 month and feeling like a scrub,anonymousalligator25,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/uxt3a0/leaving_job_after_1_month_and_feeling_like_a_scrub/,"Okay I posted on here before I’m sorry! I’ve been an anxious wreck and other job related forums wreak of LinkedIn propaganda and are making me feel bad. For context: I’m in grad school right now for communications/marketing (off for summer break). I live at home, have a good chunk in my savings, and don’t pay rent but was hoping to move out with the income from my job. 

I finished an internship mid-April and immediately after started a full-time job. I thought the job would be writing and comms and I really liked the team, but because of my misunderstanding (and their somewhat vague job posting) it ended up being all numbers/data. I have 3 learning disabilities, dyscalculia (issues with numbers/sequences), dyspraxia (issues with spatial reasoning) and ADHD. So the long instructions sheets and moving data from one database to the next to the next sheet to the next sheet has been impossible and stressful. I have been making mistakes left and right (even in proofreading and I’m an editor) because my brain is so scrambled.

Spoke to my therapist and career counselor and both said I should quit because it isn’t aligned. I’ve applied to 100+ jobs but haven’t heard back from any yet. Can someone please reassure me this is okay, and that I’m not a scrub? Anyone with shared experiences?"
uxtrad,0,2022-05-25,Questioning majoring in mechanical engineering,howdyhello764,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/uxtrad/questioning_majoring_in_mechanical_engineering/,"Hi everyone, I had a question about my current major choice. So currently, my major is mechanical engineering, I came into college a little nervous because I didn’t know anything about engineering, and because it is so male dominated I found it a little intimidating to join clubs since I did not know anyone. I know it is a little dumb but I recognize my mistakes now and I’m slowly trying to fix this. However, because of this I feel that I’m at a disadvantage since I don’t have as much “experience” as others in terms of clubs, and it might be harder to catch up, I found it hard to adjust to my university since I am a freshman and I focused on academics instead. I thought about switching to civil since I feel it may easier to compete with my peers in the future, but I’m torn between choosing civil which is usually thought of as having lower pay/ bad work life balance or mechanical, since I don’t have that many technical skills I’m kind of nervous that I won’t be able to find internships or even a job in the future, Can anyone talk a little more about their experience in finding these things and give me any suggestions??"

Im currently entering my 2nd year for a Computer Science major (in a community college and will transfer for 3rd and 4th for bachelor degree). Living in the US as an undocumented is really tough. I can’t get a driver license, FAFSA, and other federal related aids. I couldn’t get into my desired Univ because of financial problem, which i don’t want to take a loan on. They gave me $50k in scholarship, but I still have to pay $40k a year (because they count me as an international student).

Can I get any internship at all in the US, and be able to look for jobs when I’m done with my education? Or is it a waste of time going into college at this point? 

If anyone has any resources or experience please let me know."

I have been doing pretty poorly on them and then I get a email saying apply again in 6 months. However, I would like to apply for summer 2023 internships at these same companies when im better at leetcode, but isn’t the time period to apply for those in 6 months?

uxumeb,1,2022-05-25,Missing direction in software,fuju1,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/uxumeb/missing_direction_in_software/,"I am a recent software engineering graduate, currently doing a grad program at a bank. I chose to do a graduate program so that I could rotate around the bank and learn about different areas of the business and hopefully find a field where I have a heavy interest in so I could become a specialist in that area. I’ve noticed that most companies like specialists and not generalists. After learning about a lot of different business areas nothing has stuck out to me. 

I see myself as a generalist, someone who has little bits of knowledge in a lot of different areas but is not great at any. I naturally approach problems with systems thinking and so have a wider perspective on things.

I have also done 3 internships at tech startups and really enjoyed them even though they were definitely harder than my current job. I enjoyed seeing lots of growth and analysing the avenues the company’s took.

My question is, are there any other generalists out there that have found a role in a company where they can excel in and feel that all their skills are properly utilised? And if so what is that role?"

I can use this to basically do anything that will in some way enrich my academic studies/pursuits or my professional development. Does anyone have ideas for things I can use this funding for? I.E. programs I can enroll in during just August, internships, fellowships, or online classes in the evenings? 

Relevant information: 

The funding can be used for travel, lodging, food, and other costs. It is a ""Summer Experience Fund."" I will be able to use it to go do something in another region or country if I so choose. 

I am a biology major who has already been accepted into an accelerated master's program in bioengineering. Ideally, what I do will relate to this. 

I might be interested in some coding bootcamp (maybe not one of the really big ones) if it fits. 

Thank you all for any ideas you might have."

I've always loved making things on the computer but I don't want to just do one thing. Like I don't want to JUST be a video editor or JUST be a programmer or JUST be a graphic designer. I love everything from blender to programming to making music in Logic Pro. Is there a career out there where I can dip my toes into just about everything? I just love learning the different programs and being able to express myself whether that's a full stack web app or a song or a cool 3D model. I'm also a pretty social person and noticed that at my programming internship I didn't enjoy how isolated it felt. 

TLDR: Want a diverse career where I can make a variety of things on the computer and have a chance to be around people."

my dad has a good job, a very good one. he and my mom agreed, years ago, that she would be a stay at home mom and he would bring money, since he's the only one working we used to have a pretty stable life, no luxury, no misery, it was ok, but it's been a few months that it looks like he bet all his money in some gambling (that's a joke he doesn't gamble). he didn't lose his job, nothing extraordinary happened he simply said we are bankrupt. HOW?

I don't believe a word. everything stays the same. I thought with 2 years of staying at home we would have saved some money but it looks like we've been living like Kim Kardashian judging by the way my dad is putting things.

it would be ok if it was only words, but the breaking news is that he's not paying for my college anymore (I'm on the last semester, I've been studying for 5 Damn year, there's 6 months left only 6 and he says he's not paying anymore) I can't afford it bc I earn an internship grant. he's not paying for my gym too, which may sound stupid but the gym is the only way I have to relax and stop thinking about all the shit I have inside my head. the gym I might be able to afford but I don't have credit card, mainly bc I'm terrified of being in debt, and my gym only accepts credit cards. he's not paying for my transportation, medicines, food (that I eat out of my house since I spend all day out sometimes I have to buy food).

I don't know what to do, I don't have money for everything, I pay my therapist which takes half of my income, I can't afford my college, I can twist myself and afford gym but I can't afford my medicines and everything else.

this is going on for a while but it wasn't so harsh, I was already paying for ""trivial"" stuff like a piece of clothing I was needing, the few parties I go to... things like that bc my income is horribly low, actually I have gone days eating only lunch (bc I bring it from home) to stop myself from spending money with food, I thought I could combine my wish to be thinner to the new fact that I was poor. 

I can't stand my dad bc he keeps yelling and blaming everyone but himself, he thinks he does all the hard work and yells at my mom for being at home and not having a job when he was the reason she quitted her job 40 years ago, ofc she won't be able to find anything, she should be retiring not  putting up with his selfish bullshit and be deprived of her stuff bc he did God knows what to our money. 

I'm honestly on the verge rn. I was supposed to be asleep bc I wake up early tomorrow to go to college and work but I can't sleep thinking how the hell am I gonna afford this college, my gym, my medication all my shit...."

uxy61e,10,2022-05-25,Should I apply for a different positiob within my company or leave?,renneslok,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/uxy61e/should_i_apply_for_a_different_positiob_within_my/,"So basically I work at ACN as a customer service rep in a voice role for almost 6 months now, and I absolutely hate it. Maybe there are people out there more mentally resilient than me, but I just cannot handle day after day of angry callers throwing abuse at me. I've already been diagnosed with clinical depression during my last year of college, and I feel like the last thing I need right now to feel like my disastrous last years of college (I almost didn't graduate) will be followed up by years of literally being afraid and anxious for 45 hours every week because I'm constantly scared of irate calls.

I've been looking to leave already but my parent, uncles and aunts, and even my psychiatrist keep insisting I should stay here for at least 2 years and that anything less would be questionable. Right now the only idea I have that would satisfy that is to see if I can apply internally in ACN as an assistant software engineer since I've at least taken a class before in Java, but that is literally my only programming experience. Beyond the fact that they take in career shifters and that they will assign you into a completely random project, I really don't know what being an ASE is like, I don't know if it'll be a better fit for me or it'll just be as stressful as my current job, or even if it makes sense for me to apply there with little experience.

My other idea has been to just leave once I pass 6 months, and in fact I've already been trying to apply to other companies this past month. I still have no job offers though, but at the same time I've managed to save up money during my time here. I'm heavily tempted to just leave after the 6 month threshold without another job lined up since I can afford it. In fact, I'm already thinking of announcing my resignation now since I have to give a 30 days notice and I hit the 6-month mark in less days than that. I'm afraid though that I have to pay back the sign-in bonus if announce it now, even if I tell them my last day is after the 6 month threshold.

Di ko alam kung tama ba ginagawa ko pero desperado na akong makaalis dito. My family keeps telling me to stay. I talked to my psychiatrist about how much I hate this job and I get told na ""ganyan talaga pag working ka na"", even though I never felt this way back when I took up an unpaid internship during college. 

So to sum up, I feel like my options currently are:

* Apply for ACN's ASE position since I'm already an employee within the company anyway  
* Keep powering through the job hunting; I've actually had an interview recently for a proofreading and copyediting role but I haven't got any offer yet  
* Bahala na, file my resignation anyways since I am close to 6 months, even without another job lined up.  

I have no idea if I'm making a mistake here. Please give me some advice, kasi hindi ko na talaga kaya."

I am a self-taught or community taught developer and been constantly struggling to get a job

I had to do other stuff like a job in a shop, 
and i am in a place where the opportunities for developers are very less, India Sikkim Gangtok
I want to move out from here to Maybe Delhi India or Bangalore or anywhere, i am willing to move because i need to make connections because i am struggling for 2 years to get a job, i have done tons of interviews and internship s but most of them ask for experience which i can't have without a job.

3 weeks ago I was really happy because I was offered an internship and I gave my best during these weeks and built 3 landing pages for the clients but for some reason, after finishing a few projects they said I am inexperienced and should take a break...

No, I got nothing and was left depressed and I was blaming myself for not being good enough...

But one of the devs who are my friend helped me and said not to give up or lose hope and keep so that's what I am trying to do,

I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and react js, I am hungry for learning but i need to have a job because living alone without Money will be hard, i do some graphic design for local businesses but it is something i don't like doing, i am doing it to put food in the table...

uy0pod,2,2022-05-26,What’s the best way for me to career transition into Data Analytics / Data Science?,Curiousshark2,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/uy0pod/whats_the_best_way_for_me_to_career_transition/,"So a bit of context. I know this type of question has been asked numerous times, but I wanted to throw out the considerations and personal background.

I currently have a BS in Finance from a top university and work full time in financial services. I feel that I’m in a bit of a dead end job and have recently developed a passion for data analytics/science and am very eager to learn coding. With this said, I would like to keep my current full time job to pay the bills and keep me afloat, despite it not being career-related to Data Analysis. I have a experience with R as I took a class during my undergraduate studies that involved the use of R, but basically don’t remember any of it, so I’m essentially back to square 1. I would like to focus on developing skills in Python, Tableau, SQL, and am open to other languages if needed.

With this in mind, I have done extensive research on my available opportunities:

1) Pursue a MSBA at a local university which would be in person and classes are on Saturday’s which would not interfere with my work schedule whatsoever. The cons would be that I feel as if it wouldn’t be as coding centric as I would like it to be, and the price tag is a bit steep.

2) Pursue a MS in Data Analytics. This is the area I currently have the least knowledge on. I took Calculus 2 in Highschool, and it’s been awhile since I touched math despite me being very good with it. I’m not sure how much math is tied into this route. This would be more coding involved than option 1, however.

3) Obtain a Post-Baccalaureate Comp-Sci degree. I’ve read up on OSU’s program which sounds great. It gets phenomenal reviews and I feel like it’d be a tremendous thing to explore. However, I’m worried that when my boss finds out that I’d be studying Comp-Sci, that he’d look into replacing me given that he knew my time there would be limited. As stated before, I want to remain full time employed, at least until I’m able to land an internship or another role closer to data analysis.

4) Self study using Coursera, Codecademy, and / or bootcamps. It seems that Reddit often suggest this as the best option, however I feel like to me it’s either the last or second to last best option for me to pursue. I would like more structured learning in which I can engage with faculty and other students, as well as the networking opportunities available.

Any comments will be greatly appreciated. If you can point out any flaws I have in my thinking or other things for me to consider, I’m all ears.

Thank you all!"

Now, I'm actively looking for an Internship in this field. As Django can be used with Jinja templating as well, I'm confused. Confused because I'm quite unsure if the organisations offering Django Internships are using Jinja Model or the DRF (REST Framework) model.

i showed my vulnerable weakest side at my lowest point this year when i relapsed and finally mustered up 20 days clean.  the process made me cringe and my best friend would not stop calling me and my people pleaser side came out and i just broke down talking to him since i felt suicidal and was not in the right state of mind off no sleep and now lost the respect and support of my best friend,  i’m pretty bitter now and don’t know how to conduct myself.  i. college before i did drugs i was outgoing but slick with my words.  then i adopted this naive way of thinking and self esteem issues after a professional mentorship abuse as an intern.  and after rehab i changed from a person that i didn’t feel was me as i was pushed to be more “open” leading to be more impulsive etc.

i hate to say it but i used to charm people to get what i wanted or to meet professional objectives.  i was always calculated and logical but also took care in making sure i make the other person feel good, since i know people really only remember how you make them feel.  recovery programs like aa say rigorous honesty and being vulnerable is key.  the thing is in adult life or corporate life is not like this naive bullshit way of thinking.  friends ditch you once you lose your value to them.  when i got into this business minded hustler aspect i achieved a lot of things but in the end got burned with my expectations of what true friends are like and now don’t trust anybody. 

i always think before i speak and was careful not being too honest but tried adopting this other route.  but i misconstrued things assuming the general population is like the recovery bubble.

i try to be fair and make sure it s a mutual gain in professional relationships.  recovery tried to turn me into a saint and help other people at the expense of my own mental health or needs ultimately being taken advantage of.

i don’t know i’m just a young man just rebuilding himself and reflecting on what worked and didn’t work in the past. wtf is genuine honesty?  i never lied to people except when i used drugs as in i would carry the guilt and shame.  but now i’m facing the negative consequences after being “open”

is it better to leave the past as the past and being selective like i was on who to be “open with” and to be more slick and street smart instead of naively kind and a “nice” person?  i’m just resentful at how that approach made my initial year of sobriety TERRIBLE, and i wish i just kind of held my shit in like a real man and overcame it and grinded.  maybe i’m just growing up and realize true friends just come and go regardless, and you can’t trust anybody and have to be smart and filter everything and never expose your weaknesses or true feelings or share key personal jeopardizing info for the sake of “rigorous honesty”. i think it’s smarter to be selective , don’t lie but don’t divulge more info then needed and deliver how you feel ina. rationale way that won’t hurt both parties if possible

sorry just butt hurt at my best friend ghosting me when he said “how many times do you have to destroy yourself and rebuild yourself”. i did choose to relapse 9 months ago but i’d largely blame that from the meds i was in that fuckdd up my bloodwork causing my mental state to be altered."

I “need to publish a paper to graduate” even though other students have graduated from my lab by getting jobs and abandoning their papers. They had internships and I was not allowed one. I would like to take some time off to recover from this traumatic experience before finding a job, so I’ve been hesitant to accept a job offer without publishing first (I have one, though it’s not my first choice).

I feel like I’ve been exploited by my PI to generate data for grants with absolutely no help or support from anyone. My PI barely knows what I do. I was given two HUGE projects to work on: both 4-way comparisons with a tricky animal model that takes weeks. 

I’ve generated data for one project that I thought I could publish, but after asking some postdocs for help, they agree that the data doesn’t make a whole lot of sense (essentially we looked at epigenetics, RNA, and protein expression, but they don’t logically correlate). Im meeting with some other people for advice, but I fear I may need to repeat things to get this published and again I have minimal help. This paper is touching on big questions in the field that I can’t answer.

I’m sad, frustrated, angry, and burnt out. I hate science and all I want in the world is a remote job coding (which makes me somewhat happy) or doing anything other than academia. I’ve submitted abstracts and got invited for a talk at a conference but my data sucks. I’m panicking.

Should I master out? Should I accept a “meh” job offer and see if that will help me graduate (sucks not to have a first author paper after so long)? Should I try to switch to a dry lab (not sure if that’s possible)?

Thanks for any advice :("

uy5uff,3,2022-05-26,My experience with Hillsong,im_a_little_potato,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/uy5uff/my_experience_with_hillsong/,"**BACKGROUND** 

(Feel free to skip to the post itself)

In case you don't know what Hillsong is, it's basically a megachurch that started off in Australia, but now has branches across Europe, the US and S Africa. 

They have been through a lot of controversies theoughout the years, and there's a lot of them that happened over the last couple of years or so, such as:

[- One of the pastors having an affair](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10677273/amp/Woman-claims-affair-disgraced-Hillsong-pastor-Carl-Lentz-speaks-out.html)

[- The lead pastor being charged with intentionally hiding his father's sexual abuse](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna14183)

[- A documentary that recently came out tells of people who were exploited by Hillsong and even sexually abused](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/03/27/hillsong-megachurch-exposed-discovery-plus/)

Anyway, here's my story.

**POST**

I started going to Hillsong's London campus back in 2016, and left at the start of 2019.

On the surface, everything was going great at the start. I was making new friends, I was learning anlot of stuff about film and photography (which is something I've always been interested in) and I was learning more about God.

However, they started exploiting me. They started keeping me behind doing work for them until late at night, sometimes up to midnight, when I was under 18. They didn't care about me- that I was tired and had college in the morning- they just wanted to make themselves look good by ""giving me this opportunity"", rather than say it like it was and admit I was working for them for free.

The closest they ever got to admitting they were doing something wrong was when a youth pastor pulled me aside and told me not to tell anyone I'm staying this late as they might get in trouble with the law.

It's also worth mentioning that they never used words like ""helping out"", ""working"" or anything similar- it was always ""serving"". You were serving people and God, which made God happy, you never actually worked  for Hillsong or helped them out.

I didn't realise there was anything wrong happening at them time, and I made the  mistake of getting more and more involved. It got to a point where people thoight I was a member of staff.

Anyway, I turned 18 and decided to do what they called ""the Academy"" at the time. This is where it all went downhill even more.

This was meant to be an internship where you would ""serve"", but also learn a lot of stuff.

It turned out we just did a lot of work without actually learning much.

I would leave my house at 6am, if not earlier, every day, and it was rare I'd come back before 11pm. We would often get there before most members of staff and leave after pretty much everyone else left. It was also very rare for us to have a day off.

Every day I, alongside the other internees, would be helping in our respective teams, plan stuff, be in meetings and so on. If there wasn't anything to do, we were given stuff no one wanted to do, like cleaning a cupboard that hasn't been cleaned since the previous year, when the last internees cleaned it. If there was nothing to do, it was our fault because we didn't ask anyone to give us stuff to do.

If we couldn't make it in or were late, for whatever reason(s), we'd have a lecture by the person in charge (who was also a hypocrite)

I'll give you two examples of what I mean:

1. I had a migraine and threw up quite a lot throughout the night. It was obvious I couldn't go in that day, so I texted the person in charge to tell him this. I got a reply a few hours later saying that I shouldn't have told him last minute. (As if I had some sort of schedule of when I was gonna be sick and I could tell him in advance)

A couple of weeks later, he texted us saying we needed to be somwhere within two hours, even tho he knew it would take each of us at least about an hour to get there. That's pretty much a last minute notice if you ask me.

2. They also have (or at least had; this was pre-pandemic) a Carols service a week or two before Christmas every year. That year, we were meant to get to the venue at 5:30am, meaning that everyone had to leave their house at about 2am due to the way the public transport works at night. 

We had an event for all the youth leaders a few nights before, and the person in charge's wife was there. She asked me how we (the internees) were gonna get to the venue. I told her that we all had to leave at 2am in order to make it in time. She said she'll talk to her husband and sort something out. A couple of days later, we got a text saying we could get there at 7am instead (meaning we could leave our houses at 6am).

However, one of the girls only moved to London a couple of months prior, so she wasn't very familiar with London just yet. She got off at the wrong stop, so she was ~30 mins late, and we waited for her outside as we were told.

When we all walked in, we had a lecture about how we should be on time. The guy in charge completly disregarded that the only person who was late wasn't very familiar with London (which I think is a valid excuse). He also said he changed the meeting time from 5:30 to 7 because he cared about us, not because his wife asked him to change it. He couldn't look me in the eyes for the whole morning.

The worst thing is that Hillsong, which claimed to care about people, not only exploited me, but they didn't even pretend to care after a while. They didn't care I had to pay £200+ a month for transport and food (which was usually one Tesco meal deal a day and nothing else). On the contrary, they made me pay £450 for the internship (which, to be fair, used to be £1500).

There's so many more stories I could share, both from my personal experience and what I've seen/heard, as well as what others thag I personally knew who also left told me, but this post is already too long."

Grew up in Asian Christian household in Chinese-influenced culture in an Asian country. 

Before uni I had my eye set on a specific industry. Worked my ass off doing back to back multiple internships while attending full time uni. I had not stopped working since 2020, be it internships or projects or part time work. Often times I had jobs stacked upon each other. Half of 4 years of uni was Covid-19 and near 1 year was a political movement in my country. Overall depressing and hopeless environment for my country. Still powered through. Broke up with long term serious boyfriend in the midst of the 4 years of Uni. 

Now, just graduated from uni and company I’ve been loyal to freelancing won’t sign me on as a full time contracted staff. Everything is incredibly unstable but I regularly work for them still. I go in 4/5 days a week now working for them. 

I feel incredibly stupid for all the effort I’ve put into building my career. I’ve tried so hard muscled through depression, family trauma, 3 years straight of therapy, break ups and weight fluctuation. But it’s never enough. I have no reward. No breaks in between and now I’m left with a crushed heart of no guarantee for a title, burnout headspace, and losing passion for what I wanted to do.

I’m with someone new now and we love each other. We share a lot of similar morals and beliefs but have a drastically different outlook in life. He doesn’t want kids, I want kids. It’s early to talk about this, we aren’t even 1 year into our relationship and we have a 7 year age gap. I’m in my early 20s as well. Am I overthinking this? I want to enjoy the better things in life, strive hard, have a family, and at least 1 kid. He has been working hard to move up in life but I know for the most part his mind set is more like day to day and pay check to pay check. 


I worked so hard to plan my life and be smart with people and money to end up here. I feel stupid, betrayed, useless and hopeless. I’m sick of it I want to give up. If I could I would float into non-existence. Like fizzle out like a bath bomb. I don’t want to work hard anymore, no one cares and no one loves me enough to make change for me. 

What can I do…."

I have Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering, now I am studying last year Master's degree in Data Science at one of the best engineering universities in Europe. I have 5+ years of experience in programming, and 2+ years in Data Science. I have many skills in my field which is really in demand. I speak 3 foreign languages. 

Recently I am having multiple offers from companies. But those companies are generally local and small. I also received one internship offer from Baker Hughes which is really prestigious and big. But it is an internship, long, underpaid, hard, in another city. However, if I bare for 6 months in the end I might land on a big company if nothing at least have experience. Then it becomes easier to get offers from other ""bigs"". Also, the internship is curricular which I have almost completed for my degree. 

My concern is I don't know if I should accept this offer or wait for some time to get another from other companies or directly accept offers from little companies. Can someone with or without experience suggest to me how to proceed? I don't have any such experience in selecting the companies.  

I appreciate any help. Thanks!"

After +2, every other kid in nepal wants to be an engineer or a Doc. And it was same w me. I thought i would earn so fking much after being a doctor 🤔 and i thought its really a Respected job lol. But what i did not know was it was just a myth. The doctors i met would advice me against being one, and i thought they say this cuz they don't want more people to be in their profession cuz it will dilute their income lol. 
But anyhow i got into one. FYI it costs around 40 L just for tution and around 10 L for the living expenses for 6 yrs. Even if you get an scholarship you need 10L for living + 3-4 L of fees. 
Money is just one part lol.. You will be wasting 6 yrs of ur young life studying the hardest of subjects, even if you are a good grader from +2 you will be just praying to pass those MBBS exams. And its gonna be very hard managing time for enjoyment if you wanna do good in studies too.. 
And don't forget about the bullying of seniors and residents and teachers.. It may not be a physical one but directly or indirectly you r gonna get bullied lol.. 
And MBBS is not just another subject.. You are learning about saving lifes so it comes with great responsibility and with responsibility comes immense mental pressure to do well. And i will not forget that final yr exam, i was close to being crazy lol. 

So, anyhow you pass those exams. Now comes 1 yr of intership. You would think you have passed the exams so you already are a doctor.. But guess what interns have to do.. Apart from doing those sleepless duties, The consultants and residents will be treating w like a helper, you will feel more like personal secretary than a doctor. 
Now comes the harder part.. You are now officially a Registered doctor. But you are just an MBBS DOCTOR.. The lowest tier of this profession, so expect no respect from anyone lol.. Most of the consultants will look at u like a nobody. So you want to study further and do masterz. If you are from paying category.. You will have to do 1 yr compulsory work before starting further study.. If you are from scholarship you have to do 2 yrs compulsory work in government hospitals.. If you start mbbs by 18-19, you will be 24-25 after mbbs and.. 27-28 after the 2yr bonding.. And most of your school friends are either already married or even have children.. 
If you are contented with just MBBS,  you will look for the jobs.. The government scale is  40k..but if its a private one, its just 30-35k in most cities. Its bit higher if you are okey to go to durgam areas but you have already spent fking 6 yrs far from ur family, its a hard choice.. 
But you are a doctor and Society sees you differently. You need to have a good social look, look rich even if ur broke.. But with this income you can't buy a average bike forget about a car..
And If you are from a middle/lower class and have loanss.. You are Trapped.. 😂..
That's it for today 😂.. To be contd"

In my earlier life through almost all stages of school I got bullied to varying degrees so I spent most days alone when everyone else happily made friends (I managed to find a couple of great friends at Uni though). I was always pretty insecure and lazy and nowadays I have to face the consequences of feeling completely left out of any social life. On top of that, I am a lazy fuck who doesn’t really do much to change, but I am REALLY terrified of spending the rest of my life equally isolated and away from society.

I'm still deciding between NUS CS and Waterloo Math. Major difference is the cost I guess... like 180k without living costs for Waterloo and 30k for NUS, but I do want to live and work in the US in the future (also just get out of Singapore lol). I also need to do math here so I do miss out on the CS only modules I am interested in (albeit I do love Math, I'd rank CS core&lt;Math core and CS uppers&gt; Math uppers).

So my life story is that I'm a child of divorced parents, both pretty well of, but one of them moved to USA and become quite successful. Fast forward to adulthood and i flunked uni, asked for a job, got it and later moved with a green card. I was hired as an IT person, because i was good simple computer tasks and felt that it intrigued me. However, the ""pleasure"" of work never came and i started to hate the life of an adult that came to USA to live in the basement of his father (back in Europe, i was lucky enough to be gifted a one room flat, that i could live alone with my girlfriend).

Work in my dads company continued and i ""climbed"" the ranks towards IT Manager (more like just got the job, because the people above me left). Internally life sucked, since i was always labeled (and i think its probably true) a lazy person. I found some drive and decided to go to uni for a tech degree back in Europe (wanted to leave USA). during these years, i worked only 4\~ months a year, which would be enough to make live paycheck to paycheck. (for my country, the 2.5k a month i got was was really good). However due to this (and my laziness) i didn't do any internships or worked anywhere else.

Now I'm 29 and finished my degree almost a year ago. Got my pay bumped to 4k\~ a month and still feel unmotivated to do anything. Part of the problem of the whole situation is the unmanageable projects that we have. Most of it is legacy code that will brake if anyone touches it, we only hire specialist from cheaper countries and we lack specialized specialist. Everytime i tried changing things up, it wouldn't stick or broke more stuff than it fixed. 

I tried looking for other jobs, but im in a position, where i dont feel like i have any experience (especially as a developer which i would like to be) and at the same time im hoping for atleast not a lower paycheck. I would love a remote job, where i dont work much. These days i just sit on reddit most of my time at work.

Heck, im not even sure if I should be posting here. Im pretty well off compared to most of the posts. And im probably one of the guys that would get hate on here. I just feel like this capitalist culture is just suffocating me."

When meeting with my manager later (not someone I interviewed with) she mentioned I would be working with azure and dot net, which are platforms I have no experience with. She didn't seem to know that I didn't have familiarity with these platforms, and in retrospect I probably should have brought it up.

Apparently a Bachelor's just isn't going to cut it.

So I'm in the final phases of an internship interview process for a mobile development role and was given 2 options for my choice of the internship experience. Both are at the same company. I'm currently a ""junior"" (2nd year graduating 1 year early) at a state school not known for its CS department, with no other prior internships.

1. An unpaid internship/mentorship program. Essentially, I would have my manager walk me through the work, as well as dedicate time for 1-on-1s and such to up my skills. Once I *do* land a job (presumably within that area of focus), then I start getting paid.
2. A paid internship, part-time, with a relatively comfortable salary (think LCOL intern range). I would still do the work, but it would be more of a job than a full-on learning experience (though of course weekly standups and such would still happen).

Personally, I'm torn between the two. As someone who enjoys the structure around school as a motivation to get me to learn stuff that I otherwise wouldn't have, the first option would be a great way for me to presumably fast-track my knowledge in that area. I graduate next year, but I also plan to take out another year for an MS in CS (special track at our school, only takes another year so 4 years total for a BS + MS, and I get another year for internship hunting). But as much as full learning sounds fun, I would also like to get paid for my work. I'd like to get your feedback on which route that I should take. Thanks in advance!"

I am currently trying to decide between doing co-op CS at UTSC or CS at UTSG. I know that universities look at certain high schools differently based on averages (I think thats how it works, if not I would love to know how that really works), so I am getting confused. St. George is considered to be the “prestige” UofT experience and where many people go wanting a better education. I know that most content taught at campuses is the same but if I wanted to find a job/internship myself, will employers care whether I went to SG or SC? Or are they just looking for better students overall? If I don’t go for the co-op program but try my absolute hardest to do as well as possible at SG, will finding an internship or job be difficult? What if I’m looking for a job after attending co-op UTSC, will employers care that I didn’t go to the more “prestigious” campus?

Thank you for your help, so much to think about as I make my decision but such little time left, so I was really hoping to just get some guidance."

uyn1jy,6,2022-05-26,Deciding between UW Madison and USC,Funny-Employment-554,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/uyn1jy/deciding_between_uw_madison_and_usc/,"I saw a post on here recently where someone asked for advice on whether they should attend USC or UW Madison and the responses were really great so I decided to ask for help about my own dilemma. I am so sorry that this is absurdly lengthy, so if you don't feel like reading it: plain and simple UCLA vs UW Madison... which should I choose? 

To clarify, I am currently in my first year at UCLA but was accepted as a transfer student for fall 22' to UW Madison and I am deciding whether or not I should stay in LA. 

I grew up in northern Wisconsin and my entire family lives there or nearby but I was always insistent on moving far away for college. I am extremely thankful for my parents because it was never a question that they would pay for my sibling's and I's college. My parents established early on that they would pay for in-state tuition (UW Madison) or out-of-state tuition if I got into a school in which the education and opportunities it would provide were ""worth it"". Today at the heart of this debate is the question whether an education at UCLA is ""worth"" the extra money it costs to attend. Anyway, because pre-teen me was set on going to college away from home, I knew that I would have to work extremely hard in high school. And that was exactly what I did; I worked so darn hard (especially in my first 2 1/2 years, before covid, before burn-out), putting in so much time and effort into getting good grades and building up a resume. At times it felt like my whole high school experience existed for the sole purpose of getting me into a prestigious university. I rarely sat back and enjoyed the present moment and for a time lost some friends because I thought I couldn't afford to spend time with them. I bet if you asked the people I went to high school with they wouldn't have much to say about me other than that I was that one know-it-all who mostly kept to myself (in reality I wasn't that naturally smart, I just had an insane work ethic driven by an unhinged desire to get good grades... hopefully they couldn't tell how grade obsessed I was). Covid gave me some perspective... aka burn-out... but apparently not enough. I found out I got into UW Madison first but when I received my UCLA and NYU acceptance letters, UW Madison was embarrassingly not on my mind in the slightest. I decided to come to UCLA and in all honesty, it felt really good. I'd like to say that I don't care what people think of me but that would just be a flat out lie; and as much as I don't want to admit this (but I know there are people who can relate) it felt really good to wear my UCLA gear on decision day. My parents supported my decision wholeheartedly, my dad informed me that UCLA was ""borderline"" ""worth it"" to pay extra money for (in his slightly biased opinion as he went to Madison). 

I understand that UCLA out-of-state is expensive, I've seen the bill they send my father every quarter. However, looking back on it, the money did not play as big a role as maybe it should have in influencing my decision. Again, I am extremely privileged to have parents that are able to pay for my education but perhaps a year ago when I made this decision I didn't really know or understand if UCLA's tuition would be anxiety inducing for my father. Were my parents just so amazing that they were willing to put such a heavy burden on their backs even if it stretched their wallet thin? Or was some 60k a year actually of minimal detriment to their wallets and their expectation that the college be ""worth it"" just a motivation tactic? In part perhaps this dilemma was a product of never knowing how much my parents made (and yes, I can infer this to some extent but my parents are not flashy people and would never in a million years display opulence even if they could)... but it was definitely also my own fault for having constant blinders up for any potential obstacle in my journey to go to school far away in California. 

Anyway, I came out to LA and overall had a pretty good year minus a couple bumps along the way. A significant one being after the first quarter I was ousted from my friend group and in the two quarters following had a very difficult time making new friends and getting back to where I was socially back in November. Although I had a hard time getting through that I was able to confide in my parents and they really supported me. Slowly, feelings of sadness due to being left out became homesickness (although I would never dare admit it). My parents were worried about my mental health since I lacked a support system out here and they encouraged me to apply as a transfer to UW Madison. I was originally outwardly opposed to this idea but in the back of my mind I couldn’t stop pondering... What if...? Only the day before the application was due did I decide to apply, telling my parents that it didn't mean anything, it was only ""just in case"". I made them promise not to tell my siblings or any of their friends that I was considering it because I was so concerned that people might think that I wasn't thriving at UCLA (which... was completely true at that moment). 

A month in a half later I got in and decided it would be a waste not to seriously consider it. Although I was accepted as a Life Science Communication major, that was in all honesty, completely dependent on my mood at the time when I filled out the application. A few months wiser, I am now pretty much set on pre-law, most likely majoring in psychology and definitely minoring in something writing/composition related no matter the school at which I attend next fall. I explored what UW Madison offered and honestly was pretty ashamed to have overlooked it a year earlier out of the need to be different than everyone at my school. I became excited at the possibility of attending there next fall. Despite this, I have remained slightly in favor of UCLA throughout this process for a number of reasons which I will mention in a moment. This was the beginning of my internal discourse (I first mentioned in the third paragraph), considering if a psychology degree on the pre-law track at UCLA is ""worth"" the extra money it will cost my parents. 

I am only now realizing how freaking long this is omg. I am so sorry for those who are sticking it out to help me out (but thank you so so much).

Also it is important to note that I have no idea if my parents will pay for my law school (or maybe this is dependent on how much they spend on my undergrad education... lots to consider)

If I chose UW Madison I would be close to home, family, and old friends and definitely have a support system to fall back on if my mental health takes a turn again. However, there is no guarantee that being in a new location would do anything for my well being, especially a place where in the winter it is really tempting to escape the dreary atmosphere by holing up in my room and avoiding social contact. I will say, being in LA has completely rid me of my seasonal depression (the sunshine is a game changer). Another pro about UW Madison is that it is cheaper, but I already dove into this so I am not going to write it out again. I will mention again; however, is that it is a real possibility my parents will only pay my law school tuition (including for a prestigious university \[is it regressing to admit that I am still hyper focused on receiving validation through acceptance from one of these ""elite"" law schools… that's an issue for another day\]) if I transfer to UW Madison. Yes I am aware how spoiled this sounds... but tbh it doesn't just sound that way, in real life I am 100% spoiled and privileged. I hope to one day be able to use this privilege as well as whatever ladders that privilege helped me climb to do some actual freaking good in this world. Anyways, away from the cheesiness and back to the comparison. In a sense, transferring to UW Madison makes me feel like all of my hard work (the work that set me apart from my classmates that did end up going to UW Madison \[I tried phrasing this like five different ways but in all of them I end up sounding cocky so I've just accepted it\]) would be for nothing. Would all those weekend nights during my sophomore year of high school when I told friends over and over that I was busy just to bury myself in homework… be for nothing? The possibility that I could have ended up in the same place, at UW Madison, whether or not I hung out with those friends every Friday of my sophomore year is a very scary thought to my brain. This may seem stupid and laughable to other people that I would actually think about this, but to me it is extremely profound; it makes me feel even more than I already did, that my high school years were just a waste. Another pro of staying in LA is that for every internship, every job, every opportunity I seek, I will have ""graduate of UCLA"" on my resume. As much it shouldn't be this way, it is a fair assessment to say that when two candidates with the exact same experience on their resume apply for the same job, the graduate of UCLA is more likely to get the position over the graduate of UW Madison just because society has assigned value to prestige (so that those who could afford said ""prestige"" aka rich, elite white men could perpetuate their positions of power within institutions \[I could write a whole paper on this but I won't for everybody's sake\]). You may be asking why, If I think prestige is subjective and for the most part a stupid social construct, why it is so important in my final decision. And to that I say, the only way for this lovely social construct in which we (oftentimes inadvertently) groundlessly assign value to a certain institution to be deconstructed is to have people with power willing to change society's collective psychology in order to do just that (enter me... perhaps... one day). There is no way anyone understood that, I'm convinced it reads like a bunch of mumble-jumble... and that's being generous considering there is no way that anyone has read this far. How on earth did this go from an innocent cry for help to a philosophy paper. So, I actually did have more to talk about, talking about how awesome Madison's campus life is, comparing the two psychology majors/departments but I am going to stop here out of fear I might combust. To the %0.001 percent of people who read this far... hope you get the point and please help me. "

I stopped smoking several weeks ago to be safe in case I would be drug tested, but now am unsure if or when I should feel comfortable smoking again. I've had friends in similar positions who eventually felt confident that they would not be drug tested based on the impressions they got from the company/their coworkers, but I don't know how I should approach the situation for myself. I probably can't go around asking employees if they've been drug tested or if they smoke, and I'm not sure what I should look for to feel comfortable smoking again. There has been no mention of drug testing during my orientation or first week on the job, but I feel like you never know when it could come up (I'm pretty new to office work and thus don't have much experience with this dynamic).

I'm interested in taking a master's degree in probably software engineering or a data-related field. 

So I stumbled upon [educlaas.com](https://educlaas.com) by [Lithan.com](https://Lithan.com) which offers work-integrated master's degrees. After a bit of looking it seems like some kind of Bootcamp combined with internships. But it's also giving an accredited Master's Degree in software engineer. 

Basically, giving 6 months of intensive (Mon-Fri 9-6) Bootcamp then 1.5 years work which I don't really know how they would be able to give me master's for it? it still said you need to do some college when working.

These are the pros that I can think of:

1. Having 1.5 YoE extra
2. Open the gate for me to work in Singapore (I live in Indonesia)
3. Curriculums are definitely more practical compared to other universities due to the fact they need to prepare for the 1.5 Years of full-time intern

Some cons that I can think of:

1. Having a brand-new no name master
2. Too focused on jobs maybe close doctoral/research pathway
3. Being a ""beta-tester"" of the program

Some flags that I see:

1. on [educlaas.com](https://educlaas.com) they referring the program as ""products""
2. To register to have to contact a real person
3. I contacted one of them and a bit of miscommunication, He said weekends are not used for study while the website states to study on weekends and work on weekdays. He clarify as ""depending on what I take, etc""

My questions are:

1. How is this compared to a reputable master's degree?
2. How is this compared to other no-name master degrees?
3. Would you take it if you want to have a master's degree?
4. How is this compared to other paths that let me work outside of my country (work-visa?) 

Some information the program costs 8000 USD for 2 years (2000 USD/semester) (for reference my current university cost 500 USD/semester) they said I can earn at most 7200 USD in 1.5 years, I would assume I only will earn half of that 3600 USD or around 200 USD/month

I worked in IT as a Desktop, Network, Server and general support engineer (almost 7 years experience). My Fiancé was working in HR/IR and we were doing well, our salaries at the time were almost R20k combined, (we are in South Africa) and things were very well.

She got retrenched end of December and my Salary at the time were nowhere near enough for us to survive, (mine was R6500, our rent was R4000 and would have gone up in January to R4500 thus leaving R2000 for our living costs, debts etc) so we had to look at all the options we had.

1st option was to stay there and find her other work (yes we did look around a lot and highest salary we could find was R6000 pm thus leaving us on a total of R12k before company deductions etc) and see if we can make it.

2nd option was to move to her parents (where we are now) and search for work here, in-laws has a 4 bedroom house with 2 separate kitchens so they said they will divide the house then we can stay here and don't have to worry about rent, electricity bills and so on. (the only downside we knew of at the time is that this town is about 35KM from one of the biggest towns in South Africa)

3rd option was to move to my parents (about 800km from where we are now) and search for work that side. The biggest issue with this is that my parents doesn't like the fact that me and my fiancé are not married yet (yes they are those kind of people) and takes swings at us regularly because of that (even though we are planning to get married in November). My 3 brothers are also still living with my parents (26, 20 and 19) and this would have been very difficult sharing a house with them.

&amp;#x200B;

So it seemed that our best option was to take option 2, but, the house wasn't divided like MIL promised and we had to improvise, now 5 months down the line it is nothing but fighting everywhere as MIL runs a home bake shop from her kitchen (next to our bedroom....) so we are often awaken between 5 and 6AM in the mornings due to the mixers that's starting up.

We did manage to receive ""payment holiday"" from the bank on some of our debt but neither of us were able to find employment this far, (I have applied to everything anywhere in IT that I could find even internships to development) but still nothing, so in the meanwhile I have started helping people with computer related issues and thus try and make up some money for month end, however, the last 2 months I had 3 clients that brought in about R3000 in total, I have also been marketing actively on FB, WhatsApp groups and even putting flyers out at our local shops.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Should we continue advertising and hope there will be clients for me or should I continue applying for jobs while doing the support on the side? unfortunately I know the fighting in the house will not stop until we are able to move out into our own house/apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me if you have been in a sort of similar situation and what could help us.

I did work as a ULA (basically a TA) for 5 semesters. 3 semesters on OOP and 2 for ML.

Firstly, would looking for internships at this stage be a good idea. Should I focus more on that or focus on a full-time position?

Secondly, I have seen mention of talking to recruiters, but how do I get in touch? Will most job listings have contact information on there? If I find an email, should I email directly and not bother filling out an application from the listing? Or do both?

Where do I do this searching? Linkedin? Indeed? Some other Job board? Maybe something that isn't a job board at all?

What are current opinions on staffing agencies? For example, OtterBase.

When I was in university, I naively assumed it'd be easy to get a job but I've filled out about 60 applications and I've gotten one response (not even an interview), which was for something unrelated to my skillset.

If it's relevant, I have less than 20 connections on LinkedIn."

I don’t know how it happened but at a certain point in March and April I did the following things:
- I started smoking weed on a weekly basis
- Stopped going to the gym
- Started dating a lot of girls at the same time (who I didn’t even care about in the first place) and had sex with a really bad girl, who I didn’t know anything about and who used cocaine.
- Started compulsively looking for a job, I am a student at university but I always thought that having a job could have helped me when comparing to others / my inferiority complex.
Then, at a certain point, I found myself with an health problem (probably due to stress + sex with that girl) which seems to be nearly solved now, or at least under control. This problem made me not think about all the things above, which I basically stopped.
Next week I will probably go again at my parents home because uni will finish for this period and so I will have 3/4 months in which I don’t have any idea about what to do, which can help me for the future / self-improvement while providing fun. In my country it’s quite too late to find a job and they don’t do summer internships so I would exclude this option. Thanks for everybody who will answer this."

I'm a college student practicing Data Structures and Algorithm questions to apply for internships. Been breaking my head over this DSA question for days and still very confused on how to solve it.

Mr X has to be in the Vietnam office of his company for certain dates of the month (given as an input list of numbers representing dates).  He can either travel to Vietnam for 1 day and back on the same day, which will cost him $200. A trip for 7 days will cost him 700$, 14 days 1400$ and 30 days $2500. (Travel days inclusive) Write an algorithm that returns the minimum amount he must send that ensures he is in the Vietnam office on all the required days.

Example:

Input: \[1,2,3,30\]

Output: $800 (he makes 1 day trips on each day which costs $200\*4) 

A logical/algorithmic explanation of how this can be calculated would be greatly appreciated, I can write  out the code myself. Cant find any help on Google :("

I got two offers from two different companies in Budapest, Hungary, and would like to hear your opinion.

**About me :**

I'm a Moroccan student at ELTE ( Eötvös Loránd University) in Budapest Hungary. doing my master's degree in Data Science. Currently, in a ""Preparatory year"" and still have two more years to finish it. 

My graduate degree was in Computer science and mathematics back in morocco.

**First offer:**

It is as a Data engineer intern for 8 weeks in the summer at TCS (TATA Consulting Services). Contrat mentioned a full-time position, but HR told me it's going to be a 5-hour shift on average. 

Compensation : 130,000 HUF/Month (around 330 euro).

Promised to be double after the two months in case of solid performance. =&gt; 260.000 HUF/Month for a part-time job, around 20 hours a week.

**Second offer:**

The official title at Citi Bank would be Market Quantitive analyst but I think in other companies would be called a Quant Developer. Full time position, 40 hours a week. for 3 months

Compensation 1,900 HUF per Hour -&gt; 304,000 HUF/Month (around 771 euro). The salary would be the same in case of staying for a part-time job after the termination of the intership.

\----

At this point in my life, money would be the least concern. I'm looking forward an enviroment where I can grow and develope my skills.

My question would be, In case someone have some experience in either of the companies, Which one focus on training and developing more ? and which job field would be more rewarding in the future (Data enginering or Quant) ?

Looking forward to hear your opinions."

However, I have not yet taken DSA or built any side projects. I’m going to be taking my school’s DSA class this summer, starting next week. It runs until the end of August.

My question is, will that be enough prep time to get ready for interviews at the end of August for FAANG? Since I’ll be in the middle of learning it all during the summer, i know it might make the Leetcode grind harder to do. But is it possible to do well and be ready for those end of summer interviews?

Also, to better have a chance at interviews, what are some good side projects to work on to have on my resume? Im not entirely sure what would look best or give me the best chance at success for my current situation.

During my internships I received exposure to many related technologies to the job posting with my Jr. position being the most related (lots of AWS, some CI/CD pipelines but would classify as relatively basic).

I would classify my skills as *touched most of the stack*, but haven't gone too deep and need a mentor and production examples to help me nail down learning the stack.

Anyways, I just got declined from Columbia which means I no longer have any grad school available. I applied to the Fall 2022 admissions for grad school mostly doing PhDs. I realize this was a big mistake on two parts. Firstly, I really should've applied to Masters, my profile is simply not competitive for PhDs but my parents convinced me because PhDs generally receive funding which means I don't have to pay exorbitant prices for Masters (I still want to do PhD as I really want to go into research). Secondly, it was a mistake because I failed to realize that I could apply for Spring 2022 admissions (I graduated in December 2021) which were likely less competitive. I also applied to schools FAR beyond my pay grade and that really contributed to me not getting anywhere. That said, I would like to now apply to the Spring 2023 cycle and as such, would like to ask all of you based on my profile, what types of schools would look good for me, what schools are difficult to get in but possible and what schools are way out of reach. (I'm now aiming for a Masters in Computer Science)

My profile:

School:  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Bachelors in Computer Science

GPA: 3.36

GRE: 327 (166Q,161V,5.5 Analytical Writing)

2 Internships from Harris Computer Corporation (5 months) and GlobalFoundries (3 months) in SDE and IT respectively.

No major research contributions.

Native English Speaker

I would also like to ask what I should do between now and Spring. I'm currently on the hunt for jobs however, most software jobs require at least one year of work. I made another mistake by not applying to jobs after I go out of college as I didn't want to apply if I was going to graduate school (which in hindsight was the obviously wrong choice). If I apply for Spring admissions that would create problems with work. I also really want research experience but as I'm no longer officially part of any university, getting any professor to allow me to do research is extremely tough (I didn't do it in undergrad partially because of COVID and partially because I underestimated just how important research is). 

Basically, I'd really love some advice on next steps because currently, I'm really struggling."

So, I recently made it to the final interview for a job I applied for at my dream company. The interviewer liked me a lot! I was expecting an offer. But the next day, he called me saying he was sorry but, although he asked to keep me, the group decided to move forward with another candidate.

I was still trying to get over this episode when, days after, I got a call from a manager at the same company. He said my last interviewer told him very good things about me and invited me to have a conversation about an opportunity he had. I couldn't believe it! The only thing is the interview was going to be in English (which is not my native language), and I only had 4h to prepare for it because they were in a rush and had to select a candidate quickly. Although I had some difficulty speaking, I felt the interview was OK. But... after a whole day of expecting an answer... I received a rejection email saying I was considered for the role but some other candidate ""had better reflected on his failure and learnings, but I will be kept in mind for future trainee roles"".

I'm feeling disappointed and ashamed. I mean, I was invited to interview for a job I didn't apply for, got a second chance to get a job in this dream company that I didn't want to lose, had an intern cheering for me and had only a few hours to prepare only to get rejected! Can you imagine the pressure and the stress I felt, and how disappointed I am right now?..

Now, do you think it has something to do with my English? Do you believe I've damaged the good opinion the first interviewer had about me, and have just lost a referral? Is that a thing? I'm really afraid of that. Or is there a possibility that they never considered me for this position, and just had to interview someone else besides who they had already picked? I'm starting to think that this is not my fault.

I am super confused between California State University Fullerton (With 10 prerequisite course) and CSU Dominguez Hills (with 2-4 prerequisite). AFAIK CSUF is better regarded but is it really worth spending 20000 USD + 4 courses every semester that I would need to take unlike CSU Dominguez where I will have to take 3 courses first 3 Semester and then just 1 in the last semester. Or very less if i have any prerequsite at all and I can finish the degree in 2 years. If I choose CSUF its gonna be long 3 year grind.And it probably will be relentless 4 subjects per semester.

Potential strong admits are CSU Chico and CSU Northridge (Maybe)

I felt as per my research that CSUs are what you make of it except (SJSU ) but everything I looked up(Ranking reviews and alumni ) showed me CSUDH is like bottom of the barrel, How much of this can impact my internship and Job prospects if i choose CSUDH as on positive side it will be less workload and i can grind Leetcode instead of prerequisite. Also For CSUDH i was not able to find many Alumni in top 10 companies. Is this an indicator of weak academics or quality of grads of school.

Note: I know some of the above might not be the most PC way of asking advice but I mean no offense to anyone graduating from a CS program at CSUDH ,its just that the place I come from kind of judges with the same lens and some formation of my opinion can also be blamed on google.

I'm a college student with two SWE internships under my belt. Admittedly, I've always been pretty rough at leetcode - and now that I'm looking at more competitive companies for this internship season, I was wondering what the best practice material is for getting must better at typical intern interview questions. To prepare better, I've been working through the Blind 75 and reading CTCI,  as well as doing practice CodeSignal 75-minute exams everyday and taking notes on my errors. 

I am curious what others in the field would recommend to put my best foot forward for entering SV this year. Thanks!"

Either full stack developer or data science? Today I had a web developer intern interview that I completely bombed because I couldn’t answer basic web developing questions. I haven’t been putting much work into it web developing. Rather, I have been invested more into python and data science. I like both fields and I know that python developers are much more needed. However, I need to pick one area to get better at and imo web development is more junior developer friendly. I think that if I take this route, I’ll eventually get better with python. 
Thoughts?"
uz8mgo,3,2022-05-27,Do short-term jobs hurt my CV?,Cph265,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uz8mgo/do_shortterm_jobs_hurt_my_cv/,"I have been unemployed now for a year since I graduated in Web Development. I don't have any connections or friends that can help me with networking, so I only have 1 follower on LinkedIn. Because of this I have really taken my time to make a good and detailed CV to put up online, as this is the only thing I can really rely on.

The problem is that my career history consists of jobs that I only had for 2 or 3 months. The reason for this is that every time I get hired, I am told that I need to work as an intern in the beginning, so that the company can ""get a good feel"" about me and my skills. It usually goes well, but as soon as we get to the point where the intern contract ends and I need to talk about salary, they always find some kind of excuse for letting me go. 

What I am fearing is that people will read my CV and they will look at all those short-term jobs and think ""Oh this guy is not reliable"". On the other hand, if I don't mention these jobs my CV will be rather empty.

I would like to hear your opinions about this."

Seeking advice,confusedguyy9,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/uz8qs2/student_thinking_of_working_in_market_risk/,"Hello everyone, I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student and will be graduating at the end of 2022. So far I have done 2 internships 8 months in finance and 4 months in a non-finance field. During my internship, I got interested in coding and data analysis etc. Basically, I was building a linear model in R using a bunch of data. After some research and speaking to some people I thought Market Risk management would be a good fit for what I want. I want to do coding, and data analysis but am also interested in finance. Unfortunately, I'm an economics major and most of the courses I have taken were theory-based courses. That's why I plan to do a part-time master's in statistics while working full time. Senior people I have met in Market Risk, usually have either economics or other quantitative masters. 
 But I have some questions about Market Risk management. 
1) Firstly, Is Risk Management especially Market Risk management considered a good area in finance? What are the exit opportunities? 

2) If I start in Market risk, would it be possible for me to work as a trader in the future? "

uz9t6e,1,2022-05-27,"Psych told me most people take a 1 month med vacation each year, is that true?",trippinfortawny,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/uz9t6e/psych_told_me_most_people_take_a_1_month_med/,"I've been on Vyvanse for nearly a year (I was diagnosed in my late 20s). After 5 months I found the improvements were fading - e.g. I was still calmer and centred after the meds kicked in, but the effect lasted a few hours rather than the whole day. 

I researched and discovered the concept of tolerance, which my old psych had never mentioned. I tried to take a weekend break from the meds to see if it helped, but once the last dose of meds wore off, I couldn't function. I've tried this multiple times, taking anywhere between 1 and 5 days off the meds. It's the same each time - I'm so fatigued, all I do is sleep. I feel as sleepy as when I take panic attack medication, I literally cannot stay awake. I eat everything in sight, walk into everything, drop everything, I cannot focus on anything at all. I spend 4 hours getting ready to walk the dog, because I'm so slow with everything. It's similar to how I was the few times I've suffered insomnia, but on steroids. I become a zombie.

I'm now back at the point where I take the meds everyday, but I'm procrastinating just as badly as before, losing things, forgetting appts, disorganised, never submitting assignments on time, just generally struggling with the same pre-medication problems. It's still an improvement over being unmedicated, my anxiety is lower, I'm calmer overall, I have a few hours a day where I can accomplish a few things, I get less angry from sensory input. But as I said to my new psych, I couldn't hold down a job like this. They would fire my ass, and by completely justified in doing so. 

In my country there's no other medications I can try - Concerta gave me scary heart palpitations. So the psych said all I can do is take a med vacation, she recommended a month off to see the most effect. She said everyone who takes Vyvanse does this (directly contradicting what my old psych said, he said it's fine to take it all year long, people do that), and that Vyvanse is most commonly prescribed to children (??), they don't take the meds during summer break. 

This has left me very despondent and angry. I have to work/study nearly everyday of the year, assessments all the time, internships. I have to study on weekends too, I'm always playing catch-up so I can't afford to take time off. Not taking the meds means I don't do anything because of how zombified I feel, and even if that wore off after a week, I don't have a week to sacrifice! 

If I can find a full-time job when I graduate, when exactly am I meant to take these med vacations? I'd need two 1-month breaks each year, because tolerance hits after 5 months. I won't even get that much vacation time, and I don't want to spend my vacation time incapable of doing anything but sleeping! My college mentor said 'well, you can still enjoy your vacation time! You can just travel to a nice beach and sleep there!' with a big smile. How is that enjoying my vacation time?! Why would I waste money doing that? I want to be present for those I love, make nice memories, DO THINGS. I've wasted enough of my life in this fog. Also I would definitely be working during some of the med breaks, and how am I supposed to work when I really shouldn't even be crossing a road because of how zombified I feel? 

The psych told me my expectations of myself are too high, and I need to be kinder to myself and accept that I just can't do as much as those without ADHD can. Way to make me feel even more depressed! My earning power will be affected, no matter how 'kind' I am to myself. I don't even have high expectations of myself anymore, I'd be happy to work a repetitive desk job for the rest of my life. I just want some quality of life! Not to miss 2 months a year! I can't work during a med vacation, and what's the point in working if I can't enjoy my annual leave?"

My specialization required me to take courses like Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Big Data Analytics, Stochastic Analysis, and Exploratory Data Analysis through which I developed an intense liking for DS and have decided to make a career swap. I acquired a decent set of skills - TensorFlow, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Plotly, SQL. Did some cool projects related to Time Series Analysis, Unsupervised Learning, and CNN's, been practicing Leetcode just in case.   


I wanted a summer opportunity as a data analyst/scientist or biz analyst intern, but out of the 200+ places I applied, I only got rejection emails (not even an interview/coding round). I'm not exactly sure where I'm going wrong with my application process and kinda worried when it comes to securing full-time offers. Also, I have no previous DS/CS related work experience, it's all Mechanical.I'm concerned if a lack of internship experience would prove detrimental to the full-time application process.  


What could I do this summer (Leetcode/Kaggle/projects/study) so I could score a full-time offer by the end of this year? Also, if any of ya'll know of any internship openings for this summer, do let me know! (I'm based in Manhattan, NY)

I also go to a Tech school for half a day, and they don't offer as many AP classes, but I have to take the computer science classes and AP Physics there because they aren't offered at my normal public school. Due to my school being small, and people's lack of interest in taking APs, most ap classes are only offered one class period, 2nd semester, which can make it insanely hard to fit in your schedule, especially if you want to take 2 APs, but they both happen to be offered at the same class time.
* Senior Year Course Load: My school does 1hr 30 min class-blocks each semester, which means four classes each semester
* Current classes: 1st semester: Internship at local tech company half day, 2nd half of the day accelerated Physics C and PLTW Cybersecurity, 2nd semester: health, AP Calc BC, AP Physics C Mechanics (school doesn't offer E&amp;M-disappointing), DE English

**Letters of Recommendation**

Computer Science teacher- (10/10), I had her sophomore and junior year for AP CS classes (ironic because she knows nothing CS and cannot code); she did robotics, cyber patriot, and worked with me at a tech company over the summer, she showed me the letter before she submitted it and I was shocked, it was also the first time that I had seen her write in complete sentences

Design and photography teacher (7/10)- I wrote a letter asking her to write me a letter, and she repeated what I wanted to do, I also think she only spelled my name wrong once or twice

Guidance Counselor (0/10)- I got mad my sophomore year of high school and walked out of a math class because the class was easy and my teacher refused to let me answer any questions, and then would go over everything over and over again, this ended with me going to the counselor and telling her I wanted to drop out of school, which in turn made her mad, the counselor also would get frustrated because I would ask to take AP classes and then want her to help me fit as many as possible in my schedule but apparently, her job is to ensure that I only take easy classes, anyway I really cannot imagine that she had anything positive to say about me

**Interviews**

MIT interview- It went okay, the interview started late and during that time my anxiety was building up and I got pretty nervous, I talked about coding and building a supercomputer and I think she was impressed, she was quickly unimpressed when she asked me about AP classes and I said I'm only taking five and seemed disappointed that AP Calc BC is the highest math class I'm taking (it's also the highest math class my school offers, and out of the three schools in the county, it's the only school that offers ANY AP math Calc classes), she asked a lot about COVID and I was virtual during that time, I talked about having to take a DE Chem test at a Panera because my house didn't have wifi-interviewer seemed to enjoy that

UMBC interview- so this was interesting, normally they don't do interviews, but I had an interview with the head IT person because my personal statement was about hacking and that seemed to concern them, overall it was pretty much just as an advertisement for the college, but the IT person seemed to think I would be a good fit for working in their IT department, which was weird to me, it sorta seemed like he was trying to hire me

**Essays**

Personal statement(4/10)- I wrote about how I got in trouble for hacking and now I do cybersecurity, it was original, but I honestly think I should have written about something else

Why this college? (8/10)-I wrote something pretty specific for each college related to their CS program, on one of them I wrote a little too much about my code and how I could improve a project (oops)

What do I like to do for fun? (9/10)-talked about dumpster diving and fixing computers

It seems like I wrote a ton about why I was passionate about CS or why I wanted to major in it (9/10)- I talked about how I like Tesla and want to work for them one day as a software developer

Diversity questions (0.001/10)- People tell me that ""oh you're a girl in a male-dominated field, write about that"", no. my gender doesn't affect my ability, Is it awkward to be the only girl in a CS class? Yes. Does it define who I am? No.

I submitted a maker portfolio to MIT- I showed my Face ID code, robot, and some machine learning code I wrote for self-driving cars (nothing particularly impressive)

Family/world I came from(5/10)- talked about how I came from a family of commercial fishermen, what it felt like to be out on the water at sunrise, and how my Dad inspired my work ethic (honestly I hate having to get up in the morning to check gill nets and fishing, but I made it seem like I wanted to do and it wasn't a chore)

I also submitted links to my Github and google sites page whenever I got a chance. My stats might suck, but here's some code!

I also probably should have refrained from talking about illegal activities like hacking and dumpster diving, but maybe it made me stand out?

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Salisbury University 
* UMBC: University of Maryland, Baltimore County 
* University of Maryland-got into the college of Letters and Science for spring semester and not for Computer Science, kinda unfortunate but I guess I can transfer it
* Northeastern- NU Bound Program that I cannot afford, surprised that I got in and for this program considering that I put I didn't want to study abroad on my app
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute-tuition actually is affordable due to scholarships
* William &amp; Mary

*Rejections:*

* Massachusetts Institute of Technology- Of course, it had to be my top pick, but maybe I'll be a janitor there and solve some complex proofs. A little disappointed, but I got bubble tea afterward and that made the majority of the pain go away.
* Caltech- probably good bc there's no way my parents are letting me good to California
* Cornell University
* Johns Hopkins-kinda sucks, I wish I would have done ED but no I wanted to get into one of the most selective colleges instead
* Carnegie Mellon-informed me that I didn't get in off the priority waitlist
* Virginia Tech-not talking about it, somehow I was the only person in my AP Physics class to get rejected

*Waitlisted:*

* Georgia Tech

**Committed:**

* William and Mary- My Dad's really pushing me to go here. I know that it's a very good school, but it doesn't really seem like the right fit for me. 
* I also have a deposit down for Salisbury; I might end up going there depending on family circumstances.
* Either way, I think I will try to transfer to Maryland.

**Reflection:**

I should have been more realistic. I would have loved to go to RPI or northeastern, but they are both far away and expensive. It was also an incredibly stupid idea to apply to as many colleges as I did. Pizza is also a good tool for masking pain and suffering."
uzbvdo,1,2022-05-27,"Need advice on if I should move my inappropriately peeing cat across the country to live with me or let my mom rehome/put her down. I don't know what to do, but feel like the choice is all on my shoulders.",blandandblue,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/uzbvdo/need_advice_on_if_i_should_move_my/,"Hi all, 

So I'm a college student living across the country from my fam (6hr plane ride). I have a family cat that is \~9-10 years old (adopted from a shelter 5 years ago) that has been living with my family since I left for school 3 years ago. She's a very timid cat, hating people walking up to her (cowers or runs away), hates loud noises, usually hiding, etc. However, within the last two or so years, she has started inappropriately peeing, and despite adding and changing litter boxes, litter type, and a trip to the vet (who recommended meds which are extremely difficult to give to her and change her personality a lot, and were about half-effective) she continues to pee in the area around the litter box, but not in it. My mom is moving into a new house and she says she can't deal with cleaning up the pee anymore (which I get - despite using smell neutralizing cleaners and buying a proper wet vac the carpet has begun to make the whole house smell like pee). We do have a dog, so my mom decided as a last-ditch effort to have her stay at her boyfriends, who does have a cat. However, after a couple weeks she began peeing outside the box again. My mom has reached the end of her rope and given me an ultimatum - either I take the cat to live with me across the country, she gets taken to a shelter, or the cat gets put down. 

I don't know what to do. We're not sure if the peeing is because of other animals stressing her out, or just a general behaviour issue. I live in a furnished rental with roommates - if I take in the cat and she continues to pee because of something other than other animals, it wouldn't be fair on my roommates and could lead to us losing our deposit. I also am in the middle of applying to an internship (been told my chances are good) which would take me out of the country for the entire fall semester, leaving the cat with no person to stay with (all of my friends are college students - making someone watch a potentially peeing cat is unfair and difficult) (if I take in the cat I likely can't go - but both my parents think I shouldn't give up this opportunity or I'll regret it). This doesn't even touch on the fact that, with her timid nature I don't think making the cat take a plane ride across the country is fair. I'm not sure me taking in a cat as a dependant is a good idea with how uncertain my life is at the moment. However, I have been told by my mom that she believes putting down the cat is the best option as she is getting old and my mom doesn't think anyone will take her long-term. 

I don't want to be the kind of person who abandons a cat due to something like inappropriately peeing, but it seems like I either take in the cat or my mom will take her to be put down or maybe give her to a shelter, which would probably be traumatic to my cat considering her origins. I don't know what to do. I hate being the person responsible for choosing this. Does anyone have any advice?? Something we should try? Please."

uzhbo5,6,2022-05-28,Question on Negotiating Salary,Tokey_TheBear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uzhbo5/question_on_negotiating_salary/,"Hey there, so I got an offer from a place that I really seem to like. I am a new CS grad, graduated Magna Cum Laude, and I have what I have been told is a pretty good resume, but I do not have any intern experience. 

The point of this post is that, I finished my first in person interview and then got an offer the day after (Yesterday).  I live in Dallas, and the average New Grad Software Eng. salary is about 75k, but just like with everything there are certain high end companies (like Banks and other large firms) which have the potential to pay 90-100k starting for New Grad positions. The company that gave me an offer yesterday is a small firm, and they are offering me 80k starting, 6% 401k matching, and some really good health insurance. 

During the interview, when they asked me towards the end what my desired starting salary was, I said 80k because a lot of the other places I had talked to for interviews were giving \~70k starting, so I figured that 80k would be a decent starting salary to go with. Now that I have the offer though, I am being told by other friends who work in industry that I should be aiming for a 90-100k starting salary, and that I should attempt to negotiate for a higher salary with the company.

So, my main question is this: Given everything above, is it a good idea for me to try to negotiate a higher pay? I am worried I may piss them off by asking for a 90k salary after I had already said in person that I was desiring an 80k salary. But I also have been told that 1. They probably wont rescind my offer just because I ask for a 10k paybump, and 2. Whatever number they give you it is almost always a good idea to try to negotiate for a bit higher than offered.

Thanks everyone!

Also here is my resume for reference:

I am a nurse who has decided to leave nursing and go into IT. I have been doing some self study over the last year and researching career paths, and ultimately would like to end up in a cyber security/information security position. 

I have recently been interviewing for some entry level IT help desk jobs, and this last week interviewed for a non technical customer service support desk role at a cloud software services company. From a cultural fit, I felt like I would fit in well, and they promoted that they have many opportunities for professional development into a technical role for their non technical staff. They also promoted they are really big into helping their employees with getting certs and credentials, shadowing employees in other areas, etc. 

I also recently interviewed for a short term cyber security internship to promote women in technology, and I feel confident that I would be able to secure a spot. However, there is no guarantee that I would be matched with an employer this round (it is a brand new program), which means I could potentially be without a job for several more months until the next round in October. Additionally, there is no job guarantee after the internship; it solely depends on if the company I end up working with wants to hire me. I would come away from it with a few micro credentials and the 12 weeks of cyber security specific experience to seek other positions. 

My query is if it would be worth to start in a non technical adjacent role to get my foot in the door, then transition over, or if it would be more advantageous to have a more technical focused experience? The lack of job security is concerning to me, however I am happy to take the risk if it is a significantly better path forward in terms of use of my time and developing my skills. 

Thank you for any insight!"

I was super excited to finally get and start a SWE internship this summer. I just started last week. I’ve felt pretty confident with all the school work I’ve done so far and with personal projects but have no professional software development experience.  

So I finally started the internship and got my dev environment setup and am feeling extremely overwhelmed looking through the code base. It’s all in a language I don’t really know and is just massive in size compared to anything I’ve touched before. I’m supposed to start working on stuff/picking up tickets soon and I just have no idea where to even start. My manager is really nice but I’m stressed that I should know more than I do and am kind of afraid to ask dumb questions like how do I even start?  I think a big reason I feel this too is that even though I hated my old job, I’d been doing it so long that it was very comfortable/relatively stress free, so this is like the exact opposite. 

Sorry this is kind of a shit post/rant, just got super overwhelmed last week and feeling a bit disappointed with myself. I was so excited to finally have all this work pay off changing careers and then get hit by a bus with all this new information and feel super lost. Anyone have similar experiences that turned out ok (or didn’t turn out ok)?"

• Post-soviet country, very underrepresented 

• Female

• Very low income (5-8k a year)

• First gen student

• Major in international relations, minor in political science

HOOKS:

• I speak 5 languages (4 of them spoken within the household, so very much a multicultural background)

• Scholarship exchange student. Currently finishing up my last 10 days in the States through the Future Leaders Exchange program. It's a highly competitive program offered to post-soviet kids (less than 2% acceptance rate), fully funded by the U.S department of state, administered by American councils, so now I just have a certificate from the U.S  department of state that confirms my successful completion of the program.

 ACADEMICS &amp; ACHIEVEMENTS:

• 3.9/4.0 GPA roughly for my freshman + sophomore year. School doesn't do ranks or provide any honors, ap or ib classes. No where to even test if you self-study either. 

• Junior year, I'm in the states, finished with a 5.8/5.9 weighted on a 6.0 scale, so I'm guessing roughly 3.9/4.0 unweighted? Took 2 AP classes. Took the exam for both AP language and AP psych, expecting a 4 or 5 on both. Didn't have have honors classes or anything at this highschool, other than those 2 AP classes, I took one ""pre-ap"" class: Algebra II. Everything else was regular (7 classes in total so 3/7 not regular)

• Also took the SAT while in the States, didn't do well :/ I got a 1170. (690 on the writing/reading but obviously did poorly on the math portion) I will take the TOEFL when I get home this summer, expecting 110+. 

• Once again, Future Leader Exchange alumna. I'm planning to do internships and become a ""regional representative"" and a bunch of other crap they offer alumna when I go back

• Debate since 7th grade, was vice president of the debate team while in the U.S, got 1st place at UIL district, another 2nd place award at a TFA tournament.

• Mock trial, MUN, no significant wins though (will always be a debate girl, I fucking can't stand mock trial and mun)

• Mediation role play competition, won best team (was me and 1 other dude though) Won 2nd place at a speech competition, random awards like that here and there but always related to politics, speech or debate in one way or another.

• Newspaper - writing and photography. I also enjoy poetry, but that's very much a personal hobby.

• Student council.

• 30 hours of community service while in the U.S, will try to do more back home.

• I'm a tutor. (English language for kids)

• Random certificates of recognition here and there, like for Preparing Global Leaders Forum, presentations I did at different places ect. Always focused on same interests again, though. 


That's basically it. I'm a pretty good writer and have alot to write about in terms of essays, crazy ass life and family (dad recently got questioned by police bc turkish gov hates him for constantly criticizing the gov. will be arrested if he even steps foot into turkey again. took me to my first protest when I was 3, ect. I find this pretty funny considering what I wanna do with my life.)

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:

Full scholarships or atleast majority scholarships + work study to cover the rest (tuition AND accommodation). I cannot afford college at all otherwise. Wanna go to the States mostly, but Europe is fine as well. Once again, intl relations or political science. I'd like places such as UT dallas, UT austin, Texas state or maybe even A&amp;M. Arizona state, Florida international univeristy, most other state schools. I'm kinda desperate, so no real deal breakers except I do not want to go to any religious school. SO even though I'd prefer a warm place with a big city nearby, anything goes I guess, as long as they give me $$$"

Now I'm dying for your company.,dotdeeron,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uzsjgw/i_got_a_free_house_from_a_mysterious_letter_in/,"Hello sir or madame, I am writing to you to in order to tell you my account of events most suspicious. I hereby declare that everything in this letter is a factual account of my experiences over the past week regarding case no. 1238 in Shelby Falls. If you have any questions regarding the case, please contact Dwanye Conye at Shelby Falls Central Police Station. Though, truth be told, you aren't going to get any better information than this:

It all started a week ago. At first, it was like any other Monday morning. I awoke at 6am, dressed up in my uniform, and headed downstairs for a quick cup of coffee and a few biscuits. While sitting at the table, I performed my own personal little morning ritual: studying my officer badge intently and repeating my name mentally as I read it over and over again. It was a habit I picked up when I first joined the force in order to calm my nerves before the day began. ""Officer Albert Rogers,"" I almost said aloud. Seeing my name on the badge made me feel proud. I'm one of the few people who can say that they actually grew into the person they wanted to be as a child.

Once my coffee and biscuits were extinguished, I made a trip to my mailbox to see if anything had come in from the weekend. I'm naturally a disciplined person, but I must admit that I often forget to check my mail regularly. Honestly, knowing what I know now, I wish that I had completely forgotten that I have a mailbox at all.

Inside the mailbox was the usual assortment of spam and advertisements. Great. Maybe this is why checking the mail is such a hard habit to form. It rarely pays off. Initially I was just going to donate all of it to the recycling bin, but there was one letter that stood out. It was a plain letter addressed to me, but oddly there was no return address. It had an old-timey wax seal that was pitch black in color and had a mansion depicted on it. For a few moments, I was actually a bit excited. Was I about to be informed of the death of a long lost relative whose fortune I was to inherit? A few seconds later and my excitement turned to private shame. What a foolish thought. Life couldn't be that stereotypical, could it? But still, I found the mystery too tempting. This is the problem with detectives -- give us even a hint of a mystery and we're hooked. A character flaw really, but a profitable one with the right resources.

Grabbing a pocket knife out of my jacket, I carefully peeled the seal off the envelope. Seemed like a shame to break it. Inside was a standard A4 paper folded twice to fit in the envelope. The contents of the paper appeared to be a shoddy advertisement for a housing development project called Shelby's Retreat. Another one of those all-too-common garden home suburban projects. The ad had an amateurish picture of a happy family in front of home. It honestly looked like it had been clipped out of a magazine. The letter read, in sloppy, weak handwriting, ""We welcome you to Shelby's Retreat! We offer brand new, affordable, quality homes that are perfect for first time buyers or those looking to make their pension go further! Act quickly, houses are selling fast and you won't want to miss this opportunity!""

Below this was a date and time written for an open house: today at 1pm. 1366 Waverly Drive was the address for the showing. I did not see an agent to contact about this viewing, but at the bottom of the page ""Shelby Real Estate Co."" was watermarked. The whole note had me intrigued. Why go through the trouble of adding a wax seal and making the letter look fancy when the contents were so.....unprofessional?  Perhaps I was overthinking it. Anyone can buy wax and get a little stamp these days. The note was amateur quality through-and-through then. Though the unconventional nature of it did make me want to open it. So perhaps it was very effective marketing after-all? I chuckled a little thinking of some poor intern at Shelby Real Estate's offices having to play 4D chess with this advertising campaign.

I discarded the note and envelope with the rest of the trash and proceeded to have a completely uneventful commute to my station. Once at my desk, I began looking through the reports for the day. Several immediately caught my eye. People had been reporting receiving ""creepy, unwanted mail"" in their mailbox. One report included a picture and, as I had begun to suspect, the envelope they received had the same black wax seal on it. The contents of their letter was different from mine. Seemed like the letter was trying to invite them to a birthday party. It had the same crappy graphics that were clearly pasted from a magazine. There was also a date and time, which was illegible, but I was able to barely make out the address: 1366 Waverly Street. Other detectives in the force probably wrote these reports off as some prank by kids, but my gut told me that there was something more...sinister to this.

I booted up my computer and typed in '1366 Waverly Drive' and 'Shelby's Retreat'. No hits for any articles on Shelby's Retreat, but it seems that the neighborhood did exist on Google Maps. I called Shelby Real Estate and inquired about the open house. A sweet voice on the other end of the line told me that they had no recollection of an open house for that address, if Shelby's Retreat did exist, it was not in their files.

This was beginning to look suspicious enough to investigate further. I entered the new case file into our system for the letter I received (case 1238) and began driving towards the suburb to do an initial investigation. The sky was completely dreary when I left. What started out as a sunny October morning became a gray, cloudy mess with an annoying drizzle of cold rain. The kind of drizzle that made you turn on your windshield wipers for one swipe before waiting three or so minutes for it to accumulate enough to justify another.

Once I had gotten to the periphery of the suburb, I slowed my vehicle down to a leisurely crawl so I could absorb the details of my surroundings. From the outside, the suburb looked mostly complete and built. However, there was no sign at the entrance giving a name for the neighborhood. Who knew if this was even Shelby's Retreat. Well, if Shelby's Retreat even existed, of course. Driving into the main arterial road for the suburb, I noticed that most of the houses had well-kept lawns and their exteriors looked freshly built, but there was no sign of inhabitants for any of the dwellings. No cars in the driveways, no lights on in the house. For such a grey day, they should have been visible from the outside I thought. I began driving down the minor streets to check more houses, but it was all very much the same. New houses, no inhabitants. Perhaps the letter was correct? These houses were so newly built that no one had even moved in yet. Going to the 1366's open house might provide more answers, I thought.

It was on Waverly Drive that I saw the one and only sign of life in the neighborhood. In the driveway of 1364 Waverly Drive, the neighbor of 1366, was a beaten-up looking car. There were still no lights in the house, however. Whoever lived there must of had two cars and took one out for some chores, I thought. Then, I noticed a peculiar string of yarn hanging out of 1364's mailbox. It was tethered to the inside of the mailbox and it went all the way to the front door of 1364. I couldn't help but think ""God Bless America"". Here was someone so lazy that they devised a system to get their mail without ever leaving the comfort of their home. Perhaps I could use such a system to check my own mail? Would make it less of a hassle. Funny thinking that with one pull of a rope I could dump all of those ads while drinking my morning coffee.

Turning my attention back to 1366, I noticed that there was a distinct lack of guests or even a real estate agent waiting outside of the house. As I began to approach the main entrance of the house, I experienced the all-to-familiar tingling of adrenaline. Something about this seemed so...off. A neighbourhood with only one inhabitant, an open house with closed doors and no welcome party. It did not feel right. What if this was an elaborate set up for a mugging? The more I looked at the facade of 1366, the more hesitant I became. My mind started playing silly tricks on me in order to get me to turn heel. It tried to convince me that the two front-facing windows, dark from the lack of lighting, were actually windows into the abyss. Or the cold, dead eyes of predator that feels no remorse as it sinks its teeth into its prey.

The wind was starting to pick up now and, combined with the freezing rain, I had to make a decision. This was supposed to be an open house (or a birthday party) after all, so there should be no harm taking a peek inside. And I should be safe, I had a gun with me after all. If this whole suburb was some den for crackheads or thieves, at least I had some protection. As I began walking towards the front door, I saw some movement from the corner of my eye, but it was not coming from 1366.

I looked to the left and studied a window from the side of 1364. There was an elderly man with his face pressed into the window glass. When I moved my hand to the doorknob of 1366, I saw his hands move to the front of his face. At first I thought he was to shout something, but it seems that he was...praying? Though it was hard to tell from a distance, I could of sworn that a uniform trickle of tears were rolling down his face. Was my mind just playing tricks on me once again? I yelled out to him that I was an officer and asked if he needed assistance. He looked wide-eyed at me and ducked below the window. I walked up to the window, but it was too high for me to peek down into his house. I knocked a few times asking if the old man needed my help, but I received only silence. I continued to listen. Silence. Silence. The wind blowing between the houses. Rain drops hitting the vinyl sidings of the house. Silence. After about a minute I turned around to return to 1366, but as I did so I heard weeping prayers to Jesus and Mother Mary coming from the window behind me.

""Christ, that's sad."" I thought to myself. The man must of had dementia or some other illness and was probably abandoned by his caretakers for the day. I breathed deeply and returned to the door of 1366. Exhaling, I opened the door and took my first step inside.

The inside of the house looked...impossible. It was much larger than the outside would imply. And the interior decoration looked...ancient. Like an old mansion you'd see in fairy tales or on Disney rides. It was also completely dark save for a few candles that lined a grand stairway in front of me. At the top of this staircase was some kind of altar flanked by smaller staircases that led to the second floor of the house. A house that was clearly only a single floor from the outside. I thought it might have been the darkness playing a trick on me, but this was far too elaborate to explain away with the mere movement of shadows being processed by an anxiety-laden mind.

I did not go back. I could not go back. There was something compelling me to look at the altar on the stair landing. Step by step, I walked up until the altar's contents came into view. It was another letter with an identical envelope to the one I and so many others had received. I did not take time to carefully open this one. I hastily ripped its contents out. Unfolding the paper, I saw a message in rather fancy cursive writing:

&amp;#x200B;

*In this house full of dread*

*Not many are willing to tread*

*But you have entered instead*

*Giving me my daily bread*

&amp;#x200B;

""All this for some high school poetry!?"" I shrieked out in anger. My voice bounced off the far walls and ceiling of the foyer. I threw the paper on the ground in frustration and stood there breathing heavily. Once the echoes of my anger had subsided, the only sound to be heard was the whispering of the wind and the plip-plopping of rain outside. The rain seemed to get louder. And louder. And louder still. Until it was no longer rain. It was the sound of heavy boot steps coming from the stairs beside me. I could not make out much in the darkness, but each step was getting louder and louder. Like a body being slammed to ground with each step of some unseen being's gait. I pulled out my gun and pointed it into the darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm Officer Rogers, a member of the Shelby Police. Lay down on the ground and identify yourself!""

&amp;#x200B;

There was no noticeable change in the rhythm of footsteps. They continued until suddenly I saw it. Two feet wearing a familiar set of shoes entered the dim candlelight of the staircase. As they slowly shuffled down the stair case, their torso was revealed and, in two more steps, I saw its grotesque face. Only, it was my face. And my body. Except my eyes were not my eyes. They had been replaced by two of the black, waxy seals as seen on the envelopes. They were halfway melting, with the resulting black drip giving the beast a weepy appearance. It raised its hand and from its index finger grew a long, curved blade. It was probably half a meter in length. Its steel glowing a pale orange from the candlelight and casting a long, serpent-like shadow on the wall.

The sight of my armed doppelgänger was too much, and I fired two shots without hesitation. Both went through the chest, but the monster did not react. It kept its slow pace and continued plodding towards me. I breathed in deep and honed my sights for the creature's eyes. Those damned black eyes that made a mockery of my visage. With one shot I popped off the seal from the left eye of my worse half. Instead of staring into a bullet wound from where I shot the creature, I found a glowing red eye staring back at me. This unblinking red eye that pulsed like the embers of dying fire had me so completely entranced that I did not notice that this crazed version of me was within arm's reach. It was too late. I looked down and the creature's silver-orange blade was sunk deep into my belly. I saw my blood trickle out from my sweater and jacket. It seemed to follow its own path rather than the one dictated by gravity. Running down the blade and then up the arm and body of the creature until it flowed into that red eye.

Then, it simply retracted its blade and disappeared. I looked down at my stomach and the wound was gone. I felt weak, but I could still stand. Looking at the altar, I noticed a new letter sitting upon it -- tempting me to give it another read.

""Oh fuck this.""

I ran to the front door and yanked it open. The outside all looked the same -- except that the car in front of 1364 was now gone. I guess the old man was capable of leaving by himself after all. Using the remains of my might, I dashed to my own vehicle. However, the further away I got from the house, the greater a pressure I felt in my chest. It became harder and harder to breathe as I approached the handle of the car. Nonetheless I made it inside. Looking into the rear-view mirror, I made a sick discovery: my skin look parched and my hair was graying. It was as if I had aged 10 years. Perhaps that's also why I felt weaker.

I fished the car keys out of my pocket. I was about to stick them in the ignition when suddenly I had a premonition of the car blowing up as soon as the metal connected. My heart starting palpitating harder. I would need to run instead, but outside the car stood two ravens in the street. If I tried to run, they ARE going to dive into my eyes I thought. I knew. Chest pounding more frequently now. I could see it clearly. Those birds would fly into the sky and then dive bomb directly into my eye sockets. I hear a crash coming from the rear window of the car. Chest was practically collapsing now. A hooded man man with a trench jacket broke through the window and is connecting hundreds of pipes to the car exhaust. I will suffocate in this car.

I looked to my badge. It has always been my saviour. My soothing ritual. ""Albert Rogers Officer"" I repeat over and over, but the heaviness I feel in my chest is no longer bearable. My only hope is the house. It just \*has\* to be. I quickly discard the badge and explode out the car and towards the house. Ripping the doors open and slamming them shut behind me. My chest eases. I can breathe again. I look out the window. There is no sign of my earlier assailants.

Taking a few moments to breath and let it all sink in, I realize that there is nothing more for me to do than read that expecting letter. Thump, thump, thump. I drag my feet up the stairs, mimicking the menacing mimic who had assaulted me minutes earlier. I put a heavy hand on the altar and, with the other, picked up the envelope. This time I opened it with diligent care. Inside I found a set of rules and directives:

*Come to me, sweet lamb*

*Feed me and sustain me*

*You are one of my prisoners*

*In a jail with but one escape*

*Bring me another to the dreary home of 1368*

So, here I am a week later. I am but a shadow of my former self. Every night at midnight my red-eyed doppelgänger  takes another piece of me. I grow older. My body and heart grow more frail. I've tried hiding, but it always finds me. I've tried going outside, but I am only strong enough to get to the mailbox before the hallucinations begin and I start wheezing. I wish I took that rope from 1364. It would have given me great assistance in getting to and from the mailbox.

But I believe I have figured out how this curse operates. In order to free myself, I just need to invite another to the neighbouring house. Have this evil spirit, beast, or whatever take them instead of me. That's how the being gets fresh food. I once asked what would happen if I simply choose to rot away, and the being responded that they know how to ration. I could live my whole lifetime in this agony. I have tried to end myself, but every time I try to do so, I get these strong feelings of hope. Praying that one day a stray car will pass by and maybe, just maybe, someone will wander into the house at 1368 and pick up that letter.

I have now resigned myself to send letters, much like the one I am writing now, to curious individuals. I'm not like the host of 1364. I do not want to trick you. I am writing my full account so that you know what you are in for. So come on all you paranormal investigators, puzzle solvers, and wannabe Witchers...

Won't you be my neighbour?"

uzubvm,50,2022-05-28,Feeling burned out before I even get started…,Typical_Comfortable9,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/uzubvm/feeling_burned_out_before_i_even_get_started/,"Very new therapist here. I just graduated this month and applied to sit for the LMSW exam…the community health agency where I completed my second internship for my MSW offered me a job a few months before I graduated and let me start part time (15 billable hours) and with the goal of ramping up my hours to full time (30 billable hours/week) this summer. I thought it would be great to graduate with a job that includes free supervision so I accepted the job….but the only problem is that I am only three months into this new gig and already feeling so insanely burned out that I don’t think I can sustain this.

I have a caseload of 32 children and adolescent clients and between sending appt reminders to parents, applying for authorizations, writing notes, conducting sessions, and scheduling I am working 55-60 hours in total. My agency has me split between three schools, telehealth, and office appts. My agency also offers me a generous (sarcasm) 40% split of all clients medicaid reimbursement for sessions, no no-show protection, no medical coverage, no mileage reimbursement, no PTO unless 30 billable hours are hit weekly, and now our 401K option has been taken away. Additionally, clinicians are now responsible for billing and collecting session fees for all self-pay clients even though the office has admin staff (this is giving me tremendous anxiety as a clinician who now feels like a debt collector on top of everything else I do.)

I am struggling to meet the 30 billable hour requirement and when I do I am EXHAUSTED. I don’t have energy for my boyfriend, friends, or family. Not to mention, I just experienced a family tragedy a couple months ago (a close family member completed suicide), and my supervisor keeps throwing high-acuity suicidal clients at me. 

Everything in me is screaming that I am being taken advantage of and need to walk away from this job, but I’m worried about losing the free supervision my agency offers. I just don’t want to be this exhausted, burned out, and jaded before I even get started with my career.

Advice please?!"

Going into my junior year. In terms of completing my major, I would say I’m slightly ahead of average, but still there are many kids at my level.

Languages I know, C, C++, python (self learned so not extremely familiar), SQL

As the title says I really want to prepare well this summer with the goal of getting a great internship for next summer. Currently, I’m doing an internship this summer, it was the only place that gave me an offer and its kinda to get my foot in the door. Not a very “high tier” internship, but still very grateful for the chance to learn.

Apart from the leetcode and interview prep, what is the best way to spend my time. I was thinking a project of some sort. Right now I only have two, and neither are very advanced. I’m not sure if I should take what I already know and go more advanced. Or if I should learn something new that may be relevant. Please let me know what you think and I can clarify anything if necessary."

uzvg4e,6,2022-05-28,Recent Admit Needing Advice,arzee9,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uzvg4e/recent_admit_needing_advice/,"Hi, a few days ago I found out that I was admitted off an appeal, and I now have until 6/1 to commit. I'm beyond grateful because Cal is one of my top choices, but I have one major concern.

In November, I applied for bioengineering as I was interested in the intersection of engineering and the biomedical sciences. Since then, as a result of an internship at a mechE firm, I've realized that while I still want to end up in the BME industry (specifically medical devices), I'd rather go the MechE route so that I can have greater specialization in device design and fabrication.

As a result, these past few days I've been researching internal CoE major transfers, and I understand the [whole process](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/change-of-college/) where freshman must maintain a certain gpa in certain classes. And while I find this approach doable, I just don't think that I can attend Berkeley in good conscience having to take a year of BioE (intro courses don't overlap with MechE) before I can even apply to transfer. Furthermore, MechE has some of the most requirements out of the CoE, and I do not want to extend my graduation while paying OOS tuition.

At the school I've currently committed to, I'd be able to jump into MechE right away.

So my question is, has anyway had luck transfering CoE majors prior to freshman year (without undergoing the whole maintain gpa in technicals process)? I plan to contact Berkeley soon and explain my situation, with the meager hope that they would change my major to mechE.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Applied to Berk as bioE--rejected. Realized my interests were more aligned with mechE and got accepted into a school for MechE. Just now, I was accepted off an appeal, and can't see myself going to Berk if I have to go through a year of BioE. Should I abandon my Cal dreams if I will be unhappy with my major selection?

Any help would by appreciated. Thank you so much for reading."
uzwpfr,4,2022-05-28,How is the job market in Germany and the Netherlands for junior backend developers (1-2 YOE)?,clytaem,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/uzwpfr/how_is_the_job_market_in_germany_and_the/,"I'm a recent graduate having my first full-time job as a backend software engineer in Prague. During studies I've had an internship at the same company for 9 months, where I was mostly working on REST API's (Python, Django, Docker, K8s etc.). Before that I spent 2.5 years as a software tester&amp;application support specialist. I also used to contribute to some open-source projects, then I had to quit because of exams, but I'd like to continue with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently earning 2431€ gross, which is 1903€ per month after taxes (with bonuses). After I pay rent (45m2 flat for 2), bills and food (eating out once-twice per day, I'm not much into cooking) I'm left with around 1000€. I'm quite satisfied with my job and salary, however I'd like after a year to move somewhere else to gather more international experience. Better pay would be nice, but I don't care that much about money as long as I can live comfortably. I wanted to go on Erasmus, but because of COVID it didn't work out, so I thought finding a job might the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I speak English (C1) and German (B2). I really love big, urban and progressive cities like Amsterdam, Hamburg or Berlin. I'm not a fan of heat nor mountains and I don't mind shitty weather. How is the job market for juniors with EU citizenship and 1-2 YOE over there? Is it hard to find a job? Are there any other countries in the EU you'd recommend? I checked some job openings in these cities, but like I have no idea how many applicants they have on average."

uzwuxt,2,2022-05-28,Is it okay to ask why you were hired?,PoorPassword,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uzwuxt/is_it_okay_to_ask_why_you_were_hired/,"I’m going to try to keep this short.

I was hired for a 2-year PhD research internship at a big company and I guess it still hasn’t settled in.

This is a dream job for me as this company is one of the leading names in the field and it comes at a low point during my PhD where I was even considering dropping out. And I haven’t even mentioned that I will be making triple what was previously just my stipend.

The problem is that I don’t know why I was hired. I don’t feel qualified enough, I know other people who have applied to the same position which I would even pick over me. I’m super happy but at the same time extremely anxious about working there. Is it okay to ask for feedback as to what they liked about me that made them give me the position?

Edit: I think everyone seems to agree it’s not a good idea to ask this. Someone even suggested that I might be suffering from imposter syndrome, which I thought about myself but I’ve always felt that I shouldn’t try to self diagnose based on what I read on the internet.

That being said I booked myself a session with a licensed therapist. This seems to be the best course of action to avoid making any dumb decisions and calming myself before the work starts.

Thanks to everyone who replied. I’ve really taken your words into consideration."

A degree apprenticeship for software engineering at a well known company with a 21k salary for when I do it (I'd be 18) and id finish it with a digital and technology solutions degree specialising in software engineering and id have 4 yrs experience and the degree and tuition with them would be all paid by them or a traditional cs degree with an internship. The first one seems much more appealing but would I be judged for not having a cs degree?

I’m currently going into my second year at a university in Canada, specializing in finance, and majoring in economics. I need advice on a couple of areas:

1. What career path or job would suit me if I wanted to do something related to finance or business, but also wanted a decent work life balance. I heard industries like Investment banking and consulting are rly competitive and strenuous, so what careers are more suitable for someone who still wants to be in finance or business, but doesn’t want to be under that amount of stress. 

2. What are the best ways to network and get internships (I get good grades but have trouble getting to know people). What tips do you have to get better at it. 

3. I read online that you shouldn’t get an mba immediately after finishing you bachelors. Is this true? I am interested in grad school and would like a recommendation of what degree to get (ex. mba vs mfin) and when to go (ex. two yrs after finishing undergrad). 

Thank you."

uzyat6,60,2022-05-28,Do not come to Rotman Commerce,Romeo_Santos-,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/uzyat6/do_not_come_to_rotman_commerce/,"I finished my 4 years at Rotman Commerce a month ago, and wanted to share my experience on here.

I will not write a huge rant telling all of you that Rotman Commerce/University of Toronto has been the worst experience of my life and that I totally regret coming here. What I will do, however, is list a number of reasons why I do not think that Rotman Commerce is worth it.

\#1 Grade Deflation

Most people who visit Reddit often will likely already be familiar with the grade deflation that occurs at UofT. To be fair, this is not the case in most Rotman courses, though there are some exceptions (like RSM435: Future and Options Market). However, all Rotman students are required to take ECO101 and 102 in first year, and ECO204 in second year. To say that ECO101 is hard would be an understatement. I find it ridiculous that the average for the first term test back in 2018 was a 54, and the professor had to curve it to a 64, which he thought was more fair, and that the historical average is around C+. (The professor had to curve up the final exam by 14% because the average was so low). This means that ECO101 will likely be everyone's lowest mark, and will bring down their Cgpa. Those students who choose to drop ECO101 in fall and retake it in the winter fall behind by 1 credit, so they have to take ECO102 in the summer (meaning the university makes money by intentionally keeping the averages low).

In addition, the Finance and Economics stream requires students to take ECO209, which is just as annoying and difficult as ECO101, and 2.5 FCE of ECO 300+ level courses. This means that students have a hard time maintaining a high GPA (above 3.3) as a result of the low averages enforced by the economics department.

\#2 Effort

This point goes hand-in-hand with the first one. Since a lot of the courses have low averages, students have to spend a lot of time reviewing their class notes and studying the material if they want to get good grades in their classes. The average Rotman student spends more time studying for every class than any other student in Schulich, McMaster, Ryerson, etc. Thus, they do not have as much time to network, be involved in extracurriculars, apply to internships/positions, and have a harder time landing internships and full-time roles compared to students in other business schools. This is even worse for commuters and/or people who have to work part-time during school, as they have even less time to study and focus on their careers.

\#3 Cost

Rotman Commerce's tuition is $17,000 for the second, third and fourth year. Schulich costs around $9,600 per year, and so does Ryerson, McMaster, and other comparable programs in terms of reputation.

Queens Commerce costs $17,000 per year (4 years), and Ivey (Western) costs $30,000 for the last 2 years, but both schools have better reputations than Rotman and prepare students more for the job search,

\#4 Career preparation

Rotman Commerce career services needs a lot of work. A lot of students in first and second year are not prepared for recruitment. For example, all my friends were not familiar with the different recruitment windows throughout the year, and had no idea how to network or write a proper resume. This is why so many Rotman students are unable to land any internships across all 4 years, but students at other universities do.

\#5 Mental Health

Another common problem at UofT across programs.

The grade deflation combined with large number of students (most of whom commute from outside Toronto) means that a lot of people can feel lonely and suffer from ""Impostor Syndrome"". As you may imagine this does not really help in having a great university experience, especially for international students who came to Canada for the first time.

Once again, I am being completely honest and sharing my experience.

To be fair, there are some pros to Rotman Commerce, such as the variety of electives available in upper years (courses on Negotiation, Excel, Python, Machine Learning) and professors that have worked in the professional field and are very knowledgeable.

However, I think that the cost of tuition for what you get in the program is too high and just not worth it. If I was able to go back in time and choose business schools again, I probably would pick Schulich (which I got accepted in). I know several people from my high school who went there, had a great experience, and landed internships and full-time roles, while I see so many Rotman alumni who are struggling to get their careers started."

Hello all, I got a badass internship this summer and I want to knock it out of the park. My problem is I’m an electrical engineering major with minimal C++ coding experienceand my projects will all also include a large amount of python coding to emulate SMNP/SIP/UDP/TCP emulation with an emphasis on SNMP at the moment.

I feel like a fish out of water. I have thus far copied most of my code from the internet and when trying to teach myself what each line of code means I often end up with more questions about the code than I started with. 

Any advice on solid places to learn python for the network and transport payers of the OSI model would be very much appreciated!"

Can you let me know how much that harms me? My ecs below will include what I have planned and the years include senor year.

Tutoring two students, beginning summer before senior year

Purple Pearls (Community Service Club, Possibly a Secretary), 2 years

\*\*By the time i apply ED I'll probably be at 100+ hours of community Service.\*\*

**Finance:** Parent makes \~65k a year and also have a sibling in high school. My mother (separated)gives 10,000 for my brother, my dad, and I so some financial aid will be needed

**Location and weather:** Preferably Northeast with all the seasons! I'm also interested in a smaller student population, in the range of 500 to 15,000 undergrads.

**School:** Dark Academia vibes and small/secluded, like a college town. Also, in love with LAC's.

**Family:** My dad never has a bachelor's and my mom has a master's degree and is working toward a phd rn.

**Recommendations:** I think I'm pretty good on recommendations. One of my letters is my

AP Lit Teacher (9.5/10)

Founder of the place I am interning at (7/10)

**Awards:** I have a handful of awards for track and field (800m, 1600m) and like 2 in Cross Country.

v02bdm,19,2022-05-28,2nd mid-life career change: should I pursue Network Administration or Data Analytics? (Job/Salary/Growth/Subject Matter Challenges),Randomessa,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/v02bdm/2nd_midlife_career_change_should_i_pursue_network/,"I'll try to do the TL;DR at the start: I'm 44F, with an ancient (15+ year old) 2-year Computer Science certificate, an equally ancient BFA in Digital Design/Graphic Arts, and a brand new Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Paralegal Studies (that was career change #1). Looking to change professions again to either Network Admin or Data Analytics; I could finish courses in either in about 1.5 years from now at my local community college, additional certs notwithstanding. Trying to get a realistic view of salary expectations and job duty expectations from an entry level standpoint, keeping in mind I'm employed full-time so doing an internship is out of the question for me. I can accept a pay cut (from a current rate of $43k/yr) with an entry-level role such as help desk, but do need to start making up that gap pretty quickly as I work, so I'm seeking advice, warnings, things I need to consider but may have overlooked, expectations vs. reality, etc.

The TL: Right now, working as a paralegal, it's fine, I have a good gig, pays good, not amazing, but I didn't expect it to be amazing going in, so no problems there. But now that I've had some time to get my bearings in the role, I have looked around and don't see as many opportunities to increase my income as I'd hoped.

Background: I'll preface this by saying I've only recently been diagnosed with ADHD and in retrospect it's clear that it's been with me all my life without me knowing it, but explains virtually everything. As a kid I had two interests: ""computer stuff"" and arguing about technicalities, so I was always told I should either ""go into computers"" or ""become a lawyer."" I went with Electronics and Software Engineering as my dual major since the legal profession was overpopulated, but washed out horribly since my ADHD didn't carry my A-grade performance over to university and I fell apart. Switched majors to CS at the last second to avoid being kicked out, but only got halfway through the CS degree before it caught up with me, so all I had enough credit for was the two year CS Certificate. Just ""Computer Science,"" no specialization.

My first job out the gate was working for an IT Help Desk (""Help Desk Analyst"") for a family-run company in IL. At $13/hr in 2002 (so that experience is far too ancient to count in my favor) it paid well enough for me to have my own place and make my car payments, and the IT department was willing to let me shadow them for either programming or network admin if I wanted to. Too bad I was also interviewing for a paralegal job (which I didn't get because I was late for the 2nd interview... ADHD), and then decided on a whim to put everything I owned in my car and drive to CA (...ADHD).

My first job out in CA was as a temp for a major telecom company doing ""data entry"" that turned into ""project admin"" then ""project coordination"" which turned into ""network coordination"" which paid really, really well for just basically knowing how to use Excel and communicate. I went for a quick and easy online accredited degree so that I could demand that extra salary, which was Digital Design for me since I'd spent a lot of time making webpages when I was in university, so I essentially didn't need to learn any of the tools.

I did the telecom thing for another 12 years (and got married, bought a house, etc. DINK lifestyle), but ultimately felt like I didn't want it to be my career for life, nor did I want to take the next ""logical"" step and move into project management, because I couldn't keep my keys/glasses/wallet straight, let alone a several hundred million dollar project. Cue dissatisfied move to OH, where I floundered around for another couple of years doing temp work until another telecom company headhunted me and the salary was, again, too good to refuse. At this point I bit the bullet and enrolled into the paralegal program at the local community college.

Why did I go the legal route instead of IT/Network Admin? I guess I figured since the telecom company dealt with leases, I could maybe move into a lateral role within the department doing legal stuff. I didn't feel as adjacent to the IT side.

FF to three years later, I'm interviewing for paralegal jobs, the pandemic hits literally two weeks after I get and accept an offer (at a pay cut, so I can grow), so there's no time to reconsider. I spend the next year and a half working exclusively from home as a paralegal, an opportunity for which I'm immensely grateful. It also gives me the opportunity to look into whether I have ADHD, I get a diagnosis and medication which \*changes my life\* - it makes me better at my job, yes, but more importantly it gave me a different insight into the courses I took and failed at before, and made me wonder if I could even begin to approach them again. It put IT more seriously back on the table for me.

So here I am looking at maybe enrolling in the local community college Network Admin Certificate program, which I can start in September but which requires a pre-requisite that I can take this summer semester, or their 31-week Data Analytics (specifically for Career Changers) program that starts in September. Thing is, I don't know which would be a better fit for me. I don't know if I'd feel strongly that I prefer one or the other, although my understanding is the potential earnings are higher with the Data Analytics path. I have more fear around the Databases since those were classes I actively failed before, and so there's part of me that is afraid that maybe I just can't do it at all, in which case Network Admin would be a reasonable backup.

I know nobody can answer for me whether I'd ""like"" to do Network Administration more versus Data Analytics, but with the choice between the two, are there real issues that stand out with Network Admin from an entry level perspective where realistically, it doesn't look like I'd be able to weather the pay cut and ""working my way up"" at age 44 where I'm currently basically ""making exactly as much money as I need to make right now,"" and on the other hand, is there any advice around Data Analytics for how challenging the subject matter might be or ways to get my head around it, or get more confident about getting my head around it, I guess?

Good/bad anecdotes? Pointers?"

I chose CpE because I liked the idea of both hardware and software and didn’t know which I wanted but over the past few months or so, I have started to enjoy software more. I was wondering how CpE(course distribution between circuits/cs) is like at UCI and if anyone knows of others who turned to SwE after graduation or did SwE/CS internships as a CpE since I know that a lot of cpe grads go into software. What extra elective classes should I take to help me prepare myself better for an SwE related job in the future? If you can provide any insight as a current or former CpE major that would be very helpful. Thanks in advanced!"

I also, do web scraping and automation with Python using Scrapy and Selenium frameworks.

I'm looking for a remote summer internship to improve my professional career and gain more experience. I'm willing to work full-time (8 hours a day) for 300$/month.

PS:- I am also waiting for decisions from ASU MS IT and CSULB MS CS. If I get into any of these two programs, I would choose them. But, since there is no communication yet from the both of them, I would have to atleast be prepared if Binghamton is the one I go ahead with."

v0c1bz,1,2022-05-29,I feel so uncomfortable around my roomies now,oingoboingo8977,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/v0c1bz/i_feel_so_uncomfortable_around_my_roomies_now/,"My roomies and I have known each other for several years. My best friend (let’s call her M) has been like my sister since we were very little, and her boyfriend (D) is also a close friend. They let me move in with them a few years ago due to COVID and numerous other issues. In that time, they told me to just save up, pay off debts, and collect furniture so I could eventually move out. I’ve been doing all of these things, but have had a few setbacks. 

For example, my car got totaled so I had to get a lease. I used most of my savings for the down payment to try and get the monthly fee as low as possible. I also paid off like $4k in credit card debt that I’d accumulated from having no job a few years ago, so that took a lot of my money as well. I also have been bettering myself with therapy and other things, which cost money. Over all though, I’ve saved a decent amount, but nothing to live off of for too long. 

Recently they’ve been saying they want more time alone, and I get that. But they asked me to do this in the winter, when I had basically nowhere to go outside of the house besides my job. We are still being mindful of COVID so my options to go anywhere are limited. My boyfriend also lives 45 min away with his parents who are religious and won’t let me stay the night, so I can’t be gone too long at his house and his house is a little awkward anyway because of his parents being there. 

Okay, so then they ask me to contribute to some bills since I’ve been there for a while and they were having money problems (even though D has been splurging on various hobby equipment for a while now but I know that’s mostly none of my business). No biggie. I told them I could pay the wifi bill since I don’t make much but I could at least do that much. I want to contribute and help out if I can, that’s not the issue at all. They said that was fine. 2 mos later, they hit me with a lease agreement saying I have until October 31 to move out. They told me I could stop paying the wifi bill and start saving again, and if I stay after Oct. 31, I have to pay $600/mo. I asked them to lower it to $500 so I could at least continue to save for my own place, otherwise I’ll have to pull from my savings so really I’ll be even less likely to leave. Nope. They won’t budge. 

I’m more just frustrated because I do a lot of chores, I contribute money where I can for fast food/groceries, and I constantly checked in with them to make sure everything was okay and I could still live there and they said things were fine-until suddenly they weren’t anymore. 

I’m especially annoyed because I feel like this is their knee-jerk reaction to fixing their relationship. D has bipolar disorder and autism and struggles with his temper sometimes unless he smokes weed. Rather than get him therapy and proper meds, I feel like they’re putting the blame of the tension in their relationship onto me and booting me out. 

I’m also annoyed because they cited “needing time alone” and said they hadn’t had a trip or time alone as a couple for the several years they’ve been together. So like literally before I was even in the picture. Also, I picked up shifts at work so they could be alone for M’s birthday weekend (even though I really wanted to see her) and they spent the whole weekend hanging out with our friends and their new baby. Which they keep doing, almost every. Single. Weekend. But when I mention this to them and suggest they take some time for themselves they say it’s fine and they enjoy doing it. What?? 

D literally didn’t have a job for MONTHS because he refused to get a job that made him work weekends so he could spend more time with M, and they’re still dedicating their weekends to other people. But I’m the problem? 

They’re basically obsessed with our friends’ baby and dedicate all of their spare time for it. They even use his picture for our house profile pic on a home app instead of my dog like it used to be, even though he doesn’t even live here. 

The biggest annoyance is that I told them I would move out within the year because my bf would be finishing up school and would have his own job so we’d be golden. Instead of waiting a few more months until I have a better idea of my bf’s position with his internship or anything else (he’s foreign, so he doesn’t even have a credit score or SSN-another concern I’ve had about moving out), they dropped this on me out of the blue. Now I just feel rushed, stressed, and very hurt. They keep telling me I’m a great roommate and it isn’t personal, but I feel like D is lowkey brooding about it and feeling some type of way towards me. I think he wants more time with M and instead of setting boundaries with the new baby, it’s easier for him to put it all on me and just want me out. 

I just signed their little lease agreement they printed out, because what other choice do I have? But I feel very lonely and upset. I spent all weekend not speaking to anybody because they left me again to be with the baby. Then they came home and D barely even looked at or spoke to me while I talked to M about my bf trying to figure out his internship situation-which may fall through now because his advisor is quitting and he has yet to get a SSN or letter from her. D lit right up when M mentioned me signing the agreement though!! He was suddenly very animated and talking really fast and excited and pushing me to sign it. I just feel heartbroken that I might lose my friends over this. I would love to move out right now just to get away from them because I feel so uncomfortable now, but I don’t make a decent wage and so can’t afford the income requirements most places have. I’ve been applying to more jobs lately to get a better income, but I’m still waiting to hear back. 

I just feel really lonely and depressed and I can’t even talk to my therapist because her office messed up my insurance and I’m still waiting for refunds and other things from them-if they even finally give me my refund. I’m just so stressed and sad. I have my wisdom teeth coming out this Friday too and M is supposed to take me and I just don’t even know how to talk to her anymore. If I say anything about D needing therapy or whatever, I’m worried I’ll make it worse. I just feel so alone. Thanks for letting me vent. 

tl;dr: my best friends are kicking me out and even though they’re being nice about it, I feel like I’m being pinned as a scapegoat for their relationship problems."

Also sorry if this has been asked before. I was digging around a bit and couldn't seem to find too much around this stuff.

I'm an incoming freshman who's kind of thirsting over these first/second year programs, and I was wondering if anyone who already did one or had any experience with the process could help me understand where the ""bar"" is compared to a regular internship.

I currently don't have much experience besides a really simple program that takes a fraction in the form of a string and simplifies it. I'm going to try and make a game with Unity over the summer though, and I might have the opportunity to collaborate on a scraper bot/website to display the scraped statistics that one of my more experienced friends is making. 

Are those projects impressive enough? I assume these big companies will have pretty high expectations, but also these are the internships designed for complete newbies, and I even heard that if you're too experienced they'll reject you from the baby internship and tell you to apply to their normal ones (definitely not something I need to worry about though haha).

Also, I know that for STEP applicants are supposed to turn in an essay along with their resume. Is this more like a cover letter or more like a college essay, and also what's the difference between the two? I apologise for my cluelessness.

Finally, this sounds really pretentious, but how much does the school you go to matter for these types of programs? I'm going to Duke, which I've heard has a fair amount of overall prestige but isn't too stand-out in CS. Will that help me at all, or do they not care unless its somewhere like MIT?

Thanks so much if you read through this mess, and of course I'd love any other advice people might have regarding these programs. Hope you all have a wonderful day!"

LORs:

AP Physics teacher: 9/10, my favorite teacher by far. He's super lax and funny, and doesn't take himself too seriously. I love his class and I'm the type of kid to sit at the front of class and ask the most questions. I've also discussed with him my college plans and how I was thinking of going into physics in the future. He is very easy to talk to so I developed a close relationship.

AP Lang teacher: 8/10, although at the start of the year I found my teacher very hard, I've changed as I found it easier to do well in class. He is also the club sponsor for one of my ECs so I've spent a lot of time outside of class with him. He has seen me struggle but work hard to clutch at the end of the year, so I think he can portray my hard work and determination."

Oh man. Probably the worst professional experience I’ve ever had. Internship was at a financial firm that had 2 other devs. One was the “Head of development” and the other a senior engineer. I didn’t understand absolutely anything regarding the business tech, what any of the tables meant, or what I was supposed to do. The head of development actually quit at one point and came back a week later asking for this job back (I got some stories from that place). Not surprisingly, I wasn’t extended an offer.

**Second Internship**

This was a fantastic experience and learned a lot, I did however go through a lot of stress cause I struggled. I worked late and the team was super helpful but I feel like I wasn’t shipping enough code and this might’ve been one of the reasons I wasn’t extended an offer. I got along with all the core members though and one of them left me a really touching and great review on my LinkedIn profile the next day. It was unexpected but I really appreciated it. I later found out that the decision fell on the Head of Development and some team members were also surprised that I didn’t join. After this internship I took some time for myself since it was a harsh blow to my confidence.

**Job Offer**

BUT, two days ago, I just got an offer for a Jr Dev position at a SaaS company. The interview process was relaxed yet long, there was no algorithm section but instead I talked about a personal project I worked on for for an 1hr30m. The rest of the day I spent meeting the team and other core members of the company (CTO Co-founder, etc). It seems that the company is going through a spurt of growth and really focusing on maintaining their culture, so they’re looking for someone with the right attitude to join the team. I met the senior engineer that I would be working under and she was extremely welcoming, friendly, polite, and overall just got a great feeling from her. The people seemed great, my flight even got cancelled due to weather on a Friday after work hours and the HR head went far and beyond to make sure I was set up with another flight/hotel, offered to pick me up from the airport, and even checked up on me on Saturday morning to make sure everything was good. All good flags imo.

However, this feeling that I’m “not good enough” keeps hovering over my shoulder and I can’t seem to shake it off. My supervisor being so nice and excited to work with me just makes me want to prove myself more and be able to assure her that they made the right choice. I’m just scared that I won’t be good enough and will disappoint. It terrifies me to find out that I’m not smart enough for this and I won’t be able to succeed.

I’m not sure if I’m asking a question here, but I felt the need to write this down and just share it cause idk if someone experienced something similar when they first started out. Maybe they can share their experiences"

To clarify I'm not suicidal at the moment, thought I was in the past. I'm here to vent that out before it overwhelms me again.

Right now I'll start the last week of internship, then I'll have to return to school. Thing is that, I like working my job, especially at the place I do now, where workers know that I'm learning and probably don't know even 10% of the stuff they do, still they give me difficult tasks for me to guess out how to do them, and if I have no clue on how, they guide me enough for me to get it. It's not in a fashion of me doing their job for them while they sit around and watch, unless they really have nothing to do and the task is really simple.

Through the last 3 weeks I forgot that I'm still in school to be honest, speaking to workers like if i was actually employed there (which they don't mind of course), but it started to catch up to me that my ""good time"" is ending, very soon... And I'm scared of going back, spending next 2 years of my life in this shithole, besides, I really like it here, working my ass off, but I'm happy, especially when I'm praised for doing a job correctly all by myself, and not being yelled at if I fuck something up, that is if what I did isn't something severe (hasn't happened yet).

I'm additionally scared of failing the class that I'm in right now, having 2 subjects that I'm failing in, and having to fix that situation in 2 weeks for internship ending. My classmates tell me it's nothing wrong that I'll drop out, but me being the ""gifted child"" in the past really makes me overthink that. If it will happen, I'm certain that I'll lose my sanity completely (I probably have some disorder as of now, but I wasn't yet in the doctors to check up on that). Also my family will not take that kindly, especially that my parents can't really wrap their heads around how I can have such low marks.

And I'm scared that the depressive state will return, I feel good now... I don't want that happening again... I'm feeling fine why does that need to change... why"

I don't know where to begin. I'll start with my details of my current role and my background. I am an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineer from India. I am a 24 year old guy working as an ERP(SAP) consultant for a services based IT MNC. I have around 1.5-2 Years of Experience. I don't ""hate"" my job as such, but neither do I like/love it. Its like meh, I don't feel much about it. I would say that I put in only that much effort which puts me above average/slightly above doing the minimum things. I don't like to explore things myself/do extra work/take lead or be in charge of things. I know it is not sustainable, which is one of the reasons I am looking for change. Also, in my current project, the work very chill for me I would say. My contribution in the last few months has been quite less. Only if something is assigned to me, I look into it. If not, I ignore the other issues. This also makes me feel worried in the sense that if I am assigned some task, what if I am not able to do it/what if I wouldn't be able to understand it at all?

I'll explain a bit about personality and my characteristics from my childhood. I've always excelled at studies in school, high school and college. I would be one of the top 10 in my batch every year. But I'd never do anything beyond studying for school/college in terms of academics, i.e. Only study for exams, not really do any practical work/projects/internships. I was never particularly interested in any field as such.

Since most of my family members and close friends chose Science and then Engineering in college, I followed the same path. In college as well, I would work hard but only during the exams and lab assignments. I never did any projects on my own, or applied for internships to companies. I did do an internship but that was more like a formality.

Also, I would never ask for money unless it was necessary. And there is no concept of working jobs while studying in India. So I would only spend money which was necessary. Now in hindsight, I realize that I didn't have fun in college/didn't hangout/go out a lot in college because I didn't have a lot of money and I didn't wanna spend my family's money. Thus all I wanted was a job from college so that I can spend a lot of money on whatever I want. Now that I am working for almost a year and half and making decent money, I did spend it on whatever I wanted, like clothes/accessories/apparel/restaurants and bars/vacations/etc. But now I am now longer attracted by those things, its like I'm fully satisfied with those things and no longer wish to spend lavishly on them.

Now back to my career and my personality. Like I said, I've always been in the top bracket of school and college, and that's because I would always have the habit of knowing everything for the exams. That would make me comfortable. And even if I made a mistake, I knew only I would be affected by that mistake. Now when I work, I've realized its impossible to know and learn everything. Its not like exams. In exams, you know and learn everything and then apply it. However, in a job, you learn a few things and try to apply them, but major part you learn by doing things and then taking a lesson from it. I have steadily accepted this fact, but it took a lot of effort. Last year things were very bad, I was so afraid of making mistakes and being scolded (since I 've never experienced it), that I had major issues. As it is I have a very anxious personality outside of work as well, but all these things led me to depression. After work, I'd literally waste time and binge scroll on my mobile to avoid my thoughts. And the next morning before work, I'd lie in my bed doing the same before it was the exact time to start work. I'd eat very less, eat at unusual times. My sleep cycle was fucked, I'd hardly sleep for 5-6 hours.

I did visit a therapist and I continue to do so now. I was told to do radical changes to my lifestyle, and if I didn't do that, I would be on pills. I did improve a lot, started exercising, sleeping more, socializing, opening up to people. I have come pretty far from where I was. I'm not that afraid of work/mistakes anymore. However, the doubts and insecurities do pop up and remain with me from time to time. Its like I am always afraid of things going wrong. Because, its difficult for me to accept things going good with me. Even in the happy moments, I am afraid to celebrate and have fun because something bad may happen. On top of that, I have this bad habit of comparing with others. Many of my friends, even though they aren't super successful, they know what they want to do, and are working towards it. I have no idea what to do and how to do. Its like I don't know my own likes and dislikes. Which is why I don't know what skills I possess, and then what career I want to pursue. Seeing everyone else at least know what they want makes me feel like I'm lagging behind. I feel like the whole world is moving forward and I am stuck.

So to sum it up, I've had a very decent academic record, but skills wise I don't have that many. I know I have to upskill, but I don't know which field/domain to enter/study. I also have these characteristics I've mentioned. I'm just confused and not sure what to do/how to proceed in life. If you can suggest any path/any domain or anything else, I am open to listen. Any guidance/help is truly appreciated.

If you are still reading, thank you for listening to me !"

Then permanent position 6900 chf per month after internship, which amounts to 82.8K gross yearly.

I'm still studying so during the academic months I will be working 40% and during the breaks 100%.

I liked the offer but I dont know what to expect after I graduate, I definitely want the salary raised after I graduate. By then I will also have 1 year of experience working with this company. What final offer should I expect after I finish my Master's degree in CS.

How is the current offer in terms of market rate. I am based in zurich so I will have to travel to Aargau canton every day for the job which should take me about 40 mins. It's a small/medium sized company with 25-40 employers. Should I continue with this company after graduation?"

v0jjln,1,2022-05-29,What job should I pick?,Royal_Outrageous,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/v0jjln/what_job_should_i_pick/,"I've been working as an SEO for about 4 years. Since pandemic started, my office moved at home and I've been working from home ever since. The issue with this action is that I won't learn much anymore so my salary just got stuck. I've had about 450-ish euro/month, which is lower than average in my country. The problem with this job is that it's not only SEO. Actually, 90% of the time I do stuff that won't help me learn anything at all, just robotic things.

At the beginning of May, I've applied for an unpaid internship QA tester position. Even though I don't know anything about this domain (well, I've read that it is about but I don't have any specific experience), I'm willing to follow this path because it's a more future-proof job. I've had an interview and I've been told that I have to wait until the end of May for a response.

I've also applied to other jobs as well and I've had an interview for a Customer Service position. The CS job is paid just as much as my SEO job but I'd be able to promote faster. I've been accepted as a Customer Service and I should give my final response, if I want it or not, tomorrow. 

I also had an interview for another SEO job and the employer seemed content with me (tomorrow I get the response if I am accepted or not). The salary is also not that big but I think I'd be able to learn more things so it should be able to earn more pretty quick (though I don't plan to stick on this job, read further to understand).

Last Thursday I resigned from my current job so I can focus on the interviews - it was getting suspicious for my boss anyway that I needed so many free hours - I've had more interviews but the ones that I've talked about are the ones I take into consideration.

**Problem with Customer Service job** is that the schedule is at night and I really hate that as I struggle with anxiety so it would almost surely make my life a living hell. It's not just ""meh, it's a discomfort I should get through"". Basically, working at night shifts is just an immense anxiety trigger for me. 

Otherwise, the job is pretty nice. Another issue with this job is that I won't be able on doing the QA testing intership because the schedule of the job overlaps the hours I should be present at the internship program.

**As about the SEO job** (though I am not 100% sure I got it, I'll find out tomorrow), it has a normal schedule, from 9AM to 5PM or 6PM so it should let me also study for the QA internship.

**Problem with QA internship** is that nothing is certain. I don't how well will I perform and also even if I will pass the program, I'll be able to get a job into this company only if there are any (or enough) positions available.

**Conclusion (or TL;DR)**

What would you guys do if you were me? Pick a Customer Service Job that may give you anxiety and may not be able to keep the job for more than several days 

or

pick an SEO job (a career I have experience into) that would also let you follow a QA testing internship program?"

v0jytb,1,2022-05-29,First internship and I'm feeling pretty pessimistic about my performance. Am I bothering my mentor too much?,csmajor039,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v0jytb/first_internship_and_im_feeling_pretty/,"I've received an intro project to get started, and although I completely understand the high level concepts, I get blocked on the details. I bugged my mentor a lot in my first week, like hopping on call once or twice a day at least, with a few questions as well via messages. He says I'm not bugging him and he's happy to help, but I feel bad about seeming incompetent with everything. Some of my questions are like:

""Can I confirm my understanding of how all this code fits with each other before moving on?""

""Can I confirm my understanding of how this technology is integrated into the system?""

""How can I build/test my code?""

""What does this variable mean"" (used a lot in the system without any documentation as to what it's used for).

And some questions regarding frameworks and patterns I've never touched before.

I try to be thoughtful with my questions, like detailing what I've tried to so far, and my mentor tends to be very hospitable and confirm that my questions are good. Sometimes he has to think about the answer for a bit, other times he has to bring in his team member because he doesn't have a good answer.

But I keep feeling in my head that I shouldn't be bothering him this much. I do as much research as I can before resorting to asking him but sometimes it seems like no matter how much I do, it either won't help or it's better to ask so I can find answers that best fit their current codebase (ex. asking what technologies to proceed with a task, I gave some of what I found and he said that I should use some other stuff, both in-house and external, neither of which I've heard of).

*****

Part of me feels like I haven't received enough guidance with how to do things. I was sort of just given a high level overview of the system, then the code in a language I've never touched before, and I had to make sense of it myself and add functionality to it. There was no onboarding regarding any of this technical stuff, and I'm the only intern in a small team. Another part of my thinks that I shouldn't be this bothersome and I'm not performing well. I attended a meeting where apparently my mentor had a few of his own tickets or tasks that he had to complete that should have been completed, and he said he was busy but should be able to finish it soon, and that really made me feel guilty.

The area of quality I'm working in is rather niche and, from what I understand, in high demand. It's centered around biocompatibility of medical devices for EU MDR submission and ISO 10993 compliance. My company wasn't able to find anyone they were satisfied with for this job, which is another reason it was offered to me. I realize I lack industry experience and have not yet obtained my master's degree, but I also know that contractors generally get paid more per hour since benefits aren't usually included. My responsibilities/work load/expectations will obviously be much high than when I was an intern. I've also talked with my colleagues to get a baseline of what I should expect.       

So my questions are:          
How can I go about negotiating? What key points can I use to make my case?          
Would it be unwise of me to try and negotiate $40/hr with no experience?          
Can the recent skyrocketing COL in my city be used to justify my request?          
Any other considerations I should take into account?          
Thanks"

v0kuik,4,2022-05-29,Is there anything I can do to boost my chances of getting into top colleges such as Harvard?,littlechili21,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v0kuik/is_there_anything_i_can_do_to_boost_my_chances_of/,"Hi, I am a grade 11 student looking to improve the odds of me getting into a top college like Harvard. If I were to apply my current achievements and traits, I think it's safe to say that I have no chance. So, is there anything I can do to salvage my current situation (I have 4-5 months to backflip into success) and improve my odds significantly, or would I be better off giving up on Harvard and focusing my efforts elsewhere?

For reference, here's a list of things that are likely to affect my admission:

* I'm Chinese
* Studying in Ontario, Canada
* IB diploma programme student
* Parents did not go to an American college
* I want to study computer science, AI, or applied math
* Completed the CS 50 course from Harvard
* Average grades (Usually, math and science marks are my highest, French and English are my lowest)
   * Grade 9 - 88%
   * Grade 10 - 96%
   * Grade 11 Sem 1 - 97%
   * Grade 11 Sem 2 - Pending. I can make this go up to 98%
   * Grade 12 - Pending. I can make this go up to 99%
   * I am also taking grade 11 and 12 biology online, I think I can get 100% on both
* SAT - taking this in August, I think I can get roughly 1550 if I study for this
* APs
   * Computer Science A - 5
   * Statistics - 5
   * Calculus BC - Pending. I think I got a 5.
   * Would taking more APs and getting 5 on every one of them help even a bit with college admissions? If AP test scores actually help, I could probably take 4-5 more APs and get 5s on them.
* Competition scores
   * Canadian Chemistry Contest - 10th in Ontario
   * Avogadro 13 Chemistry Contest - Pending. I think I got 1st in Canada for this.
   * AMC - idk my score, but I qualified for AIME, so top 5% of contestants
* Extracurriculars
   * Vice president of French Club (Contrasts A LOT with French being my worst grade)
   * Web developer for a small youth organization
   * 3rd place winner at WinHacks (A Hackathon event)
* Work experience
   * Tutored year 1 university students on Python (This was freelance)

I will be travelling to Hawaii during the summer, so I would probably be unable to get a summer internship. During my time in Hawaii, I might be able to get some experience running a car rental business (2 of my family friends are currently renting cars, and I could try to help out).

Judging from what I have so far, is there anything I can do to boost my chances of getting into Harvard (I literally would not mind working 8+ hours a day on top of doing things in school), or is the best that I can do just to get 1550+ on SAT, do the best I can do in school, and then write a phenomenal essay?"

For context, I'm a college student currently living in a dorm because I'm doing an internship over the summer. I live with a roommate in a suite with 2 other girls. 

I've been feeling really shitty about myself because I order deliveries for like every meal because I haven't gone out to get groceries yet (which I told myself that I would do today but haven't, like it's literally only 9 min away from my dorm), my room has become a mess ever since my roommate left for a little break (bc I don't know how to keep my space clean unless I absolutely have to because I don't want people to judge me), and I feel terrible about just wasting my time away doing nothing when I should be going out and enjoying my time in the city. 

I told myself that I would spend this summer getting my life together, get back into my hobbies, and go out to do more things I've been wanting to do, but idk why every little thing is overwhelming me, and I literally have no motivation to do anything. And I'm so fking privileged too, being able to study and do whatever I want in a city that everyone wants to live in because I have a supportive family, and I feel even more terrible about feeling this way.

In my experience at least, I feel like there is a bit of a disconnect and a lot of classes focus on teaching theoretical stuff, and they almost expect you to learn practical development either at an internship or on your own. One example I have is the requirement to learn a lot of calculus/probability at my school. I totally understand that all that math is super useful for AI/data science/other stuff, but it seems weird to focus so much on that when there are lots of jobs where you'd never need calculus.

I also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SiFgB1lGxw) talking more about this. Would love to hear what y'all think, and if you think about it differently."

5. Teacher’s Choice Award from AP Chemistry Teacher (11) (School)


**Letters of Recommendation**

I can’t give ratings for these because I don’t know what they said and I don’t know what colleges even look for lol. 

Counselor: She oversees a lot of kids but she knows me pretty well despite that. We have a pretty great relationship and she always makes sure I have little to no scheduling conflicts lol. So probably pretty good. 

Chemistry Teacher/Science Team Coach: Has literally told me that I have been one of his best students ever. His classes were my favorite ever and I talked the most/showed the most personality in his classes. 

AP English Lang Teacher: Wanted a Rec from her to show that I actually am a good writer. I got my lowest grade I’ve gotten in her class but I loved her class. I consistently got some of the highest essay grades in her class and she was a tough grader too. Kinda contradictory but that’s junior year (and me being terrible at multiple choice) for ya. 

Lab PI: Probably pretty good. It was only an 8-week program but we got to talk about my career and future goals so she probably wrote about that along with my contribution to the lab. 

 

**Interviews**

Yale Interview: Was the first time I ever had fun at an interview. Lots of laughing and very conversational as if we were good friends. We connected a lot on our families and I asked a bunch of questions both naturally in conversation and at the end. I had no “test” question unlike many Yale interviews. Also at the end of the interview instead of saying “You’ll do great wherever you go” like most interviewers say, she gave me her interview stats from last year (33% RD acceptance rate for all of her interviews last year). This was odd to me, but that amazing stat (especially for RD and not even REA) gave me hope. I felt like there were no red flags in my responses/in general after the interview. 

MIT Interview: Pretty standard and we had a pretty good conversation. He talked a lot about sports and I wasn’t able to play sports in high school lol but I talked about how I played sports for a long time before high school. The only weird thing was he asked a personal question that was eerily related to my rushed (and rejected) MIT WISE (fly-in) application. Maybe it’s a coincidence but really put quality time into your fly-in apps because I think the AOs remember some applicants during the actual college app cycle. 

Harvard Interview: I didn’t know how to feel about this one. He prefaced by saying how he wasn’t going to ask any trick questions. Most of the questions were character and personality based. Some of them really made me think. It wasn’t bad but…I was having a rough week and he rescheduled the interview last minute to a time that conflicted to an important event. I missed the event for the interview and I was bummed. Also around this time I was getting really sick and tired of doing interviews, but I hope these emotions didn’t show in the interview. 


**Essays**

My Common App/Main Essay was about how my relationship with community evolved as a result of my father’s deportation/death. It was sort of a flashback essay and I set my essay up by using something from one of my EC’s as a metaphor for that relationship with community. It definitely was NOT a sob story. I think it’s okay if you mention something like death/divorce/other “taboo” topics in an essay but it should be pretty brief and you should focus on yourself for the majority of the essay! Also I think it was easier to explain how my family situation affected me through an essay, but some are more comfortable using the Additional Info section, and that’s great too! In the end, I felt like this essay was really “me”. 

UT Austin: I sent in the roughest of my drafts because this was the first school I submitted. My essays definitely got better over time. My Dean’s Honors essay was fun and showed a lot of personality, along with non-academic interests. 

Yale: Why Major and Why Yale were okay. The word limit kind of restricted me, so I was very glad to get an interview so I could expand further and tell stories. Short Takes were so fireeee 🔥😫 I took a unique approach with the Topic that Interests You essay, and I picked the Satisfaction essay and thought it was very good. 

JHU: I did the JHU Virtual HOME+Impact Fly-In so I just had to tweak this essay and make a few additions from my Fly-In application draft. I thought it was pretty good. 

MIT: I used a lot of storytelling. May appear to be slightly robotic but I liked them. 

Stanford: This was the most fun school to write. I was super myself (maybe too much 💀) so it only took less than a weekend to complete (probably a bad thing lol). 

Harvard: Pretty standard; did all 3 essays and took a risk with the EC one. 

COVID Essay: Single mom works at a hospital so she was a frontline worker but also worked longer hours and multiple jobs to provide for family. I described my experience with that and related it to my desired career. 


**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* Yale REA
* UT Austin Dean’s Scholars Honors Program (Priority) 
* MIT RD
* Johns Hopkins University RD
* Harvard RD

*Waitlists:*

* none

*Rejections:*

* Stanford RD


**Additional Information:**

UT Austin Auto-Admit really gave me the chance to branch out with my reaches. I turned in all 6 of these apps before I got my Yale decision, but I would have applied to more schools if I hadn’t gotten in to Yale (I had outline’s done for multiple schools).

I sent a research supplement to all my schools whether they had a research supplement or not lol. I also sent my MOSTEC course evaluations (letters about performance) which were very good. 

I also added and took away some stuff for MIT because they use their own app. 

Last Note: The only people that have ever read my essays are me and the AOs 🤠 I don't think I would recommend this (not showing at least 1 person your essays) but everyone is different and this process is really about knowing yourself. But at least my essays were 100% authentically me :) (kinda concerning…but cute!!)

I’ve committed to……
&gt;!YALE because you can’t spell Yalies without slay. JK but I narrowed my choices down to Yale, MIT, and Harvard in that order. I really loved MIT but it was the second most expensive next to UT. Harvard didn’t give all that I thought it would give and I felt like I would mainly be going for the prestige and getting a meh overall experience. Also their aid was slightly worse than Yale's. I felt like my reasons for going to Harvard were the same for MIT but worse lol. I had genuine reasons for wanting to go to Yale, and I'm SUPER excited for the fall!! YAY!&lt;

The Title: Going into this process, definitely don’t have a big head. But do give yourself some credit where it’s due. I underestimated myself so much in this process (I was seriously doubting that I could even get into my major at UT lol 💀 let alone honors), and there were a lot of surprised WTFs in my reaction videos LMAO. But things worked out in the end. Stanford was very bittersweet since it was my last decision and it was a rejection. But I’m very proud of my results since I was definitely expecting a few rejections lmao.

**Finance:** Parent makes \~65k a year and also have a sibling in high school. My mother (separated)gives 10,000 for my brother, my dad, and I so some financial aid will be needed

**Location and weather:** Preferably New England with all the seasons! I'm also interested in a smaller student population, in the range of 500 to 15,000 undergrads.

**School:** Dark Academia vibes and small/secluded, like a college town. Also, in love with LAC's.

**Family:** My dad has a bachelor's and is a truck driver. My mom has a master's degree and is working toward a phd rn. She is also a professor.

**Recommendations:** I think I'm pretty okay on recommendations. One of my letters is my

I graduated in December 2020 with a degree in marketing. But, I do not have any experience. Due to the pandemic it was hard to land an internship. So, I took an extra class instead. And at the time I did not realize the importance of it and should I have taken it seriously. So, I am mostly to blame. I have applied to countless jobs from marketing assistant, administrative assistant, and customer service assistant. But, I usually made it a few rounds and I never move forward, they just view my application, or I receive no response at all. I even re-did my resume after college and have worked with employment agencies but nothing is happening.  Thankfully I am employed, I work at Walmart as a personal shopper in the online grocery department. But, it was only supposed to be a temporary job after college. I have been there almost a year and half now and I feel like I am at a dead end. I now am working with a career coach, so I will see how that goes. But, instead of feeling sorry for myself and accepting my “fate”. I refuse to give up! I love marketing and I KNOW I have a bright future ahead of me. I just have to work a LITTLE harder to get there. And that’s fine with me. I am just not sure where to go! Even though I have been out of college for awhile, I was thinking of getting an internship. I understand it is a long shot, but the worst they could say is no, right? So what are your thoughts? Do you think I could land one or what would your game plan be?"

I have a lot of experience with iOS development so I'd prefer to do something with that but I honestly don't care exactly what I want to do, I am just very keen on work life balance. I am wondering if there are any companies people can recommend where you end up working around 30 hours a week with no times of the year where you are truly bending over backwards.

So I did quite well in bachelors in Psychology but I felt that my university didn't really contribute well to my understanding, or maybe it's because of COVID that I spent most of time learning all by myself, anyways I finished with 8.5/10 CGPA, two paper now under publication and one published, and many more projects in Psychometrics with a good internship. I applied to bunch of schools in Uk, mostly in HR without really having any background in it, probably because I think I would be able to do well in it. My all hopes were to get into London school of Economics and I had great profile, as I had discussed it with their alumni but, I got rejected, probably due to mistakes in motivation letter. This was a major blow as I didn't had any good backup options, so now I am confused in my life.   
I have admits from   
University of Exeter HR (5k pounds scholarship)   
University of Leeds data analytics and HR &amp; University of Edinburgh's decision will come soon,   
Now, I don't know how I will going to do in Masters because I don't have real industry experience before transitioning into these courses, usually I have heard that as an international student in Uk, you will have hard time finding a job and I am also unaware of the opportunities in the field. I am unsure on whether to choose these courses or to wait one year and apply next year to other courses at even better universities, with a clear mindset on what I want to do in my life, or just going to these courses, try networking as much as possible and then paving a way from there.   
I also want to know if it can impact on my future grad school ambitions which will be in the field of Educational data science and interventions. I just want to add that I am from a good SES family so I can afford to go abroad for my education.   
My major questions in short -   
1. Whether to take a break and apply to other universities with clear mindset.   
2. Whether choosing current universities that I have admits from will provide a better pathway to future.   
3. Will the decision to go into these universities impact my future grad school options (mainly in Psychometrics &amp; Ed data science)."

I just received my offer in BBA (ACC) yesterday and I'm being a bit insecure and indecisive, I would like have some advices on some issues:

1. **Is ACC really that hard as I read in other posts? cuz I have been wanting do ACC since my college day.**
2. **Is math heavily involved in the modules of BBA ACC (other than stats)?** 

Lastly, this can be touchy, so feel free not to answer.

1. **if u happen to be both accepted by NTU and NUS in ACC in the past, what makes you regard NUS over NTU?**

Personally, I think NUS is more flexible compared to NTU, it is like the high % graduate of NTU will go into audit field because of their inflexible 3 years curriculum, and NUS have freer curriculum and one more year to do whatever (e.g. intern) to find your suitable place in the future.

I’ve been self teaching for a few months now, and I’d say I’m intermediate in Python. My plan is to soon move on to The Odin Project then Full Stack Open, and then work on some good portfolio project while studying DSA and some CS through online resources. 

I’ve discovered I truly enjoy programming and would love to turn this into a career. My concern is that I have no Bachelors degree. I have a high school diploma and a couple years of work experience in sales at startups.

 I know it’s possible to get a job without a degree and I know it will be hard, but will a Bootcamp help my chances of at least getting an interview? 

I know boot camps don’t have the best reputation and I fully expect to still do a lot of self-studying, but it seems that having a Bootcamp on my resume may give me a slight advantage over just having a high school education and nothing else. 

For reference, I’m looking to start with at least having a paid internship or apprenticeship as I know I have so much to learn. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this or your experiences in getting a job without a college degree. 


TL;DR switching careers without a college degree. Will a bootcamp boost my chances in getting a job interview?"

v0ztcp,2,2022-05-30,Which are the best advanced courses for using my yearly learning budget,throwaway_simracing,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/v0ztcp/which_are_the_best_advanced_courses_for_using_my/,"Hi guys,

My current company has a €2k ""learning budget"" that I can spend every year for improving my skills and I'd like some suggestions about courses for intermediate/advanced users worth doing.

The main areas I'd like to improve are the following:

* MLOps, as I didn't have much chance to improve in this area as in my previous company we didn't make any deploy of our use cases
* Edge computing and more in general how to improve model inference performance while preserving its accuracy
* Gain a better understanding of areas I didn't have the opportunity to work on  yet (e.g. Reinforcement Learning)

At the moment of writing I was thinking about proposing Deep Learning.ai specialization on [ML in Production](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops), the AWS ML certification and eventually Coursera Plus, however I will still have a lot of budget therefore any suggestion is more than welcomed!

In case it is useful, my background is the following: M.Sc in DS, B.Sc. in CS, 1.5 years as a DS + 1 year as a Data Engineer and 6 months as a research intern.

Thanks in advance!"

v11in0,2,2022-05-30,should i transfer to NYU?,Arrowhead311,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v11in0/should_i_transfer_to_nyu/,"hey guys. so i currently go to tulane university, i’m in the honors program and have 85% scholarship. i thought i really wanted to go into music, and i got eboard positions on the tulane music festival board, the music club, the entertainment business networking club. i also met a lottt of music business people in new orleans who have done a lot of work. 

the thing is that i honestly didn’t like the culture at tulane. everyone is always going to the same place, everyone parties(which i did for a while until i realized i absolutely hated it), it’s all rich kids who went to camp together, and it feels like high school all over again with cliques and people thinking they’re popular and sorority bs(i tried the sorority route and joined it’s just not my thing). 

i do like my friends but i don’t feel like i’ve really clicked with many people, and even those i did, all they want to do is the same routine every single day. stay in the dorms/at home unless they want to party. i heard about the tulane bubble before- which is that people just stay on campus and don’t explore even though there’s an entire city, but i didn’t realize how real it felt until i was there.

so anyways i end up feeling really stuck on campus, and i’ve realized that i’m not really sure what i want to go into other than the fact that i know i want to work in pop culture(probably fashion/events/festivals). new orleans feels like a small town, there aren’t really any large companies or great internships i could get other than music. but if i wanted to go into fashion or anything this just wouldn’t be the place, and that feels extremely limiting.

i recently got into NYU as a transfer for fall 2022, and i’m not sure what to do. i really would love to be in NYC, as i grew up there and honestly miss it a lot, and the opportunities there are endless. i miss being able to walk out the door and explore, and choose what i’m doing without 100 cookie cutter people all doing the same thing every single night at tulane. 

the thing is, the tuition is 4.5X as much as what i’m paying for tulane. my family has money set aside for college so we can afford it, but i also want to go to law school. i want to be in nyc and at nyu so badly, for the change in pace and culture, but i don’t know if it’s stupid to pay so much money for that. 

the way i see it is that in nyc i have so many opportunities to meet a lot of different people, i have the city at my fingertips, i can go explore anytime i want and i won’t fall into any stupid routine like at tulane where i just go to class and then go sit in my room all day. i don’t even get dressed bc i just wear my pajamas bc there’s no point in getting dressed. the internships i could get could be with my dream job brands and companies, and i could explore so much more and actually physically go to my internships which i couldn’t really do at tulane. i plan to live in nyc when im older so being able to be there for three years and network would be so perfect for me. the larger school would be better so i don’t feel like i’m walking on the set of mean girls, and where life isn’t just based on partying. i miss going to central park and walking around(audubon park doesn’t compare) and going thrifting and meeting random people and just the spirit of the city. 

on the other hand, i could give tulane another chance, as it was just my first year. i might meet my best friends and get good opportunities at the music festivals there bc there’s less competition(at nyu id be competing with so many other students for internships). it would also probably be harder to get positons at clubs at NYU bc there’s sm more students, and id be a transfer. would it be stupid to leave the positons and involvement i have at tulane? since it’s pretty small, most people know me bc i’m very involved in all of the events on campus which has made it easy to get positons in a bunch of different clubs. im not sure what to do and i’m pretty torn. 

what do u think?"

I have been in a loving happy relationship with my partner for almost 5 years. I say almost because yesterday on our 5-year anniversary he couldn't look at me and it became clear that I've driven a major divide between us.

Since we met in high school I always chose to run away and picked the path of most resistance. Going to college not only out of state but down half the coast. He was willing to make the drive for me. He didn't even have a car but every night he would call me for hours helped support me through the whole ordeal and he would find any way he could to come to visit me. The messages he would send me made me feel like the most important person in the world and made me feel like nothing could ever come between us. I dropped out and moved home to pursue my associates at the local community college, I had a car but I was so focused on myself that I never drove the 45 minutes to see him. He was always there for me and I loved him, but even though there was little to no effort needed I put even less in. I graduated and got into the same university as him and while things were good I still did not see him as much as I could have, I didn't tell him how important he was to me I just assumed he knew. I also struggled with addiction to over-prescribed painkillers and while he stood by me the whole time I chose to lash out at him consistently going through withdrawals. Covid hit and we both had to come home from school. We live 15 minutes away from each other and I still barely called him relied on snap chat and texts and didn't see him for a long time. When I finally began to see him again things were great when we were together but he always came to my home and he always made the plans. It's not that I didn't want to hang out with him, but I had classes and two jobs and he always worked to fit in my schedule when I allowed him. Now we graduated in May of 2021 and I ran away again taking a 7-month internship in Florida. He didn't fight me and didn't tell me not to go, but the entire time I played happily while in reality, I was miserable and I missed him and my family severely to the point where I learned having my dream job meant nothing to me compared to having them in my lives. I slowly became more addicted to my phone over the years and installed apps I previously hated and knew destroyed my mental health and pulled me further out of reality. I came home in January to no job and remained unemployed while he was working his way up in his company and field and meeting new people at work while also connecting with old mutual friends and I began to become aware that he has become self-sufficient without me. He hasn't messaged me the way he did when we first started dating in years. The handwritten love letters stopped. In realizing this my world stopped

I didn't tell him that until yesterday as we sat on a bench mutually crying and breaking up. I know I cant send him a million messages and call him a million times. Since then I have called twice and sent about 5 texts, but I pushed him away for so long and built so many walls that I am sitting here now 24 hours later realizing how I have changed. I rejoined my gym hours after the break-up and have already gone twice. I've deleted so many apps (Reddit being the next) because they are the ones I need to break up with. I've put my phone on the grayscale and gone online to make the public profiles I am keeping private. Nothing feels the same anymore and everything feels so obvious that I dug the grave I now lie in. I know you should never dramatically make a post about leaving a platform, but if you even begin to feel like you can't help but spend hours a day online anywhere on any platform be aware of what that's pulling you away from. Be more aware than I was, because if I truly have lost my partner I don't know what my future holds anymore, because while I don't think its the end of me there's nothing I want more in the world to hug him again and have he wish me goodnight one more time. Last night I couldn't sleep without it and it ruined me. Last night I tried to talk to my mom and she sobbed about losing a son and the massive fuck up has just come full force and nailed me in the head.

My change started yesterday and continues forward. It was a great 3 years and I began deleting a lot of my content and now I think I am just going to log out and delete the password save. Good luck.

TL;DR: I didn't appreciate what I had until it was gone and now I am stuck feeling alone and abandoned as I spent my 5-year anniversary breaking up and now I don't know if we are done forever. Part of the problem was my ignorance and the other part was my growing addiction to social media and I just want to warn others the way I wish I could go back and warn myself."

First of all, I would like to thank this wonderful community during my GMAT and b-school application journey.

I have been fortunate to have received some amazing offers. I am in some deep confusion and therefore, would like to gain some perspective from you all.

I have been enrolled at UNC Kenan-Flager Business School with a full ride. However last week I cleared the waitlist at Tepper CMU. Tepper has offered me quite a generous scholarship (60%) and I have already appealed to them for a bump -- offices are closed at present, so I am waiting to hear from them back.

Even if Tepper were to offer me a full ride (hypothetically), I am in a great dilemma to go forward with the offer because I have been fortunate enough to have received acceptance to Amazon's pre-MBA technical product management immersion program with priority consideration for the summer internship. This program requires me, an international, to be in the United States before 30th July, which is not possible through Tepper since their MBA classes start in late august (immigration restrictions). However, through UNC, I am able to be part of that Amazon program.

I want to recruit for PM/PMT roles. And, Tepper and UNC honestly seem quite close when it comes to tech recruiting -- but to be honest, Tepper is much better. I want some perspectives on whether it makes sense to decline the Amazon opportunity to go forward with Tepper, or just go with UNC + Amazon. I am quite in a predicament and would love to have some thoughts. Is Tepper better ENOUGH to decline the Amazon program..?

I would also mention that I have my visa appointment next week, which already makes joining Tepper so hard.. having to figure everything from scratch -- stuff I had been doing at UNC for over a month..... It took me two months to get the Visa appointment..... But I will figure those problems out, hassles, but I will do that..... I just want to make an informed choice and not be irrational about it. Many of my friends in the community tell me to heavily consider the Tepper (even with the 60%) no matter the Amazon program since that is not really an internship per se. However, it does statistically improve the chances to get a summer internship. So, for what it's worth, what would you guys suggest?

Thanks &amp; Regards,

* I've been solving Leetcode and Hackerank puzzles too.

All of them were pretty average, clicked with most of them but they were all fairly generic, don’t think I stood out too much in any of them and people told me interviews aren’t really a make or break factor anyways, so just assume like average I guess. Like didn’t bring me up but also didn’t drag me down

**Essays**

Not going to go into specifics since some of the stuff I wrote about in some of the essays is hard for me to share to strangers, but in general I put a lot of time into them and started them in the summer so overall I would rate them like an 8/10 in general

**Reflection:**

Honestly, I feel like I got screwed in this app process. I know that my demographic makes it really hard to get into a lot of the good schools, but I feel a little let down committing to UCSD seeing a lot of my friends getting into and going to better schools. I really can’t explain why I got rejected from so many of these schools, I don’t think I had any major red flags in my app. I feel like the only way to explain it is that college apps have gotten so much harder now, and being an ORM makes it 10x harder. I’ve been trying to process this for a couple of months now, and I still can’t get over the fact that I basically wasted my entire high school career. Of course, UCSD is a great school, but deep down inside, I think I’ll always feel a little let down by the process and disappointed in my results."

As the title says, I wanted to ask about applying to US companies from foreign countries (South Korea, in my case). For some context, I'm in a US college on f-1 visa, and will be graduating from my college on May 2023. However, I'm not sure whether I'll be able to get a full-time job here for two main reasons: 

1. I started practicing for coding interviews very late (Beginning of Junior year) and have been super inconsistent (which I'm trying to fix)
2. I don't have personal projects under my belt. The only project that I have on my resume is a class project using Flask, and it's not very good (It's a shitty Reddit clone)

The one thing that I have is internship experience - I was consistently able to get internships during the summer - but I don't think that's enough.

Given my current situation, I wanted to prepare for the worst case scenario where I am unable to find any full-time jobs and have to go back to Korea. I'd like to hear from anyone who has had this experience, and what they did. I would greatly appreciate your input.

v19mk1,1,2022-05-30,Question about typical data engineering workflow (Raw data to Tableau Visualization),TheAppletron,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/v19mk1/question_about_typical_data_engineering_workflow/,"I recently started a software dev internship at a company that does data analytics. Currently they have a handful of data sources that are pulled from monthly and stored in a Postgres database. I think they use Trifacta for some of the joining of these different tables, and then loaded into Tableau.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I see is that the entire calculations of their analytics are performed in Tableau, rather than using Tableau simply as a data visualization tool at the end. I've been tasked with making the workflow less tool dependent and my goal is to take those calculations out of Tableau (their entire analytics algorithm is implemented with a chaotic nesting of calculated values in Tableau)

&amp;#x200B;

What would be the best way to do this? Would it be to run SQL commands directly on the database? Or would I write a script in Python (or other programming language) that can run these calculations through a connection to the DB, then store the final results in a table that can be uploaded to Tableau?

&amp;#x200B;

Data engineering is all new to me and am looking forward to any insights or ideas you may have."

We have clients with autism, dementia, physical disabilities and more.

So today I asked a man if he would like to go outside for a walk. Due to a accident 10 years ago he can't walk outside, only inside with help. So I took the wheelchair and make sure he's comfy and has everything with him, that means also his dog. His dog is a guide dog, a mix between a Labrador and a poodle, a real sweetheart.

Buttt he really can't handle other dogs sspecially dogs that look like him. So when we're walking I'm holding his  leash down on the handles of the wheelchair. Thenn dog #1 but I had some treats. So I try to distract him from that doggo and say to him he's a good boy, which worked.

Then we continued our walk and after a while we go back. At the last part of the road it's just all sand, rocks and just a hell to push with a wheelchair. And there he was doggo #2. But it was a small doggo, so nothing to worry about? Right... Welll

At that moment I tried to push the wheelchair and make sure it didn't go in any holes or idk what ever it could possibly stick behind. I was holding some tape and somebody called me. Then the woman and the doggo ran behind me. The dog got loose and I could just hold him with my pinky... That big doggo with only my pinky... Oh god! Everything fell out of my hand, my hand started shaking for hours and now it's blue!

What a nice way to start the week and even the worse part is how that woman laughed at me while I tried to hold the dog and make sure that the wheelchair didn't bump against anything :/ but my pinky is alright so far haha

TL;DR: TIFU by pushing a man from my internship in the wheelchair and holding his guide doggo at the same time. He's a sweet golden boy but when he sees other dogs around him. Too many dogs at the wrong place at the same time I must say."

Took an ""internship"" through my university to work with a PhD student. His first task for me was to implement OAuth2 into an already developed stack.

The frontend is using the msal-angular package. I have a login page with a Microsoft button that redirects the user and prompts for their Microsoft credentials. Microsoft sends a response with an ID token and access token. I am stuck here.

My task is to:

1. send the access token to DRF (no idea how to even begin doing this) securely
2. Validate the token (wtf does that even mean)
3. Get the user associated with the token info or if none exists create one
4. Send session token to frontend

The PhD candidate I'm working with doesn't know anything beyond high-level OAuth flows. He has changed the design of our OAuth implementation 3 times since I started working on it nearly a month ago. I am at my wits end with this and I am honestly considering dropping the internship.

Don't get me wrong, I have been enjoying the projects I got throughout these months, I have had 8 projects in this company, they all were very different from each other so, I learned a lot. But now I have no projects anymore. When I ask for projects, they just tell me to study a topic or read some articles about Machine Learning. I have been doing Leetcode at work and trying to improve my algorithms and DS skills.

Because the founder of the company knows my father, I have way too much freedom. I can come to work whenever I desire and leave whenever I want. However, I am the only intern who doesn't get paid, all the other interns get paid.

I had an internship lined up for summer, but due to company layoffs my position was eliminated, so I am staying on campus and keeping my school year jobs. I work as a Resident Assistant (RA) and for campus dining. The RA job provides my housing plus a stipend ($1200 for the summer) and the dining job pays $14/hour plus provides a meal when I work (usually 5 meals/week). I can only work 20 hours per week on campus and I am considering getting a third job for summer. I am on the fence, though, because I don’t know if it’s worth the time and I don’t want to be a workaholic all summer.

The third job would be at a pizza place. The pay is $11/hour plus tips (idk how much that will be). There is a discount on food, but I don’t think that I will buy stuff there but maybe once or twice. I would expect to make an additional $1,000 in wages from the job over June and July.

As an RA, I have to be on duty some nights and can’t leave the living area. I also attend meetings and have a weekly mail room shift. With my RA commitments, I think that I will only have 3 nights in June when I am not working if I take the pizza place job. In July, I should be able to have 1 or 2 nights per week when I’m not working.

I don’t *need* the money, but it would help me to save for either a trip over winter break or a car for when I graduate. If I’m not working, I don’t know if I will be doing anything else productive. Most of my friends are away for summer. I would like to start going to the gym more if I am not working (or even if I am). I don’t want to just work away my summer and young years, but if I’m not doing anything I might as well be working and making money.

Last summer I worked 50-60 hours per week and on my day off I ended up doing nothing. I think I could plan my time better this summer, but I do worry about burnout. I have looked for other internships, but it is hard to plan internship hours around my other job requirements and some of the places I've found aren't accessible by bus or walking.

Do you think I should take the job at the pizza place?"

From what I've seen, a lot of students that did get internships this summer fall into the camp of either being extremely smart and started coding their own compilers in the womb, or wealthy kids who leveraged their connections (though there are many normal students that got internships). 

I'm neither wealthy nor a genius, just someone who likes math and is majoring in cs. Any advice on what I can do right now, so that I can get an internship next summer and/or don't end up failure?

My opinion is that capitalism and the rich are not the main problem of exploitation as one might think by reading this forum. 

If you look at all the economic systems of the past and present (capitalism, socialism, communism, anarchism, etc) you will find examples of relationships between the leaders and the plebes that are pure exploitation. So what's the problem? I know it's hard to look in the mirror and call it for what it is and just blame it on ""the rich"", but I would say that the problem is much wider. We, as humans are not wery kind to each other. Just look at all the wars, genocide, slavery, hunger, discrimination and other issues around the world. Don't tell me that if we as a society are ok with rolling into (insert country) and just achieve our goals on top of piles of civilian bodies, that doesn't somehow translate into domestic exploitation. 


In fact, I would argue that a lot of people being exploited and also posting here would change on a dime if the roles would reverse. Take a small idiot and give him power and his idiocy would increase exponentially with power increase, may it be in a multinational corporation, your mom and pop's store or in a politburo. The asshole manager above you was most likely an intern once and with more power his asshole ego just got pumped up more and more. 

Like the late and great George Carlin said... politicians are not another race, they don't enter Earth through a portal from another planet. We are politicians and politicians are us, they are the direct reflection of our society and all the poop they represent. I would argue that the same logic can be directly applied to ""the rich"". 

Change the system? You will only get a new set of ""rich"" that will exploit the not so rich. Remove the money? Well I'm sorry to tell you, but exploitation can be done even without the money and power can be had without money. 

So what's the solution then? There's no quick fix in my opinion. Humans have a looong way to ""figure it out"" and go beyond the dog eat dog mentaliy, if we even want that? That is if we even get the time to evolve that long...if we don't blow ourselves up or make the planet permanently uninhabitable?

So what can you do until we just become better humans as things won't change overnight? Fight for your rights, don't say yes to everything, negotiate, improve the cards in your hands. Turn the ods in your favour so that you have more leverage and try to find eployers that respect you. 

I wish you a happy day and discuss..."

Would I be able to get pure CS jobs with a Statistics and CS or a Math and CS degree?

Through my Stat/Math and CS degree, can I just overload on technical CS classes while just doing the bare minimum for my X component? Would I have some priority when it comes to registering for CS classes over non-CS students (CS minors, ""interested"" students)?

I'm a little confused about how I go about with applying for jobs online. For people majoring in CS + X or know someone who is, are we allowed to apply for internships where the qualifications say something like ""Must be enrolled in a CS program?"" I don't want to be in a situation where the employers say something like ""you're not what we're looking for"" when they see the Statistics in the title of my degree.

Also please add any other useful information about the Statistics and CS along with Math and CS degree programs.

**How does this schedule look for Fall 2022?**

* Calc III
* STAT 400
* CS 128
* CS 173

v1mlf8,483,2022-05-31,Interview Questions to help you prepare for your next interview,cambo3003,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/v1mlf8/interview_questions_to_help_you_prepare_for_your/,"Here is a compiled list containing all of the interview questions I have been asked for engineering roles, which you can use to prepare for your interviews. These questions can be grouped in five categories, of which an interviewer will usually go over at least one question from each: General, Behavioural, Teamwork, Safety, and Technical.

Feel free to comment other questions you have been asked to add to the list.

## General Questions

These are typical questions that could be asked in an interview for any role – not just engineering roles. With these questions, the interviewer aims to get an idea of your background and experience, and allows you to share your expectations of the role and aspirations for future growth.

* Tell me about yourself.
* What do you know about \[company\]?
* Why do you want to work for \[company\]?
* What do you hope to get out of this program?
* Explain why your background and experience would be a good fit for this job.
* What can you bring to the company?
* Why are you leaving your current role?
* How do you show the values of \[company\]?
* Why did you choose engineering as a career path?
* What are your salary expectations?
* When can you start?
* Where do you see yourself in 5 years from now?

## Behavioural Questions

The purpose of behavioural questions is to convey to the interviewer how you will react in specific situations. The majority of these questions will ask you to draw on a previous experience and describe your actions/reactions. Ideally, these questions should be answered using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

* Tell us about a time you experienced a significant setback and how you dealt with it.
* Tell us about a time you had to adapt to a challenge, how did it challenge you?
* Do you ever get stressed? If so, how do you deal with that?
* Tell us about an achievement you are proud of.
* Tell me about the most challenging engineering project you’ve worked on.
* Tell us about a time you struggled to meet an objective and how you successfully managed to do so.
* Describe a situation when you have made a difficult decision under pressure.
* Describe a situation where you have used engineering knowledge to solve a real world problem.
* How do you prioritise your daily tasks?

## Teamwork Questions

Technically these fall under the bracket of behavioural questions, although they are asked in almost every interview for roles requiring collaboration with co-workers. The hiring company needs to know that you are going to work well in teams, so it’s a good idea to go into the interview with a few examples handy.

* Have you ever been in a conflict with a co-worker?
* Tell me about a time you had to motivate a team member.
* Describe a time you demonstrated leadership skills at work.
* Tell me about a time you had to take a course of action you didn’t agree with.
* When have you worked in a diverse environment and how did you overcome it?

## Safety Questions

A strong safety focus is a non-negotiable for new employees. Here is your opportunity to demonstrate that you value the safety of yourself and your co-workers. In addition to this, the hiring company needs to know that you will have the confidence to speak up on safety issues if they arise.

* Where have you come across a hazard in the workplace and what did you do to overcome and fix the issue?
* If \[insert safety hazard here\] occurred, how would deal with it?
* Have you ever felt unsafe at work?
* Can you walk under yellow tape on a construction/mine site?
* Can you walk under red tape on a construction/mine site?
* How do you handle employees acting in an unsafe manner?

## Technical Questions

From experience, these are the least common type of questions asked in interviews. This is highly dependent on the type of role you are applying for – is it a technical design role, or is it more of a project engineering/management focused role? The array of questions that could be asked here is large, so it is unlikely you can prepare for the exact question to be asked. Although, you can generally get a good idea of the type of technical knowledge you would be expected to possess from the job description and the company itself (is it involved with subsea pipelines, aeronautics, civil works, etc.?)

* If I give you two spherical balls, each of the same size, same mass, and identical looking:

1. Give me some of the properties that the balls would have.
2. How would you use these properties to determine which ball is which?
3. Taking a segment of the balls, how would you determine the density?

* Attached is a diagram of an FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) unit which is attached to a buoy held in place by a subsea mooring.

1. Given an FPSO, how could the mooring lines fail?
2. What could you do to fix these failings and are there any other solutions if a cyclone comes through?
3. If construction had already begun, how could you fix the problem?

* Given a subsea pipeline, the temperature has been operating above a maximum recommended temperature for a significant amount of time. 

1. What could happen to the pipe during this time?
2. What would you ask the operators to do?
3. How would you test to see if the pipe is still okay to use?

* What do you know about \[insert product/process relevant to the role here\]?
* Have you had any experience with \[insert software here\]?
* Tell me how statistics applies to engineering.


Edit: Thanks for all the kind words people, glad I could help. I have a blog page where I have guides to successful interviews and applying to internships / graduate positions if you are interested. I won't post the link here but feel free to message / go on my profile if you think you could benefit."
v1ooa4,1,2022-05-31,Should I take a new job offer or stay?,wizzy83,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/v1ooa4/should_i_take_a_new_job_offer_or_stay/,"Hi, I have been offered a job that seems a lot better than my current one on paper, but I'm worried this will impact my future because of me and my girlfriend moving to another country in 1-1.5 years.  


new job pros:  
\- going by job description, it's something I want to do a lot more (than what i'm doing currently), and want to develop myself in for the future

\- 38% salary increase, better title  


cons:

\- my currrent job is comfortable and easy,

\- I've been at previous company for 3 years (incl. 1 year intern and 2 year full time), and in current company for just 1 year. I am planning to move to another country in 1-1.5 year, which means I wouldnt be able to have even 2 years experience in this new company.  


Pretty much I'm only worried about the 2nd con, I will have 2 jobs in resume for only 1 year each, and I'm fighting with myself whether I should take the new job that I want, or push through in the current one (that is a bit worse for my experience also) for another 1.5 years to have less job hopping. 

Then again there are some external factors that could delay the move to another country more, I just don't know.

Would this make me less likely to be hired? For context, I am talking about corporate jobs."
v1p1bd,1,2022-05-31,College student unsure about additional summer job,igpay-atinlay-,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/v1p1bd/college_student_unsure_about_additional_summer_job/,"I am a rising senior in college. I had an internship lined up for summer, but due to company layoffs my position was eliminated. I am staying in my college town and keeping my school year jobs. I work as a Resident Assistant (RA) and for campus dining. The RA job provides my housing plus a stipend ($1200 for the summer) and the dining job pays $14/hour plus provides a meal when I work (usually 5 meals/week). I can only work 20 hours per week on campus and I am considering getting a third job for summer. I am on the fence, though, because I don’t know if it’s worth the time and I don’t want to be a workaholic all summer.

The third job would be at a pizza place. The pay is $11/hour plus tips (idk how much that will be). There is a discount on food, but I don’t think that I will buy stuff there but maybe once or twice. I would expect to make an additional $1,000 in wages from the job over June and July.

As an RA, I have to be on duty some nights and can’t leave the living area. I also attend meetings and have a weekly mail room shift. With my RA commitments, I think that I will only have 3 nights in June when I am not working if I take the pizza place job. In July, I should be able to have 1 or 2 nights per week when I’m not working.

I don’t *need* the money, but it would help me to save for either a trip over winter break or a car for when I graduate. If I’m not working, I don’t know if I will be doing anything else productive. Most of my friends are away for summer. I would like to start going to the gym more if I am not working (or even if I am). I don’t want to just work away my summer and young years, but if I’m not doing anything I might as well be working and making money.

Last summer I worked 50-60 hours per week and on my day off I ended up doing nothing. I think I could plan my time better this summer, but I do worry about burnout. I have looked for other internships, but it is hard to plan around my other jobs and I don’t have a car to get to work.

Do you think I should take the job at the pizza place?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

* Purdue University (West Lafayette) 

*Yet to Receive:*

**Additional Information:**

I messed up Common Application a lot. I didn't mention about National Level Sanskrit Exam (City topper), Cofounder of a Space Ccommunity (although it was founded after application), Blog writer, School level Debate Competitions, Poetry Competition winner, Infosys hosted Test (School Representative), Student Council, etc. (I mentioned these for UK application as I completed it in April)

Me and my parents mainly focused on Singapore because of affordability and safety and that's why I applied to very few US universities. But NTU requires Term-1 marks but I scored around 85% (requires &gt;90% ). So no hopes. Purdue was my dream university in the USA, the main campus one. But I got rejected; I appealed but they said seats were full for Aero. and Astro. (probably a common reply to every appeal). Ivy was expected.  Application to Embry Riddle and UK Universities was just for the sake of doing it; unaffordable fees. 

I accepted Purdue Fort Wayne (Mechanical Engineering) because I shall have a degree in the name of Purdue University which is worth it according to my cousin (she's in Purdue WL, doing PhD. in Aero astro). Moreover, its affordable with scholarship. I found most its courses nearly similar to Aerospace so went for it. Also, spoke to few alumni students.

All applicants for 2023, please make sure you don't mess up with extracurriculars just like I did. I got my rejctions because of my carelessness :(.

I hope you all get into your dream colleges. All the best!!"
v1qwzz,3,2022-05-31,Should I keep pushing for better comp? UK Talent Manager,wickermouse,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/v1qwzz/should_i_keep_pushing_for_better_comp_uk_talent/,"Hi all, I work as a talent manager for a localization company. I'm 25F, I posted here already a few months back.

I  was hired in February of last year as a paid intern, right out of my  MA. They paid me 18k (I live in London). At the end of my internship, 6  months later, I got hired full time at 26k. 6 months after that, a year  after I was first hired as an intern, I was promoted within my same  department and role, and I now get 30k. I pushed for more, but I was  told that even though I was very highly rated at my evaluation, the  company can't do better than a 15% raise.

Now,  I work in a really stressful environment, and I'm torn between being  content with what have objectively been 2 raises in a year, and an  almost 100% increase on my salary, and the feeling that I'm still  getting underpaid for what I'm doing.

Unfortunately  it is really tough to get an idea of an average salary for this role,  as it's very niche; it's not talent managing as in HR, and it has to do  more with filtering a pool of freelance resources rather than CVs and  hiring.

I was hoping you could give me some perspective, and advice on whether to keep bringing up my dissatisfaction with comp.

Thanks!"

The 1 month when I was going into the office was absolute HELL. I was so depressed and so anxious every time I walked into my job. As soon as I would sit down I would have horrible anxiety and almost panic attacks and just could not find anything to cope. I hated being in that cubicle and it made me so anxious when i got home knowing i had to go in again. I would cry everyday and i really had no reason for this anxiety other than being in the office and in my cubicle just triggering it horribly. 


So this summer, they want everyone working a hybrid schedule. That means 3 days at home and 2 days in the office. My first day in the office is tomorrow and the anxiety has already started. I’m not sure if I’m just scared because I know how I felt last summer or if this is actually going to be a repeat of last summer but worse since there will be no transition into full time remote. 

Im trying to think on the bright side of it all and be thankful that it’s only
2 days a week and not more and thank god not 5 days a week.

Feel free to add comment any patterns you think I may have missed, but the patterns I am trying to rank are the 16 from 'Grokking the Coding Interview' by DesignGuru:

* Sliding Window
* Two Pointers
* Fast &amp; Slow Pointers
* Merge Intervals
* Cyclic Sort
* In-place Reversal of a Linked List
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Two Heaps
* Subsets
* Modified Binary Search
* Bitwise XOR
* Top 'K' Elements
* O/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
* Topological Sort (Graph)

I was wondering how you would rank the importance of knowing each of these coding patterns for a New-Grad/Early-Career/SDE-1 Coding Interview on a scale of:

1. High Importance:

2. Medium Importance:

3. Low Importance:

4. Very Low Importance (Rarely Asked):

Although I'm currently in the process of studying, I will try to make an updated post soon after with a list that agrees with the majority of comments and members’ opinions/thoughts. My hope is that this list can serve as a guide to help those starting or already in the LeetCode grind.

The thing is, I have two scholarships, so I'm just a little bit grade-conscious. However, even if I lose them it wouldn't matter sobra. 

I'm still living with my parents, and they've always assured me that I don't have to stress too much about grades since they'll pay for my schooling, with or without scholarship. Pero syempre sayang naman po.

Ang worry ko lang po kase is baka sobra naman po yung workload na ipatong nila to the point na wala na akong time to even relax.

Is it advisable po kaya na maghanap-hanap na ako ng internship or part-time job o focus na lang sa study and wait for my graduating year na lang? 

And if you recommend that I pursue an internship or a part-time job, do you have some tips on finding them?

Thank you po!"
v1v7sf,205,2022-05-31,"To incoming students: the average new grad SE pay is not $284,728",microwavemasterrace,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/v1v7sf/to_incoming_students_the_average_new_grad_se_pay/,"I see that a lot of incoming students like to quote [the 2021 SE profile](https://sexxis.github.io/classprofile/) for the $284,728 figure. A recurring belief I've seen in posts made by high schoolers is that they have an 85% chance of going to the US for full time, and make $285k+.

Let's go over some facts about this survey:

1. The $284,728 figure is an arithmetic mean, the median is $260,000

2. The exchange rate used is 1.3 CAD to 1 USD

3. The figure is *first year* compensation, which is usually much higher than recurring pay due to the sign on bonus ($50k ~ $100k USD)

4. The number of students in the graduating class is 92 + a few students who transferred to CS

5. The number of respondents for the compensation data is 47


Let's try to make sense of this.

1. Survivor bias is significant, 100% of the graduating students surveyed are, well, graduating. As per [this article](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/undergraduate-students/future-undergraduate-students/comparing-bse-bcs), the SE cohort size is about 125 people. From what I recall when I was in university, the actual cohort size is a little larger in 1A, but I wasn't in SE so we'll take it at face value. This means that, assuming no incoming students from upper years, at least 33 (26.4%) students in the matriculating class did not graduate from SE. Considering that many engineers do take a year off due to failed courses or other reasons (myself included), the actual number of students who did not complete their degrees as intended is higher, but some do transfer out to CS and graduate early, so it's hard to know what the true attrition rate is.

2. This is a self-reported survey. Those who respond tend to feel good about their accomplishments, so it is much more likely the 47 respondents are the top 47 earners in their program, than the scenario where they are the middle 47. The median ($260k CAD) presented here is likely actually around the 70th percentile rather than the 50th. Another way this can be looked at is that only 23 students of the graduating class are actually making more than the reported median, this would make them the top 18% of the original cohort size of 125.

3. Well paying US companies tend to do hiring earlier than other companies, so those with offers and numbers in hand are likely to be going to one. 40/47 respondents are going to the US, and it is often wrongly quoted as 85% of the graduating SE class is going to the US for full time. In reality, 85% of those with jobs lined up are going to the US, and the 45 who didn't respond may well be without job offers. 


Let's also see how reporting just the first year compensation (in CAD) changes things. Total compensation in the industry is usually calculated as the total target over the equity vesting time period.

Here is Facebook's max offer for an E3 bachelor's new grad this year (master's gets $5k more in base) in NYC or SF Bay Area: $124k base, 10% bonus, $220k RSU (4 year vest), $75k sign on. I have no doubts a number of those in SE managed to get this package.

Using the SE profile's way of calculating this: $124k * 1.1 + $220k/4 + $75k = $266.4k USD * 1.3 CAD/USD = $346.32k CAD

Using the industry standard way of calculating this: ($124k * 1.1 + $220k + $75k) / 4 = $210.15k USD * 1.3 CAD/USD = $273.195k CAD

Quite the difference there. A good resource for US SWE pay is [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/).

Edit:

That 1 sample point at $600k+ is likely from a hedge fund such as Citadel that pays new grads $475k USD. I've seen grade 12's say that's their dream job, and my advice would be to intern there first before making such bold statements because the work environment there is not for everyone."
v1w0hk,31,2022-05-31,Achieving resume success,Specialist-Noise1290,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/v1w0hk/achieving_resume_success/,"First off, right off the bat, I must say I am not selling anything and I certainly don't want any contact info. I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of *free* resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online.

This is the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.

Just in time for graduation and/or summer break :)

Whether looking for an internship, your first career job, or *actually* good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt.

Because let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.

Anyways, below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches ($1500 total spent there, yikes!), and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out the formula), complete with notes on how you can do it, too.

(They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after following this ressume formula and other methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).

It details how I got recruiters' attention, networked online with people who had the role I dreamed of, and, most importantly, includes a *jaw-dropping* resume/cover letter format, as well as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that contain practical tips and tricks for how to get that coveted role:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM_)

It's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those students who may be actively or passively looking for a job and need help standing out from the pack.

As mentioned earlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is *perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles *much* quicker and added a ""WOW"" factor to it.

**Some additional notes on resumes:**

1. Usually keep it to one page.
2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)
3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers *love* that. Which is better? ""responsible for managing team and hosting meetings"" or ""managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"" See what I'm sayin?
4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---&gt; number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the ""vague description"" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anyways.
7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.  
This is *KEY!*  
Ex: ""Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America."" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a ""+ after the rounded number (ex: ""157 employees ---&gt; ""150+ employees"") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital ""K"" for thousand, ""M"" for million (ex: $23,800 ----&gt; $23K+; $5 million ---&gt; $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please, *pleeeeeease* don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

""Hey (name)- I'm a (junior, senior, grad student, etc) at (uni name) and I just wanted to say that your job at (company name) seems like the dream role I'm working towards! How do you like it?"" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call or over coffee (more details on that in the link).

Use the free site [hunter.io](http://hunter.io/) to find anyone's work email to send cold emails to (email templates in the link).

\------------------------

Look, I have a history of mental health issues and the the job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.

I don't want that for *anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

I want the process to be as easy as possible for *everyone* and for *free*.

I'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost guarantee their resume and tips ain't as good this.

Anyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!

Let me know in the comments if this helped.

Go get 'em, Champ!"

v1w6rr,0,2022-05-31,Is it Illegal for an Employer to Replace me without Notifying me?,RandomlyAnonymoose,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/v1w6rr/is_it_illegal_for_an_employer_to_replace_me/,"I don't want to give away too many details and out myself just in case, but I started a new job back in January as in a position of Lead Electrical Engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this company is small, I'm the only electrical engineer in general, and the company told me they were going to hire more which I would be in charge of, which is great. No problem there.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been maybe 2 months since they claimed that, and I got curious to look at what the job listing looked like. While I did see they had a post for Electrical Engineer Interns (gotta get that cheap labor :/ ) they also had a job listing for Lead Electrical Engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not been told that my performance is sub-par, I've done everything asked of me, have never missed a deadline, and the last time I spoke to the CEO maybe 2 weeks ago, everything seemed totally fine. I'm worried that they are trying to interview people to replace me, but is that legal to replace me without notifying me first? I'm guessing because it's America it is, but if they do replace me, would it not be wrongful termination?

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any steps I can take to help protect myself?"
v1wnwy,2,2022-05-31,Getting an additional summer job?,igpay-atinlay-,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/v1wnwy/getting_an_additional_summer_job/,"I am a rising senior in college. I had an internship lined up for summer, but due to company layoffs my position was eliminated. I am staying in my college town and keeping my school year jobs. I work as a Resident Assistant (RA) and for campus dining. The RA job provides my housing plus a stipend ($1200 for the summer) and the dining job pays $14/hour plus provides a meal when I work (usually 5 meals/week). I can only work 20 hours per week on campus and I am considering getting a third job for summer. I am on the fence, though, because I don’t know if it’s worth the time and I don’t want to be a workaholic all summer.

The third job would be at a pizza place. The pay is $11/hour plus tips (idk how much that will be). There is a discount on food, but I don’t think that I will buy stuff there but maybe once or twice. I would expect to make an additional $1,000 in wages from the job over June and July.

As an RA, I have to be on duty some nights and can’t leave the living area. I also attend meetings and have a weekly mail room shift. With my RA commitments, I think that I will only have 3 nights in June when I am not working if I take the pizza place job. In July, I should be able to have 1 or 2 nights per week when I’m not working.

I don’t *need* the money, but it would help me to save for either a trip over winter break or a car for when I graduate. If I’m not working, I don’t know if I will be doing anything else productive. Most of my friends are away for summer. I would like to start going to the gym more if I am not working (or even if I am). I don’t want to just work away my summer and young years, but if I’m not doing anything I might as well be working and making money.

Last summer I worked 50-60 hours per week and on my day off I ended up doing nothing. I think I could plan my time better this summer, but I do worry about burnout. I have looked for other internships, but it is hard to plan around my other jobs and I don’t have a car to get to work.

Do you think I should take the job at the pizza place?"

I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of *free* resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online.

This is the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.

Just in time for graduation and/or summer break :)

Whether looking for an internship, your first career job, or *actually* good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt.

Because let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.

Anyways, below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches ($1500 total spent there, yikes!), and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out the formula), complete with notes on how you can do it, too.

(They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after following this ressume formula and other methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).

It details how I got recruiters' attention, networked online with people who had the role I dreamed of, and, most importantly, includes a *jaw-dropping* resume/cover letter format, as well as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that contain practical tips and tricks for how to get that coveted role:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM_)

It's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those students who may be actively or passively looking for a job and need help standing out from the pack.

As mentioned earlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is *perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles *much* quicker and added a ""WOW"" factor to it.

**Some additional notes on resumes:**

1. Usually keep it to one page.
2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)
3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers *love* that. Which is better? ""responsible for managing team and hosting meetings"" or ""managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"" See what I'm sayin?
4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---&gt; number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the ""vague description"" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anyways.
7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.  
This is *KEY!*  
Ex: ""Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America."" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a ""+ after the rounded number (ex: ""157 employees ---&gt; ""150+ employees"") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital ""K"" for thousand, ""M"" for million (ex: $23,800 ----&gt; $23K+; $5 million ---&gt; $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please, *pleeeeeease* don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

""Hey (name)- I'm a (junior, senior, grad student, etc) at (uni name) and I just wanted to say that your job at (company name) seems like the dream role I'm working towards! How do you like it?"" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call or over coffee (more details on that in the link).

Use the free site [hunter.io](http://hunter.io/) to find anyone's work email to send cold emails to (email templates in the link).

\------------------------

Look, I have a history of mental health issues and the the job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.

I don't want that for *anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

I want the process to be as easy as possible for *everyone* and for *free*.

I'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost guarantee their resume and tips ain't as good this.

Anyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!

Let me know in the comments if this helped.

4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---&gt; number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the ""vague description"" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anyways.
7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.  
This is *KEY!*  
Ex: ""Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America."" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a ""+ after the rounded number (ex: ""157 employees ---&gt; ""150+ employees"") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital ""K"" for thousand, ""M"" for million (ex: $23,800 ----&gt; $23K+; $5 million ---&gt; $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please, *pleeeeeease* don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

""Hey (name)- I'm a (junior, senior, grad student, etc) at (uni name) and I just wanted to say that your job at (company name) seems like the dream role I'm working towards! How do you like it?"" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call or over coffee (more details on that in the link).

Use the free site [hunter.io](http://hunter.io/) to find anyone's work email to send cold emails to (email templates in the link).

\------------------------

Look, I have a history of mental health issues and the the job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.

I don't want that for *anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

I want the process to be as easy as possible for *everyone* and for *free*.

I'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost guarantee their resume and tips ain't as good this.

Anyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!

Let me know in the comments if this helped.

Go get 'em, Champ!"

Besides scams, the only jobs that seem to respond are sales positions, ""contract"" ""freelance"" work, volunteer positions, unpaid internships, and the like. In other words, NOTHING FULLTIME WITH BENEFITS THAT YOU CAN SUPPORT A HOUEHOLD ON.

I think I'm only applying to regular fulltime positions, but somehow always seem to get interviews only for this type.

It doesn't help that I see the same companies posting the same jobs for literal years that never have the intention of hiring anyone (they just want to advertise their companies and clog up job boards, while lying that they're ""urgently hiring"").

So what I'm asking is.... If it's this hard to find legit/serious opportunities online and you can't really apply in person anymore, what do you do to ensure you're applying to things that aren't a waste of time? Because the majority are basically scams.

(Also, it seems like when you apply on company sites there's little to no chance you'll actually get a response. Does anyone actually have luck doing this either?)"
v1xqg7,2,2022-05-31,Another Career Advice Posting,hondakillrsx,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/v1xqg7/another_career_advice_posting/," 

Good afternoon guys,

I’m currently a 37 y/o Sr Systems Administrator with a BA in Computer Information Systems looking to transition into a GIS specialist/analyst/technician role.  I’ve been researching the best path forward for me by reading as many career advice postings on this sub as well as watching quite a few YouTube videos about the field and potential entry level positions I could land with my background and my current track. 

My general plan for learning and ultimately landing my first job are to take as many core Esri core exams as possible in the next 6 months to a year starting with the GIS Fundamentals Foundation 2201 and then moving to the ArcGIS Desktop Associate 19-001, all while creating a professional portfolio that is comprised of my favorite unique projects including some passion projects.

Once I have obtained these certs and built an “impressive” portfolio, I would then begin to look for any and every entry level GIS position just to get my foot in the door and start learning the field, while continuing some more advanced certifications.

My question/s is, given my degree, which has somewhat to do with some core GIS functions (database admin, database design, data analysis, scripting) and the certifications I am looking to obtain, will that be enough to land a job in the field, or would you recommend anything different or in addition?  I have a family, so I won’t be able to do any unpaid internships, but I am willing to make quite a bit less then my current job just to break into the field. 

My outlier idea was to just have my cover letter, education and portfolio on a new resume and leave off my 20 years of Systems Administration, just so hiring managers don’t automatically rule me out for hovering around 40 years old and to just get the interview based on my education.  Thoughts?

Any other advice for a newbie is much appreciated."
v1xujd,7,2022-05-31,Undergrad psyc major seeking advice on grad school admissions,bbwraith,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/v1xujd/undergrad_psyc_major_seeking_advice_on_grad/,"

Hello! I am a junior psyc major who recently transferred to a 4 year university from community college. Recently, I’ve been looking into graduate programs and have been feeling really anxious about that next step. I know how competitive graduate clinical psychology programs are and I’m worried that I ruined my chances of getting into one. I want this so bad and have been having horrible anxiety about this. Any advice or insight is much appreciated! 

To be blunt, I have a horrible track record with school. I have very severe adhd and only recently started treatment for it. Being on medication and doing cbt exercises has made all the difference in the world and has helped me function normally and do well in school for the first time. 

I struggled a lot as a teenager and dropped out of high school when I was 15 (later went back for my diploma) and had something like a 1.5 gpa when I graduated. Later, I went to community college and for most of my time there, my grades were still very poor. I was working a full time job and had another part time job on the side and was never able to dedicate the time I needed to school. On top of that, I only recently discovered what I want to do in life and never previously felt motivated to push myself in school. 

I left my community college with about 50 credits and a 2.6 gpa. Thankfully, my current university doesn’t transfer over gpa’s from previous institutions, so I now have a 3.83 gpa which I think I can raise even more before I graduate. 

Since transferring, I am doing really well in my classes and am genuinely enjoying being in school, despite the stress. I have started cultivating relationships with many of my professors and have specifically been working on research in one of my professor’s labs, that does neuropsychological research using rodent models. Through this, I have discovered my interest in behavioral neuroscience and have been dedicating as much energy as I can to my lab. 

I know how competitive this field is, and I have been trying to think of anything I can do to make up for my horrendous grades earlier in my education. In terms of future career plans, my main interest is researching psychological disorders from a biological perspective, although I am also still interested in working with people as a clinical psychologist (ideally providing testing, psyc evaluations and very part time therapy). I know counseling psychology programs are less competitive, but because I have such a strong interest in behavioral neuroscience I don’t think they would be a good fit for me. While I would love to get into a clinical psyc doctoral program straight out of undergrad, I don’t think that would ever happen so my current plan is to apply to Masters programs, then get my doctorate.

I have presented research and authored a poster at our student research forum, but have not been published. Right now, I am helping out one of our grad students with his thesis research, but my professor says I will soon have opportunities to be published.

Other things I am doing to improve my chances of getting into grad school include: 
- I am applying to a clinical psychology focused honors track that my school offers for psyc majors- this includes a year long internship during my senior year where I would be doing therapy with adolescents in a supervised setting
- I am planning on getting a TA position during the spring semester for a biological psychology class 
- I am going to join my school’s chapter of a national psychology honors society 

I have 3 professors that I know would write me good letters of recommendation and I believe I will have a lot more research opportunities too but I’m worried that having such consistently poor grades for so long will make it impossible for me to get accepted anywhere. Sorry this ended up being so long, I really appreciate any advice. 

TLDR; I am an undergrad psyc major who started off college with very poor grades and is now doing much better academically. I am wondering how much my initial grades will be held against me when applying to grad schools and what I can do to try to make up for that."
v1y0l0,451,2022-05-31,TIFU: I shit my boss's pants,TrueandHonestSurf,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v1y0l0/tifu_i_shit_my_bosss_pants/,"Looong time ago I was working at a relatively dirty job that involved both office work and work that made your clothes dirty, so everyone had work pants/uniforms that the company washed for us that we would change into if we needed to do the dirty work. 

I was an intern at this company, and the company didn't provide the uniform cleaning services to interns, and I didn't want to get \*my\* clothes dirty all the time so I usually borrowed someone else's uniform when I had to do dirty work. I'd just throw them in the general wash bin at the end of my day. My boss did almost exclusively office work and happened to have the same waist size as me, so we agreed that I would just use his uniforms.

One day I get to work very hungover and found out that most of my day would be office work but would start with some dirty work. I, as usual, used my boss' pants while doing dirty work, then when I came back to the office just kept them on cause they didn't end up getting dirty, and I wasn't sure if I would have to go out again. 

As the office work was boring, repetitive and time-consuming, it was common for me to down a few coffees whilst doing this work. As you've read the title of this post, you know where this is going. 

My delicate hungover stomach decided it wasn't groving well with the three or four cups of coffee and I was feeling pretty uncomfortable and especially gassy. I lifted a cheek to release some of this suspected gas, and to my surprise, absolutely filled my drawers with diarrhea. 

I immediately stood up as to not saturate the cloth chair I was sitting in, but it was too late. Disregarding the chair, I hurried over to the office bathroom, which is a single room for 3-4 people to share, and began doing damage control. 

The underwear were a complete write-off. The fruit of the looms had provided almost no resistance from the shit wave and at most held back some of the chunks as the liquid shit filtered through with ease. There was no saving them.

The pants were completely soaked in diarrhea water and visibly blackened around the ass. It was obvious that someone shit themselves in these pants, and I could see brown stain marks already starting to show. Problem is, that each person had 10 sets of uniforms, 5 for the week, and 5 being cleaned on rotation. I couldn't just trash these pants as it wouldn't make sense that the office guy's pants disappeared other than me ""losing"" them, and the uniforms weren't cheap. 

I cleaned my body off as best I could and wrapped the underwear in a football-sized wrapping of toilet paper and stuffed it deep into the garbage of the bathroom. Big guys worked in that office, and it would be no surprise that the garbage smelled bad. 

I, unfortunately, had to commando back to my locker in the shit-soaked pants to grab my good clothes, where I then returned to the shitter and swapped pants after some additional shameful ass cleaning. 

By the will of Allah, no one needed to use the washroom in the 15 or so minutes it took me to get into clean pants and hide the evidence of my sins. It was also about mid-afternoon when this happened so people were either busy at work or had already gone home, meaning there wasn't much traffic in the locker area. 

I threw my bosses shit covered pants into the waste locker, which thankfully always smelled like shit based on the work we did. My internship ended at the company the next week, so I never was able to see if the pants were ruined after they got washed. 

 TL;DR: Trusted a coffee-fueled hangover fart in my boss's pants and went as well as you would expect. 

Sorry for the vagueness with ""dirty work"", it is nothing sexual I just don't want to be discovered. Think construction/painting levels of dirty."

APs: Human Geography (4), Seminar (3), Computer Science Principles (4), and Statistics (waiting)

Hooks: STEM Background - Took Aerospace Engineering courses for 4 years (I didn’t mention this on my application, but I hated it and that’s why I decided to do creative writing and film instead), went to highly competitive magnet school in my area

Extracurriculars: 
- Internship at nonprofit

- Interned at a website that published one of my essays
- Varsity fencing

Essays: I wrote a TON of essays, so I won’t name every topic I wrote about, but I wrote about making quarantine productive for me for my personal essay, and for a lot of the mini essays, I wrote about things like my writing passion, my cosplay hobby, and my cultural identity

I admit I did shotgun and that my stats were nowhere near qualified for a lot of the schools I applied to (especially compared to the jacked college stats I see here holy shit 💀). Most of my GPA issues came from my mental health issues during freshman and sophomore year (however, I did explain that on the application when I applied, and my grades did significantly improve junior and senior year). However, even though UCLA was my dream school, I was CERTAIN I had no chances due to my below average GPA (UCLA’s 25th percentile unweighted GPA is a 3.91), test blind admissions process, and me being oos. I am so happy that I got lucky and I’m going there in the fall."

I remember in high school, I was a bright student with a passion for learning and living, with motivation to do whatever was necessary to do well. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I don’t recognize who I am right now and I hate the person I’ve become. Everyday I wake up, I have to convince myself to get out of bed for at least ten minutes because I just don’t see the point. Every day is the same, with no happy endings.

I feel so alone, all the time, but I feel like I don’t have the right to complain because on the surface, I know it seems like I’m doing well. I’ve done multiple internships and I’m very involved in organizations. Hell, I’m in one of the most exclusive orgs on campus and I know that not many people have had that privilege because of COVID. Even then, though, I never feel like I belong. I talk to these people and I can’t help but feel like I’m in the wrong place. There’s a voice in my that keeps telling me that I’m being unreasonable because I have XYZ reasons to be happy but… I’m just not. I’m very burnt out, I’m depressed, and no amount of therapy has helped (I went to the Counseling Center and it was the worst experience of my life). 

I don’t know who to talk to about this because I know everybody is struggling right now. I’m very thankful to have even the slightest reason to be happy, and I don’t know if I’m justified in feeling sad/lonely because of them, but I feel like I’m drowning and suffocating and there’s nothing I can do to save myself. My grades have been slipping, my social life is dying off, and I just can’t pick myself up.

I currently do not have any job and I am out of high school.
I seriously need advice regarding my future. Here is a detailed view of my situation:
1. I got selected in a good US university based on merit with some scholarship. Though they have good amount of money, they are not willing to give it to me and rejecting the idea that I should go to US at all.(I am Indian)
2. My parents are forcing me to get into any nearby university which may or may not be even capable of harnessing my potential. Well, I am 19, so I am also not getting forced.
3. Due to this, we are having fights regularly from the last 2 months(1 fight per week for sure). Its not really a fight but more like bullying because I don't respond back or do anything other than crying in the dark. I was suicidal at first but that thought already left my mind. My Blood Pressure  is really climbing right now and I am crying as I write this.
4. Today was a bit too much. My father said, I and my sibling really destroyed his life by being born. And the fight was about a bank's mistake. I handle all bank accounts in my home. In one bank account, it was showing 0Rs on Mobile Banking and so my father screamed at me. I generated a statement and showed him that the balance is something else but he kept screaming and blaming me for ruining his life and wasting all his money(It was the bank's fault). My finances are private in my bank account and I never spent a single penny of my parents since the last 2 years.
5. In total, we had about 15 fights in last 2 months and I am seriously considering moving out and never come back. I also know there are some serious consequences to my actions that will definitely impact my future starting with my education but at this point, nothing seems hopeful.
6. Its India and I am legally a person and so maybe Nothing can help except leaving my home. I did get offered an internship of 50k Rs/month which I turned down because I had a different plan of attending the US university and so that offer is also not on the table.

What are my options here? Should I leave my home?"

i guess i’m mostly worried bc this is a full time entry level job and not an internship where they expect you to know nothing. anything you guys are doing before you start besides relaxing?"

v20ixi,10,2022-05-31,I accepted an internship 5+ years out of school. Anyone in a similar boat?,minifat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v20ixi/i_accepted_an_internship_5_years_out_of_school/,"Some background info: I am a 20 something living in a low - mid cost of living southern American city (Bible Belt). I have a 2 year CS degree from a community college. After college, I went straight for some retail job because I needed money and I didn't go for any software jobs back then because I feel like my skillset and experience were too low. With no ambition, no motivation, I stayed in this retail job for 5 years. It paid the bills (managed to get a mortgage at $14 an hour which seems absurd), but there was no advancing, and I'd always be low income and house poor.

A month ago, a presumably great opportunity sort of landed in my lap. An old friend reached out to me and I asked if he still worked at so and so and I asked about a software job. Turns out they were hiring. I was embarrassed about having no experience and not even having any personal projects aside from one, but I was told not to worry about it. The interview went well. The interviewer was impressed by how I solved some test problems and liked my personal project.

They offered me a 3 month internship at $20.50 an hour to test the waters and, if they like me, a permanent position. That is almost exactly what I make in retail. Once the internship is over, I'm sure it will go up. Does that payment seem reasonable? I accepted the offer 2 weeks ago and I start on Monday. Although I think the pay is on the low side, I know that my knowledge will increase just by working here for 3 months and hopefully a few more years.

I'm excited to finally get into the field I originally wanted to all those years ago. Thoughts/similar experiences?"

**Intended Major(s):** CS or CE, possible minor in graphic design

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1560 (800 ebrw, 760 m) tfw u want to major in stem but your math sat is lower than reading ..

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.82 uw/4.62 w, school doesn't rank

(my gpa is unfortunately kinda eh :( i have a 4.0 everywhere except for a disastrous online soph year but it was due to genuine extenuating circumstances so i hope that explains some of it rip)

**Coursework:** IBDP + 5 ap classes + 7 self studied ap exams (as of this year). courseload for next year: ib chem hl, ib math hl, ib econ sl, ib lang hl, mvc/diffeq, apcsa, tok.

**Extracurriculars:** kind of an L since my big ecs point towards art/music lol

1. piano for 11+ years; annual recitals/competitions/exams, performed at concert halls
2. art teacher for non-profit org, kind of combines teaching art with social issues (big commitment since classes r pretty big + international reach)
3. school clubs: secretary for iGem, artist for school newspaper, member of math team, chem club, and physics club
4. director for cs nonprofit that aims to help underrepresented minorities in cs
5. ""intern"" for other cs org (basically i just dabble in web dev and graphic design that's it)
6. helping to direct an international hackathon this summer (has had media coverage in the past)
7. girls who code :)
8. independent coding..?? learned some languages on my own and coded some unsubstantial stuff. gonna try n work on app development this summer tho
9. organized a covid outreach program in early 2021 that reached about 1.5k families in my area
10. family responsibilities (taking care of grandparent w/ serious alzheimer's). this ate up the majority of my time soph year--my parents were working and i had to be my grandparent's sole caretaker for the entire day. they unfortunately became really volatile and aggressive bc of the disease and i couldn't focus on school at all (had to keep constantly an eye on them). my mental health basically evaporated bc of it
11. volunteering (170+ hours)

**Awards:** no stem content we love to see it

1. international piano award thing
2. state art awards
3. state piano awards
4. national award for documentary
5. ap scholar w distinction (lmao)

hoping for nmsf but i had an index of 221 and that may or may not be the exact cutoff of my state this year... praying it doesn't go higher

**Essays/LORs/Other:** one rec letter will be really good (asked my ap phys c teacher, i love him sm), the other will probs be kinda generic. counselor rec will probably be pretty good (my counselor knows me well) and i think my writing is high quality (the only thing in my app im confident about T\_T)

\-

overall i think my ecs and stats are extremely underwhelming for cs :""D i feel like the upcoming app season will be one giant hail mary for me. i kind of have doubts as to whether or not i should even be pursuing cs, especially since other cs applicants seem to have discovered their passions so early + are so accomplished in stem. i have no research, big summer programs/internships, or even olympiad/math awards so it's kind of like ???

i genuinely am interested in the intersection of art/cs, so i hope it comes across in my essays. idk what else i can do tbh ,, research has never been my thing, and i suck ass at stem competitions (have learned this from my time on math team). at my school there are also an insane amount of clubs, so i wouldn't really be able to found a club that's actually unique. man idk at this point--i spent high school doing what i liked/was passionate about but maybe that wasn't the smartest move after all

back to the point! i'd really appreciate advice + suggestions for a reasonable college list (mostly looking for safeties+targets). i'm also wondering whether or not i should ED upenn, since i feel like it would be a waste of legacy if i didn't, but also it's not the best for cs (my state school is literally ranked the same orz). thanks!

I’m in the process of interviewing with AWS as well and when I told them my salary expectations were 95-100K € they said it was slightly on the high end but that we’d be able to negotiate. I have yet to do the final round of interviews but I’m unsure how to go about negotiating with the first company given the pretty large pay gap.

v23a4o,6,2022-05-31,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (5/30/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/v23a4o/weekly_job_qa_thread_5302022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 123rd installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick
