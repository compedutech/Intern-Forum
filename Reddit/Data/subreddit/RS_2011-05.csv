Perhaps this isn't the subreddit for it but could anyone maybe give some advice from their own experiences?

That said, this August, I'll have completed my B.S. in Computer Science.  I'm doing well enough, and have a good enough reputation with my teachers that I could go back for grad school, and I'll be taking the GRE and applying for grad school just in case.  
I also have been putting in a lot of applications, have one summer internship offer (albeit not actually having anything to do with CS), and have a few interviews coming up for local software engineering positions.  
That said, the more I look at the US, and the more I think about my future, I don't want to be here forever.  And the more I think about that, the more I think I want to get away soon.  
I spent a year doing exchange study in Japan during Highschool, I speak Japanese well enough to get around, maybe not enough for a strictly Japanese corporate environment, but if I had to, I could get back up to snuff fast I think.  
I'm also hearing a lot of good things about Sweden through here and other parts of the internet.  
Does anyone have advice for someone in my situation looking to get into software engineering, or maybe graduate study in Sweden or Japan, or are there other places that are looking good for people looking for low level jobs for CS majors?  
Thanks in advance for any ideas, info, or for just being one of the best subreddits.

h1uk8,1,2011-05-01,What's your best academic dishonesty story?,CheatOnTuringTest,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h1uk8/whats_your_best_academic_dishonesty_story/,"In high school, I worked for the help desk for three years.  The office was right next to the IT department for the district.  There were two employees in IT, which was separate from the help desk.  One was a 50 or so year old man who had below-average computer skills and handled things like purchasing computers.  The other had initially set up much of the infrastructure, and played WoW all day until the network went down, then called Dell to come fix it.  As part of my internship, I got to do a final project, so I chose to do a security audit.

All the computers in the district had two local accounts.  One was for regular users (the acronym of our district) which used the same acronym as the password.  There was also an admin account.  Every computer of a given model was imaged the same way and Norton Ghost was used for computers not used by teachers to restore it to the same state regularly.

Instead of integrating Windows authentication properly, they just installed a Novell client of some kind which prompted users to log in to their Novell account right after the Windows credentials were entered.  Every student and teacher had their own Novell account, and we were supposed to keep all of our school-related stuff on our (protected) space on a network drive that was mounted by a script.  We were also told not to save stuff to the local drive.  The teachers disregarded this because nobody had access to their computers.

One day I remembered that all of the local drives are shared by default on Windows (SMB) shares.  You can access them from the local network as long as you have the credentials that would be necessary to get to them otherwise.  These shares are named ""C$"" for C:\, ""D$"" for D:\, etc.  They're also hidden in the network browser (""Network Neighborhood / Network Places"").  By visiting \\[computername]\C$, any user could easily browse the entire hard drive from the network.  If they had simply configured the computers not to require credentials for Windows' log-on, then it would not have exported these drives!

So, I logged onto all of my teachers' computers with the normal credentials, which were named by their building and room numbers like ""hs-314"" and realized almost none of them used their network drives to store files.  I downloaded a bunch of tests.  Most teachers who had been there for a while used the same four or so versions of a given test.

I told the IT department about this as part of my audit report, which I made immediately after finding out.  They said ""nobody would figure that out"" and ""people aren't supposed to put things on the drives anyway.""  I lied, saying that I asked teachers if they stored tests on their hard drives, and they said that they did.  He said ""tell them not to do that.""

So, I downloaded copies of these tests, which usually only had minor variations from one another.  Then I got trusted friends who were much smarter at me at humanities subjects that I would have to try really hard or do poorly at (AP English, AP World History), and, in exchange for the correct answers, I'd give them the test ahead of time.  I didn't tell them how I got them, but I did tell them not to tell anybody about it.  I ended up acing every test that I did this with over the course of 2 years, to the point that it was suspicious, but I never got caught.

As further evidence of their stupidity, I later cracked the administrator's password (it was an LM hashed on a Windows 98 computer that was used for one of the shop classes) and it turned out to be the name of our mascot.  He hadn't changed his password in years, either.

TL;DR: School's IT is retarded, easily downloaded tests well in advance, gave them to other nerds, they took them, I remembered their answers."

I will be starting a job as a security researcher in June, and have a 2 year commitment due to my scholarship.  My employer offers a number of options for continuing education.  I'm currently deciding if I should start working towards graduate school in a few years, but I have a few questions: 

1.) Would it be worth it to start a graduate degree this late in life (after 30?) 
2.) If so, is there any advantage to pursuing a PhD vs. a Masters? I've always wanted my PhD, but the idea of committing 4-6 years of my life is intimidating. 
3.) If I did decide to go for a graduate degree, will bad grades in classes 10+ years ago hurt me?  I've had all A's and 1 B for the past 4 years, and will have some research experience through internship and work, but I literally made all F's one semester back in 2000.

Reddit PLEASE help",KidPhil1989,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h3pg4/hopeless_21yrs_old_and_heavily_addicted_to/,"I don't even know where to begin, so I guess ill start from the beginning. I go to a accredited 4yr public university about 2 hours from my parents house, I'm currently a senior and plan on graduating in about a week. Growing up I was always the conservative friend that managed my money extremely well. I had saved close to $10,000 before I started college from work and what not. Once in college I began trading foreign currencies successfully and soon was making upwards of $500 a week.

  I started doing oxycontin and percocet the end of my sophmore year during sundays with the excuse ""it was my one day to relax and mellow out"" before school and the markets opened back up. Before I knew it I was doing them every night after homework and when the markets closed. It wasn't long before I started skipping class, not following the markets, and just really lowering my quality of life. My roommates had noticed a change and confronted me about it. It was enough to knock some sense into me and marked when I began to realize I was addicted. I never really stopped, but instead cut back and became a closet addict. I was able to somewhat salvage my Junior year, keep my GPA up, and luckily was going to a town 2000 miles away for an internship. I had looked back on the damage I had done to my academics, the money I had wasted, and told myself that I would get better while away. 

A month into my internship the only thing I could think about was oxycontin and percocet. I began driving around the city after my work day and searched far and wide for the drug but had very little luck. I never ended up finding any and my dealer refused to mail them to me so I was pretty much S.O.L.. The internship had ended and I went back to my college town with the intent of only doing them once and a while. Sadly, I began abusing them heavily and started to freebase the pills which I look back and mark as the beginning of the end.

For this past year, I would say I have been doing about $150-$200 worth of pills a day, everyday. I literally spent every dime to my name, drained every investment account I had, and even cashed about $3000 worth of savings bond. I almost broke down and called my parents asking for help but knew my parents would be heartbroken and decided to get clean on my own. With some of the worst timing imaginable, my parents had sent me a $10,000 check (which is about 20% of their combined income for a year), with a letter saying that this was for a down payment on a house or for a car and how proud they were I was graduating so soon (I will be the first to graduate college in my family). 

Its gone..(I seriously can almost cry when I think of this). Within a month and 26 days I had completely blown every last dollar my parents gave me. And thats where I am now. Reddit, I have no one to turn to, I have little to no friends anymore and cannot break my parents heart with the news... I am so addicted to this drug that I am starting to scare myself thinking about what I will do to get money for the pills. I can't afford rehab, I just don't know what to do, I've contemplated suicide for the first time in my life... The only thing I have left thats positive in my life is that im graduating but even with that I destroyed my GPA and don't have a job lined up..

Any advice would be appreciated. I am losing my will and drive to even try to fight this demon. If anyone has some kind of hope they could pass this way, it would be great..

TLDR- wasted over $50k on pills and had my parents give me a graduation present of $10,000 which was blown within 2 months... I cannot have my parents find out and I losing hope and need serious advice."

Coding experience C/C++/Java/MIPS
I am A+ certified for computer repair
I have had experience with setting up networks and CISCO related products

Here's some projects I thought could be interesting:
Creating a basic game-
I have very little interest in developing commercial games when I exit college (unless I can work for Valve), but this might be a good exercise to familiarize myself with using different libraries.  I have messed around a little bit with Pygame and SFML already.  This might be more fun, but probably not as productive as the next.

Teaching myself C#/.NET/XNA -
A friend of mine has expressed interest in attempting to develop some apps for Windows Phone 7, which uses C#, .NET and XNA.  I already installed the WP7 SDK and got the free eBook Microsoft provides for developing for Windows Phone 7.  I'm an Android user personally, and have no intention of getting a Windows Phone device, but the languages and .NET could prove to be very valuable to know.

I'm also open to suggestions.  I've considered teaching myself Java and trying to develop for Android, but I'll be taking a Java course in Fall anyway, and figured spending my Summer time on something else is probably better. Thanks in advance."

Anyway, bear with me for a short background and backstory. I am a third year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major at UC Berkeley (California). I am an international student from India. I have experience with web development and application development. Without going into details, I know my fair share of programming languages.


Backstory : I actually got an internship with AppDynamics in San Francisco. I signed an Agreement with them. Then two weeks after that they sent me a NDA to ""sign at my earliest convenience"". This is where I messed up a bit. I lost sight of this email for two weeks. When I sent it back to them a few days ago, they said since they hadn't heard from me for a while, they had closed the position I was hired for believing that I had moved on. They used the budget for something else, and I no longer have my position.

So now I need to find an internship again for the summer, and it's a little late for that. I realized that I have not been very good at networking, which is different from having friends in college. Friends who are still with you in college can't help you get an internship.

So I turned here for help. If any of you know of an internship I can apply to, or if you are hiring for an internship, please let me know. I would prefer to be somewhere in the Bay Area, since that's where I am now. I can also upload my resume to somewhere and add a link here.

I was wondering how difficult is it to get into internship for, lets say, facebook or google. Now, the obvious answer, of course, is to simply apply for it directly, but I'm afraid that if the application gets rejected, I won't be able to get a second chance that easy.

For some information : I'm a 2nd year pre-grad CompSci student, with not a particularly good grade average, 3.6 atm (on a 1-5 scale, 1 being fail).

I haven't competed in much programming competitions, and have almost no special achievements in my history. Pretty much best thing i did so far is getting perfect score in this year's google code jam.
I consider myself fluent in Java, and pretty good in C(++). I can dab around with SQL and php.
Also, I've got Cambridge's CPE (certificate of profficiency in english).

Question would be, is it even possible for me to apply, and if yes, will they take the application into consideration. Also, what would anyone suggest that I should learn (language-wise) to improve my chances.

Like the title says, I took an entire sequence of CS courses at a top 5 CS program, but I still cannot program. I just got an internship doing basic python/django stuff, and I sit there staring at code that I cannot really digest what is going on. 

Basically my assignment was to be given an open source project, and modify it to do newer and cooler things. Well I broke down the problem to: understand how the open source project works through the documentation and reading the code, then once understood write code to make cooler things.

Well I just sit here and read code, but I either go ""what the hell is going on?"" or ""wait wait let me look up that function in the library/documentation"". I can't for the life of me just figure out this project. Am I doing something wrong? Do I suck at reading code? Do I necessarily care how someone implemented something? Shouldn't I just be able to abstract on it?"

I found a new job, and am starting Monday, so today was my last day at my current place.  I've documented everything I can and done a handful of Q&amp;A's with my manager and team members.

My employer and I have a cordial relationship, I left of my own accord because they couldn't provide the advancement opportunities I needed due to budget cuts. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid being called whenever a new issue arises?  Most of the people here have my cellphone # or non-work email.  I didn't leave out of spite, and I try to generally be a helpful person, but don't want to get walked all over.

I am graduating essentially a year early. I began college in the fall of 2008, so under normal circumstances I would be graduating in the spring of 2012. However, due to college in high school credits I am able to graduate this summer and have chosen to do so due to the financial benefits; plus, I'm so sick of school.

I'm graduating from an accredited university (choosing not to say which) with a BS in Information Sciences and a minor in Supply Chain Management. I was the treasurer and webmaster of my college's honor society for the past year, a member of the honor society for 2 years, involved in multiple other honor societies and clubs/organizations, I have an overall GPA of 3.8/4.0 and an in major GPA of 3.91/4.0, I have had two summer internships (one at a small local company, another at a major corporation), have a strong resume IMO, and an online portfolio. In addition to my degree I have experience with various computer programming languages, some more experienced than others.

I have applied to over 70 companies ranging from a local company that has less than 50 employees in the IT help desk position to developing/design positions at Apple and Google to entry level new graduate programs at various corporations including Microsoft and Google. There are many small companies and many large that I have applied to.

I haven't heard from anyone except for being denied by a new graduate position at NASA.

I know the economy is down and there is a lack of jobs, especially for inexperienced new graduates; but I know a lot of people that have received jobs ranging from their local high schools to HP and Google. I know I'm not perfect and dislike bragging, but these few friends that have landed these jobs do not have anywhere near the writing, communication, verbal, and computer skills that I do; yet they're getting jobs. I know some people in the same boat as me and some who have just taken jobs in retail at GameStop and some driving for FedEx.

But what is the deal? Any advice?

Not sure if this is relevant, but I am a white male living in the US.

**EDIT: If I said specifically local companies instead of small, I didn't mean I've only applied to big companies and local companies. I've applied to a range of companies all over including DC, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Chicago, Raleigh, San Francisco, San Jose, and Atlanta (may be forgetting some). I've applied to local companies, too.**"
hbehi,2,2011-05-14,Applying to Jobs help?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hbehi/applying_to_jobs_help/,"Hey reddit!


So, last year I had an internship.  Before I got the internship, I had an interview.  Before I left the interview, I asked when I would know by if I got the job or not (I worded it differently).  They told me I would have an answer by next week.  A couple days after 'next week', I called and ask and they told me that they would know for sure by Wednesday.  So anyways, they end up telling me almost after a whole month later that I got the internship.  It's not that I'm in a huge rush, but I wanted to apply somewhere else if I wasn't going to get the internship.


This year I applyed for a job.  It's been will over a month since I gave them my application.  I haven't heard anything back yet, so last week I went to the place where I applyed.  They told me next week (this week) that they would call me if I got the job or send me a letter if I didn't.  I didn't get either this week.  Am I being too impatient, or am I just having bad luck at people getting back to me,  or am I doing something wrong?  It's driving me nuts because I really want this job, but if I know I can't get it I would like to apply to other places before high schoolers do.  grrr. "

That being said, however, I have this feeling that if I continue doing what I'm doing I won't get a degree and I'll be stuck here.  It would be difficult with my job to go to school while working as it's a fairly demanding job.

Basically I thought this was being in charge/looking over systems and keeping them up to date or setting them up and such, but a lot of my courses are in programming. I picked it because I thought it was supposed to make a lot of money, and that kind of work would be easy for me I think. I am also really good at troubleshooting/repairing computers, but I didn't see an obvious or GOOD major for that. If there was something relevant, I don't think they make a lot of money (do they?)

Nobody I've talked to has any idea what this is, and the people at my college are very stereotypically awkward to talk to as the computer guys. Or they're really bitchy and I can't really ask them. Or I can't understand their accent. 

I haven't been able to get a job. I've been looking for an internship to try anything with computers like I wanted, but I haven't been able to get anything. Not even this summer. So when I graduate and finally see what it's like, I might not even like it.

It sucks being at home without a job again. I want to find a job so I can get my own place; my family goes to bed really early so I can never really have friends over. And if you want to meet people, you can't just invite yourself over to their house really.

I first of all don't want to, but I'm considering getting some entry level high school job. Maybe coffee or something like that (I don't even know what, and it's such a hassle to find a list of what people want to hire. And even then, it's all spam or babysitter jobs which I wont do.) Even with that though, I don't know if I'd even get enough hours to pay for a place. But even worse, I feel like I should be spending my time looking for a job relevant to what I'll be doing and if I get a high school job, I imagine I wont have the motivation to look for anything anyways. I kind of doubt I'll find a job like my maor though.

Anyone have any thoughts or advice? About the job situation, or if you know what MCS is/does? I've been looking for these answers for a while. None of my friends have any advice, they're in completely unrelated majors and jobs and have internships doing stuff they expected and such. "
hbnka,5,2011-05-14,How can I get a job in the industry I want?  I graduated from a state university 2 years ago to this weekend and still haven't had a true whiff of what I've been wanting to do.,volshans,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hbnka/how_can_i_get_a_job_in_the_industry_i_want_i/,"I graduated Northern Illinois University in May of 2009, with a B.A. in Anthropology and a certificate in GIS.  It must have been awesome to have had a job lined up after graduation but as most people graduating large public schools knew, the cards were not in anyone's hands despite their good fortune.

I played my earlier decks well, almost accidentally, by not knowing how college worked after HS.  They passed some paper around the last few months of graduation asking where graduates were going to attend for college.  I'd not even considered the option seriously so I chose the county's community college.  I lived a grand two years, taking courses that made my mind whet and learned to live solo/progressively as best as I could.  I figured out how degrees work, how being vegan was no bueno, how raccoons scare the shit out of me when mountain biking solo at night and what treasures Appalachia hold for someone raised in the Midwest by Soviet Jewish parents.

When I graduated with honors there, I moved on to obtaining my Bachelor's at NIU.  I spent two years making intense connections with friends, dating a Japanese woman whom my family accepted as one of our own (hard to do with any gentiles ;)) and busting my ass to become happy with my dreams.  I started clubs, took over others and kept fit while learning to appreciate craft beers on the regular.  I didn't bother going to my graduation ceremony - I just wanted to get the hell out of DeKalb.  I was looking forward to utilizing what I learned there to better our society - that aloof college mantra.

Upon the final months of graduation, I dove deep into the Peace Corps process and passed through my interview process swimmingly.  But  I was disappointed in the placement so I abandoned the plans before undergoing the extended medical review.  Afterwards, I interned at a farm in central northern IL but ultimately never stayed the commitment because of factors out of my control.  I really wanted to farm, sustainably, but the winds blew me elsewhere at the time.

For a year, I worked a dead-end delivery job for my family's auto parts warehouse.  I begrudgingly watched the business fail as the economy fucked all of the service industry around us but especially the mechanics.  Laborers whose 10,15,20 year old shops went under because floating in the black was just too difficult.

Finally, after a year of dissatisfaction, I stumbled upon an internship for the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, Office of State Archaeology.  A glimmer of hope for me as I finally could showcase my ability to apply GIS to a needed function - digital transition to marking future dig sites.  I spent a vivid 2 months there, hoping that the unpaid internship would yield a future position with the department.  But a frozen State hiring landscape coupled with my inexperience left me option-less again.  I returned to IL once again, defeated but eager for more of what I had tasted.  I met a girl pre-trip who I'd begin dating but knowing the context of how I'd find nothing for me in IL, we'd expected a breakup when I'd somehow move away.

And so I did, move, almost instantly.  My step-brother wanted his work vehicle transported to AZ.  When he offered me work, both with him and a restaurant, I jumped at the opportunity.  I packed my seven-thousand base layers, climbing gear, track bike and will with me and drove across the US to crash at his place until I could find residence.  It took me less than a week to meet my current roommate who would be training with me for the tequila bar we'd both be working at.  I left my job with my step-brother and became a barback from busser at the bar.  The money's decent and tides me over for rent, ROTH IRA contributions and beans and rice.

But it's 2011.  May, 2011, for those still here with me.  I've been applying to GIS Technician jobs for these two years. I've submitted my package to two boards with the USAF now, results in September.  I've done nearly an internship a year since I started college and an Archaeological field school.

I'm at wit's end.  I pulled up a guide to learning Python because I'm tired of waiting for something to happen.  I've sent my info towards Teach For America because I didn't know the deadline for applying already passed.  I'm reluctant to study for the GRE because Grad School just seems like more debt to put on at this point and not means to an end right now.

I've got good amounts of cash saved. I've bought a car in cash.  I broke up with that previously mentioned girlfriend weeks ago and have been living solo for all of May now.

What am I doing wrong?  Why wont they take me?  I'm capable and eager to grow within a company.  Who keeps taking my opportunities away from me?"
hbmvr,0,2011-05-14,"Reddit, what was your greatest celebrity encounter?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hbmvr/reddit_what_was_your_greatest_celebrity_encounter/,"I know there have been threads like this before, but I really like reading these stories. I have a pretty good one, so here it is (xposted from another thread).

The greatest encounter I've had was on a trip with my high school's ""Political Science Club"" (which I formed) to Washington, D.C. We had talked about a trip to DC throughout the year, but it was always us saying ""Who wants to go to DC?"" half-jokingly. So, we started fundraising to go and we soon realized we'd have enough money to go, so we booked a party bus for April 29, 2010. Now, earlier that year we had met a graduate of our school who was working relatively high up in the White House, so we decided what the heck, let's see if we can contact them and get a tour of the White House. We called three weeks before the trip and didn't hear back until the night before the trip. They needed all our Social Security numbers, but we couldn't get in contact with all the members of the club so we just told them ""looks like we can't do it.""

So, we left our school at 4:30AM and began our trip to Washington, D.C. About two hours into the trip, we got a call from a secretary of the person we knew asking if we had the SS numbers, which we did. We gave them to her and she said she'd see if we'd be able to get in. A half-hour out of D.C. we get a call saying we're getting a tour of the White House. We were all happy. I remember someone saying ""What if we see Obama,"" to which another member replied ""We have a better chance of seeing John Kennedy.""

Before the White House tour, we went to the Newseum (had already bought the tickets). It's a pretty cool place, but we were only there for about 15 minutes. It turns out Oprah was doing a live taping and had a correspondent in the Newseum for her No Phone Zone thing. There was a huge crowd, and for a brief period we all thought Oprah was there. She wasn't, and the crowd that had gathered really started getting in the way, especially since we were trying to get in and out. 

We got dropped off in front of the entrance to the White House where we met a White House intern that had been sent for us. She took us to the front of the line, which was pretty awesome. She also served as our tour guide, because strangely enough the White House tour is normally self guided. Before we went into the White House, the secretary told me and my friend ""I don't think I'm supposed to tell you this, but you're in for a surprise. Marine One is taking off at noon and we're going to put you on the South Lawn to watch it."" 

Wow. We didn't even know what to think. In fact, we were so out of it we actually asked the nice lady ""will the President be getting on it,"" to which she replied ""Yeah, it's his helicopter."" So of course we didn't listen to a word of the tour because we were anticipating watching the President take off in the helicopter. We met with the person who made this all possible, and they took us back to where we had began. We were briefed by Secret Service and the director of the White House tours as to what to expect and what to do in the event of an emergency. I remember the Secret Service telling us ""If there's gunfire, do not run. Duck and walk back here. This is your safe zone. Do. Not. Run."" That was probably one of the most terrifying things I've ever heard.

We were let [out onto the South Lawn](http://i.imgur.com/QgpIQ.jpg) 5 minutes before any other tourists because of our connection, and gathered in front of a rope line. I was surprised by the lack of security; all that separated us from where the president was walking was a thin rope. I'm aware if any of us crossed that rope at any time, we'd either be shot or tackled immediately, but it was surprising nonetheless. It felt so strange being so close to the [back of the White House](http://i.imgur.com/odGDC.jpg). 

Across from us was [the press pool](http://i.imgur.com/2nrDv.jpg). It seemed like an endless line of cameras. I was surprised by the amount of press there to film him walking from the White House to the helicopter, but I realized if anything had happened, they'd all want the footage of it. 

After what had seemed like an eternity, the [helicopter appeared](http://imgur.com/vOshE.jpg) out of no where. Then we waited for another lifetime, when suddenly the President [emerged from the back door](http://imgur.com/6EEnJ). As he was walking, I shouted ""President Obama"" as if he would hear me shouting and walk over. Then, as he was walking, he [saw the staffer](http://i.imgur.com/4Oprb.jpg) who got us there, recognized them, and walked over to ask why they were out here. The staffer explained the situation, so President Obama walked the rope shaking our hands. RIGHT BEFORE HE GOT TO ME, HE WAVED AND WALKED AWAY. I said ""No, Mr. President,"" as if he would turn around and come back. 

Well, he did. And he shook my hand (proven by [this glorious photo](http://i.imgur.com/a3ziF.jpg) of him turning back)

That was the best encounter, because of both the odds of it happening and the fact it was the President. Here's a [video I took of it all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE) and here's [a photo of me taking the video](http://i.imgur.com/cMrCm.jpg) and him shaking my friends hand. 

TL;DR I met the President on the South Lawn of the White House. [Here's the video I took](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE). "
hciw5,1,2011-05-16,"I'm subletting with friends this summer, but they don't want to split the rooms evenly. Help!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hciw5/im_subletting_with_friends_this_summer_but_they/,"I thought I'd get a couple opinions on this one, so let's give it a go.

About a month ago, me and two friends decided that we would get a place for the summer, since we would all be in the same city doing undergraduate research with our school.

After two near confirmations on Craiglist, which led to two failures (you wouldn't believe how fast sublets get taken), we finally were able to submit a sublet form and confirm our housing with a nice three-bedroom apartment.

Now the backstory is that I've done about 90% of the work, emailing, calling, and checking out every single apartment we were interested in. Besides talking about the places over email or occasionally coming along with me to check out the place, I've been handling most of the conversations with potentials. We were originally going to be finding a three-bedroom and split it evenly three ways, utilities and all.

Now flash forward to the place we have now, and the people we're renting from have the bedrooms priced differently. We're supposed to pay each person separately as well. They're priced at about 750, 800, and 850 per month, for two and a half months.

Roommate B is automatically assigned the 800 room. He'll be staying for a couple extra days since Roommate A and I have early return housing to campus, and the 800 room is the only one open for a couple days extra.

Now Roommate A takes the 750 room. I let him choose that room, since he's been complaining he might not be able to get a paid research position this summer and thus siphoning his summer funds off his parents to pay for his part of the sublet. 

Now this leads to me to take the 850 room, obviously the largest room (but not by much). Disgruntled as I was at the time, I chose not to complain because - hey, what's a $250 difference (between the 750 and the 850 for 2.5 months) between poor college students? So we signed the contracts and confirmed out housing for the summer.

But obviously I wouldn't be here asking this question is $250 is a lot for someone like me. My parents can't afford to pay for any part of my summer costs, so I'm thankful I'm getting paid a couple thousand for the summer. Honestly, $250 can practically buy me groceries for several weeks here. 

So I approached my friends about this but obviously they seemed content to pay less than me and are basically saying no. Every time I approach the subject, Roommate A complains he's not getting paid and that splitting things between us evenly and then paying off the people we're subletting is too much of a roundabout way to do things. Roommate B does his best to do as little work as possible as well as shirk the question every time.

I've done pretty much all the work in finding the apartment, and I don't want to stir up trouble too much because money shouldn't have to get between friends. But when Roommate A said, ""In the real world, people don't give a shit about how much you work. You think Google interns get as much as the Google CEO?"" I was very much tempted to hold his head underwater for a couple minutes. (god I hope none of them read this).

I guess my mistake was in letting Roommate A choose which room he wanted instead of me jumping on the cheapest one, but he kept complaining about price and so I let it go and I hate being confrontation anyhow. And everytime I approach the situation, he tries to deflect it by saying we should be both be going after Roommate B for doing even less work and being less responsive. 

We'll still be splitting everything else evenly like utilities, but it pains me to have done all the work in acquiring the apartment, only to be paying the most out of my friends. I'm lost how to approach this now since it seems both my friends don't want to back down.

(sorry for the long post, but you have to read it to understand the whole story properly)

Do you think this is fair, and if not, what should I do!? This is stressing me out a lot actually, especially since they're both friends who just happen to piss me off at the moment.

TL;DR My roommates are paying less than me because of differently priced rooms, but I did most of the work and somehow got stuck with the most expensive one.

EDIT
Originally before signing the contracts, I talked to them about splitting it evenly, and they pretty called me out on making it more expensive for them so I backed down (""yes"" to anything you'll say about this part. I was retarded)

Techinically, Roommate B is making about three times what I am paying, and I'm making just enough to pay for sublet and food for the summer. 

So far I guess the consensus is that I was dumb and did it to myself. I wish I knew that I was going to be making tons of money down the road and looking back it wasn't going to matter, but architect majors end up poor D: Ah well... thanks for the advice everyone."

I'm enrolled in a Chemical Engineering in a Singaporean university. Not a top student, but I have pretty ok grades: 3.81/5 GPA. With a minor in Entrepreneurship (started a student venture along the way).

What I lack in hardcore grades I make up for in experience &amp; loads of internships. I've done 2 years worth of research internships (chemistry related), have won a gold medal with team at iGEM 2009, MIT. Have worked with P&amp;G in Paris for 6 months, and altogether 11 months in France. I speak conversational French. Took part in loads of competitions (like iGEM mentioned above) and others too. At least 5-6 in the past 4 years. On the side, I've self-learnt a bit of programming, working on my first iOS app this break, recently launched a personal website for essays and some such.

I'll be taking the GRE, TOEFL/IELTS, and French DALF B2 exams asap to get them out of the way. Because of the internship in France, I need to postpone my graduation date by a year so that'll be in May 2012. What should I do, and what can I do, to get a scholarship to do my Masters?

A bit about Masters: ideally, I want to do something interdisciplinary &amp; contributive, like Development Engineering (scoped courses in Tokyo, Netherlands) or Engineering &amp; Public Policy (scoped in CMU USA and CEU Hungary among others). But at this stage, really, anything related to these fields, with a scholarship will do.

hdq2n,7,2011-05-17,"Reddit, I need to get a scholarship to do Masters. Where and how? (help!)",iandravid,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/hdq2n/reddit_i_need_to_get_a_scholarship_to_do_masters/,"So a bit about my profile.

I'm enrolled in a Chemical Engineering in a Singaporean university. Not a top student, but I have pretty ok grades: 3.81/5 GPA. With a minor in Entrepreneurship (started a student venture along the way).

What I lack in hardcore grades I make up for in experience &amp; loads of internships.
I've done 2 years worth of research internships (chemistry related), have won a gold medal with team at iGEM 2009, MIT. Have worked with P&amp;G in Paris for 6 months, and altogether 11 months in France. I speak conversational French. Took part in loads of competitions (like iGEM mentioned above) and others too. At least 5-6 in the past 4 years. On the side, I've self-learnt a bit of programming, working on my first iOS app this break, recently launched a personal website for essays and some such.

I'll be taking the GRE, TOEFL/IELTS, and French DALF B2 exams asap to get them out of the way. Because of the internship in France, I need to postpone my graduation date by a year so that'll be in **May 2012**. What should I do, and what can I do, to get a scholarship to do my Masters?

A bit about Masters: ideally, I want to do something interdisciplinary &amp; contributive, like Development Engineering (scoped courses in Tokyo, Netherlands) or Engineering &amp; Public Policy (scoped in CMU USA and CEU Hungary among others). But at this stage, really, anything related to these fields, with a scholarship will do.

I'm really on panic mode; if I don't get any scholarship, there's no way at all to pursue this path, and I definitely don't want to be a Chemical Engineer or researcher, ever.

There's lots of internships I probably *could* have gotten if I hadn't waited so long, but since this is the last minute I don't know what to do. I can't work from home, really. Any ideas? Pay isn't important, if I can get good working/research experience. Although pay would be nice. :)

hem8q,0,2011-05-18,"Reddit, help. My roommate is an AC nazi",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hem8q/reddit_help_my_roommate_is_an_ac_nazi/,"I've been living with two roommates for a little over a year now. We live in an older house that went through a few renovations, but none to fix the efficiency of the AC system. We have had disputes over the past year about the heat and what temp it should be at during different parts of the day. Last summer, I was out of the house nearly all day because I worked and went to summer school (I am the only one in the house who actually pays for my own bills; the other two just have their parents write a check). When I'd get back around 9pm, the AC would be set at 85. We live in Austin, so it's pretty damn hot during the summer. I usually would just turn it down to 74 when I got in the house. One of my roommates didn't start living with us until the fall, but since we had all moved into the house before the summer, she still paid for part of the bills. So when schools starts, and we're all living in the house, one of my roommates starts turning the AC off when she leaves. When we'd all get back from class that evening, the house would be at 85-90 degrees (I had all morning classes, so the AC was ok when I'd leave for class. She'd change it after I'd leave the house). This went on for a while. Even though we all talked and came to compromises, the two roommates never stuck to them and would always turn the AC either way up or off when I wasn't there. Their explanation was that the AC has to work extra hard to keep the house cool, so if we keep it at the same as the outside temp, the bill will be low. I tried telling them that our AC would be low if we kept it constant during the day, but they continued to argue. Eventually, I just started staying at my boyfriend's house. Things chilled out over winter (literally) and AC wasn't an issue.

Fast forward to this semester. I literally never see my one roommate; she lives alone in her room. The other roommate is constantly on my ass about the thermostat. I quit my job in March so that I could focus on GRE stuff, my internship, grad school things, etc., but it's cool because I saved money to pay for bills. I was home more often because I had a ton of things to do, so I had more time to experience the extreme heat conditions. At first, I'd do work in my room (the rooms are tiny, so you can feel the AC better them), and after a few hours of dying (the fans don't help), I'd change the thermostat from 79 to 74-75. It may be only a few degrees, but it makes a huge difference in this house. Within a few minutes, the roommate would leave her room and change it back up, either to 79 again or higher. I'd either turn it back down, leave, or suck it up. A few weeks ago, she wrote a sticky note and put it under the thermostat. [This is it](http://imgur.com/ptam5). She's never put it at 76 during the day, idk why she wrote that. Considering the cost of our last bill, 15% of our bill would come out to around $5 more per roommate. I don't know where she found that stat. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she just walks away and goes into her room. 

Last night was kind of my breaking point. My boyfriend and I were packing my stuff and moving it to my car. The house was at its normal high temp, so I asked my boyfriend if he could turn it down to 74. It was about 6:30, so I didn't think my roommate would care. While we were moving, my roommate had opened her door to watch us as she sat on her computer. When my boyfriend got to the thermostat, she took off her headphones and started yelling at him, saying that he better not touch the thermostat, yada yada. He told her that we were moving stuff and it was really hot in the house, and she started yelling louder, telling him that he doesn't pay our bill, etc, etc. He walked into my room to get away/grab some more boxes, and she followed him in there. She told him that we were wasting so much energy and causing the bill to be extremely high. He told her that if she cared so much, he'd give her a $10. She just kept yelling. So I go over to my room, and I hear my boyfriend tell her to go fuck herself. That didn't help the situation, but it was about time someone said it. I broke up their argument and tried to explain to her that the house was really hot, and that we'd turn it back up when we were done, but she just kept going on about how much money I waste by turning the AC down and how much energy I'm wasting. I told her I wasn't going to change it, and that our last bill wouldn't even matter because we were about to get our deposit check back anyway. She said that the deposit has nothing to do with the bill. I walked off. She just went back to her room and sat on her computer. It was a bit more dramatic then I'm saying, but it's obvious that she's a crazy bitch. My boyfriend and I finished up some packing, turned the AC back to what she had it, and left.

I have a week left living here. Can anyone help me with facts to support my argument, or something to take away from hers? I feel like she is just extremely wrong.



Some additional things:

-She used to go through my room when I wasn't home. I bought a new doorknob with a lock and she got offended

-If she saw my laptop plugged in, she would take the plug out of the wall, then my laptop would die

-When we had parties, she would turn it way back up when people were in the other room. That pissed everyone off

-She has never had a job, her parents buy her everything, she drives an Audi

-She literally does nothing all day except sit on her computer (the biggest iMac that apple offers). She puts her facebook status to ""offline"" so she can facebook stalk literally all day. I know this because she told me she does this.

**tl;dr** My roommate keeps the AC really high because she thinks it saves money, but it just keeps the house extremely hot and unlivable

**polyparadigm:** One granted patent and a few pending regarding ceramic processing, and another pending involving micro-miniaturized vacuum tubes.

(TL;DR at the end)

I am a 31-year-old female who just completed a B.S. degree in chemistry. I also just got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years. We do not yet have any kids, but we are certain that we want to start a family, and soon. (In my case, I'm worried about the possibility of waiting *too* long, and not being able to...)

The plan originally was for me to get a job working for a few years, get married, start a family, then go back to grad school when the kids are old enough for daycare. People tell me that it is a bad idea to wait any length of time before grad school; however, I really just can't imagine trying to have a baby while in grad school. (If anyone actually *has* gone through this, please speak up!)

We also both want to move elsewhere... we're not too picky about the *where*, we just both know we don't like it where we currently are. Future hubby has been with his current company for 9 years now and doesn't like it... he stayed so that we could be together while I finished school. Unfortunately, I'm thinking that it's going to be difficult looking for jobs without a clear idea of *where* to look. It's also not helping that I have been told by a few people that the majority of jobs are found by networking rather than through actual job postings. I have a good network in this area, but as I said... the future hubby is set on moving.

I haven't actually applied to grad school yet (probably a bad move in retrospect), and right now my ""plan B"" is to get a 1-2 year contract position or internship around here and get into grad school as soon as I can. Again, though, the issue is that I *know* hubby is not happy here, and so I really would rather find something in another area.

Reddit, any opinions or thoughts are welcome! Thanks!

TL;DR: 31-year-old female, just finished B.S., wants to have kids before it's too late; hubby wants to move elsewhere, but I fear having a tough time finding jobs without networks in other areas. Also worrying about putting off grad school."

She said to wait a month and if I didn't hear anything, then get back to her. I didn't hear anything so I replied with this:

""Hi again,

I hope all is well.

I have yet to receive a response from X firm so I am writing you in pursuance of your last e-mail. I am awaiting their reply to confirm my summer plans; would you have any updates about the progress of my candidacy?

I do appreciate that you and your coworkers are very busy, and I'd be grateful for a response at your earliest convenience.

It's been over two weeks since I sent this out so I'm wondering what my next move should be. She on average takes a week to reply to me but I'm thinking she has just forgotten at this point. Maybe a phone call to remind her? I do need to make other plans if this doesn't work out but I don't want to get on her nerves either...

My dad has always been hard on me when it comes to school and work.  My grades were never good enough and I never seemed to work enough hours.  Well that was all fine and dandy in high school.  I firmly believe that parents should push their kids to succeed.  I'm extremely grateful for the work ethic he taught me.

Well when college rolled around, neither of my parents gave me a dime (my parents are divorced and I live with my dad full time).  So, to get myself through school, I worked two jobs.  This was fine.  I actually enjoy working and keeping busy.

I got my associates degree in Paralegal Studies and I would like to continue going to school part time to get a degree in environmental science (I probably won't actually get a degree until I'm 30, but that's moot).  Right now I'm working as an unpaid intern at a law office, and I still work both of my jobs.  So, as of late, I work between 60 and 70 hours a week.  I'm pretty proud of myself at this point, however my dad can't seem to get past the fact that the internship is unpaid.  He never fails to remind me how stupid he thinks I am for working for free.  When I explain to him how much I'm learning, he just tells me that knowledge isn't going to buy me a new car (or something along those lines).  

What makes it even more difficult at times is seeing my friends who have great relationships with their extremely supportive parents.  I didn't even bother going to my graduation ceremony.

I'm just at my wits end.  It's gotten to the point where I hate being home when my dad is here because I know he's going to ask me why I'm not at work or cleaning the house (I'm pretty much in charge of keeping the house, my dad does the yard work and such).

All I really want is to know that my dad is proud of me for SOMETHING.

Has anyone else ever experienced this; tried so hard only to have their efforts go seemingly unnoticed?

tl;dr: I bust my ass constantly and my dad still doesn't think I do enough.  Has anyone else ever gone through this and how did you get through to your parents?"

What peeves me the most though, is that she lied about being gay (Or at least regarding her partner, though I don't think she's gay either).  She told the company that her ""partner"" would be staying in our apartment for the summer, but I'm pretty (almost absolutely) sure they were just good friends.  What pisses me off the most is that I arrived at the apartment a week before them and could have taken the master bedroom, but since I was trying to be considerate to who I thought was a couple, I took the smaller room and ended up spending the summer sleeping in a bed that was a racecar (I'm 6', 250 lbs).

I know people will want to know why I thought she was lying so here are the reasons:
- The alleged couple shared a king size bed, BUT kept a large body pillow in the middle that separated the two sides as well as slept with separate blankets.   
- I never once saw them be affectionate, cuddle, hold hands or kiss during the entire two months we lived together.
- They would call each other ""wife"" and make sarcastic posts to each other back and forth on facebook calling each other ""wife"".  It could have just me being suspicious and hating them, but it seemed contrived.  And while I'm not versed on lesbian couple etiquette, it just doesn't seem something a real couple would do.  I have tons of hetero-female friends who refer to their best female friends as ""wife"" in a similar sarcastic-joking manner.
- They had been friends since junior high, went to different colleges, one lived in North America while the other in Europe during the past 5 years.  I find it highly unlikely that two childhood friends both realize they are gay and then date many years later, after moving away and apart from each other. 
- Her ""partner"" had a ""friend"" visiting from Spain during our two months there.  Her ""partner"" traveled around Thailand with said ""friend"" for three weeks out of those two months.  You'd think that if she lived an ocean away from her partner and this is a friend who lives in Spain, where she lived, she would want to spend more time with her ""partner"" and not run off spending half the time with this guy, especially since they said they only see each other during the summers.  Also, she had a calendar taped up in her room that had a date circled with a heart and inside the heart she wrote ""Roberto (or some other similarly sounding European name) coming, YAY!""
- I took a weekend trip to a beach/island, but she had to work that weekend (She was a kiss ass and volunteered and then lectured me for not working, even though our boss said it was not a big deal and I spoke to him privately explaining I had coordinated the trip (with 2 other interns as well) and he told me to enjoy myself).  When we got back from the trip, not only did she lecture me about asking for the day off, she was also pissed I didn't invite her partner.  It baffled me because I've lived with my girlfriend and another roommate and it was always such a treat to have the entire apartment to ourselves, I thought she would have felt the same, but obviously not because she's a god damn liar.
- She got sick towards the end of the intership and left a week early.  Her partner stayed in our apartment, which I found weird since I thought she would have left with her sick partner and accompanied her while she was sick.
- They were very nitpicky about expenses.  Like paying each other back for a 20 baht meal (Exchange rate at the time was like 35 baht = 1 USD).  If I asked my girlfriend to pay me back the 65 cents I spent on her for dinner, I'm pretty sure she'd punch me right in the dick.

There was more stuff I'm sure, but I can't remember every detail now as it was 3 years ago.  I just talked to one of the other interns who worked with us that summer, last week and he brought her up, we all hated her.

tl;dr - coworker lied to company about being gay so friend could stay in our company housing."
hhmh9,2,2011-05-22,Creative Aspirations vs. College,sbosw67,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hhmh9/creative_aspirations_vs_college/,"SHORT VERSION:

I'm a writer. Parents can't afford cool super expensive school where I can major in something useless (I.E. English.) Jealous of preppy ass holes who don't take advantage of their awesome education while I'm stuck in a commuter school with the grades and no cash. Sick of majoring in business. Can't stand it anymore. Don't want to be stuck in a cubicle. Thinking of dropping out. It's all a waste of time.

The less arrogant version is below.

LONG VERSION:

Hey, Reddit. Help me out here.

I'm a creative individual whose parents are forcing me to be a business major at a public, in-state school, so that I have something to fall back on. I wanted to be an English-ed major, but they say it won't get you a job (and in this economy, it won't.) Obviously having a backup plan for a creative individual is a smart move, but my problem is that I'm starting to fall apart mentally. I'm a hard working individual but I can't stand business and the thought that I would ever have to make a living doing that.

I recently failed my Calc final (which automatically fails you in the course) and my parents are pissed. It was my own fault. I lost steam towards the end of the semester and didn't put enough time into studying (I was writing instead.) I sort of went loose with repression on how its bullshit that I have the grades for great schools but I'm stuck in a business school, where I'm wasting my time studying for bullshit instead of pouring energy into my creative works*. I haven't spoken to them in a few days, but I told them I either want to transfer or drop-out, because I'm truly unhappy where I am, with writing the only thing saving me from total depression.

I know it's smart to have a back-up plan, but I feel like I'm wasting my time. I don't know whether or not I'll succeed in my creative aspirations, but I do know that I'll work harder than anybody else to get there - a passion that I feel no equivalent in with business. Why am I wasting my time majoring in a subject that I can't stand the thought of doing for a living? Why do people get to major in useless shit (I.E. English, History, Philosophy - all awesome and fun to learn, but rarely gets you a job unless you go to grad school) and have a college experience at some expensive, out-of-state (or in-state) private school? I just don't get it.

I'm jealous, I guess. Life's not fair. I wanted to go away to school - not to be a dumbass and go party everyday - but to live away from home, meet new people and enrich myself in knowledge and fun experiences. And meanwhile all these kids I know - whose families make shit for income - get to take out loans, live in debt, and get to tell me about what an awesome experience they had in college while I get to hangout with finance majors worrying about their GPA and paid internships at Lehman Brothers.

There's some part of me that feels like I'm being a whiny little bitch and I should just suck it up and appreciate what I have. You can't always get what you want (SEE ALSO: http://xkcd.com/863/) Now that I'm approaching junior year, I feel like all these business courses I have to take for the next three years are gonna suck the life out of me. They're hard courses that I don't have the time, energy, or dedication to make an effort for. This is not what I want to do with my life. This is not where I want to be. My college experience is shit and I can't fucking stand it anymore.

Help me out?

Thanks,
A redditor (hiding behind a different username because I don't want my sister to see this and tell my parents how unhappy I am - not that they would understand.)

People have paid me to fix their computers and to do things for them in Microsoft Word. At best I've done an unofficial, unpaid internship at a small computer repair shop with the vague promise that I would be hired if I could get my own transportation. I still don't have a car.

I've looked around and read all kinds of mixed up things about getting certification, experience, etc. Some people say that A+ certification is laughable and worthless, while others say it's great for getting my foot in the door. I don't even know, at this point, where to go if I even do get A+. MCITP? Network+? MCSA? Is there a straight path to take, a way to get experience? How do I get educated? How do I get experience?

I'm really at a huge slump in my life too. My parents are pushing me to get a job. I constantly feel like a helpless baby, especially when someone says ""Oh, you're living with your parents?"" I have no real-world experience. I'm scared completely out of my mind, but I want to get out there and try my hand at getting paid for what I know I can be good at. I want to be working for a company while knowing that they actually need me.

I'm not asking for anything except information and advice. Regardless, I have the materials I need to study for the A+ exams and I want to pass them in order to at least feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. That goes a long way, at least for me.

Thanks in advance, reddit. You guys are awesome.

tl;dr I've never had a real job and I want to have an IT career, but I don't know where to go. What certifications can I get, and what paths can I take? How can I set myself apart and compete in the job market?"

Now on to the problem, I've built one or two very successful AMD based builds, using newegg and tigerdirect for parts. I'm looking to completely overhaul my current PC, which to give you an idea, has:

* AMD Phenom II X2 Black Edition CPU
* 2 GB RAM (Can't remember the type as I'm on my laptop)
* ATI 4650 

I built this almost 3 years ago during my WoW era, and as a consequence, it doesn't run (well) a whole lot of newer games I want to play. 

What I would like to do is build a completely new PC, but I'm having a tough time deciding if I want to go the AMD, or the Intel route. 

I was thinking about the i5 2500k, and the HD 6950, but I have little experience with Intel and any mobos that are needed for Intel builds. Can anyone offer any advice?

**edit:**
 My budget is around the $1,200 ballpark, and I don't really need to have it right away. I have an internship this summer that is going to be covering the majority of this build, so at the end of the summer is when I'd really start building.

hihl6,5,2011-05-23,"I see your fired girlfriend and I raise you a fired spouse who engaged in what could be considered an emotional affair with a homeless, mentally ill client.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hihl6/i_see_your_fired_girlfriend_and_i_raise_you_a/,"My spouse of five years and I were in charge of running a program for homeless individuals (transitional, long term housing), mainly focusing on mentally ill adults.  I have been in the field for 5 years, working for this particular company for about 4.  My wife came on board nearly 2 years ago on a part time basis.  It is worth noting that while we get along well both professionally and personally, our marriage had been on the rocks basically from the beginning.  In Feb, my wife went to full time to cover me while i pursued an internship for my masters program.  Somewhere around the time that this all went down, she also began wanting to consider divorce.

We had a resident who was our age, intellectually high functioning and likable.  We had both remarked that he could be a friend, in another context.  About three months ago, I started noticing that my wife was treating him differently than other clients and spending exorbitant amounts of time with him.  I, inappropriately, confronted her at home about what I was noticing.  She denied it, said her Methods were clinically justifiable and asked if I was jealous of one of our clients.  I subsequently brought my concerns to our supervisor who shrugged me off, suggesting that my thinking was off due to our increasing marital strife (which I had kept her aware of).  Despite being shut down twice, my suspicions remained (though I felt quite paranoid for it).  I found my wife lying to me regarding being with him at points during the daytime.  I began tracking her with find my iPhone and noticed inconsistencies in where she said she was vs where she actually was.  I never addressed it directly but made passive aggressive attempts to communicate that I was on to her...even though I didn't know what.  My wife is very sharp and I couldn't imagine her actually cheating with a client, despite the fact that tHis was my prevalent fear.  

Everything came to a head when I looked into her personal email, after catching her in a few more lies, and found correspondence between the two of them, including mention of me and my insecurities regarding them.  I saved this info and sent it onto my supervisor, mainly because I didn't know what to do.  I knew my wife would be outraged that I went into her email.  My supervisor attempted to gently address this by issuing a company-wide policy forbidding communication with clients via personal methods and outside of the workplace.  She then specifically addressed this with my wife and this client.  I then began hearing rumors from my other residents that something was going on between my wife and this resident.  This was a few Fridays ago.

Finally, the following Sunday, my wife said she was going to the grocery store.  I was suspicious and checked the location of her phone.  I could see that she was stopping off at our workplace.  I hopped in my car (with our two children) and met her and the client of them in a park where she had taken him.  I took pictures for any potential legal purposes and there was a intense, but not explosive confrontation.  

Later that night she came home and we talked about it.  She informed me that they had not slept together but had kissed that day after the confrontation and said that she loved him.  She also stated that she couldn't say whether she loved me and still didn't want to be with me.  

She lost her job the next day, he lost his housing a few days later.  She still sees him ""as a friend"" sporadically and we are currently taking time to figure out where we go from here.  We have been up and down alot, emotionally, as you can imagine.  I had initially stated that if she wanted to consider staying with me, she needs to commit to working on the relationship and cut him out.  She agreed to this but then backtracked a few times, saying she felt forced into it (with the alternative being that she loses her home and potentially the kids).  We are in a holding pattern because she feels she cannot make any decisions, even regarding him or me, at this point.  We are both in therapy working on the issues that led us to this point.  

She is still very angry at me for invading her personal space and betraying her by sharing it with our supervisor.  I am able to respect and understand that.  She also feels that the company was overly punitive for both her and the client. That one, I'm not so sure about.  She says she connected with him because he listened to her and made her feel okay about various qualities.  Said she could talk to him about anything, that they thought alike and felt he was deep. Said she also related to him in regard to her own ""mental health"". These are certainly things that our marriage was missing and I can freely acknowledge it.  She feels the romance/sexual attraction resulted from the secrecy and hiding.  keep in mind, while I was in the dark about them, she concluded that she was not sexually attracted to me and that I was not deep enough for her.

People she talks to say ""he turned you in?!?"" and people I've talked to seem to think I'm being too passive and that I did exactly what any other guy would've done.  

So, what say you, reddit?  And this can be an AMA as well, I suppose.  In fact, she is a redditor and is considering doing her own AMA.

Tl;dr my wife and I ran a homeless program for mentally ill.  My Erie had an emotional affair to a client and the result of my actions left her unemployed."

I am a mechanical engineering student in my senior year, working my last co-op rotation at a company I would really like to be hired after I graduate next year. I also would like to apply for the company’s career development program which is a fast track to a supervisor/manager role. 

To get into this program the student must have a combination of grades, work experience and extracurricular activities, especially in a leadership role. My grades are average for an engineer and my work experience is very extensive IMO.

This summer I am kind of working with a few freshmen interns. We are not all working on the same exact projects but we are in the same department and all sitting at the same cubes. I feel this is a great opportunity to get some leadership experience and to help the interns out too.

I need your help and ideas to prove to my boss and his boss that I am a capable leader AND this would be a good topic to discuss with the career development committee when they select candidates next year.

What are some ideas to organize and lead the interns?  I just grabbed a big whiteboard and cabinets for the team.

Thanks in advance!

I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Multimedia. 
I have school experience with Java, Python, but have not programmed since leaving school two years ago. Definitely something I could relearn and bring back up to speed if needed.

For the past year and a half I have been working as an I.T. Specialist for an Environmental Saftey consulting firm, doing mainly desktop support, all aspects from hardware and software configuration, Windows OS, Windows Server, Mac OS, Office suites. In addition I do occasionally work with our servers (Dell 710/510) Active Directory, Group Policy, Microsoft Exchange.

In the past I did web design for about 5 years for small clients. Strong skills in HTML, CSS, XHTML, and basic skills in XML, JavaScript, PHP. Something again I can bring up to speed if needed. Just never had the need for any projects I worked on so I never spent much time mastering. 
I also worked on the new US Department of Radiation website during my internship with www.PNNL.gov
I did about 90% of the data migration and formatting of the site content from the old site to the new site, located here. http://lowdose.energy.gov/

I have over 10 years working directly in customer service in the medical environment, and also the retail environment doing sales and as a supervisor. I can assure you that I am a reliable prospect able to jump right in, and I do not look for the easy way out. I have had (aside from one internship right out of school) three jobs, including my current place of employment, in the past 14 years.

I am looking to stay within I.T. But of course would consider other opportunities as well. I really enjoy working with all the hardware and back end equipment and would love to continue that career path. I would also like a permanent position as opposed to contract.
I am looking for a salary in the range of $60,000 to $70,000, but I do not moving up a ladder to that goal either.
I can send resume if interested. 
I'd rather not post all my information online.

hjnoc,2,2011-05-25,In college for a ME degree in Texas. Any hope of leaving?,Nathan_BS,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/hjnoc/in_college_for_a_me_degree_in_texas_any_hope_of/,"So I have finished two semesters at a low-cost college in Texas using the Texas Tomorrow Fund, a college system which allows for somebody's family to make gradual payments into the program, then the kid will use that money to go on to college. The only loans I have accepted were to rent books and to have cash to eat on campus, so I would say that equates to around $1000.  I have finished my Physics portion, two semesters of history, and one ethics course for engineering.
Like many people here, I want out of America. I have yet to decide where to, but really right now I just want out of here before it's too late.  I'm watching our political system run our country into the ground with the help of big corporations which feed off of nothing but profits and practically farm us citizens for cash, at the expense of our well-being. I don't want to fight an inevitable fight. In fact, I don't want to be a part of it at all.
I have decided that my most open option would be Mexico, since I'm in Texas.  Of course, Mexico isn't in such a great shape either.  So if not Mexico, I guess I could flee to Canada? Of course this is a very long trip, so I have calculated that, by driving using stocked-up gas tanks from my city (~3.75 atm), that I would be spending an average of 376.83 when driving my 25 mpg car. Of course I could save some gas by leaving in the winter, but anything could happen in the given time. I will also need money for food, which I guess would be about $100 if I eat sparingly. Then there's the loan I need to pay back, before it starts adding interest. (all subsidized, thankfully) So adding in motel costs, I am looking at, hopefully, only around $1700 in costs to leave by car. Of course I could leave by airplane, but I would be packing a lot. In fact, far too much to actually be worth the cost of shipping. I have a pretty roomy car, so driving looks more attractive.
Of course I don't have $2k stashed in my closet right now, (and screw banks too) so I need to get a decent job and save/raise some cash. I currently work at the Cowboys Stadium, so I don't get much of a paycheck, but I am job searching and hopefully I find something pretty decent. (and legal!) I guess I could also sell some of my unimportant commodies which I have bought over the years? Another delay in the road may be that I might get accepted for an internship at Bell Helicopter (not so much snag, as much as a magnificent blessing involving some patience) where, if I do intern for them, I am obligated to work for their company for two years after graduating.  So here are my current questions:

* What can I expect as far as starting a new life in a Canadian city?
* Should I finish college in Texas, given that I quit taking loans and continue with the Texas Tomorrow Plan?
* Will there be any other sure expenses which I haven't taken into account?
* Should I intern at Bell Helicopter? Will two years of experience + internship with their company look good to Canadian engineer firms?
* Are there any legalities involving leaving the US to Canada? ( I couldn't find any)
* Other places are also in consideration, unless they are within US border. Any closer well-off countries which I have overlooked?
* If I get an friend to save up some cash, would it be a good idea to bring him/her along to help ease the boredom of a multiple-day trip?

Ultimately I think it would be nice to live in Sydney.  The thought of living in Australia has always seemed very cool to me, especially as a kid when I watched The Crocodile Hunter all the time.  Of course I know the very notion of moving to Sydney right out of college is ludicrous, so I am going somewhere somewhat reasonable (Canada?)

Any helpful advise?

EDIT: I have decided that I am waiting until after I finish college to make the big move. In the meanwhile I will be doing research on how to get a visa, and possibly join a program for studying abroad so I can get a feel for another country, possibly across the sea.  I would probably also talk to my family and friends about it first. I see the most resistance with my family though, they have a very pro-american mindset and I need to explain to them why this is such an important choice to me.  Thanks for the help!"

hkm09,8,2011-05-26,Is it possible to become a programmer when I'm about to graduate with an unrelated degree?,fasdfdasf,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hkm09/is_it_possible_to_become_a_programmer_when_im/,"So the gist of it is that I'll be graduating next May with a degree in Neuroscience from a top 20 school in the US with a 3.8GPA+. However, I've realized that I have little interest in lab research or going to med school like the vast, vast majority of my peers in my major.

I've always had a love of programming and computers and learned the basics of C back in elementary school, along with several other languages, and now do robotics building at my university. Just how hard would it be for me to get a decent paying job in software development right after graduation? I have no formal CS education, and no time/money to switch my major. However, I'm very knowledgeable about technology, have been writing code for personal use most my life, and am at least competent in a handful of languages. Not to brag, but I have an impressive resume otherwise (full ride scholarship to this top school along with a handful of non-profit social work internships) but relatively no university education/experience outside of AVR programming for the robotics competitions.

Any advice/warnings? Is it even likely I could find a decent paying job fresh out of college without a CS major or will I just be laughed out of interviews? Will I be throwing away anything by not using my (fairly prestigious) neuroscience degree?"

Does anyone have a sample technical report for Programmers that you can send me for reference?

My googlefu is showing up a lot of different formats and i'm pretty confused whether google's results apply for a programming report?

hlq54,1,2011-05-27,Have you ever been arrested for installing software?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hlq54/have_you_ever_been_arrested_for_installing/,"Super long story made not quite as long:

I worked as the Senior Systems/Network Administrator for a company for almost 5 years.  The company had 75 employees and 3 in IT: Director of IT, Me, and the Helpdesk/Configuration Technician (and technically two more IT ""interns"" - one was a web developer and the other was the nephew of the owner).  When I started, there were no Group Policies, no controls on equipment or software installs, and everything was basically an ""honor system"".  I got things locked down without being too intrusive.  Part of my day was testing software and patches before rolling out to the general employees.

The IT force (Director, helpdesk, interns, and myself) would play jokes on one another during absences - if the director would go on vacation we would foil his office, or when the interns would go on vacation we'd change their profiles and passwords etc.  They had never ""gotten"" me.  To make sure my record would stay intact, I installed some encryption software on my workstation PC.

During last year employed there, I requested and was given a 2 week vacation. On my way out the door, the IT director asked for my password and I gave it to him.  Halfway through the vacation - when I was out of the country - I received a phone call asking for the password.  The last day of my vacation I received a call from the owner saying the company was ""moving in a different direction"" and that I would no longer be employed there.

When filling out unemployment benefits, my form was rejected because the company stated I was fired due to violation of the company conduct handbook.  That ""installing encryption software without informing anyone in management of the password"" led to my termination.

Fast forward 18 months - The local police arrested me for Computer Tampering.  Basically the law reads that if you install any software, or alter the computer in any way - without permission - that you're in violation of this law.  I don't disagree that I installed the encryption software.  Apparently I'm allowed to install any number of software titles - and even reformat the workstation several times (XP was on there 3 different times, then Vista a couple times) - but if you encrypt you must be a criminal.

Now when you google for my name you can find ""arrested for computer tampering"" pages.  That'll make finding a new job much more difficult.

So yeah, I was arrested for doing my job and testing software."
hlalx,7,2011-05-27,Computer Engineering or Computer Science?,doubledecker73,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/hlalx/computer_engineering_or_computer_science/,"Hello Engineers of Reddit!

I am currently a sophomore Computer Engineering major and am currently debating whether to stay in my major or switch to computer science. This is partially due to my change of interests and concern about my GPA, but I really am not sure what I should do. 

Right now my GPA isn’t so great (2.5). I am also a student athlete in a highly touted program, which takes a lot of my time, but my education is still very important to me. So far I’ve taken mostly core engineering classes, a lot of which are EE classes on circuit theory and analysis, which I really don’t enjoy. My professors haven’t been stellar in those classes, but I am just not enjoying them either (I usually eek out Cs in those).  My computer engineering classes, which have mostly been intro classes and on programming microcontrollers I do enjoy much more (usually Bs). Computer Science has always been my thing, and I find it really easy to understand, so I usually get As in those classes. 

I’ve always had an interest in robotics, and really like programming microcontrollers and working with systems similar to that, which is why I chose Computer Engineering. I’ve had computer science internships for three summers now and enjoy programming.  I am not entirely sure what I want to do when I graduate, but I feel a Comp. Engineering degree gives me more options. My concern is my GPA, and how much that will effect me getting jobs.  Also a Comp. Science degree is a BS, not an engineering degree, which I think will also change job possibilities.  I’m a crossroads and not sure what I should do. Any help is greatly appreciated

**TL;DR I’m a soph. computer engineering major with a 2.5 GPA and thinking of switching to computer science. Is it worth getting a BS instead of an engineering degree and hopefully graduating with a higher GPA?**

Last spring, I graduated with an English degree (mistake).  I really didn't apply myself in college, and while I graduated with a decent GPA, I didn't know what I wanted to do while I was in school, and English just worked at the time.  I now know what I want to be doing, and I know that my degree does not prepare me to do it.  I also got a minor in Telecommunications, but again, I didn't take classes that challenged me, and what I learned won't help me in the future.  

I would really like to go into media policy analysis and research.  My undergraduate university has a great public affairs program, solid coursework in Telecom &amp; I believe I could go on to create an individualized concentration for my graduate coursework.  The thing is, even though I know it will be a lot to take on financially, I would like to do it all over again - even the classes I've already taken (if I can improve my grades).  I want to do things 100% this time.  

What I want to do, is go back and get a bachelors in public affairs, re-do my minor in Telecom (with relevant coursework), and go directly into the graduate program from there.  So, I'm looking at about 6-6.5 years before I am done - I am 23 now.  I also believe that I would be more marketable for internships in my field by taking the time to learn the necessary skills.  I would be up for summer coursework, slaving away for my loans, anything, because I know that I would be working towards something I am truly passionate about (my media processes &amp; effects class was one of the few classes I was excited about in all of my undergrad).

In the mean time, I will be living at home and trying to save as much money as I can.  I am potentially looking to move to the state the school is in to work and try and establish residency to help with the cost.

Has anyone done something like this?  I probably sound really crazy, but this is what I am passionate about, and I should have figured it out sooner (I know), but now I want to go back and get started.  Is it even possible to be a freshman again if I already have a degree from the school?  I will be talking to an advisor in the program I want to be in, but I just wanted to bounce some ideas off people.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

P.S. the reason for not going directly into a graduate program is because I do not feel that I have the skills or educational background to be successful.  I really want to learn and I feel that ""re-doing"" my undergrad is the best bet for this.

EDIT: TL/DR - I got a degree in something that won't help me do what I want to do, going to grad school now doesn't make sense (I don't have the skills).  I want to ""re-do"" my undergrad &amp; go to grad school from there.  Any advice?"

I got into journalism by chance, but I enjoyed it and did well enough that I stayed in. Got good grades and great internships, and I'm waiting to hear details of a job offer later this week.

But for about the last year and a half, I've become less satisfied with job prospects in journalism, and more concerned about salary, career growth, and the future of the industry. It's not that I didn't know about all this earlier, but as graduation got closer it all became much more tangible to me. So now I'm considering immediately returning to school for a second bachelor's in something with a better future outlook, likely computer engineering or computer science.

Coincidentally, my parents are moving up to my college town, so I'd be able to live with them and cut down on living expenses, and not have to worry so much about having part-time jobs, etc. My student loan debt is fairly negligible (approx. $17K), and by doing this I figure I would about double it.

Is it a good idea to go back to school for something I think I'll enjoy and that will bring me better job security?"
