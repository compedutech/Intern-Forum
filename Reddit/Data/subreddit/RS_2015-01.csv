I did, and I was told to do this one online coding test. It seemed like something they use to weed out people before they interview them for an internship. I wont divulge the exact questions here, but essentially I had to fix bugs in code, and they were simple fixes, usually 1 line fixes. I got 20 minutes to do 7 questions, however on the first question I kind of blanked out for a few minutes, and I couldn't find the bug. I refocused, and turned my attention to the other questions. I was able to successfully  fix the bugs in the 6 other questions to make the test cases pass, but I still wasn't able to solve the bug in the first question, and then the time ran out. I suspect it was probably something really simple that I stupidly overlooked. I can't help but think that missing that one question will cause them to weed me out and not go further with the interview process, because there's probably a bunch of other people that they gave the test to that got all of them right. Should I be worried? Has anyone else taken the online test from amazon?"

Thanks

Some background: I'm currently a second year computer engineering student at UBC. Me and my family will be in HK for at least half of the summer(If I get an internship i'll likely be there the entire summer) so I would ideally like to work in HK rather than like 2 months in Vancouver and 2 months in HK which is rather difficult to find.

The rest of my family is in the medicine/healthcare field, and mostly in Vancouver so I really have no idea what to look for or where to look for an internship in Hong Kong. Once again, Thanks so much

edit: Oh and I have HK citizenship, so that's not a problem"
2qzjln,1,2015-01-01,Applied mathematics major here. Questions...,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2qzjln/applied_mathematics_major_here_questions/,"Hi, I'm currently a sophomore at the university of Washington going into applied mathematics (discrete math and algorithms option). I'm doing this right now in case I don't get into the cs program, but I really love the applied math so far anyways. First, will I likely be able to get a software engineering career with this major? Also, there are some things the amath program doesn't cover at all, or not enough. I've come up with my own list - 

Relational databases like PostgreSQL

Scripting Lang. Python,ruby, php, etc. one or more

Linux command line 
Shell scripting 

Big O notation

Java, C/C++

I will use Java and C++ a lot in this major, at least some linux and Python. Idk if we'll do any shell scripting though. And I'm pretty sure we won't work with relational databases, but idk. So I plan to start teaching myself PostgreSQL soon. Then I want to teach myself Python I think. Also big o notation of course because I don't think that's covered either. I plan to take at least one basic web design course which we'll use php and Javascript, but ideally I want a career working on backend stuff. 

What do you guys think? Add more to my list? Learn more than one scripting language? 

Here's a link to my major too. All of the required courses for my option (discrete math and algorithms) are listed with descriptions. 
http://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/acms.html


I just want to make sure I have enough under my belt to get a job after I graduate! 

Also, when is a good time to apply for an internship and do you have any advice on landing one? 

Thanks!"

Maybe there's just a lot of anxiety and uncertainty going on right now and it's overwhelming me.

I went to my girlfriend's last night for New Year's Eve. We were going to walk around outside for a bit but it was cold so we decided to stay in. Figured we would just watch tv in bed or something simple like that, until her roommate knocked and stated that we were going to a party. We. Not even asking - it was a we're going, and you're coming. That triggered an hour of me rolling around and whining, telling my girlfriend that I refused to go. Eventually I gave in and agreed that we would at least say hi, until my girlfriend came up with an alternate plan that pretty much saved the day. So last night ended up okay.

Though it's also one of my best friends' birthdays coming up, and he was wanted to know if I was going to his little get together. The ~10 people he invited is a little higher than what I'm normally comfortable with, but they're all good people I'm friends with (two of them are my roommates...) so I did consider it. Except there's eating involved, so I said no. 

He seemed fine with it, but I felt bad. And really - opting out just because they're eating? I was also asked if I wanted to go out for dinner tonight and said no again, for the same reason.

I feel terrible, saying no to all these things. I actually usually don't mind people that much, it's just that I have an urge to hide from the world right now. And the eating thing. Ever since I was little it's been hard for me to eat with people. My stomach just shuts down and if I try to force food down I either need a ton of people water or I'll feel like I'll throw up. It's led to a lot of anorexia jokes which I shrug off, but a few years ago I started showing signs of IBS and now I pretty much refuse to eat outside of people's homes. (Though there was one year - my first year of college - where I managed to get over this, and could actually eat with people in the dining halls. I don't really know how I did it...I spent first semester eating by myself at odd hours 95% of the time but second semester I was relatively social)

I'm sure this is adding to the anxiety too - I'm starting an internship in a few days. I'm excited and not too anxious about working itself (sleeping and waking early is gonna suck though), it's...eating that scares me. Apparently this company constantly provides free food, which is great! Except I assume this means people mostly eat together, and I'll get odd looks if I run off to eat at my desk, like I used to do. But we'll see how that works out...

I guess one last thing - for Christmas, my sister got us tickets to a hockey game. I love hockey and I'm grateful for the present, but there's definitely a bit of anxiety there, as there always is when I go to a social occasion. It's like two months away, but it's still been weighing heavily on my mind :|

I don't really know where I'm going with this, just needed to get it off my chest I guess. Or if anyone has tips to help deal with the eating thing, that would be great. No idea why I've never really sought help for it before...

(I also feel really bad for my girlfriend, having to put up with all my shit...)"

I started off wanting to have a career in backend and client-side software development, but sometime last year I changed focus towards front-end stuff.

I applied for an internship with a company a few months ago and it was the first interview I ever had. I felt like I said all the wrong things and mentioned skills that weren't even applicable because I was nervous about not knowing enough.

Recently, I've been trying to work on whatever cool things I think of (most recently, learning about JSON to work with a game's API for a simple web app) so I can build up experience on my own, but my side projects never get finished and I feel like I'm overwhelmed by what I want to do.

When I was growing up I wasn't socialized very well. I never invited anybody to the house. People called me bad things. So I get into the best university in the state. My parents helped me with an apartment. Midway through the business degree I wasn't liking the team projects. I started to get sad because I was always off campus and didn't know how to have a social life. I change to economics and start taking science and language classes, partly on the advice of a counselor. I also got prescribed meds which I took for a month. Looking back, I shouldn't have gone to the counselor or the psych. At the end I graduated in just under five years and never took a quarter off. I had a handful of dropped classes. I only had one unpaid internship that is kind of like a joke. Looking back I just needed to take a and have a break and get my social life in order.

I didn't get a job after graduation. I didn't really do anything for a year except for climbing. Then I taught abroad for a couple years. This was where I made what I feel like were my best friends. I should have tried to stay there and make a life. I was going out with girls but I didn't do anything with them because I didn't realize that the girl waits for the guy to get interested. That is something I regret a lot.

I came back to the US and tried to be a teacher. I didn't get in and then I went to Asia. I'm back in the US now. I'm trying to get into accounting, but it feels like I'm in too deep of a whole. I feel like people don't want to see a job hopper or a guy who has a bad transcript. It honestly feels like if I don't make it in the next couple of years that I'll have to leave the US for good. I don't really want to teach.

I kind of wish that I had gone from high school to the military and learned how to support myself and pay for my studies. Or I wish that I had gone to a community college and worked. My parents supported me through college. I had a library job for a year before I got sad and quit it. I didn't understand how bad it would look to not have a job during college. It also looks like I should have gone straight into a master's degree in business after college. It's better to do it then instead of at 30. It feels like all of this was because of my bad decisions and indecisiveness. I feel a lot of shame. Shame about my work history and about my transcript. Right now I'm unemployed. I'll try to apply for a master's and work for the government like my parents. It seems like wasted opportunities though."

I suppose I need to convince a university professor to accept me as his assistant so that I can help with him on the field he is working on? 

I guess if a professor accept my application, his university provide necessary paparwork so I could get a student visa?

How are the chances of getting accepted? Do I have to be exceptional?

In mid-november I had the police called on my dorm due to marijuana-smell (had walked in after smoking past an RA), I'm a medical patient and it's nothing I haven't dealt with before but the school has now deemed me a ""problem resident"" and any RAs or police can just come in my room without knocking if they suspect it smells (I don't even smoke in the dorms, but tons of people in my side of the hall do and I get blamed now).

It isn't that big of a deal but it really makes me feel insecure living there. I've filed complaints with the dean and such but I've pretty much been told it's my own fault and to deal with it.

To make matters worse I just found out today that I've lost my on-campus IT job because I never re-applied for the winter semester which I had no idea I had to do. I was so caught up with finals and everything that I somehow missed the information on this. What kind of job even makes you re-apply for your own job that you've been working? So this next semester I'll be even more broke than I was the last...

I'm down home for break right now where I have a full-time IT internship which I love doing and I couldn't be happier and I make decent money. The thought of spending another few months in classes and the dorms broke just sounds awful. My parents are highly against taking any time off and I haven't brought it up to them yet but I really think if I spent the next semester working down here it'll help me figure out what I want to do and get back into the mindset for college.
I could even spend the next few months working on some IT certifications which I've been wanting to do for awhile but haven't had time, my job has a ton of resources and will even pay for any certs I want to get.

I could really use some advice here.

I just finished a double major in Finance and Computer Science at my university a few weeks ago and I feel 100% unprepared to interview in any computer science capacity.  While I also have the finance degree, my real passion lies with CS (specifically iOS Development). The classes I took mainly just covered C#, VB, HTML/CSS, and some iOS Development independent studies. None of them covered large projects or advanced programming. I did really well in all my CS classes but as I'm browsing job postings I do not feel qualified for any of these positions. I look at sample coding interviews and just feel completely lost.

I have a small portfolio of projects in C#, Obj-C, and Swift but nothing impressive. I also did a finance internship about 2 years ago where I ended up doing a lot of VB and macro development for the company and I am 1/4 through a Swift course.

My question is what should I do now? I need a job pretty quickly and geographically I could go anywhere. I don't really have any commitments keeping me in place. Should I pursue a temporary job in finance until I can put together an impressive portfolio? Or will that hurt a future career in CS? Should I just start applying and interviewing even though I really don't see that being successful? Any advice would be extremely appreciated. "

My mind was kind of set until today. 

So I have some general Ed credits from a few years back and have gotten into development heavily this last year. Got the big 4 down of course. Studying php and sql now and decided why not go back and take the two semester needed to earn a degree. But I found out today my college has a few different options than it did 5 years ago. So now I have to make a choice because one class this semester has to be a degree requirement. 

My end goal is to either be sys admin. Or in a security field. I have years of pc tech and i.t. Behind me but once I started coding I fell in love. So maybe I'm more open ended to where I end up as long as it's part of creating something beautiful and useful in web or maintaining/working towards future softwares and infrastructure for the web. 

So my question is what would YOU choose and why. I'm curious about those who went the wrong route and had a difficult time. Or those who took an unorthodox path to a certain position. Also those who don't have degrees what field are you in and what degree would have helped best. 

 Options are all within 3 credit differences so not much there. I have the choice between 

-Computer informations system technologies. Formerly system technologies and the default for un specialized CompSci majors at this school. 

-Information securities 1 or 2. Two has an extra cert and a semester of internship and labs I believe. Hands on work. 
-network systems technician 

-sys support specialist

-web dev

-web page dev (same as above just with a summer of classes based on a big build of your own and outsourced help extra certs. Received)

I know many who are successful devs without college and are incredible. But I have the opportunity and time fortunately and feel it's a big tool to help build a career. 

Also this sub kicks ass. In a year it's helped me go from ""I cAn make sites"" by that I mean blogger themes and copy paste, to having a working knowledge of multiple languages and softwares. You've been a massive pool of knowledge and information that carved this chance to learn what I love.

So I'm an aspiring reality TV producer and I'm about to graduate next semester. I was just looking for some criticism/help with the content of my resume.
Some things to note - 

-not worried about formatting, just the content/information in my resume
-I left out specific details like schools, locations, etc. For obvious reasons
-this resume helped me land a pretty cool internship in the TV industry that I start in February
-it is one page, I copied and pasted because I'm on my cell phone

I just figured I would throw this up here for some constructive criticism. I want to make sure my resume is as close to perfect as I can get it before I start sending it around. Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance.

I have a 2.5 GPA which I don't list for obvious reasons. 

I applied for about 15 internships on Indeed just to see what happened and got 6 responses. A very high response rate based on what I hear from other people.

I thanked all the recruiters for their email/phone call, added their contact information to this ""recruiter contact information"" spreadsheet I keep, and basically told them I was going to consider their company in the future because my intention was just to see if my resume was getting any bites. 

I am definitely not ready to commit to anything yet so at least now I know my resume and experience is good enough to get me an interview.

Question: Should I apply for everything that interests me and disregard this 3.0 GPA requirement I am seeing all the time or am I wasting my time applying for positions that require a 3.0 or higher GPA?


Thanks in advance!

2r8lod,1,2015-01-03,Am I still a sys admin?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2r8lod/am_i_still_a_sys_admin/,"I work for an SMB that has around 220 employees across two offices, 100 servers hosted by an MSP, and 10 servers in house.  I am one of four techs, I have a title of Sr. Systems Administrator, they are all Systems Engineers but outrank me.  I started off doing help desk, slowly taking on more and more responsibilities.  As my help desk responsibilities grew, I also tried to take on sys admin duties.  I have implemented better backup and retention strategies, done some power she'll automation of menial tasks, do server builds, do production break/fix, reccomend ways to improve our environment. 

 
It was all going well until recently.  The company is growing so fast that I am now only able to the HelpDesk part, which IMO should be a full time job in a company of my size.  The main issue is that the other techs don't do any help desk work, so I get *all of it*.


Now, I own 100% of HelpDesk which includes the following for both the local and remote office:


*workstation break/fix
*workstation deployments
*the deployment workbench
*all equipment purchasing
*inventory management
*active directory management and auditing
*the phone system
*the off network wifi
*new hires, transfers, terms
*help desk documentation
*maintain conference room equipment
*maintain cleanliness around the office in regards to IT equipment


In addition, I am expected to continue to do production break fix and production impacting projects.  The only saving grace is that I am not in the on-call rotation.


The boss knows how swamped I am, so his solution was to get me an intern.  This seemed like a good idea, but the job responsibilities of the position were vague.  Now that he is here, I find that I am the direct manager of the intern and that the intern is not to be given much permission to anything, so I still have to do a lot of the basic help desk tickets.  Example:  the intern has been forbidden access to our IT documentation or resources, can't do password resets in AD, isn't allowed a key to secure storage where the equipment is, etc. Now I find that the intern is helpful, but the time I was hoping to get back has gone into managing the intern and keeping him busy with tasks.


So here I am having a career identity crisis and not sure what to do about it.  Am I a sys admin or am I moving backwards in my career, when my goal is to become a rock star sys admin?"

One really stands out to me, and I would WAY rather spend my 16 month placement doing it versus any of the the others, which seem pretty bleak. I'm on a second degree and will be far more qualified for this particular job than most of my peers (I think). 

There will be more jobs posted through the coming semester, just the applications for this first wave are due tomorrow.

So the question is, if you were in my position, would you just apply to the one that you actually really want and hope for the best? Or apply to all 8 and risk getting an offer an one that you have no real interest in first. The reason this is even an issue, is that our internship program has like a 90% placement rate, so if I did apply to all, the odds are simply not in my favor that I would get any given one of my choice...

I study hard and I'm at an internship. I noticed a lot of the guys were talking amongst themselves one day so I went over to try to join and they said things like ""oh I'm sure you don't want to hear that"" ""ah I can't it's too horrible"" then I said ""no I've been on 4chan I've seen everything"" and from there I was included. I am the only female in that group. We do talk about the other girls in the office in an attractiveness way which I don't mind because I date women. At this internship I feel included and part of the group.

What about my next job? I have to wonder if all the guys at all my jobs will think like that: *we can't be ourselves around her because she might be an HR risk* even though I'm really not!

What am I to think? I watch Silicon Valley there are ZERO female programmers (all the girls provide SUPPORT functions), except one who pretends to write a puppy app. It becomes frustrating. I feel mad when I watch these shows. My friend and I study just as hard as our classmates yet on tv I see fucking idiots.

They can't make me see myself as anything less than I am, a person who is deeply passionate about IT. I'm more concerned that guys watch those shows then get ideas about what female techies are like then assume things like that I'm uptight, or worse - what these things actually portray! Computer Engineer Barbie, Silicon Valley, they all portray me as STUPID!  

How do I fit in? I don't want to not be invited to a bar after work or have everyone hush when I walk by the Keurig.

2raicb,8,2015-01-04,Just diagnosed and prescribed Adderall,theNextVilliage,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2raicb/just_diagnosed_and_prescribed_adderall/,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and only just today I was prescribed medication for the first time.

I was very initially resistant to the diagnoses. I've been seeing my therapist for well over 2 years now, and she has been suggesting that I get evaluated for ADHD for almost as long as I've known her. I have insisted that my problems with attention and ""dropping the ball"" (i.e., losing things, running late, etc.) are caused by anxiety. Eventually things got so bad that I finally relented and saw a doctor who specializes in ADHD. The doctor seemed quite convinced and told me she thinks I am a textbook case, noting that I came across as very fidgety and nervous. I'm now going to be on Adderall.

I think the main reason I have objected is that I like to think of myself as very hardworking (for example, I've worked full-time through college) which is in conflict with the admittedly uninformed image of ADHD I had in my head.

I've also never been all that terrible in school. I'm very naturally good at mathematics, I always won in Math Olympics, took differential and integral calc in high school through the community college and got the highest grades on the final hardly trying, and I will be graduating in just 2 months with my bachelor's in mathematics with excellent, near perfect grades in all my math and engineering classes. I got a coveted internship at a major tech company as a software engineer working in highly technical multi-threaded code where I make over 60k a year while still in undergrad, and my first job offers are coming in at 70k+ and I'm only 22. 

I'm also a painter and I've won a number of major and minor awards in art, and have had my work in multiple galleries and a museum, and I've even been able to make a few grand on the side from paintings. 

I started piloting planes at 15 and although I haven't had the money or time to fly recently, my point is, it's not as though I'm not functioning or that I'm not productive, in fact I think I do a lot.

Granted, outside of math &amp; engineering, and art, my grades have never been too great. Basically, if a class is lecture-based or includes any sort of tedious work, I won't do it. I skip most or often all of my lectures and show up for midterms or finals, a tactic which works well in my math classes because I can perform on the tests since math is not a skill that benefits much from studying or memorization, but in classes in which I can't get by without winging it I do not do well at all.

I feel a lot of dread and anxiety about meetings and lectures. If I can't get out of attending, like if a teacher bases a grade largely around attendance, I go crazy with anxiety leading up to the meeting or lecture. I hate the feeling of being trapped there and I'm so obnoxiously inattentive that I feel like I cause a scene. I get the same way with movies, so I avoid theaters altogether.

I also cannot juggle tasks like taxes, bills, etc. I have gotten so many parking tickets, I can't even count them. At least 4 dozen. And then I forget to pay them. I make great money, but I swear half of it goes to some kind of late fee or another.

I'm always late. One time I missed 3 flights in one day. I was a freshman in college and I was supposed to receive a medal for art in new york onstage at Carnegie Hall. I was all excited. On the day of, I simply forgot I was supposed to be somewhere. I got up nice and early and on my second cup of coffee I was sitting talking to my mother when it suddenly dawned on me that I was supposed to be in New York that day. I called and had to pay a large fee, but was able to have my flight rearranged for later that day. I made that flight, but then on the connection in Denver I missed my flight yet again because I mixed up time zones. On the return flight, I got the flights mixed up and managed to miss a total of 3 flights in the span of just over 24 hours. 

Just this last week we had a family reunion, so I had to fly in on my own. When I made it on time, my family all joked that it was my first time not missing a flight in my life and I now have a high streak of 1. I was too embarrassed to tell that that I actually did in fact miss my flight, but just got lucky that there was another one leaving right afterwards. The worst part was that I was sitting right there at the gate. They said they did a last call and called me by name twice, I don't know how I got so distracted.

So I guess I probably shouldn't be surprised, but I am. I never really considered that I had the disorder until I was diagnosed, and now all the sudden I'm going to be put on stimulants. I'm pretty nervous about the Adderall, what should I expect from it? If this is going to help me focus and stay on top of things, it's worth it, because I'm going to start grad school soon and I need help.

TL;DR, I'm an inattentive wreck, but arrogantly thought I was too high-achieving to be ADHD. I was just prescribed Adderall and I'm scared."

2rasbp,16,2015-01-04,How can I make the most out of 10 months to prepare myself to apply for an internship?,CS_noob_student,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rasbp/how_can_i_make_the_most_out_of_10_months_to/,"Hey guys, I am a first year computer science student in UK, and I have about 9-10 months before the applications for summer internships between the 2nd &amp; 3rd year start. I would like to prepare as much as possible to increase my chances, and I need advice on what to focus on. There are so many interesting things to learn, and while 10 months might seem like a lot, I am sure that they will fly by quickly, so I need to focus on something to actually be able to do anything of use after the 10 months (although techically I would have time until the end of the 2nd year, since that's when the internship starts, but I think it's the time of applying that matters, since that's when I'll be trying to sell myself and demonstrating my skills).

Even though I'm still a beginner, I do know some things and I guess telling you what my current level is will help you to help me choose what to focus on. So here's where I'm at now:

Programming language specific stuff:

- Reasonably comfortable with Java. Basically I know what they teach you in an introductroy OOP course: classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics etc. I also feel that I do not have to constantly look up the syntax and principles when doing something in Java.

- Some experience with C. Essentially I've read the first 7 chapters of a book called ""Head First C"" and feel like I'm comfortable with the material. I know that there is a stack and a heap, I understand how pointers work (function pointers as well) but would not necessarily be able actually do much with them due to lack of experience, I also kind of understand structs the malloc().

- Little experience with Haskell, just the first 6 chapters for ""Learn you a Haskell for Great Good"". Can't really do much with Haskell, but at least I'm not completely new to the functional programming paradigm.

- Little experience with computer organisation (or should I say digital circuits?). I understand how adders work (ripple carry and carry lookahead adders), some understanding of how memory works, negative numbers using two's complement and a bunch of other stuff. I don't think this will be useful in applying for an internship, but having some idea of what goes down the level of wires and switches makes me a little more comfortable with the computer.

- Little experience with MIPS assembly, greatest accomplishment is a recursive implementation of the Euclidean algorithm. Again, doubt this is useful, but good to know nonetheless.

- A long time ago I wanted to make my own website from scratch. I never achieved this, but in the process I learned some HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. I can't do anything with these right now, but I'm sure the re-learning these would be easy.


Other computer science stuff (mostly knowledge from coursera courses):

- Comfortable with some basic algorithms like mergesort,quicksort,BFS,Dijkstra. I know what dynamic programming is, but haven't done anything with it. Have a basic understanding of analysing complexity of algorithms. Also, completed the ""Algorithms: Design &amp; Analysis Part I"" coursera course (score: 93%).

- Coursera course: ""Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems"" with a score of 78.4%. I feel like I should go through the course again, to be able to actually make a simple app myself, and some of the course material was a little advanced for me (mainly the stuff on concurrency, since I know nothing about that), but I'm sure that in about 3-4 weeks from now I'll have my tasklist app ready.

- Coursera course: ""Cryptography I"" with score 100% (the scoring system was little weird on this, so this is way more than I deserve). I feel I understood most of the stuff in the course, but the material itself was more of a ""Here's what crypto is about"" -type, so it's not like I can actually do anything with this knowledge.

- Coursera course: ""Computer Networks"" with score 83.6%. Did this a long time ago, so I scarcely remember anything, but I remember feeling that I understood the material, and with a little revision could probably remember it all. The course was very theoretical and had no programming exercises, so I only know about the concepts and principles of networking, not how to use them.

- Coursera course: ""Automata"" with score 92% (with Distinction :D). Very theoretical course and most proofs were way over my head, but I learned a lot about finite automata, regular expressions, grammars and such (stuff about turing machines was a little too much for me). No idea how to use these concepts though.

- Coursera course: ""Machine Learning"" (the stanford one) with score 93.9%. With some more revision and practice I feel I might actually be able to apply the knowledge I gained from this course, since there were many programming exercises. I also feel that I understood most of the ideas behind the machine learning algorithms.


So that's about it as to what I know right now. I know I wrote a lot, but I just wanted to give you a clearer picture of where I am standing as a student. So, based on this, how do you think I should spend the next 10 months preparing to apply for an internship?"

So, here's what's up: I'm getting a dual degree in physics and computer science. I spent most of my summers developing myself as a person, rather than as a business asset, so my resume is a bit short. However, I used my last summer to intern for a mid sized company in their business analytics/business intelligence department, and I feel like I'd be interested in pursuing a job in business/data analysis. My CV isn't as fleshed out as some others in my graduating class who spent every summer interning and every semester working in a lab or something, but I feel like it is at least kinda decent, and I keep hearing about how CS skills are so in-demand, so I'm hopeful.

However, I got the internship by a complete fluke, and more than anything else, I want to move away from my flat-ass state and see mountains every day. So, I guess I'm asking - how do I find a job that is distant from where I live, while I'm still going to class? How do I figure out what companies would be interested in me? Just search job listings? Are those a dead end, or do they work for a student with a CS degree? How do I ask my employed friends if there are any openings in their companies without seeming like I'm using them? How much time should I be spending researching a company, writing a cover letter, and customizing my resume, when I could spend that time applying elsewhere or building my CV (or hell, destressing)? How much and how often should I follow up with a resume I send out?

Thanks to anyone who takes the time. It is much appreciated."
2rcmtm,1,2015-01-04,Thinking about transferring into engineering and I'm near the end of my current degree,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2rcmtm/thinking_about_transferring_into_engineering_and/,"(not sure if this a kosher place to post this)

So I've been doing a computer science degree with a business minor for the past three years and I'm pretty unhappy. I'm 22, have two terms of school left before I finish this degree and am seriously considering switching into engineering - I think materials looks pretty cool. 

I don't want to do an extra four years of school at this point, but my thinking is that if it's going to bring me longer term happiness and fulfilment then it's not a hard choice to make. Financially things would be tough but I know I could make make it work (I live in Canada, and it's not nearly as bad here).

My question for you guys is if you know anyone who's made a switch this late in their academic career and whether you think it'll be a tough transition to make. I'm doing fine academically and have built a pretty solid CS resume through a few internships but it's definitely not what I want to do. I'm thinking this experience could help me to transition to something in engineering.

My other option is to finish this degree and then go back for engineering, but in that scenario I would be in undergrad till I'm 28 which I would really like to avoid.

I'm 22, have two terms of school left before I finish this degree and am seriously considering switching into engineering - I think materials looks pretty cool.

I don't want to do an extra four years of school at this point, but my thinking is that if it's going to bring me longer term happiness and fulfilment then it's not a hard choice to make. Financially things would be tough but I know I could make make it work (I live in Canada, and it's not nearly as bad here).

My question for you guys is if you know anyone who's made a switch this late in their academic career and whether you think it'll be a tough transition to make. I'm doing fine academically and have built a pretty solid CS resume through a few internships but it's definitely not what I want to do. I'm thinking this experience could help me to transition to something in engineering.

My other option is to finish this degree and then go back for engineering, but in that scenario I would be in undergrad till I'm 28 which I would really like to avoid.

Any other suggestions/advice would be super helpful!"

2rcrsw,4,2015-01-04,Masters in Geology. Should i wait a year or go straight after undergrad?,bluegreywhite,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2rcrsw/masters_in_geology_should_i_wait_a_year_or_go/,"So, I'm currently a senior geology undergrad in my (hopefully) last semester and i have been approached by a professor in the department to join his group for my masters. I haven't discussed an exact thesis topic with him yet but he focuses on geomorphology and some archeology so i assume my topic would be in that general area.

I took 17 credits last semester along with a senior thesis and a part time job. It really burnt me out to the point that i'm just now starting to recover. Since i was so busy i didn't have the time to research and contact possible professors or even take the GRE's (hopefully in the next week). The fact that the professor has that much confidence in me is huge and i am trying to keep a level head and not take that for granted. But, there are a few major issues that i cant seem to make a decision on.

First, i don't know if geomorph/arch is exactly what i want to do as a career. I think that they are very cool topics and i think that id be able to keep my interest but i am wary of their job prospects (environmental consulting seems kind of boring as a career and i don't think archeological jobs are very abundant). In a perfect situation id like to do something related to planetary geology but seeing as i wont be able to visit another planet anytime soon i need to find something else. the prof that offered me the spot likes to used GIS and remote sensing so i might be able to use those skills to work my way into a planetary related job. How much does your masters thesis dictate your career choices? I understand that getting a masters in paleontology will not help you get a hydrogeology job but does geomorph give you an opportunity for O&amp;G, mining or other areas? Is it normal to go into a masters without a solidified thesis?

Second, i went to undergrad in my hometown. ive lived here for 22 years and am afraid that not leaving and living somewhere else is a huge missed opportunity and growing experience. On the other hand, if i stayed here i could live at home and put a huge portion of my stipend into savings. $30k in the bank after graduating with a masters would be pretty awesome... Does anyone have any advice on this situation??

Third, should i wait a till next year to apply to grad schools? 
The pros are that i can really dedicate time to researching and contacting professors, having more time to decide exactly what i want my thesis to be, get a couple internships (geocorps, nasa, etc) over the summer and fall, and maybe get a job for a couple months. 
While the cons are that i fear he wont have a spot in a year and then the whole ""ill never get into a grad school"" thought process starts up, it'll be another year until im done school (already at 5 for undergrad), what if i get a good job and dont want to return to grad school or become unprepared because ive been out of the school atmosphere for so long.

can anyone who has had to make similar decisions give me some advice from the other side? i feel like i am making way more out of this than i need to but i seem to over analyze all major decisions and don't know what to do because i need to let him know by the 15th of January.

Thanks!

EDIT: I wanted to thank everyone whose commented on this thread. Theres been a ton of helpful advice and different perspectives. Thanks!"

* **Budget range**: Ideally less than or about equal to 1200 with everything included (warranties/customer support plans, etc).  Cheaper is definitely better if possible.  

* **Purpose**: Mostly for schoolwork, notetaking during classes, research, etc., with some casual gaming and video-watching?  I hope this answers the question.  

* **Screen size preference**: About 13"", but that's flexible.  Just so long as I can carry it between classes.  

* **OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux)**: Windows or Mac.  I'm not a huge huge fan of Windows 8, but I tend to be grumpy about new things before adjusting, so it would probably be fine -- the touchscreen might actually be nice for notetaking.  

* **Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings)**: I'd like to be able to do Portal, Goat Simulator, run GBA/DS/Gamecube emulators, shit I find on Steam, etc.

* **Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.)**: No major requirements.

* **Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support)**: Crying hysterically and posting on Reddit?  May be able to get some help from college library.

* **Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility)**: I'm familiar with Macs and I've seen people at my internships, etc. struggle with compatibility, but I also feel like they're a little overpriced and I haven't been thrilled with tech support in the past.  I also like the wider range of programs available for PCs.  Lenovos seem to be nice but I'm flexible idk

* **Any particular style that you like (examples are great)**:  Anything that isn't ugly is good.  I'm a fan of ""sleek"" and compact sorts of looks (shiny silver kinda like the chrome Macbooks or smooth black like Lenovos) but I also love weird colors or whatever.  Mostly not clunky would be my preference.


**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)**

* **Long battery life -vs- Low weight**: Balanced.

* **Build quality -vs- Low price**: Build quality.

* **Low noise/heat -vs- High performance**: Balanced


**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* **High resolution screen**: Ehh, probably not?

* **A great keyboard**: Maybe.  I have smallish hands and it's annoying to type on some keyboards.  

* **A great touchpad/mouse buttons**: I don't think so.

* **Great audio**: No.

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)

I can't think of anything.  Durability matters a lot, though, and ongoing customer support is A+.  

I've been considering the 13"" Lenovo Yoga 2.  Potentially, I could do a Macbook Pro 13"" with retina display and the Apple Care options appeal to me, but even with the student discounts, it's pricier than I really want it to be.  Help me, SAL?"
2rdg41,230,2015-01-05,Human Driving,LeewardNitemare,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2rdg41/human_driving/,"[Excerpt from the Mecetti Prime Gazette translated to human units based on your location.] 

Dear readers, firstly: the Public Safety Column would like to issue a correction to last [week’s] piece about precautions to take around the Rainbow Beetles of Yt’vva. We erroneously printed that Rainbow Beetles are attracted to the color blue and repulsed by the color red. This is unfortunately incorrect. The beetles are repulsed by blue and attracted to red. We apologize for any inconvenience or health hazards that may have been caused by this error. But in the column’s defense the intern who collected the data on the beetles is a Parltrix and they are red/blue colorblind. 

Now dear readers having cleared the air of that small slight, we can move on to the topic at hand, which is (predictably and once again) Humans. Specifically this letter from Wuuo-Wiieeaa of Deemo III, Primary School #1471:

&gt;My fwiend says that his older bwother in the awmy told him that Humans dwive their own wehicles instead of letting AIs dwive, but I say nu-uhh! [sic]

Well I think that we can all agree that driving is an inherently dangerous task, so much so that more than 99.994% of all land vehicles in the Greater Galactic Core are commanded by semi-intelligent programming, or slaved to a city grid master-network. This is good, because the excessive ‘fastway’ speeds of [30kph] can result in terrible and often lethal injuries in the event of collisions, and we can hardly trust massive, fast, dangerous vehicles in the hands of individuals. After all, we biological creatures have reaction times.

Humans, of course, reject these sensible ideas seemingly as a matter of principle. “After all,” a Human might say, “what are we if not crazier and living more dangerously than everyone else?” Before they developed self-driving cars with ‘AIs,’ humans drove their own vehicles. Not content to move along at reasonable speeds, Humans would regularly pilot their vehicles at speeds often in excess of [100kph]! And this continued for more than a century before they started widespread adoption of self-driving vehicles, and that was mostly motivated out of capitalist greed than any real concern for safety. 

“But Hal’Tol!” I hear you cry, “certainly they would have had accidents, and wouldn’t these collisions tear their bodies to shreds!” Yes, dear reader, they certainly did have collisions, and many Humans did die. But even more Humans survived these crashes. Their durable bodies combined with a hilariously misplaced attempt at “safety” saved many Human lives. Where we would sensibly drive slower, or let computers handle the task; most Humans instead insisted that their vehicles protect them better in the event of ridiculously high speed collisions. Go figure. 

Nowadays, on their more developed planets and colonies most Humans do not drive themselves. Instead relying on AIs that hurtle them hither and yon many times faster than even the most reckless safety standard set by us Core races. On their frontier worlds, the story is different, and many Humans pilot their own vehicles with great abandon through the rough terrain and undeveloped towns that they live in. And of course, there are the myriad sporting events everywhere they live that involve driving at an appreciable fraction of the speed of sound, such as F1, E1, and NASCAR, and events that aren’t quite as fast (relative to the incomprehensible speeds of the other events) but are significantly more dangerous, like Rallying. But most worrying of all to this humble correspondent is their suicidal activity known as the Motorcycle Grand Prix; which is like F1 racing in every way except that the vehicles have only two wheels. Seriously dear readers, take a look on the Human sports nets some time and be amazed at the pure outlandishness of it all.

So in a way, young Wuuo-Wiieeaa and their friend are both correct, most humans don’t drive, but the ones that do are crazy enough for it to count for the rest of them.

However, regardless of what Humans are doing on their far away worlds, I urge you all to stay safety conscious at all times while in and around vehicles and remember that you are thankfully not humans. If you need to get to your destination quicker please take the MagVac-Tram. 

Stay safe dear readers,

-Hal’Tol Valkin, Public Health Correspondent, Mecetti Prime Gazette

2rdyu9,1,2015-01-05,Help with return offer!,throwitovertherainbo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rdyu9/help_with_return_offer/,"Hi all. Looking for general advice on how to get a return offer... I have an internship lined up with my dream company and I really don't want to screw up. Last summer I interned with a shitty company but bore with it for the experience. Long story short I think the company really regretted hiring me as an intern and that's lowering my confidence in getting a return offer this summer. 

In the previous internship I had to do webdev which I have never done before which probably caused the problems to be mentioned...I'm open to learning and was actually quite excited about the opportunity, and I did try really hard. I was never late to work, I never stayed super late but I thought it was alright because I was an intern, and for the most part I got my assignments done on time (except for one huge exception see below)... **but after the internship I contacted my manager for a recommendation letter and she never responded...** I know she checks her e-mail almost everyday and she never missed any of my other e-mails while I was interning over the summer... and below are the following reasons why I think I ""screwed up"" my previous internship...

**1. I asked too many questions.** I tried really hard to overcome my own questions... but after spending hours on google and stackoverflow sometimes I just couldn't figure it out and thinking back I probably asked way too many questions. I was really unfamiliar with web development and struggled. I tried to strategically bundle my questions up in one...but it turned out to be question after question...

**2. I couldn't finish one project.** I worked on a variety of things... but there was this one project I couldn't finish. It involved tools I *and* my mentors never used before... so I was struggling for a week and got nothing done. In the end the project was handed over to the existing dev (that didn't know how to use the tools either), and he got mentorship from the dev lead (which I didn't really have access to due to various reasons)... plus the dev had years of experience with similar tools before and got the job done. At the time I didn't feel too bad for not finishing, but I did waste a week or so and now I'm worried the same scenario will play out in the future... 

**3. HR really didn't like me** I was ordered to run errands for the HR people...I was really reluctant to doing so since I was hired as a software dev... but no one seemed to say otherwise so I did as I was told. Once I messed up on a food order...and the person wasn't very happy with me... I also paid for the food out of my own pocket, and later on naively asked for the money back and the HR person said he was too busy... so I kept (naively believed he was really just busy) asking, and eventually he reluctantly paid me out of the change he had in his pocket... 

Thinking more about it makes me really afraid that I wouldn't get a return offer. I don't know what I'll be working on yet, so what if I had to learn new tools and end up asking too many questions or waste time spinning in circles by myself again? Also what if I meet a similar HR employee like above? What should I do if I don't get along with my team members?

I thought I would be suited for the job but now my confidence level is just really low...I even think the interviews I had for this internship are just flukes and there was a mistake processing my application.

Advice? Tips?"
2re5gy,4,2015-01-05,Seeking advice on how to proceed with my situation (CS senior student),just_me__,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2re5gy/seeking_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with_my/,"Hello, 

I'm a senior student studying computer science, and I'll be finishing with the university on on September tops. 

**What follows is an introduction on what I have learned so far.** 

During the 4.5 years I've been studying, the first 1.5 years, I had in conjunction with the uni, my English courses for proficiency in English. 

In general, my department, is said to be the best in computer science amongst the other institutions/universities of Greece, and it's a very demanding curriculum, as well. 

There many projects in each of the programming courses, and also other assignments for the other courses, that take up most of my time. 

We've mainly used C, so I can say that I'm pretty confident with it.
But I've also, worked on OOP projects (C++ mainly, Java and Python). 

**Listing of some projects I've developed as assignments:** *(and what I've learned)*  

**[A]** We've also had a Java EE project - that had to do with listing of houses for leasing or selling (sth like airbnb, but a really simpler form).  
With this project I've learned:  
1. A general idea of how the whole container idea (no main function) of Java EE  
2. Using an ORM (hibernate)   
3. Using and configuring Apache Tomcat  
4. A little bit insight with maven  
5. Java Server Faces and Java Beans  


**[B]** Another big (team) project we had -  sth like a final year project, was to build a reverse search engine (it was a simplified version of sigmod contest).   
With this one, I've worked with these concepts:  
1. Multi-threaded programming (thread pool) // had already created another multithreaded application (look below)   
2. Working in a team of three people   
3. Using svn (have started using VCS with git and I'm using it mainly for my other repos/projects)   
4. Using valgrind to eliminate errors and memory leaks  
5. Using helgrind to trace a deadlock problem  
6. Created a bitmap for fast lookups  
7. How much more performance you can get with using multithreaded programmes and that the optimization flags on gcc matter a lot :-P 


**[C]** Another interesting project was a filesync application in C again, with which I've learnt these concepts:  
1. Multithreaded programming   
2. Producers consumers   paradigm for the thread pool  
3. Using mutexes and conditional variables  
4. Socket programming, for sending the data over the network and also, using the loop back port for IPC  
4. This project was the reason I created a doubly linked list API with void pointers and it's one of the projects that I'm proud of, although I probably shouldn't as its a trivial one (?). 

**[etc]** We've also doubled in AI using python, and created a solver for the Alien Tiles problem using heuristic functions. 

**[Other details]**  

I'm **currently** working on my thesis, (using python) which has to do with lossy compression techniques on tabular data. 

I've been always fascinated with FOSS, but haven't actually made a good contribution such as bug hunting, only some bug reports. 


---------------------------------------------

Regarding a **master** program, I am sure that I want to enroll in one and I will. 
The choices are: my department or preferably a master's degree in USA, or Europe, but the two later options are more difficult to achieve as the fees are quite high (hoping for some scholarship). 
My current GPA is 8/10.

---------------------------------------------

In the following year, I 'll probably have to serve my country -  although I'm not that excited on ""losing"" 9 months of my life. 
This time would be better spent in an internship. 

---------------------------------------------

**[The problem]**  

I feel like I don't have anything to show for, and this is really frustrating as I try really hard for my university, and also, I greatly enjoy software engineering and software design. 

**N.B.:** For each of the programming projects, I've had really positive feedback from my instructors, which is something good. 

How do you think I should proceed?  
A. Publish some of the university projects after I polish them a little bit  

B. Ensure that my algorithmic and data structure skill are good  

C. Start working with a FOSS project   

(i) in one of the languages I know well -  haven't found a project that I enjoy  
(ii) start working with atom editor, since I find it a project with a lot of acceptance and a big user base - but haven't actually used node js framework so far.  

D. Start looking for an internship  

E. Sth else, please don't hesitate to recommend!   

**TL;DR**  
Senior student here, feeling frustrated that I probably don't have anything to show for, although I'm vastly passionate about software engineering and doing good with my curriculum. 
How should I proceed? (look above) 


**Thank you very much for your time and sorry for the really long post.** 

Happy new year everybody!

I got a job as an internal auditor based on the strength of my computer knowledge.  What was that knowledge?  Oh, I knew how to use Lotus 123, I had my own computer at home, I had programmed macros on some of the dumb terminals we used, I knew how to fix a mouse by pulling out the ball and cleaning inside, and I installed my own CD drive in my home computer, I even set the dip switches, and I could even do a little BASIC.

Not a very impressive resume.  But it was enough to get hired and become an officer of the bank (big deal for me).  So my new boss (call her Kris) decided to send me to a UNIX security workshop.  I told her that was probably out of my depth.  Nonsense, she replied, I know so much about computers.  So needless to say I was just lost at this thing and the UNIX security thing she sent me to in NYC.  We didn't even use UNIX and we had specialized auditors who handled audits for it.

Kris was very clueless in many things but very much so with technology.  I became her front line tech support.  I did the basic troubleshooting and that fixed most things.

Then came the migration from our current mail client to Lotus Notes.  IT told everyone to forward any important emails to their new address.  I sent the dozen or so I needed and called it a day when Kris called me into her office. 

She had spent 10 hours the previous day forwarding herself every email in her archive.  She wanted me to find a way to do it faster. In the mean time she had her intern forwarding mail for her.  So I go to IT.  

I had a pretty good rapport with the IT guys because the group was small and I didn't call until I had done basic troubleshooting.  In my previous job I did the same for my group.  I ask for a way for her to send emails faster.  The IT guy refuses because they don't want people to save a ton of mail.  He admits he could shift it all over for her but then everyone will want it.  I ask if there is a way he could put a macro together that can just move more than one at a time.

So he sets one up that moves 10 at a time.  Kris was so damn happy.  Only took her a week to move all her shit.

Fast forward to after the transition.  Kris can't figure out what any of her emails or who they are from because they are all from herself and all have a subject of ""to archive"" thanks to the macro.  So she wasted 5 work days to save what was now worthless to her.

edit: to follow Rule 1 regarding the bank I worked for."

2rf6tm,1,2015-01-05,Am I actually qualified for this job?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rf6tm/am_i_actually_qualified_for_this_job/,"* Sorry for the wall of text upfront!

I was a 1st semester freshman in the CS program at my University, browsing craigslist looking at jobs. I stumbled upon an internship, to which I applied, feeling greatly unqualified as I had been programming for only 3 months (intro java class). I got an interview, and surprisingly got the job. They told me it was mostly due to the large breadth of technology I knew or at least touched, along with my personality. 

I started and immediately loved it. I worked about 15 hours my first semester, with working full time in the summer. I loved working way more than school. I started a few side projects that I got to play with some new tech that I just didn't get to use at work. (Stuck with Struts 1.3, Java 6, Supporting IE6 where I work now) The next 2 semesters I worked closer to 25 hours a week, taking minimal credits. Early this past summer, a full-time employee left, and I joked to my boss about working full time. Long story short, I switched majors to Information Systems Technology, which is available completely online. So now I was a full-time and still barley going to school (6-9 credits) I felt slightly under-paid at about $42k in the Midwest. I understood I didn't have a degree yet though.

Just recently however, I was browsing Craigslist again, as I do frequently just to get a feel of the current job market in my area. I stumbled upon an ad for a ""Senior Software Developer"" that looked awesome. All new tech, including AngularJS (which I used in a side project and love!). I applied, barely expecting an email back saying ""No thanks"". Well, I ended up with a phone interview with their lead developer, who loved me. He asked mostly technical questions and I think I answered them all really well. They are now flying my across the country to interview at the main office (not where I'll be working). 

I'm super excited for the opportunity (should they officially offer!). I'm scared of a few things:

* The position I applied for is a ""Senior"" software developer. I would consider myself a little better than junior, but with only 2 years experience, I don't know if I'm qualified for a ""Senior"" position. 

* My resume shows my college, major, and all the way to the right says ""Enrolled"". I'm not sure if they actually noticed that I don't have my degree yet! 

* My age (goes along with my degree). I'm only 20. They DID ask for my birthday but only to book my plane ticket (not sure how much he paid attention to it)

* They asked me my current salary and I told them I'd prefer they give me a number first. Their HR lady asked what I was looking for, and I told them that I looked up their company on Glassdoor, and the salaries reported for this position where close to what I was looking for. She asked to give her a number, I said 70-80 (The Senior Software Developer salary average is 90K but regular software developer like 65-70k). She asked if I was flexible, I said yes, depending on benefits. (Mostly vacation to me). Looking back, I just wasn't ready for the call asking me to fly across the country and give them a number so I shot a little lower than I would have liked b/c I was nervous!

The job would require me to move, which I'm not opposed too. However, I would like for it to be really worth it. I was thinking, if they give me an offer, I would want the following conditions met:

$75k with 4 weeks vacation or $80k with 3 weeks. 
I'm afraid of asking for too much though!? Will they remove the offer or just counter-offer?"

So I will have my BS in IT in May. I have a CCNA and an MCSA. I did a six-month internship at a power company's IT department.

I mentioned my hearing in the title because it is extraordinarily difficult for me to understand voices over phone and AM/FM radio, which has made call center work incredibly difficult. When I watch TV I usually read lips or use the closed captioning.

What options are there besides helpdesk? I lack the qualifications for the engineer-level positions, and I need to bridge the gap between now and graduation.

Thanks!"

_______________________________________________________ 

As some of you are no doubt aware, Glassdoor data for interns is highly unreliable, and many universities don't publish housing stipend and signing bonus numbers alongside salary in departmental surveys, or don't make the information available until late in the year, long past offer deadlines.

Having seen the popularity of the thread from last year I thought it might be worthwhile for us to have an informal survey here in CSCQ to get a better idea of what we should really expect when interviewing and negotiating.

2rfo7g,6,2015-01-05,After College Options,PotentialOptions,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2rfo7g/after_college_options/,"OK, I need some advice, and hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. I just recently graduated college with an IT / Business degree. I had two potential jobs lined up near near graduation, one from an IT insurance company and the other from my past internship. My internship has decided to let me go due to the new year and the other job has not contacted me in about 3 weeks, so I am going to assume they are no longer interested.

I have a friend who works at Walmart and says that with my BA degree I could start as an assistant manager and work my way up to possibly store manager within a few years. My dilemma is, should I try to go and find an IT job, or go into Retail? My fear is if I go into retail, that I won't be able to stay current in IT and my skills gained from university will go to waste, however, operating a large retail store like Walmart wouldn't leave me hurting for options later on. What should I do?

2rfygo,6,2015-01-05,TIFU by skipping work,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2rfygo/tifu_by_skipping_work/,"So I just finished winter break from my internship and woke up today to go back and said ""Nope."" I emailed my boss and told her I couldn't come in because blah blah blah. She is very nice.

For the time of my internship I am staying with my brother-in-law and sister because it is much much closer than home(40min commute &gt; 2 hr commute). I said 'Nope.' to work after I got ready and so as my brother-in-law is leaving he tells me to switch on the alarm as I usually leave after them and get back before them. *No problem, just nod and confirm and then don't turn it on.* As he leaves he says if I have issues I can let him know and he can turn it on from his phone. *Ah shit, no worries he won't check.*

He leaves after my sister has been long gone. I am now alone to lay down and reddit, watch movies, masturbate, and chill all day while I soak up my extra vacation day. 

Somewhere around lunch and after the masturbatory period I decide I would like to top off the day by having a nice drink. So I go out and get a little booze to save for nighttime, a nice evening drink is essential I feel.

I get back in the house and a minute or two later I hear a loud beeping. I rush over to the alarm and see that it is now arming itself and telling me to leave. I disarm it immediately and realize what I have just done. My brother-in-law texts me and asks why I didn't turn on the alarm and that he just switched it on. I tell him I just came home from work early and disarmed it. I had to then tell him some B.S. about why I got out only a few hours into the work day. *Okay phew, he bought it... ah fuck I left the booze in the trunk.*

I go out to the car and leave the house door open slightly, open the trunk and reach in for the bottle when I hear beeping again from the house. *SHIT AGAIN?!* I close the trunk real quick and rush inside to find that the wind pushed the door open a bit and it made the generic door open noise. *Oh boy I'm not on the ball today.*

Then it hits me. I have just locked my keys in my car trunk in my haste to get back inside. *FUCK. OKay stay calm, you pay AAA for this kind of shit.* Years ago I had done something similar and the AAA guy showed up popped my door open in a jiff and I popped the trunk and all was well. Same thing this time. He shows up, pops open the door and I reach down and release the trunk.

Nothing. I try again. Nothing. 

You know that feeling you get when you realize your day is going to be reeeeeally super shitty and it's not going to get better for a long time? Yea. I ask the AAA guy why it won't open and he doesn't know, he barely speaks English and then fucks off. None of the buttons are working. I look it up online and see that my car leaves the anti-theft system on in these cases for extra security. I look up ways to open the truck online to no avail. The owners manual(seriously? not even a mention here? Fucking cunts). Then I call the dealership. The lady sounds like this has happened a lot due to her tone. She says in an apologetic tone that nothing can be done besides getting it towed to a dealership for a hefty fee or waiting 2-3 days for a spare key to be made. *I HAVE WORK I CAN'T SKIP AGAIN.* I research some more and realize the valet key in the glove box unlocks the back seats so I can gain access to the trunk. *AHA. Screw you karma gods I have thwarted you!*

Just kidding its not there, it's at home in another state. 

So I call AAA again and ask if they will open my trunk, they say they need to send a locksmith. My membership covers a certain portion of their cost. When the locksmith calls I can tell that they know this and jack their prices up to make more money. The locksmith lady was a cunt rocket from the word go. I answered all her questions nicely and she was apathetic and kept snapping at me for no reason. Then I asked how much it would cost me, she gets angry and says she won't know until she gets there. I ask if I can use a credit card (I have like 6 bucks in my wallet(unpaid internship)). She says ""YES, NOW WHAT IS YOUR ADDRESS."" I give it and while I pull away the phone to hang up I hear a very audible **""fuckin' idiot.""** 

In the 45 minutes she takes to get to me I pace back and forth fuming at this outrageous waffle cunt, how do you have the nerve to be a bitch to someone who is in distress? Don't be a locksmith then you cunt muscle. 

ANYWAY. She gets here with her husband/boyfriend in their car passed out. Mind you she is actually very attractive in person, she just has a resting bitch face. She pops open my trunk in less than 5 minutes and charges me an obscene amount even though I have already got a $100 discount from AAA. 

Here is the absolute worst part of the day though. Forget all the stupid stuff I did today and yell at me for this one. In the 45 min I was pissed waiting for this moldy snatch to arrive I was thinking of a way to let her know I heard her call me an idiot. I finally come up with it. A subtle insult I have seen on Askreddit threads. ""I hope the rest of your day is as pleasant as you are."" I have been dying to use this on someone and here is my perfect opportunity!

As I sign the bill she smiles and says ""Thank you have a good one."" 

And I reply with................. ""Thanks.""

They drive away. I go inside with my stupid keys and my big ass bill and my stupid face and pour myself a drink early. 

I'm going into work tomorrow and I'm going to work really hard...

**TL;DR: Skipped work, almost let the jig up, locked myself out of my car, failed to counter-insult the supreme bitch of Cuntcake Land, and landed myself with a huge bill to pay.**

*FUCK.*"

We have essentially two programs in this field. One in the Faculty of Engineering for Software Eng and one in Faculty of Science for Computer Science. Soft Eng gives you full accreditation with the engineers board of Canada to certify you as a professional engineer. However, this means the program is filled with many classes that may or may not be useful for my future work. (Circuits 1, Circuits 2, Random Signals, ect.) These classes are typically taken by electrical and computer engineers. It also has much more advanced classes in regards to programming, like classes on telecommunication networks, computer graphics, microprocessor systems ect. However, it does have everything Computer Science has, but just a lot more. 

 Soft Eng is about double the credits (137 vs 63) of Computer Science and is in general, much heavier and much more demanding. 

It is my 2nd year in Soft Eng and I find myself with absolutely NO TIME to work on ANY personal projects or coding exploration to build up my resume. In addition, many internships are only looking for people that will graduate in 1 year, whereas I will graduate in 2 or even maybe 3 from now. 

Is this program worth completing to get the accreditation and the specific knowledge from the advanced classes, and delay my graduation or is the Computer science program sufficient considering it would give me more time to develop many personal projects and build up my CV?

I am a full-time student, looking to figure out how much tax I owe for 2014, and some advice regarding RRSP/TFSA. In 2014:

Income: $24,336

Scholarships: $14,100

Taxes already paid: $5338

Do my scholarships count as normal income? According to [SimpleTax](https://simpletax.ca/calculator) I should expect to pay about $6160 total in taxes, meaning I owe an additional $822 in addition to the tax I have already paid.

I put $10,000 into a TFSA mutual fund earlier this year. (total contribution room is $26,500)

I currently have about ~$9000 in my checking account.
Should I also contribute to an RRSP to decrease the amount of tax I owe?

And I know ""trying is always better than not trying"" but: 

* I've moved a couple hours (via driving) away from the university, and I don't have a car, so getting there and back is fairly difficult for me

* I actually have an on-site interview with a large tech company planned on the exact date of the career fair, so I would need to change my interviewing date.

I've realized that I'm unhappy with the work I do and it feels like I'm running myself into a dead end. I worked hard in college to graduate in 3 years while working multiple internships to get where I am today, but it feels like my efforts have gone into the wrong field. I live in Silicon Valley, so while I'm making nonprofit salary of 40k a year living at my parent's house, I know there are people around my age making twice over what I make right around the corner with financial independence. It just makes the nonprofit work I do feel even less valuable and fulfilling at the end of the work day.

The good thing though is that with my current job I've had to do a lot of front-end web dev work (though nothing too intense, mostly modifying and following after our developer's work) and that work has actually been an exciting part of my day. Most of the work has been in GitHub too, so there's a record of my contributions. It reminds me of the days when I was in high school where I set up private servers for Ragnarok Online and Maplestory, and I set up a website and modified Java and C++ to make the games customized to my server for my friends. That was fun and I think I would enjoy learning how to program. Should I try to go through a self-taught approach and try to break into a CS career this way? Or should I get a second degree? Also I'm not sure if I'd want to go into web dev or software dev, but I already have a solid grasp of writing HTML and less of CSS. I need advice on taking the first step, it's a lot to think about. I hope somebody could help think this through.

2rgyms,16,2015-01-05,Reflecting on my masters,husky_notbigboned,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2rgyms/reflecting_on_my_masters/,"As I enter my last of four semesters as a grad student, I can't help but wonder how my experience compares to other people that have tried for a thesis before me.  Possibly a long post, you've been warned.

I attended a good (top-20 public university) for my B.S. and spent every semester from my freshman fall in a lab doing some kind of hands-on work with research. Data gathering, writing python/perl scripts, interacting with subjects and following protocols, helping with blood draws. I tried a lot of different things and really enjoyed it all.

So I applied for graduate school to my undergrad, and one other school (top-5 public, research 1 institution) - and received a full fellowship at the latter.  Not only a full fellowship, but under the tutelage of one of the greatest researchers in my field.  

Move 1800 miles for the position.  Start school.  Immediately look for ideas that my adviser would be interested in.  I know that for my thesis to work out, it should be something that he should be somewhat enthusiastic about.  I end up with a few ideas - my lab is exercise physiology, specifically human performance. I proposed similar study designs to what had already been looked at by his lab, but with big enough variations in protocol and equipment that it would not only verify what had been found initially, but expand the knowledge to other athletic populations.  I got very little excitement or vocal support on any of the ideas, but kept being aggressive at getting my ideas across.

First semester finished up and I take on a teaching position in the spring (had been an RA).  Grades are great at this point and I feel like I've been making headway toward everything I need to start a thesis during the summer and have it ready for defense/presentation in Spring 2014.  Unfortunately, my adviser neglected to mention that for those wanting to complete a thesis, taking a ""Directed Research"" class is a great idea - yet he suggests this to another masters student with the same semester standing.  I did not find out the importance of this class until the end of the spring - yet we talked weekly in lab meetings and I frequently discussed (at least once a week) my research ideas and future plans with him.  At this point I am baffled, because my friends who are at grad school at other places have great ideas given to them by their advisers - yet I'm stuck here trying to piece something together and hope he likes it.

By the end of the spring I am incredibly burned out for trying to push a project that I get no response on, and finding out that my course path had been entirely wrong for what I wanted to do.  I start piloting a study design over the summer and manage to collect some data - but it's not enough in my mind to push through an IRB.  Between my sloth, or being burned out, or lack of support (whether perceive or actual) I gave up the dream of a thesis (and M.S.) and settled on an M.Ed instead.  With one semester to go, my adviser is the same person and I continue to get the feeling that he just doesn't care about advising.  I talked with him once to get approval for my internship in the spring, and have not had any follow-up on that project whatsoever.

Perhaps the weirdest thing, in retrospect, is that his lab (which has produced hundreds of papers over the last 30 years) has no active studies.  Yes, his doctoral students are piloting studies and taking comprehensive exams and such, but there is no genuine work being done. I had never seen this in my undergrad.  

So did I mess up? Did I have mismatched expectations of what getting a thesis would be like?  Do advisers usually have a bigger role in preparing a fresh graduate student for this kind of thing?  Should I have been sketched out from the beginning that no research was going on?  

All in all, I am entirely burned out from school.  It's been 19 years now and I seriously question myself for wanting to pursue academia as a career (both from my experience as a grad student and from reading more on these boards).  I cannot wait to graduate and just put my brain to use in a manner that has more direct rewards than grades and a degree.  I can always learn more - I don't have to be in school."

Help!",desperate_engineer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2rhltn/a_desperate_mechatronics_engineer_with_no_job/,"A little back story. A year ago, I graduated engineering school from a middle-eastern country. It was 5 years of incredibly hard work, but it was and still is what I'm passionate about and the best fit for someone like me. My degree is in **Mechatronics** engineering.

I and my family were eligible for special immigrant visas. Of course, as an engineer, I was thrilled to have this opportunity. I always wanted to get out and establish a good life elsewhere, anyway, and engineers are always in demand, anywhere.

So after graduating, I did an extensive research on the states that would be the best fit for someone like me, and ended up in Houston. This was on May 2014, approximately 4 months after graduation.

Anyway, after a while, I got an apartment, a license, and a car. During this period, I naïvely proceeded to send applications to several companies here in Houston. Having no luck, I did a bit of research and concluded that an EIT certificate would help, so I accredited my degree using the services of NCEES, registered and passed the FE exam, and then applied for the certificate. A month later, the certificate arrived by the mail. From degree accreditation to certificate arrival, 4 months have passed. Thinking that I have increased my chances, I resumed sending applications with improved resumes. It has been almost a month with no luck. 

A little more background. The university I studied in is the first established in my home country. Engineering degree programs consist of 160 credit hours spread on a 5 year period. The education in this university was not particularly impressive, but most of the exams were  hard; some ridiculously so, which meant hours of studying and solving a shit ton of problems every single day. No one graduates with a 4.0 GPA where I studied. It is impossible. A friend of mine studied at this same university and graduated with a 2.5-2.6 GPA. Now he’s studying for his master’s in a reputable university in Texas. He finished his first semester with a perfect 4.0 GPA. I graduated with a 2.84 GPA, which is considered in the low side here in the US, I assume.

I’ll give you a review of the course material of my degree program. I have studied Statics, Dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, and Mechanical Design. I have studied both courses of Thermodynamics, fluid (statics and dynamics), hydraulics. I have studied computer programming, digital logic, microprocessor assembly, embedded systems, signal analysis, and discreet signal processing (a graduate course). I have studied 3 control courses (classical control, modern control theory, and fuzzy logic control). I have studied electrical circuits (2 courses), electronic circuits (3 courses), electric machines, and electric drives, in addition to other electives. 

In a few days, it will be the anniversary of my graduation. I don’t have contacts, a network or whatever people do in colleges here to help secure a job after graduation, nor have I completed any internships here. My only professional experience is a 2 months practical training in an industrial automation firm back in my home country. I feel that I’m at a great disadvantage here and I don’t know what to do! 

Engineers of reddit, I need your honest opinions!

1)	Do you think that someone like me (a recent graduate with 2.84 GPA and an EIT) have a chance at a job the way I am?

2)	If not, what could I do to enhance my chances, to get contacts or build a network? 
*Note: I spent my time learning Oracle SQL in my first few months here and was thinking of getting certified as an Oracle SQL developer (requires 2 hard exams). Do you think it’s worth the time investment for an engineer?*

3)	If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

4)	I have an Arabic name? Could this be an issue?

5)	I have found that a lot of engineers do not know the general curriculum of a Mechatronics degree, could this act as a repellent to possible employers?

I can’t take it anymore. Do you think I should I just apply for a loan and go to graduate school? Please, I need your honest, unfiltered opinions.

Thank you, fellow redditors,

2rhvvl,3,2015-01-06,"Career path advice, Computer Engineer/Telecommunication master in the interview chair facing the death question ""What are you good at?""",sam_cloud,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rhvvl/career_path_advice_computer/,"I finished my computer engineering studies couple of years ago, and I am close to finishing my master degree in telecommunication sciences.. Both my studies are very generic, I studied a lot of topics, multiple programming languages, digital electronics, digital telecommunication..etc. All of these seem nice in an academic CV, so if I want to continue to PhD level, it would be easy to slip in. 
I will be frank, as most normal humans, I want to use this knowledge to earn money, but when I apply for jobs or search for jobs, it is always required to know some specific programming languages or to have an experience with some special IT skill, but after couple of years in the academic master program I forgot my skills in programming, I'm not very good in telecommunication either, not in a professional level at least.. when I see a job offer e.g. requirements: C++, Java.. etc , I think ""oh, these guys used to be my friend, but now I forgot them"" , in the interview, if they ask me ""What are you good at?"" I absolutely am good at nothing at the professional level, I am good (not excellent) in academia, but not in real life work.
To be honest, I believe that the small drift in career between the B.E. and the master was a horrible decision, it's too late to go back.. 
The golden question is: What should I do next?  

-Continue to PhD? (not very attractive for me after spending all these years in study, I'm tired of studying and I don't want to be a teacher, I prefer in-field professional job. But I will not exclude this option as a last resort.

-Study another master? (this option seems to me like repeating the same mistake, even if I did another master in a CS field, I have the impression that I will end up having the same problem)

-Build skills on my own? (this option is attractive to me, but thinking about it, if for example I spent 6 months to a year to become an expert in let's say C++ , then what is the benefit of my degrees when any hobbyist with C++ skills can compete with me in most of the same jobs? same things goes for web designing, Cisco networks ...etc

-Other solutions..?

My optimal solution would look like: Using my degrees and finding my place in the job market.

Internship jobs, or jobs that include training are very rare in my location, when they appear, the competition is so tough, so this option depends on luck, which is not something I would gamble on.

Thank you very much for you patience and your help.
I hope this question will help others having similar problem."

The first one is at Europes biggest research society. The job is mostly web frontend and backend stuff, which I have already done at different projects and at an internship. The work there is supposed to be really laid back and the pay is about 2€ more per hour compared to option 2. I could write my masters thesis there but during the interview they made it clear that this is not a priority for them. After my masters it is very unlikely that I can continue working there. I don't know on what hardware I am going to develop.

The second one is a consultancy. At this job I would do a lot of prototyping and work with a lot of new technology. The pay is about 2€ less, but by writing my masters thesis there I could get some extra money. A friend of mine told me that you learn a lot there and the people there seemed nice. I was offered to occasionally do home office (which is impossible for option 1). I might need to buy some shirts because I mostly have t-shirts. I am definitely able to write a thesis there (not about my favorite topic but still pretty useful: databases). Judging from the open positions I could continue working there. Thinkpads + monitors for hardware.

Both jobs are for 20h a week.

Which one would you choose? I am kind of leaning towards the consultancy

Do you know any other criteria to help my decision?

After much consideration and prodding from my wonderfully supportive boyfriend, I decided to reach out to the fine folk of Reddit. Although I do not post much nor comment I have observed a lot of solid advice offered on many posts. I have mulled over my options long enough and have sunk into a depression regarding my career and life's path. My depression is starting to effect my health, my happiness, and relationships. I desperately want to succeed and be proud of my career choice; however, I have no clue what I should be doing with my life. I was blessed with many talents but none of which are practical or desirable in the work force these days. I was taught to follow my dreams and be the creative person I am but in my late 20s I have a solid realization that I am drawn to ""sexy careers"" and those careers are limited. I need a career path now and I need to be able to pay my bills, but I don't want to feel miserable.

**Educational Background:** 
I have always been a very dedicated worker with an entrepreneurial mindset. I worked my way through my bachelors (debt free) and obtained my B.A. in English and minor in Rhetoric. I set out believing I wanted to be an English professor and write books like Lord of the Rings, but during my Junior year I was miserable dissecting literary works and felt my creativity drained in that area. So, I began pursuing photography, which I had been prepping for since I was 16 years old. After I graduated college, I pursued my Masters of Fine Art degree in Commercial Photography. I have a year left but I had to put my Masters on hold to get my finances and professional life in order since it was quite difficult to balance a full time class load and a full time job. While I pursued my Masters I ran my own photography company and was contracted out to studios and was published on multiple occasions. The bread and butter was wedding photography but I loved photographing upcoming models in the fashion industry. After a while weddings became monotonous and boring - I felt like I wasn't giving my all anymore after a business partnership went sour. I still photograph weddings on occasion, but only for extra income during the times I need it. 

**Post Graduation 2014 Job Experience:**
Aside from that the jobs I have had are just that - jobs. They pay the bills and aren't satisfying at the end of the day. My first ""real world"" job was very meager in its pay and my boss sexually harassed me on multiple occasions. I was eventually demoted due to financial issues, or so they claimed, with the company. While I searched for another position, as directed by unemployment, I interned at a motion capture studio for marketing. The internship was enjoyable but the company would not be able to pull me on full time. I eventually landed a Graphic Design/Marketing position at a pet product company. I quit my meager paying job quickly only to be fired at the new company I started working at after 4 days without reason. As you can imagine I was distraught. I once again obtained unemployment and kept applying. I did my best to stay positive but I was beginning to feel discouraged. Eventually, I was offered a position as an Executive Administrative Assistant to the CEO of a hotel management company. It was a great job, with great pay, and benefits looming in the distance (it was a fairly new company with great promise). I figured while I worked there I could start searching for what I should be doing in life. However, the Vice President of Finance was stealing money from the company and it wasn't discovered until a month after I began working for them. In November of 2014 I was laid off due to financial reasons. My boss told me that I could file for unemployment and they would not contest me although they wish they could have kept me. However, I had already had to go on unemployment twice during the year of 2014, which means I ran out of unemployment by the end of 2014. The job titles I have held since my college graduation are: Key-holder/Assistant Manager, Benefit Specialist, Graphic Design/Marketing Coordinator, and Executive Administrative Assistant to the CEO. 

Luckily, my parents and boyfriend are incredibly supportive and understanding that my basic needs are met but that does not mean that I feel satisfied as a human being relying on others to help me as I flounder about.

**My passions:**
Photography - models/fashion industry and travel. I have scouted models in the past and watched their careers flourish after photographing them and sending them to agencies.

People - I love helping people and making them feel great about themselves. Listening and giving sound advice are normally what I am best at with my friends and co-workers. 

Writing - I use to write fiction but I have years of experience writing on a professional/communication level.

Gaming Industry - I have been a gamer ever since I remember. I love everything about it and love everyone that's a part of the industry. There are certain companies I would love to invest my career goals with but I have been told it's a pipe dream since I don't have any relevant skills. 

**The situation:** 
I don't want to keep relying on others to help me financially, especially since I am so eager to make my own money. I don't want a big house nor do I want children. I am in my late 20s and I want to travel my heart out and experience the world. I need a creative environment where my ideas can be brought to life and I need people to appreciate me for my efforts. I want to work to live not live to work. I need to find my way around positions that prefer specific degrees since I am an English major. Help? Thoughts? Advice? Questions? 

Although this is a long post, I found it very cathartic to write out so thank you for reading. 

**TLDR:** English Major and photographer with a passion for work in saturated markets unable to find career path or direction. "
2rjgi6,6,2015-01-06,In lot of confusion and depression. Doing MS in US. Please help.,foren_nar,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2rjgi6/in_lot_of_confusion_and_depression_doing_ms_in_us/,"I m doing MS in CS. No work ex. I now plan to get an internship for summer and complete my MS by December and want to go back to India permanently. 

The reasons for this: My parents are old and especially my Mom's health is not keeping well with age. But not in a financial crisis, can afford medical help easily in India. But still I feel like I should be taking care of them now. I am the only child. Whenever I talk to them, I feel like they are not as happy now. I guess my decision for MS was not well planned. 

I had taken a 15 lakh loan. Hopefully, I will get a decent internship so that I can manage all my expenses for last sem. Rest of the amount has come from my fathers' earnings. We have a small, not runnig well, business, I would say. 

Although, I desperately want to go to India and be with my parents as soon as I complete my MS, here are the few problems and doubts I have which are bothering me so much that I was unable to do any thing in the Christmas break. 

1. I am concerned about job opportunities in India. I consider that I am an above average coder. Have developed couple of android apps. I am not great a communication skills. Is it possible to get a good job with ~15 L+ salary in India?

2. And with that will I be able to repay my loan in 8 yrs and take care of my parents?

3. I am not at all street smart. In know in most places in India, you need to know how to talk to certain people and get your job done without much hassle. This was one of the main reason I thought of doing MS, and later a job in US. Would I be able to survive decently?

4. With all this, what will be my future life / career?

Too scared and confused. Please help."

I found a guide on what it's like to work as a software developer at a start-up... written by interviewing other software developers. 

Some of the people interviewed are CTOs and senior software engineers of up-and-coming tech companies, and what surprised me is that all of them are 20-somethings or 30-somethings.

There's honestly so much useful information that I can't put it all here, but this is one excerpt from the guide...

**Aidan McLaughlin** from Indico Data Solutions

I would like to think that my path to indico began back in high school, when I spent my summers working as a lifeguard at a local pool.  Aside from being my first job, lifeguarding was the first time I had to listen to users, understand their needs, and work to satisfy those demands.  It sounds simple, but in a way, that element of empathy has been a major component of all my professional experiences, including my current role with indico.

When I began exploring summer internship options following my second year at Olin, I attended the school’s on-campus career fairs.  Olin is interesting in that they have two career fairs: one for mature, well-known companies, and another for startups.  I attended both events and I was captivated by the energy and chaos that was the startup career fair.  At that startup career fair, I spoke with some of the indico folks and I was fascinated by what they were trying to accomplish.  I honestly did not think I was qualified to work for the company, but I applied anyway.  During the application process, I simply communicated my enthusiasm regarding what the company was doing and it’s prospects.  Thankfully, I was hired and here I am, in my first ever development job.

**What skillset do employers expect...?**

I think that people with very specific skillsets can be very valuable.  Someone’s expertise could be a piece of technology or just a passion about which he or she is deeply knowledgeable.

**What interview questions did you receive?**

I was asked how I would go about load balancing if I had a couple machines running a server.  I had no idea regarding the correct answer to the question, but that was OK because my interviewers simply wanted to understand my logic, thought process, and willingness to ask questions.  I feel that is a huge part of being successful in a startup environment- being willing to ask questions and admit when you do not know the answer.

**Describe your day-to-day as a software engineer...*

I come into work around 10am.  I get set up and work a bit.  Around 11am, we conduct a “stand-up” which is a meeting in which we discuss the previous day’s work and our goals for the day.  Following that meeting, my schedule varies a lot, but I will essentially work on my primary project(s).

**What's your least favorite part of the job?**

There are times when members of the team disagree regarding our direction and architecture and we have difficulty understanding what decision is “right” ...

To mitigate this problem, we will often try to identify our most promising options and assign people to research each option.  If we can do the 20% of work that earns us an 80% understanding regarding what is the right idea, that is good enough because we usually do not have a lot of time.  Other times, we keep talking until we reach agreement.

That's a small part of one interview out of about 6 or 7. You can read the rest [here](http://www.lifeguides.me/guide_info/software-engineer-startup)."

I want to transition into working with medical data, and I specifically think bioinformatics might be a perfect fit. I've been studying it a lot over the last 6 months and so far I love it.

My current plan is to go back to school (starting in a couple weeks), since I never finished my undergrad. I'll be studying CS or computer engineering, but trying to create my own emphasis in bioinformatics with biology courses and MOOCs (my university has bioinf labs but no explicit CS w/ bioinf emphasis yet). I'm planning to focus on algorithm design, big data, stats, machine learning, etc so my skills remain widely applicable in case bioinf doesn't work out for whatever reason.

My question is what types of internships you all would recommend? Should I try to get into a university lab? Research institute (ie Broad)? Large company (ie Novartis, Illumina)? Startup (ie DNANexus, Omicia, etc)? NIH? Or something else entirely?

I'm a big fan of internships and I would specifically like to get some real bioinformatics experience ASAP so I can get a better idea if this is really a good fit."
2rk1zv,3,2015-01-06,How do I talk to my boss about moving the intern out of my office?,[deleted],work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/2rk1zv/how_do_i_talk_to_my_boss_about_moving_the_intern/,"I have been at this job for 7 months. I was replacing someone else in the position who had been at the company for two years. 

My first day I learned that the girl I was replacing had recently changed offices (they were doing a lot of moving around in the office before I got there) and there was an intern temporarily sharing the office. 

I was told when I was hired on that when I went full-time/salary, the intern would be moved. Now that I'm full-time, I've been wondering when this intern will be moved. 

There are a few reasons I don't want her in my office: 

1. I don't like small talk 
2. I feel, somehow, that because she's in the office, I am obligated to let her know when I'm leaving, where I'm going, and when I'm returning (even though I know I don't have to do that)
3. I feel pressured to constantly be working because she's always there (feel guilty even being on my phone)
4. She talks on the phone all the time (because of things she's tasked to do during the day) 
5. I recently got a new work table and I've been gone for a week while the desk was being put in my office. When I returned, she told me, ""You're welcome to use the table."" (She has the entire table covered in papers) ...this is mainly frustrating because I know I can use the table. It's mine. 

I realize this may come across as petty or like I'm just complaining, and I partially am. But mainly because I was told she would only temporarily be in my office and I wonder if maybe my boss just forgot that we had discussed the intern moving. I now don't think she'll ever move unless I say something. 

How do I go about discussing this with my boss in a way that doesn't make me sound bratty or entitled? I really like my job, I also really enjoy my space. 

Me and the intern are not equals, and I fear that because I am a younger employee, I'm somehow being viewed as an intern as well (despite the important work I do for the company).

I really do like this girl, she's very sweet. I don't want her to ever feel like I don't like her because of this, I just like having my own space.

tl;dr promised intern would be moved out of my office when hired, still hasn't happened and I need advice on how to discuss this with my boss. "

Over the 2 years I've been working here, I witnessed many unethical practices done by this employer. I don't want to get into deep details for security reasons. I really would like to leave this place and change companies, public or private again, I really don't care as long as I'm out of here. For the past 5 months I've been applying to many places trying to get a job (even entry levels) and I've been having a lot of trouble getting positive returns, not a single company called me for an interview. I don't think it's the experience the problem because not only did I started working since my graduation but also I did many internships too. I always apply for something that I know I meet the company requirement. I was suspecting that maybe my current boss got a word of it and is not helping my case. Not only did he change his attitude when he talks to me, but also I feel like he's been giving bad references. I had a chance to ask my friend who works @ one of our competitors which I applied for, and he confirmed to me that my current boss advised him not to hire me so he could keep me in his company.

Obviously now I stopped putting him as a reference to be called, but this is a construction company where they all know eachother, if they see where I worked in my resume, I am worried they would call my current boss and advise him.

I can understand maybe why he wouldn't want me to go work with a competitor as I know a lot about his strategies and way of bidding on projects. But I feel stuck here and I am really not enjoying it at all. I can't just quit because I need the income. And I am worried about what could happen to me or my reputation if I stay there longer. 

What would you do? please any advice would help a lot. I am sorry I can't give a lot of details about the type of stuff he does or the company does, but I really fear for myself.

2rl28l,9,2015-01-06,Internship Advice,EpicCelloMan54,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2rl28l/internship_advice/,"Hi, I'm a current university freshman majoring in EE looking to intern somewhere during the summer. My only experience in EE is from FRC in high school, then an intro class in college. I know java and python, but havent taken Data Structures yet. I've already tried searching online for opportunities, but have encountered two problems. 

First, a Google search gives me hundreds of different options at hundreds of locations. I have no idea how to choose ones that will give me the best experience that will help me in my studies and job search in the future. 

Second, I would ideally like to intern in Silicon Valley or Washington. However, internship opportunities at these locations seem to be very selective. I don't know if it would be worth to go to an interview if I am not competitive with the hundreds of other students competing against me. Even if I somehow get in, I am afraid of not being skilled enough to complete whatever tasks I need to do. 

As you can tell, I have very little knowledge of how interning works, nor am I even sure that this is the best way for me to spend my summer productively. What do you guys suggest I do?"

My team lead came in today to the lab and asked me if I knew anyone who's looking for work. He said he's looking for fresh blood who has their Digital Communications fundamentals really good, and knows some bit of coding is a plus. Our team has mostly EE's with DSP or Wireless background, and there are about 18 of us in my sub team, of which 3 of us (including me) are C coders (as well as Perl and Python). Coding requirements as a function at job we have is limited to 15% to 25%. We work on 3GPP and 3GPP2 Wireless Telecom RATs such as LTE, CDMA, EVDO and so forth. Our team mostly focuses our tests, experiments and tool developments on PHY, MAC and Protocol layer. You may know about shift registers SSRG and MSRG, modulation schemes, interleaving, scrambling of bits using PN spreading technique, Knowing few things from the standard for CDMA/eHRPD/EVDO from 3GPP2.org, which is IS-801 is a plus, Anything you know about Carrier Aggregation (just the basics, you can google and learn these), Bit energy, chip cycle, Channel coding, Source coding techniques etc are all useful, good to have.

Our sub team is a part of a bigger team of over 550 engineers (all EE's). And our company is about 32,000 employees. Roughly 65% of that are EE's and CompE's. We are based in Southern California.

Experience is not what we are looking for, but if you have some its a plus. From my experience 90% of our engineering staff in our company have an MS, so that is required. I don't know why this is so. (I was an intern here during my final year of BS in EE, and the general climate was, if I didn't have an MS, I need not come back to apply, so after my BS., I went for my MS, so there's that, sorry.) Also, if you are looking for intenship, now is the time to apply for summer.

If you have questions you can ask me here. Work is always busy here, and we demand a lot of hardwork and fortitude. Some resumes in the next two weeks will be ideal (ofcourse, don't send them to me directly). Most of us in our team went to Purdue, UMich, Columbia, Rutgers, UVa, RPI, Auburn, and Penn State (me)."

In Denmark you get something called ""SU"" which is money you get payed for going to school. Therefore i'm able to have an apartment which i share with a mate.

I moved away from my parents at age 18 when i was able to get this SU as everyone else over 18 gets. The rates differ tho. Because of my parents income, and me being under 20. I'm still ""reliable"" to my parents according to the law. Therefore i could only get 430$ a month, where the maximum rate which you get if you're 20+ or your parent's don't make enough money, i think where you get maximum which is 930$ is if your parents combined make 54000$ a year. My parents make 864 k a year, but i have 3 brothers still living at home, and they have a house loan car loan and stuff to pay, so they can't afford to give me like 600$ a month. Which forced me to take a monthly student loan for around 800$ a month. I get 1408$ a month total. I was forced to move out from my parents (kind of) because i had to take the bus for 45 minutes to school and home every day. Everyone in my home town does this, but for some reason i got too tried for it, and my brain would just shut down for days sometimes, days where i wasn't able to focus on anything. Therefore i moved to the city where the school was. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now my ADHD is not super severe, but handling economy is not something i'm good at, i suck at saving money, and i'm an impulsive buyer. On top of that i can't hold a job while under education. Education is hard enough for me as it is, and setting aside time to work is stressing me out. I've tried to take a job 2 times before while being under education, and that didn't last more than a month or 2, then i stressed out so much that i wasn't able to sleep, wasn't able to get any work done in school or anything. My mind simply focused so much on keeping track on work and school and everything, that it filled me up. I figured i can only do one thing at a time, which annoys me because i like money, alot.

&amp;nbsp;

Now when i'm done with my education im not able to start on the next step until march, that means that i can't get my SU in february, so hopefully i can get welfare that month, or i'm screwed. In march i'm starting my school internship, which pays 1100$ a month. My bills are around 860$ a month. I'm having a hard time living off 1400$ a month ( even tho i shouldn't) I've tried to quit smoking to save money, but i simply can't it feels like theres a ""second me"" that just goes to by cigarettes, i simply can't control it. And with the school internship i can't take a loan on top, so i need some advice on what to do, since these days will be even longer than my current school days. My brain get's easily tired, so when i get home from school my focus is pretty much used up. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


I just want to start working and start my life, but at the moment i'm not even done with my education. I've thought about taking HTX, a education like college i think, and then starting at the university to get my computer science bachelor. Then i can continue being on SU, but then my huge ass loan will rise even more. my life seems like a mess at the moment, either continue on the next step of my education towards data technician, and get stressed because i don't have enough money. Or start HTX and get an even bigger loan. I know this sounds like i have it pretty good. And i might, and yes i can live off 1100$ But the problem is that I can, i don't think my ""Brain"" can. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like i'm out of options, so any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated, and yes i am on medication. 30mg motiron (cheap brand ritalin 75$ a month) every 3rd hour.

Hope it's readable, since my dots, commas and some grammar, and my ""sidetracking/ jumping around"" isn't perfect

2rnqz6,249,2015-01-07,I recently started interning at a government agency. I've found something... worrying.,SMS450,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2rnqz6/i_recently_started_interning_at_a_government/,"Hey nosleep. It feels kind of weird to post this on reddit of all places, but I've seen people do similar things, so I was thinking maybe someone here could make sense of all of this. 

I'm currently going to college for a law enforcement degree, and a big part of that is the opportunity to intern places. Local police stations, that sort of thing. Well, I recently started working at a branch for a government agency that I'd like to keep nameless, for the sake of anonymity. I'm not trusted with a whole lot of security access, being an unpaid lackey and all. I generally just get coffee or fill out simple paperwork that the big dogs can't give two shits about, but about a week ago, one of the guys who's a few levels of important above me, who I'll refer to as Morris, began to trust me with getting files and evidence from a locked room that normally requires pretty high clearance (smart move on Morris' part, right?)

I really don't see it as a big deal. I'm a very well-behaved guy, not a spot on my record, not even a parking ticket. Morris figured that a good guy like me wouldn't do anything stupid. And plus, it's a pretty low-priority evidence/file room. It's more stuff that dealt with child abuse cases, assaults, domestic abuse, stuff like that. Not extremely dangerous or confidential stuff, but not the lowest level of importance, if that makes sense.

Well, yesterday, Morris sends me to go grab a file about a wife who beat her husband or something like that. As I was going, I heard a guy a few levels of importance above Morris talking to Morris about a very important file that was missing. I had no idea what he said at the time, but now I know he said the words ""Vitriol S16.""

It immediately sounds familiar to me, but I disregard it. Probably heard Morris mention it a while ago or something, who cares. So, I get to the file room, and in there is another worker, about the same level of importance as Morris. I'll call this guy Mort. Well, Mort's always been a little... off. He's only about 10 years older than me, but still rocks a heavy wool trench coat and middle part in his hair like he's 40. He seems like the kind of guy who plays Magic: The Gathering and EVE online in his free time, and gets waaaaaay too serious about it.

Anyway, he's in there, and he's sort of frantic-looking. Eyes shifting, looking under the couple metal tables in the room, frantically shuffling through files in the cabinets. When I enter and he hears the doors close, his head snaps towards me. ""SMS, right?"" he says, of course with my real name. ""Yeah..."" I say. He walks up to me quickly. I see now that he's holding a manila envelope with the word ""CONFIDENTIAL"" stamped all over it. Something told me it was confidential. 

Anyway, he gets to me and pushes the envelope to my chest. ""You need to take this, alright buddy?"" he says. His voice is quivering, but he puts on a smile, to reassure me, I guess. ""What is it?"" I ask, not totally expecting an answer. ""No, no questions. Just- Just tuck it into your shirt, ok? Don't let anyone see that you have it. Get whatever you came here for, get that where it needs to go, then say you're not feeling well and go home, ok? Take it and keep it at home, not here."" I'm freaking out a little here, because this seems like some shit straight out of a movie where me, the protagonist, eventually gets hunted by FBI agents, but just to get him away from me, I quickly nod, stick it in the waistband of my pants, then tuck my shirt in over it. Luckily for me, I was wearing a thick vest that day, so it didn't look too odd.

Mort smiled, nodded, then left quickly. I was a little shaken, but I just resolved to give the file to Morris, explain what happened, and be done with it. So, I grab the file Morris sent me there for in the first place, and started back.

But, as I was going back, I saw a bunch of officers who worked at the building handcuffing Mort and taking him out. I was right by him as he was escorted out, but he didn't so much as glance at me. This should make it all the more clear that I should hand over the file Mort gave to me, right? I should tell Morris about it, right?

I didn't. Beyond all reason, I didn't. I'm a very rational person. I always look at things from all ways, consider every outcome, all that. But for some reason, I gave Morris the file he asked for, said I wasn't feeling great, and Morris suggested I go home. Fuck. No way out now.

I get home, and set the file down on my table. I resolve to open it up later in the evening, but I think I was really just too terrified to look at it. This had to be why Mort got arrested, right? For taking this file when he probably had no clearance to. Why the fuck did I have it, then? Goddamn it, I'm already in too deep.

At about 11 PM or so yesterday, I finally gathered the courage to open the envelope. I hadn't realized it, but it was one of those heavily padded ones, so it was decently cushy. Inside was a piece of paper, two photographs, and an iPod. At the top of the paper in bold, italicized letters was ""***Vitriol S16***.  ""So this is what the guy was looking for,"" I thought to myself. Fuck, now I have it. The paper had a few dates, ranging from 2011 to 2014. They weren't labelled at all, just said ""June 4th, 2011,"" or ""May 23rd, 2012."" At the bottom of the page, hand-written, was ""change the password on the iPod. Mort made it way too fucking obvious.""

One photograph was of a man. It was odd, though; it was him walking down the street, seemingly knowing that he was being photographed. He had short black hair, good posture, and a full face. Not to say he was fat, but he was certainly healthy. 

The second photograph was of the same guy, but I could hardly tell at first. It was a mugshot. He had shoulder-length, greasy hair, gaunt, almost yellowish skin (like long-time smokers, I guess), and his face was very gaunt and thin. He looked exhausted.

Finally, I turned my attention to the iPod. It was an iPod touch, don't know what gen, not really important. I turned it on, and was prompted to put in a 4-digit password. Having seen the note about changing the password because it was obvious, I thought ""what would be obvious?"" After a moment of thinking, I typed in ""VS16."" Click, I was in.

It was clearly jailbroken. All the default apps were gone. Hell, *everything* was gone, except one app, voice memos. Might be a default, I dunno. I opened it up, and found a ton of audio files, all labelled with dates. After looking at them, I noticed a couple of them coincided with dates on the piece of paper, but not all of them.

I haven't listened to any of them yet. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm going to. I'm thinking that if I listen to them, I'll be in way too deep. If I just hand over the shit to Morris now, maybe I won't get in too much trouble.

On the other hand... I think I should listen to them. Mort clearly wanted this stuff to be public, don't you think? He lost his job and went to jail over this, and while he didn't seem all the way there in the head, he wouldn't throw away his career for nothing. I don't know. Plus, Vitriol S16 sounds very familiar to me, but I can't put my finger on where I've heard it before. 

If there's any interest, I'll listen to the audio files, maybe transcribe them here.

-------

**Update** I originally posted this as another post, but I guess nosleep has a one post per day rule, so oh well. I'll post what I wrote there to here:

A few people posted that [this is where I might've heard Vitriol S16 before.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vdyop/hidden_inmate_records_disturbing_occurrences_s16/) It's strange; those sounds exactly what I read before, but I only came upon nosleep a few months ago, and never searched for that or remember seeing it linked elsewhere. Weird.
Anyway. I worked a few hours today, so I was a little worried that people would know what I did. When I got to work, almost right away, Morris spoke to me and said that Mort had used his card to go into the evidence room a few minutes before I did. Morris then asked if Mort spoke to me. Here was where I definitely should've spoken up, told Morris what happened. Fuck my job, I should've been honest.
I wasn't.
I told Morris that I got into the room right as Mort was leaving. I don't know why I lied. That's not something I'd do. Maybe I wanted to keep my job, I don't know. Point is, I still have the iPod and documents, and as far as I know, I'm not a suspect.
I got home an hour ago, and decided to listen to an audio file from the iPod. It seems to be an audio journal from a guy named Gerry Randall (pronounced like Jerry, not Gary). I found his name on the back of the mugshot, hadn't noticed it before. I haven't listened to all of them; only the first 7. They're pretty mundane to start, just Gerry talking about his life. They're spaced over a few months at a time. Seems like Gerry wasn't very invested in the journal since he didn't update it very often.
Also weird, the journal entries don't start with #1. The first entry is #42, but every one after that seems to be the next one numerically. Maybe the ones before weren't relevant.
I debated for a long time about whether I should post the transcriptions (partly because I could get in trouble, partly because I'd have to actually type them out), but I decided to do that. They're weird, and I'd like some insight, if you guys can provide that. Clearly, this is important somehow, and I feel like I wouldn't be able to deal with it myself. So, here's the ones I've listened to so far (I'm going to only listen to a few at a time, so I don't get overwhelmed or whatever):

**Entry 42: June 4th, 2011**

Hey, journal. Gerry signing on. Been a while since we talked. Been real busy with work and things. And hey, guess what? Maria said yes! We’re getting married! I’m not sure when yet, but it’s amazing. I never thought that girl that I met in the coffee shop would ever become my fiance. It’s a pretty crazy feeling.

I don’t have much else to say for now. Still working at the office. I got promoted to assistant manager, but that doesn’t really mean much other than a name plate on my desk and a 1% pay raise, but hey, every little bit helps. Especially since I’ve got a wedding to save up for now!

**Entry 43: June 27th, 2011**

Things have been… weird lately. Maria and I have been fighting a lot, but I’m sure that’s just because we’re both stressed and nervous. She lost her job at PetCo, and we’ve been struggling a little bit since, but we can make it, I know it. I love her. It’ll work out.

**Entry 44: July 13th, 2011**

Guess what? Maria and I are going to have a baby! Yeah yeah, I know, born out of wedlock is a bastard. I hear ya, mom. But I don’t care. We’re going to have a baby! I couldn’t be happier. I’m engaged to the love of my life, I’m going to be a father… Nothing can bring me down!

**Entry 45: November 16th, 2011**

Nothing to report, just figured I’d drop in and say hello. Maria and I are still doing great, the baby’s healthy, and my job is going well. Maria’s finally got an interview at the local newspaper printing place, so let’s hope that works out.

**Entry 46: January 19th, 2012**

Maria and I are back to fighting, and it’s worse than ever, and I don’t know why. She’s just… pissed at me every moment of every day. I just don’t get it. Oh well. I love her, she loves me, we’ll get through this.

**Entry 47: March 16th, 2012**

I had the most fucked-up dream last night. I woke up in my room from when I was growing up, not the one of my house that I live in with Maria. I didn’t feel like anything was off, though. I stood up, to get a glass of water or something, then left my room. Except, when I left my room, I wasn’t out in the hallway of my old house; I was on main street in my old town.

It was freaky. I immediately got a chill. It was night, and the streetlights were dim and flickering. I glanced around, and everything just felt… off.

I looked down the street and saw this really tall figure. He was too far away too make out very well, but he stood, like, seven, eight feet tall, easy. I blinked, trying to get a better look, but when I opened my eyes, he was closer! Like, several yards closer and slightly on my left!

I thought it must’ve been a trick of the light, so I blinked again, and now he was closer and on the right side of the street. Now, I was getting scared, and blinked again, trying to get him to disappear. Each time I blinked, though, he got closer and closer.

Finally, he was maybe ten feet away from me. I could see him now. He was definitely seven or eight feet tall. His skin was really pale and grey, and his black hair was really long, like, shoulder-length, and greasy as hell. He wore this really long, black trench coat that looked like it was made out of wool, not that nylon stuff or whatever.

I kept my eyes wide open, refusing to blink again and let him get closer, but he walked forward anyway. When he got close to me, he grabbed my face and turned it up, so I was looking straight into his eyes. Then, he opened his mouth, but it wasn’t a normal mouth, right? Instead of going across below his nose, it went up and down, his teeth parallel with his nose. You get what I mean?

Anyway, he opened his mouth and started screaming this really high-pitched scream. I think my ears started bleeding. He then vomited this yellow, chunky shit into my mouth, which I guess was open wide in terror.
The shit smelled like rotten eggs, and I really wanted to puke, but I couldn’t. He just kept vomiting and vomiting it down my throat and way into my stomach.

From there, everything went black. I’m not sure what happened next, but I woke up on the street, on my back. The guy was nowhere to be seen, and I got up shakily. I took a few steps down main street, then woke up for real.

I’ve had nightmares before, but never one so… vivid. Realistic. I’ve been on edge all day, snapped at Maria more than once. I can’t fucking do that. Our baby is due any day now, and she doesn’t need any more stress.
Oh well. I’ll just take it easy for a few days, and I’ll be good.

**Entry 48: April 18th, 2012**

He was born today! We named him Benjamin Carter Randall. He’s so beautiful! I’m happier than I can even begin to say. It’s crazy!

I should get back to Maria. She’s still in the hospital, just sent me home to grab some things, and I figured I’d say hi. Gotta go! WOO!

-------

That's all of them that I've listened to so far. They take a long time to write out, because Gerry talks a lot faster than I type, so I have to go back and re-listen to parts a lot. But yeah, weird shit. It sounds like the dream he had isn't unlike what a few people in that post I linked above described. Tall guy, yellow vomit, smells like rotten eggs. I'm probably going to listen to a few more audio files tonight, but I don't imagine I'll feel like typing them up tonight. You can probably look for them tomorrow, if I'm not arrested by then haha.

2rnt2g,1,2015-01-07,Help choosing an internship,[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2rnt2g/help_choosing_an_internship/,"Currently in my junior year as a CompE. Applied last year to a ton of companies but got two job offers: one is from Intel for post-silicon validation and another from Nvidia for SoC logic design and verification. Kinda stumped as to which one is better to go for. Pay, locations, and housing is good for both which leaves me to consider which one will better my future and fill my goals/area of expertise.

Some background info: heavily done projects and classes on my own on VLSI and transistor design, took one internship last summer at Atmel on ESD prevention design. I want to get into physical design and verification (layout, PNR, CTS/insertion, BIST). I feel that the Intel job has the name going for it but post silicon stuff is monkey work and boring. On the other hand, Nvidia is actual design work, but its logic/architecture design which is not one of my strengths and would make work tough and unlikeable."
2rnx84,18,2015-01-07,Amazon Online Assessment,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rnx84/amazon_online_assessment/,"Amazon reached out to me a few days ago saying they were interested in my application for the SDE Internship, which was a welcome surprise because I submitted my resume months ago and assumed they had finished recruiting.

The internship is specifically for college juniors (they were very particular about that) and to be considered further I need to take an online coding assessment.

The thing that surprised me is that the online coding assessment is only 20 minutes, which doesn't seem like much time at all. All of the people online who have mentioned an Amazon assessment were given 1.5-2 hours. I guess I'm a little bit worried about this 20-minute ""one shot chance"" and was wondering if anyone had any experience with it. Should I expect just one somewhat complex algorithm/data structure question? A bunch of short answer questions (time complexity or ""how would you approach this problem"" come to mind)?  "
2rofpp,1,2015-01-07,How long should I stay at Amazon?,zombiepotatoes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rofpp/how_long_should_i_stay_at_amazon/,"Hi,

Some background: I'm 23, I graduated from UIUC in May 2014 and started working at Amazon(Seattle) in September. I am an international(from India). I like the work I do here, its not very demanding and I get to learn stuff. Were also designing new services to our system, so there would be quite a bit of coding in the near future(which is good).

But here's my dilemma: I want to go back to India soon(maybe in the next 4 years?) and go work at a well paying job back home. Before going, I obviously want to get enough experience so that I can easily find jobs in India. I also want to try to work at a start-up here(possibly in the Bay Area). It would be fun and I might cash out some big money before going back.
As I said, I like the work i'm doing right now, but I'm not really learning any new technologies. Just learning new stuff about our own system, which would be almost useless outside of my team.
I also don't want to wait for a long time before moving back to India because I want spend some of my 20s there.

So, my question is how long should I stay here? Should I try working for a start-up soon and then get an years more experience at one of the Big 4 if it tanks? Or should I just stay in Big Companies as that would look better on my Resume? Or should I work here for an year and then try to look at jobs in small companies? Would anyone even want to hire me right now(I don't have much experience, just an internship and a job in the same team at Amazon, though I am from a really good CS college).

Thanks for reading and any comment is appreciated :)

Edit: Formatting. Also, Saving up money right now isn't a huge priority."

:--|:--
[Can you go in to the extenuating circumstances you’ve mentioned that occurred in the 2nd half of Season 3 of CBB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnfz2?context=5)|For season two, we wrote all 20 episodes before we started shooting, and we shot them all out of sequence.  I think the christmas episode with Zach was one of the first ones we shot, and I know the Halloween ep with Pee-wee was in our second week.  So we really got to figure out an order after the fact that made sense.
 |For season three, we had an earlier premiere date, but we started at the same time.  So, even though we still wrote everything before we started shooting, what I didn't know was that the first ten episodes we turned in (and the first ten we shot) had to be the first ten that aired.  The network told us that after we shot them.  Those ten were huge episodes - and ones I would have spaced out a bit, because in most of them we're doing big, big ideas.
 |Secondly, after we shot these huge episodes, the production company came to me and told me we were wildly over budget, and had to cut stuff out of the second ten eps.  So, not only were the second ten episodes slightly less ambitious, we had to cut even MORE out of them.
 |I pushed back, and we were able to keep some great stuff, like the time travel episode and the Xmas ep, but I do think the back half of the season suffers a bit from being less ambitious in scope compared to the front half.  I would have liked to have mixed them up a bit more, like a mix CD, and have there be more variety.
[Hey Scott, it looks like you have a lot of diverse guests on the upcoming season of the CBB TV show. What guest on this season surprised you with their ability to ""fit in"" to the overall attitude of the program?  Also how did Eddie George become part of an episode this season? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhpfce?context=5)|I met eddie in Washington DC at an event Obama put together for people who had helped with the ACA.  Since I am not a huge sports fan, i saw him and for some reason, knew he was a football player.  and i wondered how I would know something like that.  We had just had a football player do a scene on our show, and he was only there for like 45 minutes, and I was thinking, ""is that how I know him? Is he the same guy?""  I convinced myself it must be him, since that would be the only way I would be so familiar with this guy.  So I went up to him and asked if he had been on my show, and he very politely said no - but now he had to do it!  we chatted about him doing Shakespeare, and how athletic you had to be to do it properly.  I thought he was a cool guy, and so I wanted to find a way to get him on the show.  The episode he's on is our tribute to ""sports,"" so he was a natural fit.  When we were doing research about him for the interview, I realized his wife was on Survivor - and he was on it too - and that's how I knew so much about him!
[Hi Scott, firstly I just want to say you're a big inspiration for me. I remember reading that on your second ever stand-up performance, you were spotted by Bob Odenkirk who then asked you to write for his show. Is that right? Sorry if I've got that wrong.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnwy9?context=5)|Thank you!  Yes, bob was there and said we should write for him.  took three years, but i finally did!
[My questions though are about comedy writing. Firstly, how do you approach plotting your episodes? I find plotting in general to be very difficult but Comedy Bang Bang always has interesting plots.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnwy9?context=5)|Plotting can be tough because you're never quite sure you're doing it right - it's usually kind of like an exploration.  You try something, and figure out what it needs.  For instance, one episode we were plotting last night, I felt like it was all things happening, and no emotional connection from our charaters.  So we figured out what my own personal connection to the plot would be, and that actually helped us figure out the things that would happen more easily.  It's also helpful if your characters can have opposite points of view about what's occuring.
[Also what do you suggest a writer should do when struggling to motivate themselves? Even with this comment I feel like I should put a funny comment in here somewhere but I can't think of anything good to say.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnwy9?context=5)|To motivate, I would try to outline as much as you can before you ever start writing a line of dialogue.  If you're having trouble plotting, alternate between forcing yourself to sit in front of the computer, and grinding it out, and taking a shower or a hike, where you can just think about it.  Also, dreaming about the problem is something I tend to do - your mind can work it out while your'e resting.
[As an Earwolf / CBB fan from the UK, are there any plans to tour the show beyond the US? (Soho Theatre or Leicester Square Theatre in London are both great venues for CBB!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnh9g?context=5)|I would like to go to the UK, was thinking about asking my agent if there would be any interest.  would there be?
[Also: will there be a Comedy Bang Bang / Fernwood 2 Night crossover?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnh9g?context=5)|I tried to do a Fernwood 2 Night crossover... Norman Lear was shown CBB and he really liked it.  We cooked up a really cool crossover, which turned out to be the Fred Armisen episode in Season three.  The ""TV at Night Show"" (a Tonight Show analogue) was originally going to be ""The Tonight Show,"" which we would then reveal was the Fernwood 2 Night show, still hosted by Martin Mull and Fred Willard all these years later (Mr. Lear's idea).  I also wanted to film, as a web video, a new episode of the Fernwood 2 Night show, and got IFC to agree to finance it.  For various reasons, the timing didn't work out, which I was bummed about (even though I think that episode turned out really great).
[Follow Up to the Also: is the character of 'Dabney' a nod to Dabney Coleman?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnh9g?context=5)|Dabney probably is a nod to Coleman? Not sure!
[Hey Scott, thanks for putting out a consistently amazing podcast and TV show. Now that Comedy Bang! Bang! is about to enter it’s fourth season, when can we expect the U Talkin’ U2 To Me? TV show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhngq5?context=5)|Someone at HBO told me they were a UTU2TM fan, so I told Adam we should do a TV show there.  He said it would be like ""Tell Me You Love Me,"" but with more fucking.
[Also, I feel like I saw somewhere that you are a comic book fan. What are you currently reading?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhngq5?context=5)|I am currently reading almost everything I can - loving Spider-Man and Silver Surfer by Slott; bummed Fables is coming to an end; stuff by Jason Aaron is great, just read Ant-Man by Nick Spencer right before this started, and it really had that Superior Foes of Spider-Man feel.  Currently re-reading Hickman's FF, which is so complex and well-thought-out, it frightens me from ever attempting something similar. 
[Sliding Doorman,  Are you excited for Reggie to be on The Late Late Show? Have you already developed something for his exit from CBBTV? Super stoked for season 4.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnhrs?context=5)|I am very excited for my pal reggie... it will be a challenge, I'm sure, for him, but it'll be good to have him actually live in LA for a change.  We have a very cool goodbye episode for him... it was kind of difficult to figure out, since we had just done a fake ""series finale"" episode and a Bookie goodbye ep that kind of mined farewell material, but I think what we came up with is very funny and very touching, if I do say so myself.  A proper tribute.
[Who are your comedic influences? I get a very Pee Wee's Playhouse for adults vibe from CBB. Also do you think of all your fake names or does an intern do it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhoal1?context=5)|Late night with David Letterman, certainly.  I still use a lot of the techniques in writing taught by Bob on Mr. Show, even though they're tonally very different shows.
 |The editors usually come up with the fake names - they have a master list and cross them off one by one.  THAT SAID- i thankfully caught them recently when they accidentally repeated one, and ONLY because I happened to watch an older episode for research that day.
[Scott and Paul discuss this on 2014 BEST OF Ep. 4. Particularly in regards to what Zouks does with Andy Daly. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhp87m?context=5)|Sometimes it just naturally goes in directions people didn't expect - i'm thinking of pam murphy and will hines on a recent episode.  when we take a break, I'll usually ask, ""Is there somewhere else you were thinking of going with it, and can i lead you back there?""  Most improvisers don't care about where it ends up, because the journey is more important than the destination.
[Who are your favorite characters throughout the history of the podcast and tv show CBB? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhochd?context=5)|Love Huell Howser - am bummed about James's insistence to retire characters once they die (or like GWB, once they're out of office).  ALW is probably my favorite character with whom to interact.  I could probably talk to the Calvins Twins all day.  And Ho-Ho is a new favorite - i went around imitating her for the next few weeks.
[Do you have any plans to put your creative energy into dramatic/serious works? No slight intended; comedy is the best. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhnftd?context=5)|I have always done some dramatic stuff - i worked with Imagine Films recently for a year, working on a script of my own, but also giving notes to other ones.  There were a lot of different types of scripts that came out of it - dramas, comedies, action films, etc.  One, The Good Lie, actually made it to the screen.
[Can we expect to see any CBB pod regulars come back soon that haven’t been on in a while such as Mulaney, Pally, Tig, Silverman, Hiedecker and Richter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhngoq?context=5)|Mulaney is coming up soon; Tig would be great if I can get her; Silverman usually comes back when she has something to promote; Heidecker just ran out of time to do it last year; and yeah, I should get Richter back soon!
[Can we expect to see any new upcoming Earwolf shows soon besides The Hooray Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhngoq?context=5)|We're always looking for new Earwolf shows, but we also don't like to talk about them until they're ready to come out.  So keep your eyes peeled in '15!
[Why don't you do more videos of the podcast? They're great! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnhoadf?context=5)|Our deal with the video podcast company expired - it is very expensive to do, and they were having trouble getting advertisers for it.  I would love to work them out in the future somehow... i really think the medium and execution was great.
[Hey whats the writing staff for season 4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ro2qs/scott_aukerman_host_of_comedy_bang_bang/cnho6lj?context=5)|For the first 20 - Neil Campbell, Joe Saunders, Paul Rust, Dan Klein, Lauren Maguire, Emily Strachan, Mookie Blaiklok.  Second 20 - Neil Campbell, Joe Saunders, Lauren Maguire, Tim Kalpakis, Nick Wiger, Mike Hanford, Dave Ferguson.

2rok3s,2,2015-01-07,I'm starting my first internship soon... and I'm freaking out,-csthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rok3s/im_starting_my_first_internship_soon_and_im/,"I've already posted this to the current internship advice thread, but I decided to also make this a separate post. 

The situation: It took me months to finally get this first internship. Due to minimal amounts of projects and no previous internship experience, I was struggling to get interviews. Somehow, I managed to get extremely lucky and landed an internship with a good company (it isn't a tech company, but it's one of the top fortune 500 companies that most of you have probably heard of). It's been kind of a surreal feeling the past few weeks after I heard I was accepted, but now reality is starting to sink in and I'm starting to get scared. 

I'm feeling a case of 'imposter syndrome' that is constantly mentioned here, although mines' is probably worse because there is some truth to my inability. The position I got an internship for was web development with Sharepoint. I told the interviewer that I had no experience before with Sharepoint, and he said that it wouldn't be a problem and I could learn on the job. The position requirements said that they were looking for someone who could develop in HTML and Javascript. I have some previous experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I never did anything that great with it.

During the interview, I wasn't really asked technical questions. I was asked simple things like ""Do you know how to use developer tools"" and ""What would you do if you come across a piece of javascript code you don't recognize"" and ""Where do you go to learn about something you don't know how to do"". I was able to easily answer these questions which seemed to satisfy him, and the rest of the interview was simply the guy looking at the stuff in my github and asking me questions about some of the stuff I did.

I'm worried that I gave a false impression and that when I start work next week that I won't be able to do what is asked of me. I wasn't actually expecting to land the internship, I was mostly going for the interview experience. Now that I've gotten it, I'm not sure I will be up to par with what they think I'm capable of. 

I've been going over Mozilla's JavaScript guides and doing codewars challenges and trying to get a good grasp of the JavaScript language, but I still feel insecure. I don't have any experience with any JS libraries or frameworks (not even jQuery) and I struggle with CSS quite a bit. I've always enjoyed programming and am quite good with Java, but front-end development hasn't really been my thing. 

I don't really even know what I'm asking, I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I probably know less than what is expected of me and I would appreciate any help/guides you guys can provide in getting a good grasp of Javascript as well as HTML/CSS. 

tl;dr: Finally got a good internship, but I probably don't know Javascript as well as they think I do. Help would be appreciated."
2ropk0,1,2015-01-07,Question about Youtube Entry level Developer Interview,thatdudekak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ropk0/question_about_youtube_entry_level_developer/,"I am about to graduate in May with a Computer Science degree and got an interview with Google's Youtube group. 

I was wondering if anyone has interviewed with Google recently for an entry level position and can give me a few tips for my technical interview. They said I will have to code on Google Docs during the interview.

Also, they request unoffical transcripts for my GPA, but my GPA is not very good after this semester. I recieved a 3.1. I am really scared that they might deny me strictly on this. But I had a really tough semester with upper division courses as well as working at my internship part time for 15 hours a week. Was hoping you guys had some comments about this too.

Thanks

EDIT: Forgot to add this, I go to a small not very well known private school. So I dont know how that will go over with the Google people"
2rovor,138,2015-01-07,A small vocabulary issue,Super_Bad_64,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2rovor/a_small_vocabulary_issue/,"Nine years ago, I had to spend a week as an intern in whatever place would take me. I had the incredible luck of being taken by a computer repair store not too far for where I lived. It was a rather uneventful week, we open shop at 8:30, and little did I know, the first customer was about to change my life. (Not really, but, you know)

The guy comes in with his machine, an average ""gaming"" prebuilt, saying he has overheating issues, and wants us to put a watercooling system. (Client says, client gets.)
Boss says ""Yeah we'll do it, come back this afternoon and it should be done"". Now I know putting a water cooling circuit up in half a day is rather odd, but somehow, the other employee did it. Dunno how, but by 13:00, the thing was very much alive. We give the guy his machine, he pays, he leaves, everything good.

He comes back roaring about three hours later, saying we screwed up and fried his computer. Boss and me look at each other; It was pretty much *impossible* Bob (let's call him Bob, yeah. Bob the builder.) screwed up. We take the comp' in the back room and open it, and everything is drenched in liquid.

Mind you, we were using green liquid for that precise build, and the liquid here was pretty much anything but green. In fact we were 90% sure it was ordinary water. We quiz the guy about the presence of water in literally the entire build, and his answer was basically this:

""I wanted to clean the motherboard, so I ran the computer under the showerhead. But since you guys put a watercooling in it, it *should* not have been an issue""

Water**proofing**. He mixed watercooling with waterproofing. Oh my god. At this point me and Boss are doing our best to not burst out laughing in front of him. For god knows what reason he apparently chose to do this while the computer was somehow running (*I swear I have no idea how*, unless the comp was in the bathroom to begin with or something), so obviously everything fried.

For the record, he still wanted a computer, so we built him a reasonably priced actually-for-gaming machine. Air-cooled, this time."
2roy57,2,2015-01-07,"Feeling lost, looking for general advice. (25M, extreme wall of text)",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2roy57/feeling_lost_looking_for_general_advice_25m/,"Hi. I'm a 25 year old CSE graduate, feeling a bit lost and looking for some general advice. Not really too sure where to start. I apologize in advance for the wall of text.

During HS/college, I took an interest in mining video game data (offline - created a few undubs (replace english audio w/ original jp audio), online - find new items, quests, etc, from updates, and share the findings online), so I had a general interest in data. I like programming, but I don't feel like it's something I would enjoy as a career. To me, it's another tool in my belt, not my end-all-be-all.

During my senior year of college I did a project with a municipal utility company (they ran SAP, for anyone familiar) doing what I had an interest in - data. The project was an amazing success, and they hired me as an intern. This later converted into a full time position that they created just for me. (Completely unheard of there.) Now, I absolutely loved this job. I got to do a lot of things there, I doubt I could list them all. I created a reporting web portal, fixed old inaccurate reports created by consultants who didn't know what they were doing, identified billing errors (or just errors in general that led to revenue loss or other issues) and created reports to routinely monitor them, provided data directly to the executive team, identified opportunities to improve processes (mainly through reporting - I dabbled a little bit into GuiXT and created some nifty shortcuts for the CSR's), I even helped the collections department by leveraging our data, as well as publicly available information (It is incredibly scary what you can find out there when you know where to look ;)) to link accounts together - basically people trying to cheat the system to not have to pay their bills! Between all of the billing fixes, detective work, and process improvements, I probably helped recover/save more than half a million dollars in the two years I was there. (And that was a pretty conservative estimate - some of the things I did weren't very easy to quantify into $'s.)

That job didn't feel like a job. It felt like I was just a kid in a playground. It was the perfect job for me. Everyone loved me, and I loved everyone. I even got the employee of the year award for the entire department (maybe ~100 people I think?) in my first year. (Was nominated before I became a full time employee, lol.)

So, why did I leave? Well, a few reasons. One, I hated that state, especially the heat. I had been wanting to escape that hell hole ever since I was a kid. Two, the pay wasn't that amazing. I was making $47k/year, and my boss knew that for what they were getting, that was a steal. (I was coming pretty close to getting promoted to the next level, based purely on years of experience, fucking HR departments. Would have been $52k/yr.) Third, I also had pressure from my family to live closer to them. (Of course, when I go off to college, NOW they decide to leave that stupid state. Seriously?) Also, mainly due to reason #1, I never expected to stay here forever. Heck, it was only supposed to be a summer internship for that summer after graduation, and it ended up lasting a good two years.

So... I finally landed a job, after looking for a while. It seemed like a good fit. They wanted me to implement a CRM solution, and that was right up my alley. I knew, with my experience on the business side of my previous job, that I would be able to do an amazing job. I also figured, since I would be in an actual IT department this time, I would actually be able to fix and create things, rather than just band-aiding the best I could with the access I had. 

The reality wasn't all unicorns and rainbows. I was led to believe the role would be kinda business analyst-y, but in reality, that was only really true for the CRM implementation, which has already been successfully completed. The team using the CRM isn't very large, so the solution is pretty simple, and managing it will probably take way less than even 5% of my time from here on out. So what do I do from here on out? Mostly development work, and converting old apps to VB.NET.

Now, this job isn't TERRIBLE. The hours are decent (9 hour days, leave early on Friday, whereas in my old job I would come in at 6:30 and leave at like 2:30. I honestly miss the free time, getting home at like 5-5:30 every day I'm too drained to do anything productive at night.) I have a pretty decent 401k match - I'm putting in 4% and they're putting in 6%. I can eventually put in another 4%, and they'll raise the match to 7%, the cap. (My old job had a pension, but I never gave retirement much thought there, since I never expected to stay there long enough.) I'm also making $55k right now, which isn't that much more, and due to state income tax changes, probably a wash. Insurance is pretty good, and slightly better than the old job. I also get much less vacation time here - 12 days a year (old job was 19.) Although here I can take sick days, leave early for appointments, w/e, without using up my vacation days, whereas my old job I would either flex or take vacation time.

So overall, the job on paper is slightly better than my old one, but I honestly feel miserable at work every day. I have also been having very little drive to work. I think one of the big issues is that the dev work is pretty much just doing things for other people, it's their vision, not mine. I like coming up with ideas, and then programming and implementing them myself. That's the way that I really get any joy out of programming.

Another thing is that I think I'm suffering from depression. (The low drive thing started in the last month or two of my old job.) So I don't know how much is me miserable due to depression, or me miserable due to the job. The company is actually really solid, and most of the people who work there stay there forever because it's so good. I'm due for my annual physical, so I'm going to bring it up there and see what my doctor says. 

Anyway, that's my story. I guess I'm having a bit of a 1/4-life crisis. My very general plan right now is to go see a doctor, and if I am having issues with depression, get that fixed asap. While doing this, look for new opportunities that I would find more fulfilling. (I’m interested in moving again as it will likely be necessary for this.) I don't know if this job will grow on me (it's been 3 months now) or not. I also have the option to take my old job back if I ever want to, which while tempting, I really don't want to move back there if at all possible. 

Another thing to note is that I got a $5k signing bonus (to help relocate), which I have to pay back if I stay &lt; 1 year. (Stupid, after taxes I got like $3.2k, but I would have to return the entire 5k.) I’m also currently $6k in the hole in CC debt (Guess I should mention – no student debt) because moving here was more expensive than I thought it would be, and I had to pay double rent for a few months. I have no emergency fund, but I will have everything paid off before my 0% APR expires in August. This is the only thing making me weary of leaving right now. On the other hand, I’m not vested in my 401k until 3 years, and I honestly don’t feel like I’m going to last here that long, so it feels like I’m wasting 401k matching potential by sitting around here. I also feel that I should be making a lot more than the $55k I’m making now. (Especially if I'm doing dev work...)

So my question, besides just asking for any general advice:

Based on my experience and interests, what kind of jobs/careers should I be looking for? From my research it seems like data scientist might be a good fit, but I don’t know anything about statistics besides what I learned (and no longer remember) from the intro stats class in college. I’m also potentially interested in doing an MBA in a few years, as I think my career goal would be some sort of tech-business (or maybe just business) type thing. Another option would be doing something SAP related, since I did that for basically 2 years, although my job was more circumvent SAP instead of doing SAP. I actually had an offer (also $55k) to do SAP Utilities consulting, but I stupidly turned it down for my current job. Besides that, I just really like data, looking at it, making sense out of it, getting meaning out of it, and just plain using it for fun. :) I think my “dream job” would be working for the CIA or something, and using data to track and catch bad people, kinda “similar” to what I did for the collections dept in my first job. I doubt that would ever happen, though.

I really do want to make more money, though, and I feel that I could be doing a lot better than the $55k I’m making right now. I want to plan my best for the future, while I’m still young and without kids, and I really feel that I should be maxing my 401k and roth IRA every year, but I’m nowhere near that position right now.

Also, I know this is something I’ll have to decide for myself, but in your opinion, do you think I should toughen it out, or just try to recoup and move on?

Any general advice, career/job suggestions, heck even company suggestions, or even just a positive comment, would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you very much."

- Went to cook and came back to a computer that mysteriously shut itself off. Would not post unless I pulled the GPU out. After GPU was pulled out, computer would POST with full bios control but refuses to boot into windows. When plugging in GPU without power from PSU, GPU pcb had a capacitor/integrated circuit that started glowing red... pulled gpu out and noticed that particular capacitor clearly had burn damage around it (see position C525) [link](http://i.imgur.com/N2iIdet.jpg)

Hey r/TechSupport, this is my first time posting a real ""post"" so I would like to begin by apologizing and hope that you'll forgive me. I will also answer questions as quick as a I can during work hours, and after work hours for sure.

Here goes the story: 

About two evenings ago I was home playing games after a day being an intern (approximately 5:30pm). At around 8pm after playing some Sleeping Dogs and the occasional redditing, I went to cook dinner/lunch for tomorrow leaving Sleeping Dogs idling thinking it would be fine. After an extended dinner session with me and the roommates, I returned to my room at approximately 10:30pm to find that my computer turned itself off. When attempting to boot up the computer, there was no response. Due to this, I messaged some tech savvy friends who have plenty of experience with their own rigs who told me to start by pulling components until it at least posted. Following this recommendation I pulled my gpu which then made my computer at least post and get to the bios. In the bios it registered all my parts (ssd, storage HDD, ram, cpu) but when I went to boot up the system, it would go past the motherboard splash screen, flicker to a black screen with an underscore flashing on the top left corner, and then return to the splash screen in a continuous loop. 

I am now currently stuck at the position where I know for sure my gpu, which seemed to spontaneously combust at one of the capacitor/integrated circuit points at the back of the gpu's pcb, is dead but not sure what else is dead. Any recommendations would be great as this rig is only about 8 months old and was my first big purchase with my internship money.  Thanks!

2rr4zo,1,2015-01-08,Preparing for Temp Work,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rr4zo/preparing_for_temp_work/,"Hi All. I am a fourth year in college and I'm going to take an extra fall semester (so four-and-a-half years total) to finish my degrees. I would like to enter graduate school in the Fall of 2016, but that leaves me a Spring and Summer where I have no real dependable source of income (plus I'll have (hopefully less than) about $10k in loan debt). I would like to fill this gap with a temp position, and so I've come here with a few questions (that I did not see on the FAQ/from searching old posts).

To give a little background on me: I will (hopefully) be graduating from a large, well-known institution in the Bay Area with degrees in CS and Math and (hopefully) a &gt;3.5 GPA. Within CS, I've mostly focused on PL and systems (e.g. compilers and operating systems) as well as a bit of theory (mostly just algorithms), so I'm well-versed in Java, C, Python, C++ as well as various build systems and debugging tools (e.g. make, git, gdb, etc). However, I haven't taken any of the more industry-oriented courses like software engineering, distributed systems, user-interface design, or databases. I've got a decent background in SQL and HTML/CSS, though. I could probably refresh myself with the details of PHP without too much effort, as well. I also had an internship where I believe my performance was quite good (and I picked up a good amount of experience with development for Hadoop).

Anyway, here are my questions:

* Given my skill-set and background, is it reasonable for me to expect to be able to get a temp position next Spring/Summer?
* Would applying for position next Fall give me enough time?
* How does pair differ for temp positions? What should I expect (in relation to full-time positions)?
* How should I best prepare (besides just for interviews)?
* How are temps usually treated within a company?
* Does anyone think this is a bad idea? Should I reconsider what I am doing? I'm all ears to any advice.

Bonus question (not incredibly important):

* Is there any market for OCaml, Standard ML, or Haskell programmers? I really enjoyed these the most (along with LISP dialects). I know OCaml is used somewhat in finance, but I'm guessing that's more for people who want long-term careers in that area."

Before that I knew little to nothing about the field. On a whim I enrolled in some courses in community college and after two years (this past May) I completed an associate's in computer programming.  I also have a bachelor's degree, but it's unrelated to CS.

When I first got out of school, I was unable to find a job due to my lack of experience.  I admit, I was more than a little naive in my expectations.  I realized soon enough that 'education' means very little and it's what you can actually do that matters to employers.  The only place that would hire me was the place where I completed my internship.  It's a small consulting company that works on iSeries/AS400 type stuff.  We maintain and write code for clients that have been around since before PCs and still run their shops on this old legacy technology.  I code extensively in RPG and CL on green and black screens.  The stuff is really old and not relevant to anything modern.  I'm also paid very little.  I realize that if I keep doing this for a few more years, maybe I could move to another city and get paid more, but eventually RPG programmer jobs are going to disappear as this stuff becomes more and more obsolete, and there really is no long term future in this.  As of right now though, relocation is not an option for me and there isn't another competitor I can switch to.

My goal now is to move on from here and work in SOMETHING more modern.   I would work for FREE in my spare time just to get something on my resume so I can have a future.  The thing is though, I'm having a hard time teaching myself.  I work really well in teams, and I have a desire to learn... but when I try to do things on my own, I just sort of feel lost and lose direction/motivation... I tend to get overwhelmed.  I really wish I could work in a team or with a group of people, or maybe find a mentor, but I don't really know how to make that happen.  I also feel a little ashamed in how little I know... I'm relatively old to be doing this kind of work and know so little.  I've had a few semesters of basic programming languages, like Java, C++, HTML/CSS and JavaScript... but right now my skills in those are pretty limited.   

TL;DR  -  Stuck in a dead-end legacy system coding job, want to move forward.  Feeling lost... adrift.  Would like to network and work with others on some projects to get something else on my resume, but not sure how to make that happen.

Looking for guidance, more info inside.",College_Throwawayy,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2rsatp/ive_made_some_pretty_major_mistakes_so_far_in/,"Hey guys, I am currently a junior at a small, mid tier private university in the south. 

Two and a half years ago when I started school, I was really fucking depressed and made some absolutely terrible decisions, and now, I am trying to fix my mistakes. I entered school being naive to how the real world works and decided to study what I liked studying in high school: ***psychology***. By the time I pulled myself out of depression and realized what a monumental waste of time psychology is if you don't plan on going to grad school for it, the damage had been done. Me being the fucking genius I am decided to get all of the ""hard upper level major courses"" out of the way while I was a freshman (I did the equivalent of 3 full semesters of courses my freshman year) and sophomore, and by the time I realized how hard I was fucking up, I was more than halfway through sophomore year with 90% of the psych major completed. 

I have since realized that I have a passion for marketing, branding, entrepreneurship, and business in general and have been studying those subjects independent of school for almost a year. I also just took my first official business courses last semester and fell in love. I haven't had this much fun learning about something in a long time. On top of that, I also was able to land a marketing internship last summer and had a blast (while earning a pretty sweet letter of recommendation in the process ;)). I remember freshman year considering business and deciding against it because it seemed super boring. Looking back on that now, I find it funny how I instantly judged something without taking the time to look into it for myself. 

Now when I was a freshman, I received pretty abysmal marks. In my first semester, I received a whopping 1.4. I also will add that I hated my university and that combined with my pretty terrible depression is what led to my low scores. I ended up losing about half of my almost full ride scholarship but was able to begin to pull up my grades before they took the rest away. Since that first semester, I have been making steady improvements to my GPA, and just last semester, I got a 3.8. My overall GPA is currently a 2.9, but I've scored above a 3.0 for the last four semesters and above a 3.5 for the last two. I feel like this is a good time to mention this, but I have kicked depression's ass and am now a generally happy person for the first time in my life.

At this point, I really want to transfer. My friends from high school and friends that I made at my current university that transferred all ended up at schools in NYC, San Francisco, Seattle, and San Diego. After visiting them at their universities, I realized how much of a fucking terrible fit my current school is for me and how much I want to end up in a modern, cosmopolitan city after I graduate. After explaining my situation to my career advisor, she flat out told me that my school has minimal connections anywhere where I am interested ending up. She suggested that transferring was probably going to be my best option.

To be honest, I'm sort of at a loss about what to do. I want to transfer and I have completed most of the common app and have two awesome letters of recommendation (one academic, one from my internship), but I am just not sure how I should represent myself on my application and in my essay. Just for the record, I will be transferring as a psych major. Should I be like, ""hey, I messed up and I want to pursue business"" or should I try and play it off like I still want to pursue psych? Also, I am aware that I will probably lose a years worth of credits if I transfer, but I think that at this point, it will be worth it in the long run. My parents have also said that they will support me for up to 5 years total in undergrad, but after that, I will have to take out loans (which would end up being a substantial size because of the schools in the locations I am looking at). 

(By the way, I am considering changing majors if I transfer and spending something like 6 years overall in school. Would this be a good decision, or should I just stick with psych at this point? Would taking out 50k in student loans be worth it?)

To be completely honest, even though I don't like it, my school is a pretty great school. It's not too high in any national rankings or anything, but the university administration and my professors seem like they have a genuine concern about the well being and future success of students. Its just that I don't feel like they are going to be able to help me get to the places I want to go to in life. I guess what I'm saying is that even if I can't transfer, it's not going to be the worst thing in the world, but I feel like it is in my best interest to change schools. 

What would you do if you were in my position? How do you think I should angle my transfer application? Also, are there any other subreddits I should cross post this to?

If you have made it this far, I would like to personally thank you for reading my really fucking long and disorganized post. If you are reading this and are entering college or are currently in college and are struggling with issues similar to what I am currently going through or what I have gone through, I hope that this post was somewhat helpful or informative. Thanks for listening and thanks in advance for the advice!

Can anyone recommend a resource for me to get a quick crash course on the topics, so at least I can talk intelligently about them?

From the interview prep documentation I was given:
**Operating systems:** You should understand processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they all work. Understand deadlock, livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a process needs and a thread needs. Understand how context switching works, how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of ""modern"" concurrency constructs."

I'd be enrolling in the first term summer semester that ends in June (may-june 2015) to complete a prerequisite CS course for a number of CS courses in the fall semester (sept-dec 2015) so I can graduate on time next spring (2016). 

Is it usual to be offered the internship for the months of July - August for approx 8/9 weeks, or will I be eliminated from the pool of candidates (or my offer rescinded) because of my availability. I've considered all options when to do this course but it's mandatory I complete it before the fall semester. Any advice appreciated from past interns and recruiters.

A couple approaches I've considered:

1.Telling my recruiter about my availability
2.Wait on the offer and then drop the bombshell on them
3. Arrange with my professor to get the exam period deferred because of this 'big opportunity'
4. Ask cscareerquestions on their opinion

TLDR: Is 8/9 weeks a totally unusual internship length?"
2rspmr,1,2015-01-08,Neverending Comcast Nightmare,TMXVI,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2rspmr/neverending_comcast_nightmare/,"Since I have an assignment due in a few hours I'm just going to post the 'letter' I sent to 'Tom K' on the Comcast Support page with my information removed. Please, let me know any tips that you have for what I can do to get this issue resolved and/or have this blow up so Comcast will be forced to acknowledge their horrendous business practices.

Hi Tom,

I can't even put into words how upset I am. I've had THE WORST customer service possible from your company. Your customer service employees are either not getting the proper training they require, or they are being trained to be horrible customer service providers. Sadly, I think its the latter. I've spent the last two hours trying to get an issue from November (two months ago!) resolved. Each time I call, a new issue gets added to the last issue. Your company charges outrageous prices, and then tries to slam customers with additional services they do not ask for, and then require the customer to go out of their way to just have things corrected to how they should have been in the first place. I'll create an easy to understand timeline to better explain the issues I've been having. I’m a busy guy, so the repeated attempts to resolve this issues are an extreme inconvenience to me. To put this in perspective for you, I work full time, have a nearly 2 year old son, my wife goes to school full time and works in the evenings, and I’m going to school full time pursing my MBA. Time is precious to me, and I’ve been wasting an awful lot of it trying to get these issues resolved.

According to John or JR - I don't remember which one. The first call took place Nov. 1st, 2014,

I had been experiencing slow internet speeds for a while. Prior to this call, I had stopped into a Comcast store in Lansing, MI to discuss this issue. The customer service rep (CSR) advised that I had a Docsis 2.0 modem and the latest is Docsis 3.0. She explained that I could be experiencing 'throttling' due to the outdated technology. When I couldn't bear the speeds any longer (11/1/14) I purchased a new modem from Walmart and contacted customer service to have the modem activated - since it can't just be plug and play, I was forced to call Comcast to have the MAC address registered.

I spoke to a representative that spoke very poor English, and he promised to assist with my issues. I read the MAC address to him multiple times and he said it was handled. While on the call, the rep (as trained by Comcast) was trying to push additional services onto me. He informed me that I should be getting more speed for the money I was paying and he could upgrade me at no charge to me. I agreed, because that made sense. Then he says, ""oh and you will also have a home phone."" (Paraphasing, but thats the main point). I stated that I didn’t want a home phone. He replied with “in order to upgrade you, you’ll have a phone now, just plug one into the wall.” I again firmly stated that I did not want a phone and that if I had to have one to get upgraded, then to cancel the upgrade. Since I had him on the line, I had him check my speeds and they were still awful I was pulling down 3-5mb/s out of the 25 I pay for monthly. Yet the upload speeds were fine. Because of this fact, the support tech stated that he believed it was a Comcast issue and he’d send a tech to my home free of charge. I verified with him that this would be free of charge. He assured me it would be. So I agreed to have a tech visit. At this point, the call ends and I feel pretty okay, I hate having services pushed on me, so that was irritating, but I felt that my issue was being resolved and that I was reasonably helped.
Within the window promised, not one, but two techs showed up to my apartment. They tested my speeds and saw that the service was bad. The first thing the tech noticed was that the support agent I spoke to over the phone did not register the correct MAC address. He said that could be the cause of the slow issues. He registered the correct address and sent a refresh signal (which was something the support agent did a few times over the phone). Improved, but still slow. When testing speeds on a hardlined connection the speed was working, but over wireless it was not. The tech said I needed to get a new router, I said that I would purchase one the next day. Let me be very clear, at no point did the tech say he would order me a router, or did I agree to anything of the sort. None of this was mentioned. Also, due to the speed of the shipment, (the very next day) it is my assumption that the support agent over the phone on Nov. 1st requested a wireless gateway be shipped to me. The techs left, and I was a little bummed to have to purchase a new router, but did so the very next day, and began experiencing  the promised speeds. The nightmare was over, I thought. I couldn’t have been more wrong…
As I just mentioned, the very next day my wife texted me while at work that I had a package delivered. I was baffled. Must be a mistake I replied, I didn’t order anything. I got home and naturally opened the box to see what COMCAST had sent. It was a wireless gateway. One that I never requested nor was I aware was being sent or ever agreed to be sent. I immediately called customer service and spoke to a female who apologized for the confusion and advised that I send the gateway back to avoid being charged. I explained that I was upset, that I’m very busy and I am frustrated that I have to go out of my way to send back a product that I never requested. I figured that I would have to return the product to the Comcast store which would (not including drive time) take 1-2 hours, as it always does. The agent assured me that I could just return the product to my nearest UPS store and they would handle it for me. I still tried to stress that I was upset by this, but was offered nothing by the agent. So to recap, service not working correctly, initial agent doesn’t register new product properly, tries to upsell, and sends me unwanted equipment. Great start, right?
I go to the UPS store and, surprise, no return info. The guy says he can’t do it. Seeing my exasperation, he then talked to someone in the back and took the package and assured me that it would be sent back.  End of story, right? Nope.
In December I get my bill, and I’ve been charged for the service visit AND the equipment. I call Comcast again, and spoke to a rep that appeared to be fairly helpful.  I explain my situation and he understands completely, apologizes and tells me that he cannot do anything himself and that what I have requested requires supervisor review and approval. He advises me and I quote, “DO NOT pay your bill until the supervisor calls you, as the credit will have not been applied, the supervisor will call you within two days.” Two days pass, two weeks pass, no call. I get more bills from Comcast, but no return call as promised. I finally call back with the most recent bill and request to speak to a supervisor. I have a rep named John, and no I didn’t get his agent number – like most reps, John didn’t offer that. I explain that the previous agent told me he couldn’t help me and that I needed to speak to a supervisor, he continued to give me the runaround and eventually I had to tell him my story. He agrees that he cannot help and places me on hold. The call lasted over 16 minutes and I was disconnected while on hold. Needless to say, I was furious. 
So, I call back. This time I got an agent by the name of JR. I was very unfriendly with JR. It was not JR’s fault, but I was/am beyond upset at this point. He calms me down and gets me to tell my story to him.  Keep in mind this is now the 4th call I’ve made  to Comcast, and each time I have to repeat the story, to be told, “okay sir, I understand your issue, let me place you on hold”. JR gave me his agent number and promised to have a supervisor call me within two hours. He then asked for additional information to pass along. I explained the story again, and JR took note. He advised for the credit for the service visit to be applied a supervisor would need to review the Nov. 1st call, and if it transpired as described by me, I would be credited, as well as credited for the returned device and rental fee. JR says to avoid wasting any more of my time,  he will instead have the supervisor call within 72 hours  after they had a chance to review the initial call. I said no, that I wanted to speak to a supervisor today as well.  He said when the supervisors were out of their meeting one would give me a call in two hours. It was 4:04pm 1/8/2015, and so I told JR that if I had not received a call by 6:15pm today, I would call back myself.
The call came within that period. It was a female supervisor, and I didn’t catch her name or agent number but I believe it was Christine? She asked me to explain my story… I did, for the FIFTH time now. She kept muting herself, and I would occasionally pause and ask if she was still there. I am led to believe she was not paying attention. She would come back on and say, “I’m still here”. And then at one point, she didn’t respond and kept acting like she couldn’t hear me. I proceeded to check my phone to verify that I had not muted myself. I hadn’t. I said, “There are no problems on my end, I know you can hear me.”  At which point she hung up on me. This was the second time I was disconnected today!!! Within 3 hours! Unbelievable. To further the illusion she tried calling a few different times, each time I was greeted with silence on the other end of the line. To prove this I placed the phone on speaker and video taped this, as I was called back 8 times from my call record. Each time, silence. To ensure it was not my phone, I restarted it – just in case. When I turned it back on – same thing, and I had a voicemail. I listened. Nothing but dead air. Again to prove it was a Comcast issue, I video taped the playing of the dead air voicemail, as well as myself calling another number to prove it was not my phone. Then the Comcast survey called and that worked fine too. I also recorded that with my camera to show that this staged technical difficulty was just that, a farce.
Now, to whoever actually reads this, I’m beyond upset. I’ve made video recordings of the faked ‘technical issues’ that I’ve experienced when I received the call backs from the supervisor , as well as the dead air voicemail. I’m currently sending “Tom K” this “feedback” about my horrible experience that one of his probably unpaid interns will read or maybe just delete without reading. But I’m fed up. I’m going to also contact the FCC, and BBB about your horrible company and the horrible customer ‘service’ you provide. I also plan to submit this letter/and or the video recordings on Reddit, in hopes that this gets out and through public embarrassment your company is forced to change its intentionally bad business practices. Please feel free to contact me directly by phone at (###-###-####), or by email at (tmxvi's email address).  I sincerely hope to hear from you soon,

2rsrho,1,2015-01-08,Where can I find internship opportunities with smaller tech companies?,cornerly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rsrho/where_can_i_find_internship_opportunities_with/,"I'm a sophomore in college who just switched into CS in the Fall 2014 semester. I have a lot of coding experience on my CV, but since I was originally planning to code for the medical industry, my previous experience is very health oriented. I want to find more relevant internships where I can code for app/software development rather than writing software for research labs. 

I've been lucky enough to interview with a few of the tech giants such as Google and MSFT but with no luck :'(. I figure the best way to get more experience that is more CS related and improve my skills while making some impact would be to work at a smaller tech firm where I can develop my programming skills and build some projects to add to my resume. I'm having trouble finding these internships though since a lot of internships are with non tech-related companies. 

TL;DR: Is there a site where I can see a list of opportunities with smaller tech firms (startups or more) rather than internships with non tech firms or the tech giants? Thanks "

2rswec,1,2015-01-08,I need life / career advice: school or no school?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rswec/i_need_life_career_advice_school_or_no_school/,"I am 30 years old and already have a BS in history from UW-Madison. I have been working at the university in an administrative role and last semester took UW-Madison's Intro to CS course. I earned an A and placed in the top 10% of my class. I began automating tasks in my admin job and now I want to move to a position in development. I was hoping to pursue a second B.S. in Computer Science but they have a rule that you are not allowed to earn a second undergraduate degree. They made it sound like there was some leniency in granting permission to pursue a second B.S., but I met with the academic dean and even though she sympathized with my situation, she said there was nothing she could do.

I am not sure what to do now. I could (A) take classes as a non-degree seeking student and eventually apply for an MS, but that means that I am not eligible for most student internships while I take these classes and most courses are difficult to get into without being declared in the major.  I could (B) pursue a second BS at UW-Platteville. They are well known for their engineering program in the midwest and offer a rigorous Software Engr program. They do not have a restriction for second degrees.  I could also (C) try to apply to entry level QA jobs and hope for the best.     

School is appealing to me because I am under the impression that it will be the best for my career opportunities long-term. I don't want to be in a position where I am desperate for anyone to hire me .. I want to have options so there's a better chance of enjoying the work I do for the next 40 years of my life.

I am open to the idea of online programs but I personally learn and perform best in brick and mortar institutions.  

What do you recommend, A, B, C, or some other idea entirely?

Thank you for your guidance!"

Considering Macbook Pro or Lenovo Yoga 2?",dumblaptopbaby,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/2rtczm/usa_13_1200ish_college_worklight_gamingpersonal/,"**Country of purchase**: USA

**Budget range**: Ideally less than or about equal to 1200 with everything included (warranties/customer support plans, etc). Cheaper is definitely better if possible.

**Purpose**: Mostly for schoolwork, typing lecture notes, research, etc., with some casual gaming and video-watching? I hope this answers the question.

**Screen size preference**: About 13"", but that's flexible. Just so long as I can carry it between classes.

**OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux)**: Windows or Mac. I'm not a huge huge fan of Windows 8, but I tend to be grumpy about new things before adjusting, so it would probably be fine -- the touchscreen might actually be nice for notetaking.

**Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings)**: I'd like to be able to do Portal, Goat Simulator, run GBA/DS/Gamecube emulators, shit I find on Steam, etc.

**Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.)**: No major requirements.

**Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support)**: Crying hysterically and posting on Reddit?  May be able to get some help from college library.  If I got a Macbook Pro, I'd get Applecare (which is one of the strongest appeals of a Macbook for me).

**Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility)**: I'm familiar with Macs and I've seen people at my internships, etc. struggle with compatibility, but I also feel like they're a little overpriced. I also like the wider range of programs available for PCs. Lenovos seem to be nice but I'm flexible.

**Any particular style that you like (examples are great)**: Anything that isn't ugly is good. I'm a fan of ""sleek"" and compact sorts of looks (shiny silver kinda like the chrome Macbooks or smooth black like Lenovos) but I also love weird colors or whatever. Mostly not clunky would be my preference.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)**

**Long battery life -vs- Low weight**: Balanced.
**Build quality -vs- Low price**: Build quality.
**Low noise/heat -vs- High performance**: Balanced but leaning toward performance.

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**
**High resolution screen**: Ehh, probably not?
**A great keyboard**: Maybe. I have smallish hands and it's annoying to type on some keyboards.
**A great touchpad/mouse buttons**: I don't think so.
**Great audio**: No.
**List any features that are critical: (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)**

I can't think of anything. Durability matters a lot, though, and ongoing customer support is A+.

I've been considering the 13"" Lenovo Yoga 2. Potentially, I could do a Macbook Pro 13"" with retina display and the Apple Care options appeal to me, but even with the student discounts, it's pricier than I really want it to be.  Are there any other, better options?  "

Desperately seeking advice and how will this affect me down the road?,ebolalol,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2rtgcb/im_at_a_really_awkward_and_transitional_stage_as/,"I am currently finishing school, in my last semester. Let me further explain my really awkward stage:


After doing 3 semesters worth of internships, I decided to ""settle down"" and got a student job last semester at my school. Unfortunately I was let go 3 months because I was unhappy with it (student jobs are grossly TOO easy and I like being busy and challenged). Note that before this, I have held non-student jobs such as working at a high end restaurant but decided to quit to pursue internships.


This brings us to November. I am desperately job hunting now but have a problem: an upcoming 3-week vacation with my family that was planned in advance. I did many interviews that liked me (and my previous experience) but found the vacation to be a problem. Luckily I landed a seasonal position at a retail store that was okay with my vacation since it was seasonal. 

Now I am back and it is almost mid-January without a job. I have applied to many places but HERES the problem: I am graduating in 4  months!

I am applying to both career related jobs (zero interviews) and non career jobs such as hostessing (multiple interviews that expressed concern with my upcoming graduation).

Needless to say I have not gotten second calls back and may very well be out of a job for a while until I graduate. 

How will this affect me in the future? I have always held a job, if not 2 (job and jnternship) for all of college. How can I explain the gap? How do I go about my student worker position that I was basically fired from? I kind of need the extra job for financial purposes... How do I go about this without sounding too desperate?





**TL;DR:** Last semester senior was fired from a student position because I was always too bored and showed dissatisfaction. Has previous job experience but can't get a new job because of a pre-planned family vacation. Lands a seasonal temp position. Goes to vacation and comes back jobless. Applies to jobs but no second call back probably because I am graduating in 4 months. No calls from career related jobs either, but I will keep applying for post-grad jobs.

How to explain getting fired at a STUDENT position (so easy like what lol)? How to explain gap if I don't get a job for months? Will this hurt me? I need money though so I need job. SOS

Thanks /r/jobs!"

If I do both, I think I won't work efficiently on my thesis project and will have my graduation delayed by a semester.

I was hoping to get some career advice on what to do to position myself to work in data science; it would be super cool if it would involve machine learning or NLP as well. 

I'm currently a a junior in an operations research/financial engineering program; which basically means I take a mix of statistics, applied math, mathematical finance, and OR courses. I'm also minoring in computer science. 

I have an internship offer to join a data science engineering team at a mid-size startup - but my role is more along the lines of software engineering, which is why I'm kind of hesitant to accept it immediately. I definitely gravitate more towards wanting to formulate, build, iterate, and test in Python or R rather than build a spec out to production scale.   I applied to a few more data science/data/'business intelligence' type roles, but don't know when I'll hear back. 

If I'm kind of on the fence between looking for a straight data analysis role, and software engineering for data science, should I go with the one that I think I'm weaker on/won't have much exposure to otherwise? (I think that I'd be more willing to develop side projects on data analysis/modeling than in implementing something in production-quality code). 

Also, I'm interested in going to grad school for a PhD in applied statistics or OR (not counting on it, given my not-terribly stellar GPA and lack of published research; working on both, though). Would they possibly care about either kind of experience? 


tl;dr is a software engineering role on a data science team, as opposed to a more traditional data analyst or BI role, still a good next step for becoming a data scientist/modeler? "

When I started I didn't think it would be nearly this big!! I hope you have the patience to get through this...thank you...**

Hey everyone,

I hope this is as organized as it sounds, but I've been really introspective recently and I'm looking back over the past couple year as well as looking at the present and I have a lot of very strong feelings about my present state and I'm, well, I'm kind of scared. I just recently finished up a five month gig and I have some fond memories of, but as I reflect on it I can't help but feel like my performance was lacking. I look back even further over the past year at the jobs I had worked and I can't help but feel that I have a hard time ""keeping it together"". Focusing on a specific task is hard and accomplishing things on time is just as hard. Likewise I feel defensive, aggravated, and I completely lack confidence as well. I also took defeat and criticism hard, but weirdly, what I took even hardest was when others exceeded expectations.

Now, in the present. I'm unemployed and trying to find work. I'm currently living with my parents, whom I'm grateful toward for providing me with a bed, room, and food while I work to find employment. However we don't share the same views and at times it causes stress. Not only that but the area itself is rather...empty for someone in their mid-20s. 

I'm currently trying to relocate myself to another city. One that would be more practical for my field, however, I don't have a job nor the finances to do so. I'm using a friends address to apply for jobs with the hope that I'll be able to line up several in a week and maybe get something out of it. Since December I've applied to over 50 jobs and still haven't even gotten any interview. I've started to lower my expectations a bit regarding the jobs I could land, but now i'm looking at paid internships and financially they can't possibly work. I'm also still struggling to 'keep it together', I often look at a job posting and start on writing a cover letter only to walk away after 30 seconds. Hardly anything keeps my focus now, whether it's watching a movie, reading a book, playing a video game, within minutes my mind is wandering or I'm looking at my phone. 

 Meanwhile I continue to compare myself to my peers which probably isn't healthy ether. A friend of mine, who I worked with before, keeps urging me to move just recently landed an internship that pays well. It was an internship I had an opportunity to pursue  but chose not to, mostly because she had already moved up there and needed money more than I did (unlike me, she didn't have a home to go back to). However, as she tells me about this internship I can't help but feel jealous. Mostly because it seems like a great internship, it pays well, but the kicker is that they call her an ""associate"". What really makes me jealous is that every day I keep applying for internships that pay far less than what she is making and are far less interesting. I don't expect any gratitude from her, or a thanks or anything, that would be crazy. I just hate that I didn't even try when the opportunity presented itself.

Recently I've become more reclusive. In an effort to just focus on getting a job and relocating asap I spend long hours holed up in my room applying nonstop. It comes in bursts still though, yesterday I managed to knock out 7 job applications, today 0. I'm starting to think maybe I should broaden my search to look into other cities, but nearly all of my friends are in this one place and I'm worried about what will happen if I relocate to a city where I know nobody. I also worry that if I land a job I'll under-perform relative to my peers again.


**tl;dr:** I'm fiercely competitive to the point that I think it may be obsession. At the same time I lack complete confidence in myself in everything that I do. I'm unemployed and living with my parents while I'm in my 20s. When I'm not struggling to write cover letters for jobs I don't care about I'm playing video games while I talk with my friends about the amazing lives they have. 

I'm going up to visit said friends next week. I am also meeting with two temp agencies, hopefully I can line up a few more interviews between now and then to make the trip a bit more worthwhile. I do think that a change of scenery will help though."

I basically want to make a move fast before the other interns try anything. I want to be the guy who keeps her happy, but it's hard to show her that when you're in the workplace (and surrounded by a bunch of full-timers).

Are there any subtle things I can do that won't make me look like an idiot infront of the full-timers (or other co-ops)? Also, how can I.. make her interested in me? It's my second last co-op term, so it's not like I'll have all the time in the world once we're back in Waterloo.

I literally have zero experience dating, but I'm positive I found the one.

For those of you who have dated your coworkers, how did that go?

I know it's a co-op related question, but I'm not quite sure I should ask my co-op advisor about this."

I need an internship to finish my BA, and I can get the internship in the Spring or Summer. I've applied to several in the last couple weeks, and have already heard back from some employers about setting up interviews. 

I applied to Company X that I really, really want to work for because in my field, they're one of the most desirable employers in the nation. The application period closes in 2 months so I won't even know if I'm being considered until then. However, I feel I have a pretty solid chance at landing this internship.

A couple of other companies have already expressed interest in interviewing me, and there's a possibility that I will receive an offer before Company X even selects candidates to interview. However, if I accept an internship now, I obviously will not be able to do the other internship with Company X.

My question is: is it wise to wait around for the internship I really want but am not sure I will even get? Is there a way I can email HR and ask them if I should wait to hear back from them (as in, do I have a decent shot or is there no future for me with their company)?

**I'm super nervous, guys**. I don't think I'm that good at programming, and MathWorks is apparently really difficult to get into. I'm not even sure how I got in my freshman year, it feels like a fluke. I had a MATLAB technical interview my freshman year, and it was easy enough that they hired me.

[Thanks for the AMA! I am in fashion design college now and you basically have my dream job! How did you get into costuming? Would you say it is  a difficult industry to break into? Is it what you expected? Thanks Again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjys4v?context=5)|Hello! Thank you for your question! Best of luck to you. I started interning my 2nd year of college. I got my foot in the door by emailing anyone I could find contact info for who was linked to a network HR department of Costume Department. I utilized the resources in my College Career Center. After many emails, the timing finally worked out, and I got my first internship for a Costume Department for the TV show Kath and Kim. From there, I got my following internships by networking and making contacts. I worked my way up on shows such as The Office, The Voice, and Glee from being an Intern, to a Production Assistant, and now a Union Costumer. It can be difficult and a bit discouraging at times, but if you are persistent and passionate, you will find a way to reach your dreams! It is what I expected and more!! Cheers! All the best.
[How much thought and effort goes into each outfit? Do different scenes get more attention? As a guy who will gladly wear a white v neck and jeans everyday I have a limited style experience (except when I have to dress up.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjwns2?context=5)|At the beginning of each season, and when a new character is cast, we spend a lot of time creating mood boards for each characters' style, and have 1 to 2 hour long fittings with the actors to make sure everyone is happy with the looks. When we shop, we make sure to keep both the character's vibe and the actor in mind. We do so in order to make an outfit that will look great on the actor and stay true to the character they are portraying.  Different scenes do get different types of attention. For example, musical numbers often take more time to pull together. We have a huge cast, and we want to make sure everyone looks their best and goes with the theme of the number.
[Hey Andrea! I was wondering what a typical fitting is like, and how much input the actors have on what they wear? Is it all business or do you have time to joke around, catch up etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjuwkw?context=5)|Typically, we schedule most big fittings for 1-2 hours. These fittings are for every day outfits that we put into the characters' ""closets."" If we have a performance costume fitting, these only may take 15-30 mins. The actors definitely have input. We take into consideration their thoughts and how they feel in the clothes. We want them to be comfortable and feel their best. We have fun! We joke and catch up, but ultimately we are there to create great costumes for everyone to enjoy!
[Hi Andrea :\) can you share a few of your favourite memories with the cast? Also why did Tina's look change so drastically between season 2 and 3? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjtodp?context=5)|One of my main favorite moments was during season 1 when I was only an intern. I took a photo with all the original cast members sitting in the choir room. I also loved when we did a dress rehearsal with all the guys performing Applause. Their reactions to their costumes were hilarious. 
[Have you ever shared that photo online? Can/will you? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjumr0?context=5)|Here is the link to part of that image! [Photo\] (\[Link to i.imgur.com](https://i.imgur.com/eRNLCsk.jpg))
[Hi Andrea! Thanks for doing this ama! My question is, what's the most challenging part about being a costumer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjutfp?context=5)|Hi! You're welcome!! Thanks for the question! I adore my job, so I wouldn't necessarily say this is the most ""challenging,"" but one thing we need to be great at is time management. This comes into play when we shop and need to get back in time the same day for fittings.
[What did Darren hesitate more on wearing - the lobster sweater, the Gaga tail shorts, or the Roar loin cloth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjvujr?context=5)|He and the rest of our cast always make the costumes they end up wearing look fantastic no matter what. Typically though, if they didn't feel confident or comfortable in something, it wouldn't go past our fitting with them. Their happiness is very important to us! :)
[Can you please tell us a little bit about your favorite costume for Kurt this season? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnju9ix?context=5)|I can't spoil anything yet about this season, but my favorite from last season was Kurt's Tom Ford proposal blazer. The color and texture were beautiful! Check it out on: [Spylight\] (\[Link to www.spylight.com](http://www.spylight.com/shows/glee/episodes/glee-season5-episode1))
[Which other projects do you hope to work on? What would your dream project be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjtxin?context=5)|I would love to work on more films. I just worked on a film by Blake Jenner and Melissa Benoist called Billy Boy. It was an amazing experience. My dream project would be a tv show/ film set in the 1950s or 1960s.
[How do you incorporate each actors personal style into their characters wardrobe? And do the actors themselves help with ideas for their costumes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjts8m?context=5)|Great question! When we have fittings with the actors, we make sure they are completely comfortable in what they are wearing. This is how we collaborate with them to combine some of their personal style and vibe into their characters' looks. 
[Hi Andrea! Is there any specific reason for Santana’s drastic wardrobe change in season 4 when she started wearing almost exclusively dresses, as opposed to season 2 where she wore more casual clothes when was temporarily off the Cheerios?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjtm4q?context=5)|We looked at this change in her look as being a reflection of growing up and coming into her own. We like to coin her dresses in our department as ""Santana dresses.""
[Also, why were the cheerios constantly in their uniforms even when they were outside of school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjtm4q?context=5)|The cheerios always being in uniform comes from our creators. We like the fact that there is always (for the most part) a pop of good ol' WMHS red and white around. 
[Hello! Thank you for doing this and accepting my question.  Can you talk a little bit about your origin story? What path did you take to get where you are today? What advice would you give to aspiring costumers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnkixch?context=5)|My advice to aspiring costumers is to never give up! Also, gather as much knowledge as possible about Costume History, construction/sewing techniques, fashion designers, etc. Also, observe people! This is very helpful to become inspired to dress characters. Cheers!
[Can you give us any clues as to what costumes you're most excited about for season 6, please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjvhyd?context=5)|I cannot yet, BUT stay tuned and follow me on my Twitter account for more behind the scenes!!

For the longest time, they were hanging in my office, so it's nice to see them on camera again instead of hanging behind me!
[I bet people ask all the time what your favourite look to style was, but what were a few of your least favourites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjtj5h?context=5)|I wouldn't say least favorite at all, but one of the most time consuming was all the Katy Perry and Lady Gaga looks! We handmade many of the costumes to make them look Katy/Gaga worthy. 
[Would you consider yourself more of a Katy or Gaga?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjvhrf?context=5)|I would definitely say Katy!

I would say he likes to browse street style blogs and Pinterest, and finds inspiration there. Alexander McQueen is his go to designer!
[Do you enjoy reading? If so, what are your favorite books?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjufqd?context=5)|I love reading when I have the time! My favorite book is Atonement. I also adore The Great Gatsby.

We know how to stitch quickly!!
[When deciding on costumes do you consult with the director on the what the feel of the scene is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rw56l/i_am_a_costumer_for_glee_and_tonight_is_our/cnjts7x?context=5)|Once we get a script, we have a production meeting with the director, producers, and crew. We show them inspiration boards, and get feedback.

2rwmae,2,2015-01-09,Would you accept internship offer from company which uses Java 6/Subversion/Old-ish framework? (in other words not so new technologies).,cubid0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rwmae/would_you_accept_internship_offer_from_company/,"I got an ""okay"" feeling about the company on interview which made an internship offer to me. Only thing which puzzles me is that they don't use newest technologies available. I don't necessarily want that latest and most hyped framework out there, but how about at least Git and Java 7? And they are relatively small company so I imagine that it would be much easier to change their pipeline compared to bigger companies.

I don't know what kind of other conclusions I can safely make out of this. Doesn't people care about new things there? Do they just want to be their own comfort zone without learning anything new?

I myself want to handle new things and actually was looking forward to learn some Java 8, but apparently that wouldn't be the case. And subversion... Would it be frustrating to go back in time and learn something not that good when you already are using Git.

We built computers, placed them into computer labs, and ghosted them to have the same image.

One day, we were told to build some desktop computers custom prepared to use wifi. They all came with the wifi pci slot, and had a custom image prepared with the wifi driver installed.

This was the first time wireless was used - it would be used as a prototype for other new labs.

The administrator pushing for wireless was particularly excited about the cost saving, not needing to fumble with all of the extra wires.

Finally, we had all of the computers prepared, and wheeled over into the newly built lab.

There, a wifi router proudly stood, in the front-center of the room.

And.. that was all.

No plugs.

Sounds like the admins took 'wireless' very seriously.

Well.. a command was given.

There were two plugs on the side wall. We tried to use some extension cords to plug in the computers.

Needless to say, after plugging in the 4th desktop and monitor, the fuse blew.

After that day, pushing the idea of 'wireless labs' in the district quickly died down."

At university I mostly did Java, PHP and C++. But I'm quite keen on building web apps lately, hence the search for a language - not super keen on PHP. 

I also had a year long internship which was based on C#, C++ and VBA.

The grad scheme allows me to rotate my place in the company every 6 months, my first 6 months are based on Perl development for internal web apps, and Ruby test automation. 

My next few rotations can be either (they depend on where I move in the company so some have more than one tech option):

- Java (Maven, Spring) &amp; Node.js &amp; iOS &amp; Frontend dev

- Scala

- Java

- Perl

I know I don't want to do Perl, just not a big fan of it. The ruby wasn't bad for automation either but I don't think I wanna be a rails developer.
 
My big issue is I feel that I'm not good enough at one specific language - I know about programming design and good principles, I just haven't ever really focussed on one language, and I'm struggling to pick one.

I'm greatly leaning towards the Java + Node + Mobile one even though I'd like to learn some Scala but I need a language to focus on for my side projects.

I was considering Node.js or learning Scala and trying that out, or maybe something else I haven't considered.

What do you guys think?

I want to become a good developer and become confident in my skills but I feel like I need to pick a language and just focus on it to do that. "

I also worked full time for two years as a Quality Assurance Engineer (50k a year) at a Software Company.  I liked the job but realized I wanted to be a developer.  I left a year ago so I could take a higher load and focus on my dev career.  I have had a few inteviews for C# dev positions, most have gone OK but I am still at a junior level.

I also interviewed for a position as an interoperability analyst, which I originally thought was a dev role.  I would be a tier above support, analyzing customers web services and APIs for their systems, and solving problems relating to their integration with the company's software.  The interview went great and I was offered 70k, which is above their budget but what I asked for.  I told them I want to code and they said I may be able to do more coding in the future and move into that position.

I am not sure if I should accept this relatively high offer, I am in a low cost of living state, or if I should hold out for a dev position which could potentially be lower paying.  I have an interview for a mobile app developer internship in a few days, which would only pay me $20 an hour, and only of possibly of a full time position after 3 months.  I have a lot of friends who work at this place though and they love it, and I would love to learn more about app development, and go into that as a career.

I have been told I don't want to waste my time not learning dev, but maybe it would be worth it to me to take another job and then work my way into it.

Sorry for the rant, can some veterans give me some good advice?

TLDR; Should I take a high salary job as an interop analyst when I would rather be a dev, and possibly transition into being a dev, or should I take an internship that pays much less, but might be more enjoyable."

I am pursuing a graduate degree from one of the top 20 US BSchools. I received a summer internship offer from one of the Big 4 in their advisory practice (tech consulting). I am looking forward to joining the firm full time if I get an offer after internship. My long term goal is to transition to strategy consulting at MBB,

Little background on myself: 2 year experience at a top software product company. Currently pursuing masters in Information Systems.

I am considering the option to doing an MBA after few years at Big 4 firm. My main issue with this option is that I will be 27 by the time I start working and most B Schools have average age of ~ 28. 
tldr: I will be too old to make it to a good school.

What do you folks suggest as a good option?

A) join big 4; try to move to strategy consulting and network my way up to a MBB job 

B) Work in tech consulting at Big 4. Do an MBA (Executive) and recruit on campus for a MBB position


Looking forward to your suggestions and guidelines. Thanks In Advance.

2ryckp,102,2015-01-10,"Been ""smart"" my whole life, but now I feel like I'm a terrible SWE. Having trouble at my job",Notsmartswe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ryckp/been_smart_my_whole_life_but_now_i_feel_like_im_a/,"So, my whole life, I've been pretty used to being one of sharper kids, good at math, logic, puzzles, praised for being bright, yadda yadda... I worked hard too, but being one of the best (in terms of smarts, not social ability) came naturally

In college, I started CS in my sophomore year. I was one of the best students in my intro to CS class and later, data structures, even able to help peers with their programs. In upper level classes my programs were precise, I understood the concepts no problem. Seemed like I was on the right path to becoming a SWE, even a good one.

Now comes the first red flag: my internship. Same language I'd used in school, but enterprise code was so different from anything I'd seen. Millions of lines in the codebase, I didn't even know where to start when asked to debug or add something new. SWEs walked through what I was supposed to have written when I did it wrong, and it was a bunch of classes that all linked together in a design pattern, a factory then a session then a session manager, then a provider...  then 15 more classes, for example.

For a really simple example, if someone asked me to implement an Animal object with a speak method that takes a string and prints it out (""speaks"" it), I'd just do:

public static void speak (String sound) {
System.out.println(sound);
}

But that would be wrong; the animal was supposed to pass the sound to an AnimalManager, which creates an AnimalSession, which links to an AnimalProvider, and the other 15 classes. I just would not have known to do it that way, and the pattern is different each time. I'm not sure how the other developers know this, or ESPECIALLY how they can just debug code they've never seen before quickly and without guidance.

So, naturally, I asked for help, was the guy always needing a little guidance, and who's going to think you're doing a good job when you constantly need help? I got an ""average"" for my exit review. Now, this was not Google or Facebook, just a very average company with average pay (57k). At best, I was a mediocre employee, at an average company.

I was really down for a while because I always strived to be good at what I do. But I buckled down, did well in my classes, prepped for interviews, and managed to land a good job. Growing company, pretty good pay (not big 4, but if there was a big 50, it would be there) I was so happy. I chalked my internship to lack of experience.

Well, I started in late September (took summer classes to graduate), and it's the exact same thing. Asked to debug on first week. One SWEs gave me a 20 min overview of our team's core code base (~100 000 lines), but I was still useless. I know this is a common thing for new members to get them familiar, but it was just terrible for me. Team was nice about it, still let me get my hands wet with development since I was at least familiar with code base now. Well, same thing as with the animal thing. How do you guys know all these design patterns to use?!?! It's not that it doesn't make sense, but I just wouldn't be able to pull out the right design pattern like the others seemingly out of thin air. And debug projects I haven't touched before.

I'm starting to think that even though I was good at math, great student in CS, clean projects, that I'm just not cut out for being an SWE. I just can't seem to efficiently work on these giant projects thrown at me that I haven't touched before. My friends give me the advice ""just ask!"" but this only gets you so far. In this field everyone has a full plate, and you have to be good at self learning to be effective. I ask and I become more familiar with this project, but soon, one with a completely different design pattern comes, and I start over. I can't possibly expect to ask for help on half my bugs/patterns (which is what I'm doing) and expect to be kept around. 

If anyone has had a similar problem or has any advice, it'd be greatly appreciated.

**tl;dr**: was always ""smart"" as a kid, excellent CS student, but get to enterprise development and I'm struggling so much. Can't debug code I haven't worked with, can't use right design patterns, thinking I'm not cut out for being an SWE. **How do you learn to debug large projects you've haven't worked with before?**"

I'm very giddy at the fact that I got 2 job offers yesterday. I'm trying to create a pro/cons list, and I hope that you folks will be able to help me think of more factors I need to consider.

I'm a 2012 graduate in engineering major with EIT license. So far I've been forever interns at 3 places. For the last 6 months, I've been interning at a district, and working part time for a private company. On December, my internship ended and I have to resign from my part time job. 

Since then I've been back to the drawing board job hunting - and these 2 opportunities from my previous employers came up. It'll be my first real permanent job, so I'm trying to be as thorough as I can. I at least owe both my supervisors that much, seeing that they're amazing people and they've pushed hard to get the positions opened up for me.

Below is a list of factors (some hard numbers, some not) that I came up with. Please give me your comments on what you'd pick if you're in my situation and why.

So far I've been hearing 2 opinions. Be a gambler and go for the private job, or go for stability and go for Gov job. I definitely think that the private job is much more cutting edge/fun than the other one, but the current comparison is really not working for the private industry.

I've informed my supervisor of the offer from the district, and the Private is not able to raise the base salary anymore. I'm trying to think of ways to close the gap a little bit, more PTO, etc. I definitely identify more with the private, but the gov is just significantly better at this moment.

Factors | County Gov | Private
:-: | :-: | :-:
Hourly Base Pay | $ | $2.5 less
Est. Annual | $ | $5200 less
PTO | 22 | 15
Paid Holidays | 11 | 8
Good Culture | Yes | Yes
Good Supervisor | Yes | Yes
Good Coworkers | Yes | Yes
Work Travel | To remote sites within county | All across western US region
Daily Commute | 3 minutes walk to work | at least 100 Miles/day
Transportation | Company truck to get to sites | Company truck + gas provided
Pension Plan | CalPers | - 
Benefit | Yes | Yes
Retirement Plan | 457 | 401 (k)
Registered PE | Yes | Yes
Networking Opportunities | Limited | Great
Promotion Opportunities | Limited | Good
Future Prospect | Higher level technician, small chance of going to the engineering dept | Possibility to grow into a plant manager, process engineer, or project manager
Education assistance | Yes, at 50% | Yes, unsure if it's even possible due to amount of travel involved tho.
Doubts | Ability to move around | Stability, long commute distance
Notes | Area have lower cost of living | The difference in base pay can definitely be made up by the overtime

Thanks!"

2rz4cl,2,2015-01-10,"Have a bunch of projects to work on, but really want to get into a great company for an internship. Which one should I focus on?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2rz4cl/have_a_bunch_of_projects_to_work_on_but_really/,"Ok so I'm a sophomore at a good CS program (most big tech companies come for the career fair, hire a bunch of interns, etc) and have a good GPA. I've got an internship at a startup for this summer and am going to be doing interesting work (full-stack web dev), and have also done a couple of side projects that have won in online app competitions (ChallengePost). 

I feel like I have the potential to get into a big tech company like Google for next summer if I keep on working on cool projects and apply in Fall 2015 (when I'm a junior). So my question is which project should I focus my energy on from now till August? What could I do that would help getting that internship? I don't want to leave one halfway through thinking it doesn't help in advancing my career. I would love to do all, or do stuff without thinking about career advancement, but its not practical, especially with a part-time job and harder classes.

My ideas are:

* I have experience with Unity, so I could make a game with a designer and deploy it on the app stores.
* I really want to learn Haskell (considering all the hype), as functional programming seems really cool. Don't know what I would do with it though. 
* I could start doing things on HackerRank/TopCoder for a bit and see if I'm good enough to continue. I've seen people put their scores/whatever on their resumes, and don't know if it's valuable or not.
* Make slightly more advanced Android apps (where most of my experience is). I have thought of ideas like an app that helps regulate your smartphone use, blocking apps you think are time-wasting and helps you plan your day.  
* Take part in more online challenges, and make web apps geared towards them (something like hackathons apps but way more polished, because we have so much more time). I've won one, and came second in another, so would winning one more really add to my resume? That's assuming I do win. 

Reiterating a core point: I would love to do all for the sake of doing them, but it's simply not practical. So what should I focus on? Also, if you have any ideas about apps, I would definitely consider it!

Thanks a lot for reading through."

I've made 670 USD selling truffles... now what?",[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2rzni8/19_looking_into_food_distribution_and_whole_sale/,"Long time lurker here. Some time ago I was on this subreddit and found a discussion on ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi."" I can't remember the user, but I recall someone posting a link to [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sJ6IJZJhUU)  - I seriously recommend giving this a watch - it's just about a 10 minute video, but if you're busy, I'll summarize his work the best I can through what I saw in the video and articles and interviews I read about him.

He started selling exotic foods (mainly truffles) since he was 16. He'd forage truffles and sell them to restaurants in Texas and Arkansas. Started a club on exotic and foreign foods in high school which ended up getting 250 members. He continued his tiny business in college by continuing to import truffles and sell them to restaurants - he ended up dropping out of college during orientation week to devote more time to this. Reapplied later again only to get expelled for not attending his finals... because he was invited to give a lecture at a food fair in Oregon.

After reading up on him, I got interested in exotic foods myself (I'm a little biased though because I've always been kind of obsessed with cooking) and started looking at other businesses similar to his - more truffle companies based in NY. Since then I've learned about Urbani Truffles, Done4NY, PAQ Truffles and more. I kinda got obsessive.

Last month I got a little curious and decided to buy some Black Italian Truffles (cost me 225 dollars) and sold them in establishments in Miami. I had some cash from work and my exams ended early giving me 3 weeks off so I had the time, money and energy to do this without interrupting my uni work. I emptied out the case I ordered within a day and a half. It was an adrenaline rush. 

Maybe I'm saying that cause this is the first time I ever got my hands dirty vs. burying my head in marketing books to learn theory... but regardless, it was a really cool experience. Looking at these companies in NY and just looking at restaurant businesses in general shows that it's a ridiculously cut throat industry.

You can tell by looking at this guy, The [Truffle Lady]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2yB3F77dDM)  and more. They're constantly moving, constantly answering calls for last minute orders at restaurants, constantly dealing with competitors who seek out your food trucks to have their tires slashed. I don't know how I can be different from them, or set myself apart from them.

I've been getting an array of answers from family, friends and colleagues ranging from:

* Start an incubator kitchen instead
* Travel and make contacts with people you could potentially import from
* Finish your IT degree and use it.

I'd really appreciate any input, advice or tips, guys. I'm at a bit of a standstill right now, and I don't know what the hell I should do.


edit:  inserted the links i forgot to add earlier

edit 2: I realize a big thing that is key to starting anything in the food industry is capital.  My IT degree might help with that.  I have a contact in my family who could get me in touch with potential employers and people I could intern for up in Atlanta.  After graduation I could move off to downtown ATL to work for a start up and study food further too (I've heard the food culture is pretty nice up there).  Does this sound like a good approach, or am I best off going in all the way and just start working and networking directly in the industry itself?

Let me preface this by saying that I know I'm not entitled to a reason. In fact, I am half expecting some polite answer basically saying they won't tell me the reason behind my rejected job application. But I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. I mean, all they can say is no, right? I'm just trying to stay positive in a very confusing situation.

**Background**

I'm currently finishing a Master in Public Health in Epidemiology and have begun applying for jobs as I approach graduation in 2 months. One of the areas that I'm trying to break into is infection prevention--typically dominated by RNs but not necessarily a requirement for some openings--especially since I had an excellent internship with an infection prevention department at a major hospital this last summer.

I have applied to a handful of infection preventionist positions that don't specifically require applicants to have an RN, one of which was actually through my former employer. I have a good record and good annual reviews with this former employer. I enjoyed my time working for them, and I am/was excited to potentially work for them again. However, after submitting my job application, I almost immediately got rejected for the position; that is, 2 days later I formally got a rejection email saying, ""we have decided to continue to pursue other applicants who more closely match the needs of this position.""

I am just at a loss for words because, based on their job description, I meet the vast majority of their requirements. The only drawback is my lack of experience. I don't have a minimum of 2 years experience in the same or similar role. I have a summer internship that initiated my desire to enter this field. And in fact, unless this is some cruel joke like Hollywood where people die from encouragement, I was strongly advised by the people at my internship to seek a job in this field.  So here we are at the same Catch-22 about not having enough experience yet not being allowed to gain experience. 

And I understand that there are most likely other more qualified candidates out there. I'm not saying that I deserve to get every job I apply to. But based on the timeline of events, it just seems as if I didn't even get past the pre-screen. Like I was automatically rejected. And comparing my educational background and experience to their job description, I would have thought to have gotten past the initial stages... even if it meant being rejected later on in the hiring process.

There are only a few reasons that I could hypothesize why I was immediately rejected:

* Obviously, not enough experience. And the employer doesn't want to spend time or energy training someone new to the field.

* I'm still in graduate school until March. Perhaps they want to hire someone more immediately. I have the ability to start immediately, but I put down that I couldn't start until March just to remain consistent.

* I'm currently unemployed (because I'm in graduate school). I've heard anecdotally that employers don't like to hire people who are currently unemployed. However, I was periodically employed during grad school through the university itself. I have since left that position to focus on my defense.

* I had a year long gap between working for this former employer and starting graduate school. I left my former job voluntarily and went to help my family start up a restaurant during this time. I did not include this information on my application because it is not relevant to the position. Rather, I said I left my former job in order to pursue graduate school and other job opportunities.

*So my question is:* Would it be wise to call their Human Resources department to ask why my job application was outright rejected? Would that show initiative? Would that indicate to them that I am still interested in the position? Or would it just be a thorn in their side?

**TL;DR:** Applied for a job with a former employer. I thought I could at least get past the pre-screen given my educational background and experience. But for some reason, my application was rejected almost immediately. Should I ask why?"

2s0net,3,2015-01-10,Last semester undergrad wanting to apply for PhD in Computer Science. Is it too late?,throwaway-cs,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2s0net/last_semester_undergrad_wanting_to_apply_for_phd/,"Hello all.

**Background:** I'm entering my last semester towards a BS in Computer Science. I have a 3.61 cumulative GPA and a 3.87 in major GPA. I have some minor ""research experience"", if you could call it that; I spent 2 semesters helping a faculty member with minor data visualization and data mining projects related to Bioinformatics. With a LOR from this professor, I was able to land an unrelated software engineering internship this past Summer, where I completed my project (slightly above?) satisfactorily. 

With limited research experience, I *believe* I want to go to graduate school because:

* For the minor projects I worked on, I absolutely loved reading research papers in the field.

* From my internship, the most fulfilling aspects of my project were the investigation of the problem that I was assigned and the design of the application I implemented.

* I want depth. I loved **every single one of my CS classes**. Some came easier than others, sure. Even the ones I struggled to get a B in, I loved reading the material. I didn't just like the programming; I loved discrete maths, automata theory, data structures and algorithms, compilers, etc. I didn't feel like I got enough of it in undergrad, though.

**Problem:** I didn't solidly decide I wanted to go through with a PhD until what I perceive is too late. I don't have significant research experience. Lastly, I didn't get to know my professors aside from the one I worked with, and I need LORs. I only started preparing for the GRE this Winter break.

With a semester left, is there meaningful interaction I can have with faculty to get worthy letters of recommendation? Is there meaningful research experience I can gain in this time window? Do I have any chance at funded acceptance into a middle-tier PhD program? I'd actually like to stay at my current school, which is in the bottom half of the top 100 for CS graduate school rankings; I enjoy this city and the overall experience I've had at this school.

**TL;DR: Entering my last semester of undergrad and want to do a PhD in CS, but about the only thing I have is a decent GPA. Meaningful relationships with professors is practically nonexistent. Meaningful research experience is practically nonexistent. Am I hopeless?**

Thanks for reading."

If not familiar with a co-op, it is an internship that replaces school for a semester. I got fired for poor work ethic, as I took too long to complete projects and such. It was an engineering internship although I did not do engineering work which was part of why my work ethic was poor as I was generally uninterested in the tasks I was doing. These last weeks I have been reflecting on why I got fired and how I can improve. 

   Anyways, to why I am here. With a co-op, I have to take off school and it shows on my transcript that I had an internship for that semester. Fortunately for me, I got fired after 4 months and so my 'class' portion was complete and it doesn't affect on how it looks on my transcript. While researching on what to do as regards to future employment, the most common recommendation for similar situations was to leave it of my resume. But as I said, it is on my transcript so I cannot pretend it didn't happen, and in either case it is not like I did not learn anything. While I got fired for poor work ethic I wasn't a bad employee in the sense of poor attitude, coming in late, always on my phone etc. I also learned a lot of interpersonal skills and feel like I learned a lot from the experience regardless. I am wondering on how you all would tackle this situation. My first goals are to work on myself to make sure I don't allow boring work to ruin my motivation as well as plan better, but as far as what to do with resumes or future interviews how should I handle this?

2s1y8v,4,2015-01-11,"Job Search Strategy: Proactive searching, lead generation, &amp; releocation - Advice needed!",CloudsTasteGeometric,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2s1y8v/job_search_strategy_proactive_searching_lead/,"I am a recent graduate looking to launch a career in Market Research/Consulting/Marketing. I have been researching, reading, and stressing over it, and after a fruitless 3 month local job search (50+ apps, only 2 interviews) prior to my recent graduation I've been forced to rethink my strategy. Currently I am bolstering my skill sets and building what experience I can in my hometown (no hope finding real work here, city's too small). I currently have an excellent degree and set of skills for my field of work, which of course falls woefully short of the mandatory 2-3 yrs exp for all entry level jobs (despite being a fast growing field).

In 6 months the plan is to move to one of three cities, by that point I will have accrued 6 months of experience as a Marketing Assistant for a small/mid sized company in addition to my 6 months of experince as an Intern Research Analyst. This isn't the 2-3 yrs employers demand, but its the closest I can get as a recent grad; is it enough to be taken seriously for actual paid entry level work at agencies/firms?

Once I move I'lI have enough money to live for 3 months or so looking for work...I do not have the ability to save a lot of money prior to moving and I need to secure salaried employment by the end of this year. I'll work for dirt cheap; I'd gladly take half the going rate for the positions I am looking for, but I need to be confident that I'll be able to find something. This means my new home must be home to a large amount of firms and jobs in my field, I'll have a hard enough time presenting myself as a viable candidate for paid entry level work (being a recent grad vs established 30yo's favored for paid jobs), but I must have LOTS of leads in the region once I move - even if I am actually considered I'll have to slog through tons of interviews before I recieve an offer, I expect.

Because of this I want to generate my *own* leads and search *proactively*
Anybody can churn out online apps and upload resumes into black holes. I would rather contact agencies/firms myself to start a dialogue and eventually offer myself as a candidate. I don't have much of a network to tap into (working on it), so this would be more akin to a cold calling/networking hybrid. I would love to make headway here with numerous companies prior to moving - is this a good idea, if so how do I go about it? The *last* thing I want is to move and be at the mercy of the week's indeed listings, especially as a recent grad in a job market that doesn't hire recent grads.

The 3 cities I am looking at have strengths and weaknesses, so far I have identified 10 potential leads (firms) in each city...

City A: 2.5 hrs away *Pros* (Very large city, regarded as the birthplace of my industry, still an industry center with many large companies as well as small startups, relatively cheap living) *Cons* (Many co's here require a ludicrous 5+ yrs exp for entry level due to legacy/culture, outside my industry the city's economy &amp; job market are notoriously poor for its size)

City B: 2.5 hrs away *Pros* (Huge city, lots of employers in the industry) *Cons* (Out of state, less familiar, expensive living)

City C: 45 mins away *Pros* (Up and comer in my field w/ lots of growth in the sector, familiar, cheap living) *Cons* (smaller overall job market; while much larger than my hometown it is dwarfed by Cities A &amp; B, very few large firms mostly smaller boutique agencies and startups - I've heard that only large companies are willing to hire recent grads; the smaller the city/co, the more experince they demand)

(Another of Dr. O'Brien's case reports. Of note, this was the only one which I read before his disappearance. He asked me to edit it for spelling. He was extremely nervous and agitated at the time.)

Case 8

Organic brain syndrome caused by deliberate heavy metal ingestion.

The patient was a female in her 20s or 30s. She was brought to the hospital after collapsing at a bus stop. The paramedics said witnesses reported that the patient had been fidgeting and trembling, and had placed something in her mouth shortly before collapsing.

On admission, she was unresponsive. Her breathing was deep and labored. She was hypotensive (BP of 70/45 mmHg) and bradycardic (HR 39 BPM and regular). There was no evidence of heart disease or adrenal insufficiency. Drug intoxication was considered. The patient was resuscitated with dopamine and IV crystalloid, which increased her blood pressure to 100/70 and her heart rate to 55 BPM. Toxicology was negative for all normally-screened drugs and medications, but in the patient's personal effects, there was an unlabeled amber-glass jar containing approximately one hundred small white spheres, extremely regular in shape but ranging in diameter from 5 mm to 8 mm. They bore no markings, and were unusually hard and difficult to crush. The bottle was sent to the toxicology lab for analysis. Endoscopy revealed two of these spheres in the patient's stomach. They were removed endoscopically, and the stomach lavaged with activated charcoal.

Early on hospital Day 2, approximately 15 hours after admission, the patient regained consciousness. She was weaned from pressor support. Her breathing was still somewhat labored, but had improved. She had a significant tremor of her hands, forearms, and feet, as well as marked nystagmus. When interviewed, she was disoriented to time and place and largely to person. She could not remember her name, the names of her parents, or her place of birth, but she described her physical appearance adequately. Her speech alternated between slow and disoriented and rapid and confabulatory. She would sometimes give several answers to simple questions, e.g., when asked if she was female, she rapidly said “Yes. But no. Well sometimes. Yeah, sometimes.” [sic] There was no evidence of sex reassignment. 

She showed marked retrograde amnesia and moderate anterograde amnesia. She recalled only 3 words from a 20-word list after 10 minutes. She could not explain how she came to be in the hospital, although she *was* aware that she was in a hospital. Her only concrete memory appeared to be of speaking to an individual whom she described variously as “a doctor”, “a healer”, “a guide”, and “a teacher.” She said that this person was female, but that she could not remember any other details about her, except that she had some sort of practice (described variously as “a clinic”, “a hospital”, “a facility”, “a laboratory”, “a prison”, and “a dentist's office.”) 

When asked about the bottle of white objects, she immediately attempted to search her pockets, even though she was wearing a hospital gown. She looked under her pillow, then asked where the bottle was. When told it had been taken away for testing, she became agitated and began cursing at the doctors and the nurse in the room, demanding the bottle's return. Her agitation was a cause for concern, but because of the uncertainty about what drugs she might have ingested, we were hesitant to give any sedatives. After approximately fifteen minutes, she calmed down and complained of a sore throat. She was given water and asked again what the white spheres were. She smiled and said “They're Star Seeds” [sic]. When asked why she had been taking them, she replied “They're to get me ready. To clean me out.” [sic] She refused to elaborate on the reason she needed to be gotten ready or cleaned out, and again demanded the return of the bottle. When she was informed that we couldn't return it, since it might contain an illegal substance, she became agitated and combative and had to be physically restrained. 

Because of the unknown nature of the pills, and because our hospital is equipped with advanced testing facilities, unorthodox tests were run on samples of her blood, her hair, and the pills themselves. Samples and pills were also sent to the nearby university, whose departments of physics and chemistry are even better-equipped.

Because of concerns about toxicity, the blood was screened for every inorganic chemical element which our equipment could detect. There was a measurable concentration of beryllium in the blood. Beryllium dust is known to be damaging to lungs and skin. The body naturally contains a very small quantity of beryllium, but elevated blood beryllium has never to our knowledge been reported, as beryllium is poorly absorbed through the GI tract. There was no evidence of intravenous injection. Gadolinium was also present. The university reported, quite alarmingly, that uranium-238, thorium-232, and most alarmingly, small quantities of polonium-210 were found in both blood and hair.

Upon this discovery, the patient's bedding was sealed in a lead cask (normally used to store waste from the nuclear medicine department). Her skin was washed vigorously (to which she protested), and the washtub and washwater stored. No large quantities of polonium were found on her clothing, on her skin, or in her hair samples. However, as a precaution, all hair on her head and body was shaved, her digestive tract was aggressively flushed with magnesium citrate and propylene glycol, and chelation therapy with succimer and alkyl-ester succimer were initiated. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy were contacted and informed of potential radionucleide poisoning.

Liquid chromatography of blood and hair samples revealed several other abnormalities. The blood was highly enriched in extremely-long-chain fatty acids (chain lengths greater than fifty carbon atoms), but not in very-long-chain, long-chain, medium-chain, or short-chain fatty acids. The possibility of adrenoleukodystrophy was considered, but there was no evidence of fatty acid accumulation, and there were no genetic markers for the disease. 

The university characterized several extremely unusual molecules in the patient's blood. These included curcurbit[7]uril, a cage-like molecule currently being studied as a vehicle for delivery of the anti-cancer drug oxaliplatin, substituted fullerenes, and perhaps most remarkably, 1-amino-cyclohexamantane, a molecule only recently synthesized in the laboratory which has been described as a molecule-sized diamond. 

However, because of concerns about heavy metal and radiation poisoning, the investigation of these molecules was put on hold during treatment. Although the patient's leukocyte count remained normal, a full-body MRI was taken to assess the level of radiation damage. None was found; however, the scan was of poor quality, as the body load of gadolinium acted as a spurious contrast agent, making the scan difficult to interpret. 

Although no cancer was found, an abdominal X-ray (taken in spite of the risk of additional radiation exposure) revealed numerous small x-ray-dense bodies in the liver. A liver biopsy was taken, and these were found to be crystals of various substances, including inorganic silica, uranyl acetate, phosphotungstic acid, and iron-, lead-, and gold-rich organic crystals.

Blood samples, hair samples, urine samples, and bone and liver biopsies, revealed elevated concentrations of the following elements: beryllium, silicon, titanium (slightly elevated), iron (slightly elevated), niobium, tin, gold, lead, polonium, europium, gadolinium, thorium, and uranium. 

On interview, the patient denied having worked with radionucleotides or having willingly or unwillingly consumed them. When asked about her past, she could still recall nothing more than the “doctor” and “hospital” she had recalled previously.

On hospital Day 6, the patient began to complain of chills, anxiety, sweating, and insomnia. She was tachycardic and hypertensive. Her symptoms worsened over the next twenty-four hours, and grew to include hallucinations of tiny black insects on the walls and crawling on her skin. Her tremors grew much worse, and the possibility of *delirium tremens* or benzodiazepine withdrawal was considered. As both of these withdrawal syndromes can be fatal if untreated, she was empirically started on a standard chlordiazepoxide regimen. 

On Day 7, her symptoms had improved slightly, but she had developed a fever and mild dystonia on her right side. Blood panel revealed elevated liver enzymes and slightly above-normal creatinine. Succimer was increased to the maximum safe dose, with aggressive mineral and nutrient replacement therapy.

However, on Day 8, the patient became jaundiced and her fever worsened. Her right arm was severely dystonic, and was extended above her head and twisted, with the hand flexed backwards. She could not move it from this position, nor could a physical therapist manipulate it. She was dysphonic, and complained of worsening anxiety and hallucinations. She claimed that the hallucinations of insects were especially troubling, and that all surfaces in the room were entirely covered by them. In order to estimate the severity of the hallucination, the hospital neuropsychiatrist placed a bandage with a 1-cm square hole on the patient's arm and asked her to estimate how many insects were contained within the square. She replied “As many as there are grains in a sack of rice.” [sic] By the end of Day 7, she had begun scratching continuously, and had to be restrained. The dystonic arm could not be normally restrained, and a custom restraint had to be improvised.

On Day 8, the patient began suffering fever spikes, sometimes as high as 106 F and lasting as long as 30 minutes. She demanded the return of her “Star Seeds”, and when told that they were still at the university for testing, she suffered what appeared to be a panic attack followed by a *grand mal* seizure which did not self-terminate and had to be stopped with phenytoin. Chlordiazepoxide was increased to the maximum allowable dosage (adjusted for decreasing renal and liver function), which decreased her anxiety somewhat, but did not cause improvement in any of her other symptoms.

By Day 9, the dystonia had progressed to include painful extension of the right leg and plantar hyperflexion of the right foot. She had severe difficulty speaking, and complained of chills, “waking nightmares”, decrease in vision, and severe back pain. Reluctantly, baclofen was added to her medications, which decreased the severity of the dystonia, but did not relieve it to the extent that her arm could be mobilized.

On Day 9, while she was being fed, she suffered a sudden myoclonic jerk apparently involving the entire body. As a result, a large quantity of pureed carrot was spilled on her left thigh. She flexed her neck and stared at the stain, then began speaking and responding. A nurse had the presence of mind to record the conversation with her cell phone, and the transcript follows:

[Patient (Normal voice, but dysarthic, hereafter PND)] They won't give me back my Star Seeds.

[Patient (Slurred voice, emphasis on sibilants and glides, one octave lower than normal, hereafter PSS)] You are not ready yet.

[PND (in distress)] I know! But they won't give them back! I'm dying!

[PSS (calm)] You must *take* them back.

[PND (distress)] I don't know where they are!

[PSS (calm)] You must make them tell you. You are too close to stop now.

[PND (weeping)] I can't. They won't let me out. They want me to die!

[PSS] (Indecipherable hissing sound)

[PND (severely distressed)] I'm tied to the bed! They're giving me drugs! I can't do anything! I can't do *anything*!

[PSS] (Loud hiss, with articulation first at the dental level, progressing to the guttural level)

[PND (agitated, growing increasingly dysarthic)] You have to help me!

[PSS] (Dental hissing sound.)

Immediately following this exchange, the patient suffered a *grand mal* seizure progressing to *status epilepticus*, which was refractory to phenytoin and phenobarbital, but responded to valproic acid. Following the seizure, the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature returned to normal, and remained normal even after the valproic acid was stopped. However, the patient had become unresponsive (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3) and grew increasingly apneic, requiring mechanical ventilation. Her dystonia resolved spontaneously. 

On Day 11, during a routine blood draw to check liver enzymes (which were still increasing), the attending nurse noted that the puncture site continued to bleed for a prolonged period. The blood test revealed profound thrombocytopenia, and within several hours, she began to develop thrombocytopenic purpura of the extremities, which progressed to the limbs and the trunk. She began to bleed from the sites of her IV cannulae, and there was blood in her urine. Given the need for IV access, the cannulae could not be removed.

By the morning of Day 12, the patient's platelet count had dropped to 6,000 (the normal value is above 150,000), and she was covered with bruises and purpura. There was continuous bleeding from the nose, the gums, the right eye, all venipuncture sites, and the left nipple. Blood was found both in her stool and in her urine. She underwent numerous whole-blood transfusions, which caused only temporary rises in her platelet count.

By Day 13, bleeding was noted from both ears, both eyes, the nose, both nipples, the vagina, the anus, from all venipunctures, and from the rash and the nail beds of both feet. Sufficient blood was not available for transfusion. Frozen plasma and platelet concentrate were no more effective than whole blood. On Day 15, the patient's blood pressure suddenly dropped to unrecordable levels, and she suffered a cardiac arrest. In view of her thrombocytopenia, liver failure, and obvious internal bleeding, resuscitation was not attempted, and she was pronounced dead.

On autopsy, all organs were severely hemorrhagic. The most significant bleed was from a large tear in the right pulmonary artery, extending from the branch-point into the lung, and which had caused the right lung to collapse and caused cardiac tamponade which was the probable cause of death. Cause of death was, however, listed as “undetermined,” as life-threatening hemorrhages were found in all organs and nearly all tissues. There was a massive several-day-old cerebral hemorrhage from the anterior communicating artery with ischemia and necrosis of the entire brain, most likely the cause of the apnea and coma. The cause of the thrombocytopenia could not be determined. Radiation damage was suspected, but in spite of hemorrhaging, the bone marrow was largely intact and the megakaryocyes appeared healthy and in normal numbers. Some platelets were evident in marrow and blood, but they were undersized and appeared largely non-functional. 

Because of concerns about potential nuclear terrorism, the body was turned over to the FBI for examination by federal pathologists. The “Star Seeds” were also turned over. However, a copy of the analysis was forwarded to the hospital.

The “Star Seeds” consisted of filler materials (primarily titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, and sucrose), morphine (exactly 100 mg in each tablet examined), a small, variable quantity of ibogaine, and several unusual substances including beryllium carbonate, silicic acid, niobium(v)bromide, several organotin compounds, chloroauric acid, tungstic acid, various compounds of europium and thorium, uranyl acetate, and small quantities of elemental polonium-210. In addition, there were microgram to milligram quantities of several organic molecules, with or without substitutions or additions. These included fullerenes (sometimes containing metal ions), curcurbit[7]uril (often complexed with small molecules), curcurbit[27]uril (complexed with larger molecules), diamondoids (large molecules with an atomic structure identical to that of diamond), helicenes (polyaromatic molecules with helical shapes), and giant fullerenes containing nanocrystals of europium-doped silica, as well as several molecules which could not be conclusively identified.

Of note, an insoluble and chemically irreducible substance with a mass of 449 Daltons was observed during mass spectrometry of the ash resulting from thermal destruction of one of the pills. Even under laser decomposition, the 449-Dalton signature remained. Although some scientists believe chemical elements with this atomic mass might be stable, the majority disagree, and we suspect that this was an artifact of the recombination of refractory materials after vaporization.

It is also important to note that a medical intern who had observed this patient's case became violently ill 39 days after the patient's admission. He suffered from stomach cramps, vomiting, frequent urination, bloody stools, cognitive problems, short-term memory problems, and personality changes. He admitted to having stolen one of the “Star Seeds” and ingested it. Chelation therapy was suggested, but the intern left the hospital and could not be contacted or located."

I expected to work at least 30 hours and start paying loans and real life stuff. However, my hours are cut for a few months and I am making barely enough to cover my rent, bills, and food. I was told this would be temporary until at least March.

I am looking for really anything to cover a good 20 additional hours of work (I am currently maxed at 20 right now). I do like my job a lot but I can't continue working this few of hours. Money would be a lot nicer but I can cut some corners and survive.

I have noticed a lot of companies love having part time workers so they don't have to pay benefits.


My options:

1. **Search for part time work**: factory, food industry, service industry. Something flexible and quick to start working. Obviously I won't be making bank but it's enough to get my bills covered.

2. **Old Employers**: I have had two internships (IT then programming) in the past but when I left, I  gave a week notice that I was leaving and I feel ashamed if I got a hold of my past employers. But.. I know the work pretty well and I could get started pretty quick.

3. **New Job/2nd internship**:  I have been applying to a few full time positions and getting a hold of my college contacts. According to most of the dates of job notices, I missed a lot of the part time internships. I was previously ok with this since I felt like I would be getting good hours at my current internship. I'm obviously going to keep looking for jobs, but I feel like working 2 internships wouldn't work well with my current and new company. Or I could find something new if I like the company.

4. **Budget money well**: Suck it up, work hard on my side projects, and keep looking at potential opportunities. 

Thank you for your time and I will probably ask you more questions on the advice you give me. I would also like advice on applying to part time jobs when I'm a graduate.. should I mention I have another job?"

Ok so I'm a sophomore at a good CS program (most big tech companies come for the career fair, hire a bunch of interns, etc) and have a good GPA. I've got an internship at a startup for this summer and am going to be doing interesting work (full-stack web dev), and have also done a couple of side projects that have won in online app competitions (ChallengePost).
I feel like I have the potential to get into a big tech company like Google for next summer if I keep on working on cool projects and apply in Fall 2015 (when I'm a junior). So my question is which project should I focus my energy on from now till August? What could I do that would help getting that internship? I don't want to leave one halfway through thinking it doesn't help in advancing my career. I would love to do all, or do stuff without thinking about career advancement, but its not practical, especially with a part-time job and harder classes.
My ideas are:
I have experience with Unity, so I could make a game with a designer and deploy it on the app stores.
I really want to learn Haskell (considering all the hype), as functional programming seems really cool. Don't know what I would do with it though.
I could start doing things on HackerRank/TopCoder for a bit and see if I'm good enough to continue. I've seen people put their scores/whatever on their resumes, and don't know if it's valuable or not.
Make slightly more advanced Android apps (where most of my experience is). I have thought of ideas like an app that helps regulate your smartphone use, blocking apps you think are time-wasting and helps you plan your day.
Take part in more online challenges, and make web apps geared towards them (something like hackathons apps but way more polished, because we have so much more time). I've won one, and came second in another, so would winning one more really add to my resume? That's assuming I do win.
Reiterating a core point: I would love to do all for the sake of doing them, but it's simply not practical. So what should I focus on? Also, if you have any ideas about apps, I would definitely consider it!
Thanks a lot for reading through."

I'm currently a sophomore in College beginning to interview with a variety of software engineering companies with the hopes of finding an internship or a project to work on for the summer -- but there's just one big problem. I always face this insurmountable anxiousness before any sort of interview.

This seems like a normal problem, but it has really boiled down to this feeling of helplessness even during mock interviews or when I'm practicing with questions I've found in books or online. When I try to solve a problem, often times I'll think of the trivial, slower solution which people recommend you start with and improve on, but I just can't seem to think around questions at times and my confidence gets crushed.

During interviews I start out strong but when I reach a problem that the interviewer asks for maybe in O(Log N) instead of O(N) or adds on some caveat, I begin to panic and often times end up silent without too much progress being made. I understand that a lot of this will require practice, but to me it almost feels like how some people describe depression, when you want to get help but feel too helpless to find the energy to do so. The strange thing is that I know I really love to program because personal projects always leave me feeling accomplished and satisfied, and I love to learn for the sake of learning, but sometimes it's just not the most practical and you'll always need exposure to industry standards for certain things.

I do practice questions and spend a long time staring at some only to feel frustrated because I couldn't find the ideal/optimal solution, and then when I glance at the solutions I berate myself because it seems to obvious in retrospect.

I've been in school since fall 2010, I started with a mechanical engineering major, but it takes me twice as long to learn math than an average student. So, in 2012 I decided to switch my focus with my hobbies. My goal career is a Product Manager, that or a Product Manager. Unless I enjoy a spot on the mountain on my climb to the top I've planned to get there anywhere from 35-40yr. 

I have a little work experience, but its all labor intensive. Working at a wine and spirits department of a grocery store, and moving drywall as an odd job for a friend from time to time.

I read somewhere that with the videogame business you need to enter in with an understanding of either art or programming, and never straight from management. So I'm trying to teach myself computer languages and get a better understanding of devices. I'm a novice with Html, java script. I'm interested in android, flash, XBLA. And learning programs like adobe's design products, 3d modelling (to make products, and for character design.), anything that would help me get a handle on the position I'm interested in.

I'd love to get a handle on adobe products like photoshop, after effects, anything I can get to develop an understanding of animation and artistry. I just haven't found a good self teaching way of learning them, also just one of them are way out of my price range (so the pirate's life for me). I wish i knew where to start in 3d modeling but apart from not knowing how to find a guide I'm not even sure what program I would need to try it, so i could use a suggestion. 

Really the problems I'm having is that I am not sure what I should be looking for with internships or even what experience I should be searching for. My only plans as of now are to get a job at gamestop, and learn more about adobe and programming. Some time after maybe a few years go for a masters in Videogame development.

Things on my mind (if you cant solve its fine)
I write down all ideas I have for product designs and plots for videogame spitballs. The plots arent always golden but 1/5 are decent. I'm interested in designing products on the side but I have no idea how to: a, Find a way to show them to someone without them being stolen, because i don't have the money for pattents. or, b Make them on my own via kickstarter or something again because of keeping others from making my idea. Basically idk how to make something with out it risk just being stolen. I have quite a few so maybe providing a steady flow of ideas would be enough of an intensive. Making money on my designs isn't that high of a priority I'm more interested in recognition for my ideas then making a killing. That way i can keep making things."

Anyway, I'll be graduating High school this year and have received acceptance letters from the schools I've applied to (also, none of them are Ivy League). After making a pros/cons list I still can't decide between my top two schools. 

One is located in NYC, which I feel would be great for internship opportunities and the other is in the New England area, which I have no idea about internships in that area.

Sorry for rambling...

I want to make my decision based on the strength of the programs at both schools. So my question is, what should I look at when I compare the Computer Science programs at both of these schools."

I'm a sophomore who just changed majors in CS and I go to a non-target yet still highly ranked university. I have a relatively good GPA and my CV does include a lot of computational experience from a health company I interned at for multiple summers. I've been applying to the big firms like Google, Facebook, MSFT, Twitter, Amazon, etc. I got interviews with Google (not engineering practicum, just regular software engineering internship) and MSFT but messed those up. I didn't hear anything from any of the other companies except twitter which didn't want to set up an interview. 

I know this is a silly question to ask but I feel disheartened that I can't even get an interview at places like Amazon or Twitter. I do have 2 projects - one from a hackathon and one from a past internship - and I feel that my CV does contain a lot of coding experience from my past internships at the health company where I did a lot of software development and scripting.

Since then, I did an internship which led to a full time developer role and things are going great. I'm learning a lot and am enjoying my varied work day. However, since going full time, I've been more focused on production than the learning process and sometimes I simply don't want to come home and code some more after coding all day. Sometimes I don't have a choice, since I also have a few freelance clients who occasionally have work for me.

I'm entirely self taught and I'll admit that there are a lot of gaps in my knowledge. I feel like I should be focusing on Javascript/jQuery and PHP since my workplace would appreciate those skills the most, but I also have a lot of fun playing with Ruby on Rails. But either way, by the time I get home I'm usually too drained to do much of whatever I feel like focusing on. I try to attend social code and coffee groups whenever possible, but I usually end up mentoring/helping others and not getting much done on my own.

So, in the sea of endless knowledge, how do you continue to learn new things and improve your skill after working in front of a computer all day?"

I had to get loans, I had to work to support a family of 5 while doing my ME undergrad. I was so burnt out. I struggled to keep my grades up and graduated with a sub 3.0 and that was discouraging and scary. I got to the first semester of senior year with no internships in sight and senior project that was less than exciting. I dreaded the future. I had been applying to internships all over the state and was not even getting called back. So I kept working shitty jobs. But one day I got a call to a place that I thought they filled an internship for, it fell through and they interviewed me and I started a week later. I did not know anyone there, no network to help. It was nice to get the experience but still my not great GPA was lingering over me. All the big companies that my friends where getting hired at require 3.0 pretty strictly. Then I find out that my current internship is not going to turn into anything for at least a while. The kept me on as a courtesy, but at $12 an hour with a degree, life was rough. But I was getting experience and my resume was growing with some sheet metal design, real test analysis, injection molding, etc. my boss was great and gave me projects that would improve my resume. I was hitting indeed for hours every night. Rejection, position filled, not interested, phone interview that goes nowhere. Going nowhere, I was sinking. One night I was lazy and was just doing the auto submits on monster, you know the ones that make it feel like you are applying to places when no one will ever see them. I did this on a Monday, a company wanted to set up an interview in person for Wednesday. Went to it, had a great interview and a job offer the next day for 60k. I was and am in cloud 9! Everything is paying off for now and I am now reaching my goals I have been working for! 

I don't mean to brag, but I kind of am! I am proud as all of you should, engineer school is hard and sucks most of the time. But there is hope, even if your grades are not perfect. Do anything you can to build your resume, work in your interviewing skills, never give up and your time will come!"

I am not planning on going to graduate school, as I'd prefer to go straight into industry if possible. 

I don't have any internships under my belt, but I am working on changing that this summer. However, during the academic year, I am trying to decide between two options for myself.

Option 1 - Paid undergraduate position:
I was previously a biology major before switching majors (keeping biology for a minor, though). During that time, I applied to a two-year undergraduate research program at my school that provides the funds to be paid hourly to work in a research lab of my choice. I was accepted into the program and have been told that I can work in a computer science/computer engineering lab that is relevant to biomedical research. So, I am considering doing this: find a lab on campus, probably something in bioinformatics or a computer science area that is applicable to the biomedical sciences. Obviously, if I go this route, I am getting paid and I can include the relevant aspects of my work on my resume, but will have less free time for what is described below. 

Option 2 - Start a web/aps development company + work on side projects: Prior to getting the greenlight for the option described above, I had been planning to start a web development company with a friend, with additional plans to enter app development as we get the coursework under our belts. This could be a potential secondary source of income for myself going forward (beyond school) and could go on my resume as well. Additionally, with the extra time, I would start developing some projects of my own -- possibly some aps or something to related to Raspberry Pi/Arduino/etc. Again, stuff that I can put on my resume. I could end up making some money here, but the prospects are not as certain as described above. 

I am drawn towards option 1 because I’ll make some money for sure, but like option 2 because it leaves me free time to work on different projects. But I want to go with the one that will translate to the more impressive resume for a computer or software engineer. I realize these are two different positions, but I honestly can see myself working in either field at this time, and probably wouldn’t be able to narrow it down more until I’m further in my coursework. So, given that information, what do you all think?

Since high school, Jane has been known to embellish her stories and make her life seem more fabulous, i.e. lying about going on trips and people she knows. One day, she is caught stealing her friend's UGG boots from her locker and Jane ended up transferring schools because of ridicule, embarrassment, etc. Her online presence disappears for a few years from about 2009-2012 and no one hears about her for a while. I'm 2 years older than her so I got all this info from friends because we weren't in the same grade.

Then she gets an instagram account and starts posting stuff, again embellishing her stories. Her most notable posts included her donating ~$10,000 to a kids hospital, working as an intern at Google while also obtaining a modelling contract with Victoria's Secret. I was always saying ""Wow!! Her life looks awesome!!"" until my friends told me that none of it was real and that was when I became dubious of her.

On March 3, 2013, Jane posted a poorly-lit selfie, with her caption boasting about being in NYC for a concert. My friend clicked on the hashtag she used and found that a girl had posted the exact same selfie 20 minutes prior to Jane. A couple of my friends commented on the photo indicating that they knew it wasn't her so she deleted the post. That was when I truly knew about her ability to lie.

I had always felt it was unfair for the people's photos she was stealing from and the way she nonchalantly stole photos made me feel sick inside. So I tweeted things (indirectly) along the lines of ""this girl needs to stop pretending she works at google and is a model for VS because it's fucking creepy and weird"". I posted another one that said ""ooouuu i wonder where this girl stole her VS fashion show videos this time!"" My intentions were for her to admit her wrongdoings and curtail this behaviour because well...it's bad to steal photos and lie to people.

In November, she was allegedly in London, England and she was posting photos from different sites around the city. For 3 of her photos, I was able to locate the original post and screenshotted this. I tweeted a post which read verbatim ""that awkward moment when u get caught stealing someone else's photo"" and proceeded to post a side by side comparison of Jane's instagram post vs. the original, implicitly alluding to the chronological order in which they were posted.

So last week I found out that she is taking me to court for a peace bond and I'm really scared. I've never been to court and I heard peace bonds stay on your record forever (not on police checks but on vulnerable persons checks).

Should I go alone? The police officer who served my summons said it's probably not necessary to have a lawyer since it's only a peace bond. 

Has anyone had experience with peace bond hearings? How do I go about having her application denied? I have never threatened her. The only thing that I have really injured is her online reputation but this girl is an embellisher and she might have doctored evidence (she has created fake boarding passes before)."

I came across a listing on internmatch for a ""Software Engineer Intern"" in Austin. I match their basic requirements, but then they go into a little detail and this is where my question becomes relevant. They state that the candidate must be..

&gt; Comfortable with Linux / UNIX, Apache, and Tomcat

I have only used Linux. I am comfortable with it. Not a pro, but comfortable.

&gt; Understanding of web-related technologies (e.g. HTML / XHTML, HTTP, SOAP, REST, TCP / IP, DNS, Message Queuing)

I have a basic understanding of some of these, but the rest are completely foreign to me.

So, my question is, do I honestly need to match their specifications 100%, or do you believe they'd be flexible as long as you're willing to learn/able to pick shit up fast? I mean, hell, I can't think of one fellow student who has experience with Linux/UNIX, Apache **and** Tomcat.. 

I'd love to intern for them, but I don't want to send over my resume/cover letter/code if I'm not eligible as that's just plain embarrassing. I wonder if I'd be in a better position *after* this semester, but by then it'd be far too late to apply. Would it be wrong of me to apply with the hope that the knowledge they require would be gained during this semester?

I've spent a good amount of time apply for internships this summer and I really don't think I'm approaching the problem correctly. I've tried to follow the advice that I've gotten from recruiters at my school, my schools career department, and places like this subreddit. I think I have a good resume and that I manage to write fairly good cover letters for the jobs I apply to, but I never hear anything back. I once got offered an interview by mistake though, so that's something. My qualifications are about as good as they can be for a second year student, including some good work experience on campus and excellent grades. So in essence my problem boils down to this- I think I am a good candidate and I'm willing to put in as much work as it takes, but I want it to be effective. So far, everybody I know with work experience for the summer has it because of their parents (""networking"") and that isn't an option for me. I did reach out to the two adults I know in my industry, but their companies were not offering internships in the United States.

My current approach is to search for intern positions either through job searching services or by visiting the career pages of companies in the area. I then find a position that fits, research the company more, and then write a cover letter based on what I've read. Honestly, I don't tailor my resume too much from position to position, which might be part of my problem, but to me all the positions I've applied for are similar enough that I don't know what changes I would make.

I would be fine continuing the current approach if I thought it would work but as things stand I think I will go nowhere and would appreciate some input. Should I keep doing what I am now and hope for the best? Start visiting companies in person and hope that goes somewhere?"

Background: I'm in the USA and finishing up a 4-year undergrad EE program (pure EE, not CE). I'm teaching myself C, know Python ok, and have 2-years intern experience with VHDL, FPGAs, and Assembly. I have a 3.8 GPA. I'm very interested in embedded software design -- or really any software. 

Context: All the jobs I'm finding with big engineering places are looking for weird experience (fiberoptics, high-speed analog, etc, etc). In addition, most software jobs advertise continuing education while EE jobs seem like they're just going to throw you into whatever and say, 'good luck'. The software atmosphere seems much more modern and fun -- but maybe that depends on location. So I'm considering IT or Software. 

Questions:

Would I be missing essential skills that would limit my abilities in a software role? I can learn tools and languages easily enough, but I'm thinking more fundamentals. Will people hire someone with an EE degree?

Should I take a few semesters of Comp-sci courses? 

Do most electronics-oriented jobs really just toss new hires to the wolves?

I'm a year out of school at this point, have worked my current job right now for 6 months. I'm working on my grad degree at nights. I like the job that I have (Java stuff), but have no real attachment to our product and industry. It's good experience, but not somewhere I picture myself 3 years or so from now.  Benefits and pay are slightly below average, but I took it for the experience. Learned a lot so far.

Out of the blue, I received an email from a company I was talking with exactly a year ago. They didn't have any open positions at the time, but said they liked my resume at that point and kept me on file. Contacted me saying a Software Dev position is open and they were wondering if I was still interested in them.

My answer is YES. They are in an industry that I had internship experience in and would like to build a career in. They are substantially more reputable and rigorous and I know it would be an incredible learning experience there, at least to interview there. I'm definitely going to contact back and say I'm still interested in them and would love to come in and interview if that offer was on the table. Obviously, I'm going to keep mum at my current company about this.

The catch is that the position was designed to open up Summer of 2015. That's ok with me. My question is this: hypothetically, if I passed their interview and was given an offer for that timeframe, how do you handle your current job situation? Is it appropriate to stay on for another few months and then give notice? Or do you have to give notice right away? I don't know what's appropriate/expected if this situation appears.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, I would like their input. Thanks for reading!

I took CS61A with John DeNero last semester and got a B+. I find computer science not as interesting as English and history, which I love. I took a history class and an English class and got A's.

My parents don't think English and history are very practical majors. They point to my cousins. One graduated with master's degree in English five years ago and is still working as a barista. The other graduated with a psychology degree two years ago and is working retail.

I was reading *Cracking the Tech Career* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (who wrote *Cracking the Coding Interview* and founded CareerCup) and got to this part:

&gt; **Majors**

&gt; Although some well-meaning people will advise you to find a major that you love, that isn't the best career advice.

&gt; If you want to get a job at a top tech company, some majors will simply make it easier to get in. The more directly applicable your major is, the better. Computer science, marketing, finance, and accounting majors will have a much easier time getting their resume noticed than, say, a history major. After all, they have academic experience, and possibly other work experience, that lends itself to a specific role.

&gt; Even majors that aren't necessarily directly applicable (like mathematics, in most cases) can still show rigor.

&gt; But there are all kinds. Paul landed an internship at Microsoft as a music major from Berkelee College of Music. Not a dual computer science and music — just a plain old music major. And even he had a directly applicable role: making sound effects for Xbox. He spent his days using ordinary household objects to mimic sounds like a golf ball hitting the grass.

&gt; **Minors**

&gt; If you choose to major in something less applicable, like history, your minor is your opportunity to add an applicable skill to your resume. Seek out a relevant minor that complements your path, whether that's finance, marketing, computer science, or one of several other career majors.

&gt; A minor is also a great place to prove that you're quantitative. A minor in math or engineering will do that, but so will a minor in economics, finance, or accounting. Whether fair or not, many techies associate the ability to work with numbers as a sign of intelligence (as well as an important job skill), and a minor is your chance to show that.

I'm torn between majoring in computer science and something like English or history. English and history assignments are relatively easy and enjoyable for me to do because I love reading and writing. Programming on the other hand is doable though takes a lot of time and effort.

2sdu9f,85,2015-01-14,Problem with the laptop monitor.,GregButcher,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2sdu9f/problem_with_the_laptop_monitor/,"Hello everyone, first post here, I'll post more when I'll remember doing it :)

This is one of my favourites as i was a tech-support guy at a big company with several thousand computers. I was an intern but the only difference from a full-time worker was my wages...

Anyway one day a lady comes in with her laptop. She says she has a problem with the screen, something is very odd about it, can i fix it. I'm like, sure lets take alook at it. I open it up, power on the machine, nothing seems odd, then as the screen gets power, it shows up that the whole screen is broken in and the liquid crystal is going everywhere. Conversation:  
Me: Sorry ma'am this screen is broken.  
Lady: Broken?!  No that can't be, i assure you that it is not broken, that could've never happened.  
Me:(starts to chuckle) Look you're not going to talk yourself out of this, this screen is broken in, theres no other explanation, did you drop it or something?  
Lady: No of course, i did nothing like that.  
Me: Anyway, i can not fix it like this, talk to your boss and order a screen replacement.

So she did, went back to her boss, being a company laptop she got herself a screen replacement and got away with it with a small scolding(the company was pretty chill about punishment in general). Later I heard through a friend that the cause of the cracking screen was that she accidentally left the cap of a usb thumbdrive on the keyboard and closed the laptop like that. She didn't think it would do anything wrong to the pc..."
2sed6g,5,2015-01-14,How should I go about presenting myself and networking with others in the industry if I am brand new to the field?,Turin_Giants,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/2sed6g/how_should_i_go_about_presenting_myself_and/,"So I am a college grad (24 years old) from a good, four year accredited university in northern VA but I got a degree in psychology. While I regret my decision to get that degree now, I realize there is nothing I can do about it now and that I must move forward if I want to get a start in this new field. 

That being said, I have been doing everything in my power to get ahead in the game and have joined ISSA or the Information Systems Security Association in order to meet some individuals in the industry in my area and hopefully get a leg up on the networking aspect of the field. In terms of my own learning, I have been self-teaching myself material from the ground up. I got my A+ cert back in December and I am studying to get my Network+ cert soon. For the record, I know how much certifications are looked down upon in this sub and most of the IT-related subs but without going back to school, what other choice do I have to show that I am actually knowledgeable about the material? I have also been trying to learn as much coding as possible but I have been having a bit of difficulty with it but I am not willing to give in just yet. 

With all that, how would YOU, if you could picture yourself in my position going to meetings with these individuals, who have been in the industry for much longer than I have, present yourself? By that I mean, make the best of the opportunity? I have no problem talking to people but these monthly meetings make a point of connecting with others and networking as much as possible, and while I think that's great, its hard for me to do that with such little to go on. 

Another thing that holds me back and can sort of stop a conversation dead in its tracks is the fact that I have a full-time, salaried job with the county government. I am in no position to quit that job and take up an internship with some company. I truly wish I could, but I don't think it would be wise to quit my job at the moment. 

So how should I go about networking with others? Obviously I am looking for a entry-level position with some company in the NetSec work or even the IT world, but its tough when you are starting from ground zero. If anyone can relate or give me some advice, I would greatly appreciate it!

The reason I am asking this is because the organization is having a meeting tomorrow and they give us time to mingle and network, so I want to make the best of that situation. 

Thanks all!"
2seyls,3,2015-01-14,(Internship) Interviewing with big companies without data structures/algorithms?,sollared,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2seyls/internship_interviewing_with_big_companies/,"I applied to a bunch of companies in December for an internship this summer and surprisingly I've gotten interview requests from the really big ones, like Amazon and Palantir. The only problem is, everything I see online says that all they care about is how good you are with data structures and algorithms and I am just now starting my data structures/algorithms class and have very little knowledge of any of the questions I've seen online. 

I imagine I was able to snag the interviews with the hotwords (hadoop, data normalization, etc) on my resume since I've got a pretty sweet internship since last summer thanks to a contact there. I'm also graduating next year (changed majors late) so my next couple semesters will be 100% CS courses that should normally be spread out, so maybe they thought I was further along in my courses. However, I even pointed out in my cover letter that I haven't taken any of the higher CS courses beyond the 3 intro code monkey/UNIX knowledge courses. 

Do I have any chance with these companies, or will these just be really awkward interviews where I keep having to try and fail to solve their algorithm questions? How do I handle not knowing most of their questions? Does anyone have any tips/resources/crash course for learning this stuff and getting through the interviews? "

2sfggv,1,2015-01-14,Possible new position with lower advertised salary. If I get the offer how do I discuss a higher starting salary?,Shangriblah,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2sfggv/possible_new_position_with_lower_advertised/,"I've worked my way up from IT intern over the past four years up to a position where I'm one of the senior members of the support team, doing 2nd line stuff and occasionally sitting down with the sys-admin team to do basic 3rd line stuff. I've hit a glass ceiling as we're stretched really thin over the estate due to budget and recruitment freezes so I've burned myself out in that position.

I have a second interview for an IT engineer position for a smaller organisation where the company has expanded a lot in the past 18 months. The IT is done between the finance guy and an external company. They can no longer cope, so I would be the first ""official IT person"" the company has had an will be eventually shouldering most of the networking, storage, software, and hardware etc. I'll have to put a ticketing system in place and complete a service catalogue.

I'm taking a bit of a pay hit, but I think I'm worth more on top of the increased responsibility. I've never been in this position before, so how would I discuss a higher starting salary, or at least one that would increase after my probationary period?

Apologies if this sounds a bit vague but I'm no good at talking about money!"

There's a professor at my university with research about algorithmic trading which I'm very interested in; I don't have much of a chance to work in that lab this summer, but there is a chance if I contact him now that I can do research there next summer. However, I would be sacrificing  the chance to do a software engineering internship at a big company my sophomore summer, and I have heard that that is not recommended.

If I want to end up working at a big company as a software engineer, would doing CS research (at a top research university) my sophomore summer hurt vs. having a good internship?

[Hello! Big time Gamecock fan here. Thank you for spending time with all of us.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnoyhby?context=5)|Very welcome, I'm actually having fun. I've always had a desire to help as many people as possible. I came from a pretty bad childhood and have had a roller coaster of a life even since then. So when I left the NFL I wanted to give back how I knew, which was sports. So I opened up a gym from to help athletes like myself have a place to call home and develop the skills to play at a higher level. The gym thrived for 6 years and then I was introduced to new things and new opportunities.
[Since you are here, could you tell us a little bit about what your company does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnoyhby?context=5)|I started consulting on ergonomics for the local power company and started speaking a lot. I fell in love with talking to people and helping them on a mass scale, and people liked hearing about my life, my perspectives, and lessons ways I could help. So I closed the gym and shifted gears and opened a company where I now travel the world and speak as well as create online courses for people to improve their lives. Its called Trust Your Hustle. (Sorry for the long response lol, I might be a little passionate about it)
[, if you do not mind, I'd like to know what are your thoughts on paying college athletes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnoyhby?context=5)|As for paying college athletes I am ALL for it. We don't make enough money playing while the schools get TONS of money off tickets, endorsements, OUR jersey sales, etc. Leaving us with very little time to even get a job to make extra money. I thinks its only fair to reap some of the financial benefit that the colleges make off of us. Not a lot, just a little.
[Its 3rd and goal, call it 4 yards.  Defense has been running all game. QB is in the shotgun, 3 wide.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnpcrv4?context=5)|Depending on the defense and personnel we're in everything changes. Im going to say we're in goal line D with an extra LB. Two WR to the field, right, with the HB aligned to that side as well. Lone WR and TE on the left boundary side. Im going with HB bubble right as a last resort dump, but the main play is going to be the back side WR slant with a TE arrow out left into the boundary, because they think we're manned up with the short distance and 3WR set, but I would call a cover two and set the corners in the flat to take away the bubble threats. They know we assume they're going to run, because they have been all day, so they anticipate us coming forward to open up the pass but we do a line stunt to free up the backers. We have one LB blitz field side to rush the throw or stop the run. The backside LB knows he has a stick corner so he doesn't fly out showing the QB that the slant is taken away so the QB looks to the TE arrow and sees the corner sitting, can't throw there either. As he turns to go for the dump to the RB on the right he gets smashed in the face by a linebacker named Antony Trucks. Trucks gets up and does his signature ""Truckstop"" move. Game Over. #GoDucks.
[Best fucking thing i have seen all day, great shit, thank you !](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnqonve?context=5)|Very welcome... I miss that sh*t.
[How did your injury affect you mentally/emotionally at first? And how long did it take you to consider and ultimately begin your business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnozj0o?context=5)|It killed me inside. All I knew growing up was football. It defined me as a man. So when it was over I didn't know what to do. I didn't know why anyone would respect me anymore so I huddled down and experienced a dark low of life. Then I started talking to people and found out that I could help them by sharing my knowledge and experiences with them. Especially the kids and athletes I worked with. Then I started finding that adults needed and wanted my help so I expanded to that. It has taken me about 6 years to get to where I am now with this new business.
 |I started my gym about 3 months after I tore my shoulder and fought through some pretty horrible times to keep it afloat. Then, after it was doing very well, I closed it to help more people in life and not just sports and fitness training.
 |I just redirected my energy from sports to business. I took all that same drive and vigor and used it in a different arena.
[Do you own any interesting memorabilia from your playing days?  Is coaching most intense at the college or pro level? As in, I imagine NFL coaches to be more relaxed because they are well paid and at the top of the game. I expect to be fully wrong :\)  Thank you for your time doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnp983i?context=5)|I have some stuff from my playing days ya. Mostly from college though because in the NFL they keep stuff on lock and key. I managed to get a travel bag from one team, and at Oregon I got all the jerseys from my senior year, a few game balls from college, and a couple rings from college. Besides that nothing crazy special. Maybe I should have grabbed Big Bens jock strap and framed it lol  It's pretty much the same at both levels. Although the players aren't pros, the coaches still are. At both levels your job is on the line every year if you don't perform. In college I am speaking more of the top colleges in the country though. Its just harder on the player in the NFL because we're no on scholarship and can be cut any time.
[What are your thoughts on traumatic brain injury in the NFL? Did this influences your decision to retire? Have you seen friends and colleagues in the NFL struggle with it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnoyod7?context=5)|I think its a little out of control in my opinion. I can understand it at he NFL level because guys are getting so much faster and bigger at the same time now so every hit is like a car accident. But when it trickles down to the youth level where athletes aren't as powerful its a little like the ""ADD"" freak out were having now where any hyper kid needs drugs to calm down. I think its gone overboard. In reality its the 4th highest sport for concussions behind soccer and even gymnastics, but football is more popular so its gets the sting.
 |It actually had nothing to do with my retirement. The studies came out after I played so we werent even thinking about it in all honesty. I personally also haven't seen any teammates or friends struggle with it. I FULLY believe that it happens and I take NOTHING from the guys who have experienced it, but I haven't had that close of an experience with the issue myself.
[Whats the hardest part about transiting between college football and the pros? Also why do you have a wikipedia page in Danish but not English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnozqbx?context=5)|1) The transition is tough because were not given tools to succeed in the ""real world"". We don't usually do internships, have friends who are in regular jobs, have work experience, etc. So were dropped into a world where the skills we've honed in a ""professional"" sense are rendered all but useless. Thats why a lot of us turn to sports or fitness training, and coaching, because its all we know sometimes. I personally wanted to create something that was great for everyone and not have to piggy back so hard on my football days, so it was even harder. I almost lost my business 4 times, my marriage fell apart, I was broke MANY times, and life just sucked. It took me 5 years to get back on my feet honestly, and I probably had it easier than most in some instances.
 |As for the wikipedia I honestly have no clue lol 
[Feelings on girls/women playing football? Are the camps, around the US, that are set up for high school players really worth it? Did you go to these camps and get anything out of them?They seem to be run by bored college players obligated to do them. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnp1xkh?context=5)|I think its fine if they want to play and want to play with other women (if its tackle) it just wouldn't be equal if they played with men, from a physical strength standpoint.
 |As for the camps i think they are not as beneficial as people think. Most of the college coaches that people are told will find out about the numbers at the camps will never know. Its just goo marketing. Some camps however do teach some beneficial techniques that would REALLY help kids. The problem is that when those kids go back to their teams their coaches don't understand what they learned and it gets lost in translation and never used again.
 |Yes, most of the college guys running them aren't all that engaged, they're just trying to make a buck sometimes. Not everyone, but most of them, heck I was one of them at a time. I was just hanging out. After the NFL i stepped my game up.
[A few questions...  1\) Does anyone call you 'Tony Trucks'?  2\) A lot of college players don't make it to the NFL.  What factor allowed you to make it?  3\) How did you find out your injury was 'career-ending'?  What was the first thing you thought about after finding out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnoxpsv?context=5)|1) Yes my high school football coach does still. My dad calls me Toneford for some reason.  2) Honestly I think what made it possible for me, past the God given talent, was my work effort. I had a pretty crappy upbringing and developed a disgusting humbled work ethic. It's what allowed me to work without expecting anything in return. My dad has been welder for 20 years and watching him work the way he did without praise all the time taught me a lesson about how you need to work in silence to achieve your goals. Its a lesson I will pass down to my kids.  3) When I couldn't lift my arm up, drive, or wipe my butt I had to get surgery. After that no NFL tam wanted a linebacker with a shoulder that had bone spurs, arthritis, and a torn labrum. We do to much upper body movement in taking on blocks and making tackles to be able to be effective with a bad shoulder.
[Thanks for the answers, Toneford!  (Hey, you do not argue with your dad. :\) \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnoy7wq?context=5)|Lol... that I do not.
[My question is, from the money you made as a professional football player in the NFL, I'm curious as to how you faced times where you were broke after your career ended. Was it simply due to bad financial practice during your time as a player, or are some players not paid as much as the general public believes, etc.? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2sf9qi/i_am_anthony_trucks_former_oregon_football_player/cnp1nph?context=5)|Not ignorant at all. I think people have a misconstrued vision of how much money we made. We actually only get paid during the season every week. So if you don't make it the full football season you don't make the full money. Then the tax bracket takes  A LOT of money from you. We also don't make millions like everyone thinks. While I was playing I actually still shopped at ross and drove an old Chevy Tahoe. When I got out I still live a pretty frugal life. My struggles came from spending money on opening my gym and then not getting it profitable for years so i slowly declined. Its hard because I could have easily gotten a job and got steady paycheck, but my heart wanted to help people in a different way. At the time in 2008 the economy was horrible but i stupidly opened the gym and struggled. That being said without that struggle I wouldn't be where I am today from learning some really hard lessons.

Here's the stuff I have right now (definitely open to change). I'm hoping to get a lot of stuff from friends:
My friend can give me his old gaming monitor and keyboard.
My friend's dad says he has a bunch of PSU's lying around that I might could use, but don't know condition atm or anything. 
I can buy an OS from my school for very cheap.

Things I'm not sure about:
Do I need some sort of cooling? Does the CPU usually come with one? I think the case comes with a few fans. I don't plan on overclocking.
Do I need an optical drive? or a sound card? I plan on getting speakers eventually. 
Are any of these parts overkill? Should I get an i3 instead of an i5 (the i5 listed is from microcenter, in-store pick up). Should I find a lesser GPU? (the one I have listed is a refurbished one from GPUshack)
I'd like to get an SSD if we could fit it in.

This is my first IT related job so I have nothing to fall back on experience-wise other than the couple months I've been interning. I don't mind programming when things are going smoothly but when I'm stuck it's incredibly frustrating and I loathe having to go back the next day.

I want to, or wanted to, get into print media but from what I gather from my research its sorta a shit show or low entry opportunity into any field I want with what I have. Ideally my life goals would be reporter/ or college professor. I tried taking the GRE twice and failed both times,  low scores because I wasn't focused or a good test taker. 

I have some knack for working with computers and more or less been able to service/repair/ build my own contraption. 

My question or need of advice is this: I don't have any contacts in the field and my confidence is borderline depressive or incredibly self conscious. Should I keep applying to jobs and see where it goes? Should I double down and study for grad school? I wouldn't mind the debt because I have basically widdled down my confidence on anything that would work. Should I go to community college and get a associates in pc tech?

I did all of my core classes at a community college, and transferred to this 4-year University last semester. So while I'm technically a Junior, I've only just now started getting into the ""real"" classes for my degree. For reference, I'm taking Data Structures, Discrete Math Structures, and Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science this semester. 

One of my new professors suggested that we all start looking into internships. I had been planning on doing this anyway and started browsing last night. I keep coming across so many internships that state they want Sophomores/Juniors, but the descriptions for these internships all seem way out of my league.

For example, one place wants people with experience using UNIX, Apache, and Tomcat. Another requires you to be familiar with a whole list of scripting languages. Yet another want students who have ""working knowledge"" of Indust, Appcelerator Titanium, Enterprise Applications Integration, XML, JSF, **and** EJB... (What even are those last two?!).. You get the picture.

I totally realize, and appreciate, that this industry is one that requires constant learning, and I have no problems with that. It's just.. right now I feel seriously overwhelmed by how much a student is apparently meant to know already and I feel panicked because I don't know half of what these job descriptions are stating.

I could sit here and continue to whine about it, but I'd rather put on my Big Girl Panties and start trying to get ~working knowledge~ of different pieces of software and languages in my own time, because I realize now that I can't rely on my school for everything. 

As of now, I have experience with Java and C.. and not much else yet. I've fucked around in a few different IDEs, and I know how to (kinda) get around in Linux. I have a spare PC and my professor suggested putting Linux on there, so I plan on doing that this weekend. 

But where would you guys suggest I continue on from here though? I'm really put off from applying for internships now, so I don't know if I'm even going to bother with that for a while.. Is that a bad idea? 

Also, I've noticed SQL being mentioned in basically all of the job descs, and I have 0% experience with it (aside from knowing what it stands for, hah!), so should I start there? Are there any other particular OS or software or anything else that you'd suggested learning in my own time? 

Apologies for all of the questions. Thank you to anyone who gets this far and who can offer advice to this panicked student :)"

How much of it is purely preference, or are certain things almost necessary given the nature of a project, etc?

(Also if anyone has thoughts on the interview aspect, would it be prudent to answer with a PHP framework if I know the company is built off of PHP, or would it be better to be up front about the fact that I'd prefer other languages for my own stack?)

* Intermediate Programming (Object Oriented)
* Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)
* Assembly

* Operating Systems
* Computer Networks

2shrh7,2,2015-01-15,[SCIENCE] - I'll graduate as a Bachelor of Biological Sciences. Can I reach 80-100k annual income in 10-15 years?,gran_helvetia,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2shrh7/science_ill_graduate_as_a_bachelor_of_biological/,"TL;DR at the bottom

Hi guys,

So, about myself,

I've chosen to go for a Bachelor of Biological Sciences degree - something one needs to be passionate about, as, at least in my country, it means long hours of study and usually not the best paycheck. My program is 5 years long, I got accepted into uni when I was 17, but I got a 1-year scholarship to study overseas, and the courses I do here won't count for my diploma. I'm currently halfway through that scholarship, doing a summer internship in a highly prestigious marine science/biology research institution. So you can say things are going pretty well. BUT, I'm really doubtful about my future as a biologist. I mean, although I got that scholarship because I have good english, my GPA and resume are still somewhat average (maybe slightly better than the program’s average, being realistic, but nothing special). I failed one of the four subjects I did on my first semester abroad (first time that happened) and passed the rest with only the passing grade. That was mainly due to stress and personal problems back at home, but it happened, so I might as well move on.

I'm highly determined to improve my grades from now on, starting from my next study-abroad semester. Although back at home I was involved in a project with environmental monitoring (which involved underwater fieldwork, valuable experience) and did some tutoring in a Microbiology course, I don't have my name in any publications or anything. Hopefully I'll get to write a small essay/report/poster of my own here at my internship, but not so sure about that as I have to help the post-grads with their own work (yes it sucks, because it drains my time to the point I can't dedicate to do something of my own but isn't significant enough to have my name in their publications, but I have to do what I'm told, because I'm getting the scholarship for it).

Now, my first question for people in the science/academic world out there: what matters the most for my early career, my GPA or my involvement with projects/publications? My program has a shitload of mandatory courses I'm not really interested, so I'm not sure if I want to dedicate my time studying hard for those (instead of just passing grade) when I could be working on being involved in publications/projects.

As for my scientific preferences, I'm mainly interested in marine microbiology and also molecular biology/biochemistry, things like gene expression, biocompounds, etc. Although I wouldn't restrict myself to that depending on my career opportunities. I know there is some money to be made in those fields with things like biotech solutions to environmental problems, pharmaceutical industry, and whatnot. I don't know if I'm being too ambitious, but I have as a goal to have a salary of around 80-100k a year when I'm in my mid-thirties. Is that plausible as a researcher/university professor? Or an industry-related job, in the areas cited above? After graduating, my primary plan is to go straight to post-grad school, preferably abroad, to get a Masters or preferably a PhD. I mean, I don't want to be rich or anything, but that is the payment I hope to have to have a worry-free, non-lavish lifestyle. I don't count on inheriting anything from my family as well, we have a middle-class standard of living but we lost most of our assets (that's a different story), although I know they could give me a little hand if I had financial difficulties WHILE studying.

I have considered alternatives like going to med school after I graduate from Bio Sciences (completely possible, as I long as I want to) and getting involved with a field like dive medicine, natural compounds or something else I'm into. A second one is doing a second degree on computer science/systems analysis, which is something I also like, and I can work part-time with IT/Web Development while I'm studying, because there is heaps of demand for that work, and working with computational biology after graduating. I also consider investing in the cannabis industry, because it is a flourishing business, I love it and I think many countries will start being more progressive with laws towards medical cannabis (also something I could work with if I went to med school). 

Sorry for the long post, but here it is, I’ve listed my background and main interests, any advice on what I should do to achieve the 80-100k annual salary in 10-15 years? Many thanks! Also I typed this in a hurry so please ignore any English mistakes.

**TL;DR: OP will graduate as a Bachelor of Biological Sciences in a couple of years and aims to have a 80-100k annual income in 10-15 years, working as a researcher/professor, or some other industry-related job, his interests being microbiology, molecular biology and biochemistry, specially in the marine environment. Alternatives are going to med school after graduating or doing a second degree on computer science and working with computational biology, and also investing in the cannabis industry (which would be nice specially if I became a doctor). Thoughts?**

2sjgqt,1,2015-01-15,[Build Help] Looking for Advice and Suggestions on Pre-Build Hardware Selections!,shuff109,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2sjgqt/build_help_looking_for_advice_and_suggestions_on/,"Hey Guys!
  
First time actually posting on the sub, but I’ve been lurking for a couple weeks now. Right now, I am looking into building my first pc, and would like your honest opinions about my hardware selections. To explain what I am looking to get out of this build would be best explained by giving you some background on myself.  

First, I am a sophomore MIS student at my university and am currently working as an IT intern for a Fortune 25 company. I have never built a computer before due to insufficient funding, but now with the pay that I am making, I can certainly afford to build one now.

So the first thing I am looking to get out of this whole process is EXPERIENCE. The end product is not nearly as important to me as the knowledge that I can gain from the process itself. Without trying to sound cocky, I feel that I am well-versed in a lot of software applications, so now I am looking to expand my knowledge over to the hardware side as well. 

Second, I am looking to build a decent rig, one that will still be more effective than standard pc’s in the next few years, and can run high quality visual settings on the various games I play. NOTE: I am a very casual PC gamer, 40+ hours/week will do that to you. 

Lastly, I am not looking to break the bank. I am trying to keep the build under or around $1000. 

Having said all of that, I am asking for your help, /r/buildapc for some good feedback and ideas! Please remember that this is my FIRST TIME building a pc, so I’d appreciate constructive criticism, not hateful feedback explaining why my selections suck. After doing a lot of external research on the necessary hardware, the list that I believe to best suit what I’m looking for is perma-linked below (because I don't know how to use the usual hardware posting format :/):

I've been interning with Company A for over 18 months now, working full-time over the summer and part-time during the school year. I accepted an offer with Company B in November for a full-time position once I graduate, starting this upcoming summer.    

When should I notify Company A that I will not be staying with them after graduation and that I've accepted an offer somewhere else? I'd like to continue working with Company A for as long as possible before transitioning to Company B (the rest of this semester, through April, at least), so I'm not looking to burn any bridges at the moment.


Company A has not yet requested an interview for a full-time position, even though I applied for one and have been interning with the company for over 18 months (not a fixed-length internship, my manager asks me at the end of each summer/semester if I'd like to continue working).

Thoughts? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
2sjoid,1,2015-01-15,A question for those in the workforce,PhantomUpdate,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2sjoid/a_question_for_those_in_the_workforce/,"OK so pardon me if this is not the proper subreddit or if the question is dumb. I am a very active , fitness and health are very important to me. Im fresh out of college and will be entering the workforce soon hopefully with a junior programming job or internship. I want to know from those that are professionals in this industry and have been in it for a while how the job requirements have affected your lifestyle when it comes to fitness. At college going to the gym and such wasn't an issue for me since the gym was on campus but I know that in the real world, work days and weeks are long. You are sitting for hours on end I've even been told programmers sleep over when deadlines are approaching and rely on a lot of junk snacks to keep them alert. Is this just a myth I've heard or is maintaining an active lifestyle the same with a developer/programming as any other career? 

Any feedback would be appreciated and again my apologies if this question seems a bit odd"
2sjtag,2,2015-01-15,Should I change adviser in third year of Ph.D?,marvez,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2sjtag/should_i_change_adviser_in_third_year_of_phd/,"I am Ph.D candidate in an US university in natural sciences and I have been in school for 2.5 years (I am in my 3rd year). My current PI is running out of funding, and I am the only person working in the lab, my PI was a big professor once with money, postdocs, etc; but then he stopped applying for grants and caring about everything. He only comes to lab once a week when he comes, but usually he does not reply emails and he is gone for months, he has tenure though.

He is looking for positions in other American university and he said if he leaves he will leave me in the lab of one of his friends, since I am not willing to follow him anywhere (family).I have a strong fellowship so he can really afford paying me less than 20% of my monthly stipend (not tuition). What should I do? I do not like my research but it gives me fast medium quality publications. Currently I have 3 first author and one second author publication, and still have three more papers in preparation. I also would like to graduate in 4.5 years and do an internship in industry, which my adviser does not agree on that. My options are:

a)Stay here and hope he does not leave soon, or the funding does not run out, and he will publish my papers soon (he can take from 1 week to 1 year to submit papers because he almost never works). This will be the easiest and fastest decision, since I am familiar with the research I can graduate in 4.5 years. The other positive thing is that I am my own boss and I am pretty good at managing my time, proposing my ideas and getting this done, and still have a life at the same time. I am highly independent.

B) Switch to a new assistant professor in my department. I like his research but he pushes his students to work 12 hours daily Monday to Sunday, which I do not want to since I have a family. He has strong connections with someone I would like to do a postdoc with. I also suspect he will not allow me to graduate in 4.5 years even if I have enough papers already. Also he is new so he may not get funding and he does not have many lab equipment, like we do now.

c) Switch to a professor in other department, I do not like his reseach, but at least is more useful than the research I am doing now. He is very nice, well recognized, student oriented, has lots of funding and many students talk very well of him, he gives you freedom and does not obligates you to work crazy hours.

Any advice? which three options would be better for me? I cannot switch to another lab since the other or do not have funding, or are enemies or friends of my PI. I am afraid that if I leave him I will delay in graduation, it would look bad in resume, he will not give me any more recommendation letters or he will get so mad with me. To make things worst we have to change to a worst smaller lab space in the summer for the second time and is pain to pack everything by myself.

2skyi1,2,2015-01-15,Just finished final round.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2skyi1/just_finished_final_round/,"Just finished my two final round interviews for an internship, and I'm not sure what to think. My first interview went badly - I was on the right track to a solution, but I had a lot of trouble getting it to be the time complexity required, and the interviewer had to give me a really big nudge before I figured out the solution. He may have been planning on giving me a second question, but we ran out of time since I got stuck.

The second interview went really well. The interviewer gave me two questions that I coded up really quickly, and we had ~15 minutes left over to talk about his  experience at the company, and about company culture.

So I'm not sure how I did. I got along well with each of my interviewers, but I did a lot worse on one interview than I would've liked. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?"

I'm looking for an internship for this spring and depending on whether it's paid or not, the summer. I have a lot of free time this semester!

I'm a computer science student and live in Manhattan, and my biggest interest is web development. I'm focusing on the front end for now so I'd love an opportunity to learn how it's done in the real world.

I'm pretty comfortable with JavaScript, including its OOP implementation, closures, ""this"", a bit of functional programming, etc. Right now I am studying design patterns and more advanced OOP concepts, but I got the basics down.

I've worked with jQuery a lot, mostly for DOM manipulation but I've done some Ajax and effects/animations.

I also have a solid understanding of the MVVM architecture, having done a simple project using jQuery and also Knockout. I can extend this knowledge to other MV-something concepts as well.

Most importantly, I am a passionate self learner. I've taught myself almost everything I know about programming and web development, and I am not afraid of learning more abstract concepts like frameworks or work with vanilla JS.

I haven't done anything advanced by myself—I've done a to-do site that has priority sorting, editing, and local storage; a ""cat clicker"" app I did to learn MVC; a version of that in Knockout, and an onscreen calculator. I am planning to do more projects over the next week or so, though.

Well, that's it. If anyone is interested, I'd be welcome to talk more and share the code for these projects through PM or email. Thanks for any help."
2slc4e,5,2015-01-15,"Graduating college soon with a CSci degree....AAAAAAAHHH!!! Not much experience, what should I be focusing on?",Draoken,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2slc4e/graduating_college_soon_with_a_csci/,"A little background about myself: This year I'll be graduating as a senior with a CSci degree from a decent university. However, I'm in quite the rut. I have yet to obtain a single internship. I haven't had a job in college until this year. I'm not in any clubs. I'm not a stellar student with these socializing skills capable of swooning professors into giving me letters of recommendation. 

The good things about me. I'm starting to develop a website using drupal. I use enough linux to understand it and am fairly comfortable with using the terminal. I know how to code in a lot of the common languages, and am on track to learning some others. Although I'm sure I am nothing compared to people in the industry, while in school I was outdoing a lot of people in my classes.

 I'm not quite sure on what road I should be heading on right now if I want some kind of coding job. I'm planning to make a LinkedIn pretty soon here, and going to tackle some microsoft certs.  I want to work on open-source projects but I have no idea where to start or how to look. I've gone to [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/) a few times but I'm not quite sure if that's the best place to be at. Once I do start working on projects I plan to start a wordpress based blog to track most of it.

Besides that, how do I really show my coding proficiency? I feel like projects &gt; certs for this, but I'm not quite sure what languages I should be trying to learn/code in to show this. I've looked through a lot of job sites online and the requirements are staggering; I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do as an entry level employer.

If I had to sum up all my thoughts into a few concise points, it would be:

How am I supposed to get into the open source community? How do I show my contributions?

What languages should I be focusing on?

Are internships still usual after college? (I saw a post on this in the faq, but didn't really apply to me) Where and how should I be looking? I realize that internships are the crux of employment, and I'm bummed I didn't work on this.

Are there any pretty vital certifications that would help me get my foot in the door?

Are there any good online resources for me to get better general coding practices/information, like blogs I could be following? I've heard about HackerRank, and I do some bandit.org wargames every once in a while but haven't really got far in that.

Thank you so much, this has been a huge point of stress for me. I feel like I can always fallback on help desk but I thought might as well try to understand the programmer aspect a bit more considering I went to school for it."

Tried to cheer myself up by looking at the bright side: I got and accepted an offer from FB, my first choice. It doesn't matter that Google didn't want me, I got where I want to go anyway. That should be great.

Proceed to stalk FB intern page, trying to cheer up by psyching myself up for summer. Click on someone's profile who has the same future position as me.

Kid is super into coding, from the looks of it. Wall is full of statuses about multiple side projects with lots of cool gadgets, all of which I have no clue how to make. See resume. Looks better than mine, and what's this? Expected to graduate in 2017. Sophomore. Kid is full year younger and so much better than I am.

I'm a junior, and I feel like the offers I did get are flukes. FB rolled out a raise for all their interns and I don't feel like I'm worth anything near what they'll be paying me. Feeling the imposter syndrome hard. 

I get these waves of feelings of inadequacy and have to spend hours (sometimes days) to feel better by trying to focus on positives like the offers I did get. I feel like my self esteem is constantly oscillating. I'll have a period where I feel confident, adequate, like a good programmer. Then I see something like a friend's accomplishment and all that crashes down. How do I stop feeling this way?

I will be going to another school to acquire my B.A.S. starting in the fall.  



 I've taken a programming fundamentals class already which used C++  and we got up to arrays. I'm currently in a C++ class this semester that covers searching and sorting arrays, pointers, structures, classes, polymorphism, exceptions, and templates. I'm also taking a Java 1 class that will be covering most of the same things, but will have more GUI involved lessons toward the end of the class. Next semester I'll be taking a C#, CSS &amp; HTML, and Java 2 for my final classes. However, in order to graduate I need to an internship or a capstone. I really don't want to do a capstone because it's not paid and I don't trust people to do a fair share of work, especially without the motivation of money. I really want to learn as much as I can from an internship, and turn it into employment as I go for my B.A.S.. So being able to aim for the highest I can for my area is really important to me. I've taken a network fundamentals class and I'm currently taking a database class which uses Access for the assignments. I considered using this as a good time to go above and beyond the class and create a program (probably in Java) that will work with the database. I figured if I could use this in my portfolio that it could really help my chances for an internship.    



 To sum up the point of this post is that I really want to use the next 3-4 months to gain the right skills that will help me land the right internship. I understand this isn't a simple question because of all the possibilities out there. I'm just looking for specific suggestions mainly. Any suggestion is welcome and will be appreciated! "
2smpdm,16,2015-01-16,My car was damaged during a repossession,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2smpdm/my_car_was_damaged_during_a_repossession/,"Luxury vehicle was repossessed after missing two payments, it was dragged while in park in my driveway when no one was home. Steep driveway that I usually have to slowly drive over so I can only imagine that's what damaged it. 

I was out of state on an internship when it occurred so when we paid for it to avoid a car auction, it sat in their lot from the end of November to January. I was told normally it's a flat fee of $165 when it's there and that daily charges are normally not charged. We ended up paying around $2000 in November and continued to make the regular monthly payment on time since then.

So I went to pick it up last week and after having me wait for an hour and thirty minutes they tell me the Financer wanted me to pay another $1400 due to storage fees. First time this had ever come up, then they tell me the CV shaft (something connected to the transmission by an axle) is damaged and also the engine was making noises and if the car was in this condition. 

They say they'll ""handle"" my storage fees, which were never brought up till that day, hell the financier(car company) had called me earlier that week to ask if I was in town to pick up the vehicle and had never mentioned anything else I had to pay . Then said I'd need a tow due to the damage and offered to give me a tow to me vehicle which they broke to just sit on my street I guess.

I then asked about the damages and for
Them to repair when they suggested they had a shop that did work
For them. I suggested a dealership instead but after googling the auto shop it seemed decent enough. 

I'm scared the vehicle may be damaged further, I'm afraid they're making up this storage fee just to have some leverage. The state is Ohio, someone please help. They've been trying to contact me but have no idea what the best course of action may be or
What I may be entitled to 

Edit: just want to thank all of you for helping out with the advice, lot of shit going on right now along with this whole car fiasco. Much appreciated guys "

I started applying to jobs around mid-December (took a break during the holidays) and am now applying again for various junior Android developer positions. I picked Android because it's the most interesting to me, and I've had around one year of experience (one semester of class, then one summer internship) with this platform.

I'm really searching for a full-time junior developer position and have had phone interviews from around 12 companies as well as 3 on-site interviews. No offers, just rejections.

I feel helpless and lost. I feel like a stupid studying Biology for my winter class during this winter break. I worked hard to get an A in this class; staying up all night long working on a paper I didn't even like. But, I just lost my interview. I like doing CS stuff. I wish I could have enough time to just do CTCI questions or do some side projects, but I feel like I always spend a big portion of my time maintaining my grades at school. I don't know if this is worth it or not because I haven't taken the important CS classes yet. Last time I took a Data Structures class, the professor was really really bad; I didn't learn anything. I started to pick up things again when I read CTCI, but I haven't had a chance to finish this book.



I've really lost my confidence at this point. I don't even know what to do besides posting here hoping somebody would give a good advice. Like every CS student, I wanted to get a job at Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. when I started college.

As super excited as I was, I was also filled with panic... So I ended up telling the lady I already have an internship. She seemed surprised at the idea someone would turn down the opportunity... And quickly made our our awkward conversation come to an end. 

Now I'm sitting there, happy that they called me back... Then realized my current internship ends before summer :( I try to call her back and all these shenanigans... But no response. Now I'm sulking that I may end up with nothing to do this summer while I could've possibly been working at a company I've been trying my best to get into.

My girlfriend says I should leave with a master's, but the master's degree here also requires me to defend a thesis.  That would take at least another year probably (since I dont have enough good research yet) and to me seems like almost as much work as just finishing the PhD.

My question is about whether I should tough it out and get a master's in my current school if I want to go into software development in industry.  In terms of ""years of experience"", how do I count my years in the PhD program?  It is not just programming all day but also things like teaching classes/grading, writing and reading academic papers, running experiments, etc.  
Also, how can I leave without pissing off my adviser, who is my main employer reference for these past 4 years?   I feel like I owe him some successful publications since he supported me all this time.

2snuca,9,2015-01-16,It's been a bad year,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2snuca/its_been_a_bad_year/,"About a year ago, I cheated on the girl who changed my life in innumerable positive ways. She was a lively soul, smart, beautiful, and forever giving. She was always there.

I took advantage of her trust and I betrayed her. I'm certain I took some of her optimism with me, too, which implicates me in much more than just infidelity. I probably changed her negatively as much as she changed me for the better.

It's been about a year, and while I can't claim that our breakup is the only reason why I can't seem to make any forward progress, I can't deny its magnitude.

The past year at school was endlessly challenging to my intellect, my nerve, and my emotions. I think I turned to working as an escape, but that pulled and stretched at my patience until I was burned out.

This past vacation was a sham. I barely lifted a finger, when I should have been preparing for phone interviews. I was rejected at the company at which I wanted to do an internship the most. I sputtered and stopped. I let myself go. I started listening to the voice of negativity that is constantly narrating my failures.

I'm back at school, which no longer seems to be the haven it used to be. I'm too old to be here, I should have graduated, and I'm not making adequate progress on my master's degree. I have to ask my dad for more money to borrow, which may not even happen. I've lost all detectable desire to go to class.

My therapist helps, but only for twenty-four hours or so. I try to meditate, but only images of past failure, regrets and dreads, or images of her come out, and I can't maintain the focus to make my mind silent.

I have a crush on someone, but I have every reason to think it won't work. That's all I feel any more. Hope for hopeless outcomes or punishment for stupid mistakes.

I'm not the person I act in front of everyone. I don't really think anyone knows how messed up I am. Maybe her, but she's long gone."

As far as extra curriculars go, I was in Key Club freshmen year at my local High School, and I currently have an internship which will have me shadowing a person in the medical field at a local hospital and we will be doing community service as well. I will join FBLA senior year, too. As far as SATs and ACTs go. I took the ACT sophomore year to place into MATH 126 and ENG 101, I received a 24 without practicing.

2snzaa,3,2015-01-16,"Don't be me, or my boss.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2snzaa/dont_be_me_or_my_boss/,"This is a memoir of my experience with bullying in the workplace over the past year. Brace yourself for a novel. 

I write this post to commemorate the last day of my employment at my current job, and to mark the end of an 11 month journey through hell. Some may describe hell as a place with fire and physical torture, but my hell took place in an office as quiet and mediocre as any other. A seemingly endless cycle of isolation, psychological abuse, and perceived entrapment which resulted in the slow destruction of my self-worth. The relationship between employers and employees is tricky, with a large grey area blurring friendship and formality. Employees work best under an employer who respects their work, rewards a job well done, and makes an attempt to get to know their employees as people. In the adult world, we are expected to either talk out our issues, act like they don’t exist, or remove ourselves from the situation. However, when you’re a minimum wage earning student worker caught in a cycle of bullying by your boss, none of these options seem possible. Well, at least that’s what I thought.

At the bottom of the employment totem pole, I entered this job fairly new to office culture. I had completed only two 3 month internships prior to getting hired at (let’s call it U), and like many 21 year olds was still learning how to maneuver the customs and courtesies of the 8-5. I was hired by a soft spoken, cordial but slightly awkward man who turned out to be the boss who actually liked me. Unfortunately, he was not the one I ended up working for. On my first day employed as an administrative assistant, I sat down for coffee with the two potential coordinators with whom I could be paired. My first impression of both coordinators were that they were overweight women in their early 40s who gave me negative “vibes”. This should have been a red flag. While talking to the second coordinator, I asked about her interests and was delighted to hear that we both enjoyed ‘nerdy’ things, her noting that she enjoys gaming (this is relevant). My parents never allowed gaming consoles, handheld gaming devices, or RPG games in the house, so I was one of those kids who was never really exposed to gaming. Seriously, I can barely look and walk at the same time in a videogame. I appreciate them for their artistic creativity and entertainment value, but gaming has never been my thing. 

Anyways, I was given the choice of which coordinator I would like to assist, and I chose the gamer (call her B… for Bitch Boss). The weeks go by, I was navigating the learning curve of my new job, and becoming increasingly dismayed by B’s lack of interest in or engagement with me. Her only interactions with me were to tell me about tasks to be done. No greeting, asking about my weekend, or any of the basic courtesies. I began to worry that it was just me, as she laughed and joked with our other co workers, but never included me in the conversation. It was becoming clear to me that she did not like me, which started inducing stress with every strained interaction.
 
Cut to a month later, at our first program event. I used to have a poor habit of saying dumb shit under tension or stress, which I quickly learned how to recognize and curb. As we drove to the event venue in silence, I was desperate for something to say to break the ice. Naturally, my size 7.5w foot fit perfectly into my gravely mistaken mouth as I said, “Who even majors in (let’s call it Philosophy equivalent)? It must be hard for them to find jobs.” As it turns out, B did. I immediately apologized, ashamed beyond all imagination, and tried to turn the conversation to something more pleasant. “So are you going to play Assasin’s Creed 4 when it comes out?” B turned and looked at me with a sneer on her face. “It came out two weeks ago, and I pre-ordered it on Steam months beforehand. Frankly I’m surprised you even know what Assasin’s Creed is”, she said as we arrived to the venue. That was when our relationship took a turn downhill. All I can remember from that night, apart from the tension you could cut with a knife, was her pulling out her 3DS and playing for a solid hour in silence as we waited in the venue, alone, before the event started without an attempt to talk to me.  

Her general attitude towards me from then on out was, as my nice boss later explained to me, her effectively “writing me off”. She gave me the most tedious tasks with ambiguous instructions, passive aggressively answered my questions after I would spend 10min just plucking up the courage to ask her, and criticized my every work for flaws with no positive feedback. She rarely acknowledged my existence at work socials, unless to disagree with my opinion or begin another conversation in the middle of mine. No one ever said anything in my defense, and I began to feel singled out. 

Over the summer, our department is most busy. We are constantly handling student groups, taking them on tours around the university and the surrounding city. Going on the student trips meant the afternoon out of the office, which was fantastic… except when B lead the trips. Trips with B and I leading groups of students alone amounted to three hours of pure anxiety for me. Even on trips that were supposed to be fun opportunities for students and coworkers to get to know each other, B never made a single attempt to get to know me. I asked her about where she was from, her upcoming wedding plans, anything to possibly make her relax and talk to me like a human being, but she always responded in short and curt answers with a side of complaint. The worst was when we held informational meetings for our programs. She never spoke to me as an equal, rather she snapped at me or talked down to me in front of other students. During a computer lab orientation we were leading for the new students, she literally snapped her fingers at me, spitting “ThighsOnFire, situational awareness” as she jerked her head towards a student with their hand raised with a question.  It’s one thing to deal with this kind of condescending treatment in high school, where your peers have no legitimate power over you, but quite another when that person is the one evaluating your work. I felt powerless as an easily replaceable student worker. It felt as though speaking up about her to my other boss or coworkers would just open a can of “mediation talk” worms, or worse, get me fired. B’s constant criticism of my work and lack of instruction made me doubt my work and myself, making me believe that I would never be good enough. As one could imagine this ramped up my anxiety, making me feel constantly vulnerable. 

B is not the type to care about her own appearance or participate in anything feminine. She’s on the verge of becoming obese, wears cheap clothing, and voiced disapproval of having to pick out her own wedding dress. That would be just fine, if she didn’t make snarky comments to my co workers every time I expressed my enjoyment of something feminine. She’s nice to the men in the office, giggling and acting sweet around the women in the office who resemble her, but a sheet of ice always formed whenever I walked into the room. She scoffed at my excitement for Game of Thrones, calling it terrible and exploitive only after I showed my coworkers my coasters with GOT house crests on them. Another time,  I was encouraging some students who asked about good American horror films to watch Cabin in the Woods when I tried to include B in the conversation. “It’s my favorite Joss Whedon film”, I directed to B, “What about yours?” She ignored my question as she replied, “You all probably don’t know who Joss Whedon is. His films probably aren’t very appropriate to talk about right now”, and walked away. She essentially shot me down every time I attempted to be myself around her, which made me become withdrawn and depressed. Coming into work every morning became dreadful, as I feared what kind of isolation, rudeness or insult B would throw at me today. 
I began showing signs of depression in August, with frightening thoughts of suicide creeping into my head. The days grew numb, as I smoked more and more to ease my anxiety. There were other factors in my life which contributed, such as essentially living alone because my roommate worked nights, and tending to a severely mentally ill long distance boyfriend, but none more significantly than my work environment. I felt trapped in an endless cycle of oppression and loneliness. “Why not quit?”, you’re probably asking yourself. I should have seen the signs a long time ago, but being an impressionable 21yo who was determined to finish the job she started, I pushed myself through the summer. I didn’t make it through the summer unscathed, however. 

I began my final classes of college with a prescription for antidepressants and two major panic attacks under my belt from the summer. The second and most significant occurred when there was a printing mistake with some transcripts that got mailed out, and we had to resend a few new copies. We received this notice in August, when the transcripts had been mailed out in June. I felt my stomach plummet when I realized that they were the transcripts I had printed! I remembered that, in my stress induced frenzy trying to print a complete this task for the first time, I failed to notice a small glitch in the transcript template. This glitch made some grades not show up on printed copies, even though the grades transferred on the computer.There is a system in our office requiring everything to be checked twice, and I remembered handing the transcripts off to B with the assumption that she would also check them. Despite the fact that she did not check them, and the glitchy transcript template was under her umbrella of work, she blamed me completely for the mistake and got nice boss involved. In her email to me she told me that this was the worst situation to happen to the department ever, and that I clearly showed no regard for attention to detail. I was so distraught from the perceived gravity of my mistake that I claimed illness, literally ran from work to the campus psychiatric counseling office, and burst into tears to the on-call therapist. I had never felt so helpless, ashamed, and alone in my life. I had nowhere else to turn. 

A few months later, I was working at my desk as usual when the girl who worked in my position last showed up to the office to visit. B was so excited for arrival of her ex-assistant that she took her out for coffee to catch up. I didn’t expect to be invited along, rather I turned back to my work and wondered how much more I would probably like my job if B had been that enthusiastic about me at any point. 
I realize now that my story has become rambly, so I’ll quickly describe the last four months of employment. I worked part time, completed another internship on the side to finish out a minor, and graduated college early with a 3.5 GPA. None of my accomplishments felt legitimate to me because of how deeply to heart I took B’s treatment. When I returned from my graduation trip, she never asked about it or congratulated me for graduating, but snapped at me to begin another task. It was then that I decided that enough was enough, and set the date for my departure. Being a student worker, I could still work for the university up to 3 months after graduating, but I couldn’t stand working there any longer. It had gotten to the point where even going near the building filled me with dread. Upon setting this date, nice boss asked about the relationship between B and I. Having been built up for almost a year, I finally unloaded all of my feelings about how B had been treating me to nice boss. What he said reassured me that it was indeed not my fault, I actually was a good employee, and that B and I just had an, “irreconcilable difference in work styles.” “You’re more outgoing and laid back,” nice boss said, “and for B I think that came off like you didn’t care, but you did care. You made all of your deadlines even if there were a few mistakes, but you corrected yourself and didn’t make the same mistake twice. I think she just wrote you off a long time ago.” Having always been an eager to please A student, being “written off” was something I had never experienced before. 

Yesterday was my last day, and it went off as expected. B finished off our time together by failing to show up to the celebratory karaoke bar-hop that the rest of the department managed to attend, and departed with a casual, “Happy trails, ThighsOnFire.” It was the moment when I turned away from her for the last time that the burden lifted from my shoulders. She no longer had power over me. I sang and drank my heart out with a big smile on my face, finally freed from the culmination of almost a year’s worth of torture. 

Consider my plight a cautionary tale to both employers and young employees. I know B will never read this, as I remember her saying, ""I hate Reddit. It's so pretentious and stupid."" Employers, never underestimate the impact you have on those who work for you. It’s one thing to be bullied by a peer, but facing verbal and emotional abuse in addition to the power dynamic between employer and employee is crippling. To all of you 20 somethings getting their first jobs, never let yourself believe that bullying is worth suffering through for a paycheck. Your dignity and mental well-being should never be compromised, and there is better out there. 

TL;DR: Regardless of your position in the work hierarchy, bullying is never acceptable. Never lose your sense of self-worth, or empathy towards others. "

2sqjbw,7,2015-01-17,Should I just give in and be a programmer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2sqjbw/should_i_just_give_in_and_be_a_programmer/,"This is rather long with many questions, so thanks for reading and giving me advice!

I'm graduating in May 2015 from a US college (ivy/top 20) with a BS in Econ &amp; CS. I'm looking for a full-time job, but I'm confused if I should just try to be a programmer or not.

At my first internship in sales operations at an ad tech company, I talked to the product manager in the company, and he persuaded me to try out for CS classes at school. That PM had a CS &amp; business degree, and he started his career in business consulting and later technical sales before becoming a product manager. Thus, in my junior year, I started with a java intro course, but one thing I lead to another, I somehow fulfilled the CS requirement with only 3 programming classes and a bunch of theory classes (cyber security, multi-processor, math, etc.) that didn't teach coding. I'm honestly not interested in coding and didn't do very well in those classes, but I'm very interested in technology in general, and I enjoy interacting with people who also care about or teach me more about coding and technology.

Just to make sure what I wanted (or not wanted) to do after college, I then had another summer internship working as a software engineer at a small startup, and the job (for me personally) was struggling, exhausting, and not fulfilling. Sitting in front of a computer monitor with minimal human contact all day long just isn't for me.

I thought product management was one of the best career paths for me, because it combines technical knowledge with business and interpersonal skills. My ex-coworkers also think I shouldn't be a programer but rather a business guy, and they suggest sales engineering or business operations (e.g. salesforce stuff). After reading my final report (that turned out to be a pretty good product and business report) for my software engineer internship, the office manager (whom I became friends with and still contact frequently) even thought that my talent was wasted on that job. As for companies, I also enjoy both B2B and B2C tech companies with a ""get-it-done culture"" where I don't have to wear a suit but work with tech enthusiasts everyday.

However, now during job hunting, I find it rather hard to go to those directions as a new grad. I tried applying to some new grad PM programs at some well-known companies such as Microsoft, AOL, Pocket Gems, and didn't make it to the second round, and other companies such as Yahoo, Google, Box, Dropbox, didn't even reply to my applications. I know these are long shots, but I honestly don't know where to look for more opportunities. 

So, should I just give in, study to be good at coding interviews (probably another struggle since I don't have that much experience in programming), and work as a programer first? It might be a bit easier to be in a high-demand job market, but I'd probably hate the job and try whenever possible to move to a non-coding position. Or, did I make a judgement towards programming job too soon, and maybe it's worth it to give it more time while learning how not to be lousy at coding?

I guess my real question is how to find a suitable job in a tech company that I can leverage my wide-range of interests and (entry-level) skills. Right now, I'm stuck at trying to find a job that reflects why I really studied CS in the first place - to get to know the technical stuff of the business, but still doing business. I have some people in my network from previous internships yet to be contacted, but I don't want to put all my hope on those 4 or 5 people.

By the way, do new grad programmers in larger cities really earn 100k? Is that something usual? What do ""normal"" new grads at non-coding jobs earn? It's hard to believe that an entry-level guy can earn more than other professions with 5 years of experience, even with SF or NYC's cost of living. I'm curious because I don't know what salary to expect for non-coding jobs as a CS student.

Also, if this is relevant info: I'm a foreigner who needs a work visa eventually. I can legally work in the US without visa sponsorship until late 2017 in the condition that I'm continuously employed after graduation - so the clock is ticking! I'm from Asia and speak fluent English, and people in the US usually don't believe that I'm not American. However, this fact can also sometimes work against me, because without getting to know me, people would expect me to be totally American with the perfect English skills, but I'm still in fact ESL &amp; foreign! Managers in my previous companies said that me being a foreigner but well-adjusted to the American culture is a huge plus and is a solid proof of my ability to learn and adapt, but I often find it difficult to show this advantage during a 30-minute interview.

Thanks again for anything to share."
2sqqvt,4,2015-01-17,Feeling a lot of dread about future coworkers for new job,[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/2sqqvt/feeling_a_lot_of_dread_about_future_coworkers_for/,"This is my first post here so apologies in advance if I'm not doing something right, and sorry if my problems sound really stupid because I know there could be much worse, but I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety lately about a job that I will be starting half a year from now (currently in college). 

The job has a small (10 including me) program for new hires, so you are expected to bond with/ get along really well with the others in your class. I'm dreading the day I have to start and meet everyone because I feel inferior to all the others in my class. They are all rock-stars who are smart, extraverted, and had really high tier internships  the prior year so they probably have better work ethics and office politic skills than me too. The industry I'm in can have a very frat-like mentality, and as an introvert I feel like I was a mistake. Right before each of my interviews, I would put a lot of energy into having that ""on"" mentality when speaking to the interviewers, so I'm scared that my peers and bosses are expecting a different person than I really am. I'm terrified that I'm going to be socially ostracized. I've never really been that party type, but I've been trying to change that aspect.

In particular, there's one coworker I am experiencing the most anxiety about. In a nutshell, I had reached out to an acquaintance in a similar industry and nicely asked if she had any interview tips or advice, and she pretty much ignored my message. However, it turns out that she was actually interviewing for the same program, and when she somehow found out that I had passed into the final round of interviews, she reached out and answered my messages, and also asked if we could meet up and practice interviewing together. Since then, I've reached out a couple times and just said Hi, but she hasn't ever taken the initiative to message me. She is pretty popular and accomplished. It feels like we got off on kind of a weird foot, but since she is pretty socially adept and was nice enough in person, I don't think her true feelings really show so I really can't tell if she is being genuine to me, likes me or hates me. I'll usually go with my gut, but my gut is confused. We aren't close, but we have a lot of mutual acquaintances and I don't really know what their sentiment about me is. I'm not really sure how to approach this, and I'm not sure if I should make an extra effort to try and be good friends with her or if I should be wary and keep her at a distance. 

I'm worried that not being able to be part of the in-group will affect how I am viewed in the company, and thus sabotage my career. 

Overall, I'm just kinda freaked. I'm really frustrated with myself, because I feel like my problems are stupid, and even if I tell myself to stop thinking about it and that I will be okay, the stress and anxiety just doesn't go away. Even if I am not actively thinking about it, I pretty much always feel tense. I feel like I need some support or outside perspective on this. Sorry for the ramble."
2sr1ju,77,2015-01-17,I feel like I've been thrown under the bus,iHateCSS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2sr1ju/i_feel_like_ive_been_thrown_under_the_bus/,"Hey guys, new intern here. Recently, I was accepted as an intern at a pretty big fortune 500 company. I felt that the interview wasn't done well, and I wasn't asked that many technical questions. This was for a MS Sharepoint web developer position involving HTML/CSS/JS. 

I started in the beginning of this week, and so far they've just been teaching me how to use Sharepoint. So far it hasn't been too difficult. Then, I sat with literally the only other programmer, and he talked me through the code he's written for various things (it was all based around using a jQuery library called SPServices). He had to rush, so he went over the code very quickly, and I didn't understand much of it at all (it was all used to interact with databases, which I have no experience of using). 

I was shocked when I found out that yesterday was his last day working. Because classes are starting soon, he will only be working a couple of hours, and he will be doing it at home. This is my first internship, and I will now be the ONLY programmer in this department. I am terrified because I know that I am not capable of what will be asked of me (I am having a meeting with my boss about my first project on Monday). I was expecting to be assigned a mentor of some sorts who I would work under for awhile before I would be on my own. I was extremely dismayed when I found out I was now going to have to deal with everything myself now.

The other programmer is a really nice dude, and he gave me his email so I could ask him questions if I ever need help with something. My bosses are really nice too, it's just that they are expecting way too much out of me. I believe that they have an unrealistic view of how much an intern should know due to the fact that they used to dump all of their work on the other programmer, and he would manage to get it done. He was a really smart dude who has been programming for much longer than I have, and I know that I won't be able to compare.

The reason why I'm so stressed out about this is that I am still at a county college. It has been really hard getting interviews due to the fact that my resume still says ""Pursuing Associate's"" and I won't be transferring to a 4-year school until fall. The fact that I was able to land this internship is seriously a miracle. If I don't manage to do well at my first internship, I feel like it will be even harder to get my next one. 

So what I wanted to ask was if it would be better to be straight up with my employers to let them know that I can't do what will be asked of me, or should I just stick it out and see how long I can last before they are fed up? Also, how long should an internship be? I'm working as a contractor, and I wasn't given any timeframe for how long the internship would last. I would like to leave as soon as possible, but I want to stay long enough to be able to put it on my resume.

Sorry for all the text. Any help would be appreciated."

&gt;His major work is going on with facebook. That person will befriend lots of people from that country and then start bragging about Max's company. He also messages people from those profiles recruiting them.

&gt;For example an Indian guy befriended my sister and then she saw all this things about a world changing company and this guy messaged her. They offer you that you will be working for the next big thing, that they are legitimate. They also tell you that they are already a very big company and have investments registrations and everything you need. They then act picky for offering you a role.

&gt;You think its a hard job but all they do is guide this flock of recruitment to wherever they want to defend human. Mostly it is guiding these people to reddit just because they have unique ip addresses. They are asked to come say hi on threads, show their support and at they end they are told they are helping people and will get a piece of the pie which is being a big member of human and becoming rich. They are told if they are good they will also be employed and provided documents that will help them get employed in the future. Kind of like working for a huge company as an internship that might even pay you and also helps people.

&gt;She asked me to investigate it and I was a doubter but I just could not believe that the lengths he was going to could be fake. He puts so much effort into creating this bubble that if you are not from a first world country accustomed to these laws, regulations ofcourse you will get suckered in. I just thought he was helping people and getting attacked for it. I had my doubts but the sentiment killed them off. Thats when I became the asshole arguing with you.

&gt;But as you've been pointing out things to me I research them from laws to his claims and then I returned from where I started which was that he is not telling the truth. I wish he was because its a great promise for underprivileged people. I always wished to do something to help but its pretty difficult sitting here and thought this was it but I'm more disappointed than feeling anger that he lied.

The founder's comments might sound sane in first glance, so to clarify, [here's a post in SRD](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2p953i/redditor_philanthropist_claims_reddit_admin/) regarding the ""founder"" saying reddit's CEO is going to fund him, and the CEO shows up to say it's false. And the he says [Elon musk made an account in reddit to comment on ""Human""].


I saw other Indian names pop up in this mess. I've also read that he's targeting Indians and SE Asians. If you see any reference to ""human"" in your circle and how it's the next big thing, please speak out."

Advice?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2sr3lg/1300_job_applications_in_6_months_no_luck_advice/,"I was laid off in August of last year after the tech startup I worked for sold their company to a Chinese brand. I worked there for about two years and then before working for them I was a non-paid intern for them since 2009. So pretty much I had grown with the company from the very beginning until the end. I feel quite lost as you can imagine. I don't have a degree in CS which is one of the reasons my mother believes that I am not landing a job, but I disagree. My ex's dad has no college degree and makes $110k as a programmer in VA. I have my AS in the Arts and then I started going for a BS with a minor in CS at Yale, but then I had to drop out. I ran out of scholarship money and it was just too expensive. Also, I fail at math. 

I've been programming since my family got internet back since I was seven. I'm 25 now. I know JAVA, C, C++, Python, C#, HTML, PHP, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, R, MATLAB, etc. 

Right now I work freelance I guess you would call it. I work for an hour a day for $10 doing front end work. I know that sounds shitty, but it pays for my cellphone and my credit card bills. 

I've applied for over 1,300+ jobs on Linkedin, Glassdoor, etc. I've had a few interviews in NYC. I've taken programming tests for companies where I've gotten 100% perfect score, yet still not hired. 

[Here is my resume for critique](http://imgur.com/a/9z63l).

I know my resume mostly focuses on marketing/social media (it's what I want to move into) with only one experience as a senior front end dev, but it's the only experience I have in the field besides self-teaching myself and programming a couple of apps/games on my own. 

Also, I am a polyglot if that matters to employers. I can speak fluent Dutch, German, Polish, Swedish, Danish, etc. Should I remove my references and put that there instead? And include my other achievements like being on national TV to talk about women in computer programming and being published on the huffington post?

Where else should I look for jobs? What changes should I make to my resume? I am willing to relocate anywhere. I also would like to look into working over in the UK. I've been applying to CS jobs on Reed."

2srmou,1,2015-01-17,"Try for an internship, or make sure I graduate?",iwanttogetout435,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2srmou/try_for_an_internship_or_make_sure_i_graduate/,"My situation is pretty complicated, so please read through it all.

I'm trying to graduate in spring 2016 with a degree in Information Systems. I will have 6 classes left after this semester. Due to my struggles with depression and anxiety (I have been receiving treatment this entire time), I ended up only taking three classes per semester, and not working... and still usually only passed two of those.

The classes I keep failing are the math ones which, funnily enough, are not strictly related to my field (it's business math). Of my 6 classes remaining, 3 of those are math classes, 2 of which I have previously attempted at least once.

I could try to get an internship this summer, or I could try to finally knock out the math classes by taking them on their own and focusing solely on them. If I did get an internship this summer, I would have to take two of the previously-failed math classes together in the fall, and I'm afraid that will result in me failing them... again.

I really want to graduate so I can leave. I live in a very conservative area, with my conservative family, because they're putting me through college. I'll graduate without debt because of this. However... I've been forced to live in the closet all these years. My social/political/religious beliefs, I have kept secret, as well as my sexuality. I'm sure this is exacerbating my mental issues. I don't really have any friends in this area because I'm so terrified of my family finding out about my actual personality, and taking some sort of action.

For added pressure, I have a boyfriend currently living in the area I want to live in... but he's an international student. His visa will likely be running out around spring 2016. If I can leave, I could move in with him and marry him, and start working through the process to allow him to stay here with me that way. I love him dearly and he's been enormously supportive of my mental issues. He'll be trying for a work visa, of course, but even if he gets a sponsor, it's a lottery. I am so scared to lose him.

I do have other people in that area (other close friends, his family) so in many ways, I would be less alone there.

Also... in 2016 I will turn 26, and be booted off my father's insurance... which may pause or put an end to my treatment anyway.

I can't decide what to do. I know internships are important to get a job out of college... but god do I want to escape.

So I need some career advice. I currently am a software development intern. My internship is alright, but I'm thirsty for more. I feel like I've plateaued at my current internship. I've been applying to some bigger firms in my city, and also have been applying to places in California and New York. 

My question to you is that do you think it would be a smart idea to accept an offer in one of these remote locations for a summer internship? Currently I work year round at my current internship, so is it a good idea to go work for a different company for just the summer months?

What do you guys think I should do? Also when I apply for full time positions, will I look better seeing that I've been interning at several companies? I don't want to bury myself into a hole and be SOL for a job for when I finish school. I am currently a Junior.

How often do interns get hired for full time after they obtain their degree?

Since graduating I've taught myself C (and some C++) and I've been reading a lot about embedded systems and working with Arduino/ARM boards, and I'm really enjoying it. The local state school has a 5 year BS/MS program in computer engineering that I can do for practically nothing because I'm a resident. However, because I just finished a degree a year ago, my family wants me to get some work experience in whatever field I plan to go into before trying to get another degree, and I agree with them primarily based on the idea that I have no idea if this is a life career choice or just a hobby I really like doing. 

Is there anywhere I can work or intern where I can work with these boards, or even the concepts behind CE? I know I'm not going to get any kind of serious job but just something where I can get an idea of what I'd be doing. Is there anything I can study to get my head in the game before embarking on something like this?


Also, do you think CE is the right field for me, or should it be CS with a focus on embedded? For CS I could take a year of bridge courses and then do a (probably 3 year) MS, but I think the actual time spent depends on the program.  "

- I changed my major (Chemistry -&gt; Psych -&gt; Math) way too many times, so I can't major in CS without spending another year or 2 in school.

- My gpa is hovering around a 3.1.

- I have no work experience except a leadership position or two a couple of years back.

- Currently doing bioinformatics research my second to last semester and hopefully doing some full time bioinformatics research over the summer as well as taking a few computer science courses before my lease is up. 

- I have taken 2-3 computer science courses (As in all of them) and I have realized I really want to get into the tech field. 



What can I do in my last semester as a senior and the summer in order to secure a CS-related job such as software development or iOS/Android app development? 

I realize that I have messed up by not having a set career path, not doing internships, and changing my major several times.

I am very worried because I have student loans and I am pretty much on my own.

I'll try to keep this short. 25, M, I'm a freelance journalist who's been published in a few regionally-accredited outlets and a few national ones. Along the way to realizing that this was the career I wanted (a tenuous one, I know), I had a number of different jobs, primarily part-time and temporary, across the non-profit sector. Within that, I was doing a lot of different tasks, from managing social media pages to writing LOIs to helping plan events and a whole lot of other things. I also decided to go to graduate school in social work/social policy and am finishing my masters this year with a certificate in organizational management. In that program, I had one internship where I was doing case management and co-facilitated a group; now, I do community organizing work. 

I've done all of these jobs alright, some of them more poorly than others. I think of myself as primarily a good writer and journalist, although not the best. I worry sometimes that when I apply for jobs, I don't look like a very attractive candidate because I can do a lot of things reasonably well but I don't appear to have one specialty (even in journalism). I would like to be a full-time journalist, preferably an arts writer/editor, but the industry is collapsing and I'd like to keep my options open. 

A lot of life changes led me to very divergent and eclectic choices in my career, and I've been grateful for all of them. But, I worry that this means I'll have trouble finding work or that it's leading me to look unfocused or too generalist. Additionally, I don't know that I ever reached 100% potential in any of these jobs, and while I worked extremely hard, it has been difficult for me to find myself increasingly useful in a way that would impress hiring managers (although, by-and-large, I've worked mainly for organizations where there weren't resources to hire someone full-time). I'm not opposed to working in the for-profit sector, but I don't quite know how to open that door given my work experience as it stands.  

Is it a problem to want to accumulate experiences at the expense of specializing in something? Do recruiters and hiring managers (across industries) not like it when people have a really broad skillset? I don't want to end up a generalist at 30 and have to freelance just to clear rent, so any advice on where my path could lead would be great. Feel free to ask questions if you'd like clarity on anything.  "
2swbkm,1,2015-01-18,Thinking of going back to school. Should I?,psn22556,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2swbkm/thinking_of_going_back_to_school_should_i/,"So, here's what I'm working with. I'm 26 and graduated with a BA in Asian Studies last year. I have to confess, I really didn't have a proper game plan going into college. I was under the wrong impression that as long as I got a degree, I would be able to get a decent job.

Now a year later and I'm still working at a minimum wage retail job that I started working a few months before I graduated. I cannot illustrate enough my frustration at my life at this point.

I'm thinking about going back to school. I want to get a BS in Computer Science. Not only have I already tackled some of the requirements (I used to be a Computer Science major before I switched; don't ask why I made that decision, I was stupid), but it's a subject I'm very interested in. I want to get into a programming related job. It really doesn't matter if it's web development, mobile development, etc, I love designing things.

The only problem is that I don't really have a portfolio at this point. I've mostly done things that I found on /r/dailyprogrammer and I have a couple of bigger projects that I've put on the back burner (i.e. a text-based RPG, kind of like Wizardry or something like that). Plus, without a degree in this field and no internship experience (not to mention, no internship experience period), my resume wouldn't even make it past the initial screening process.

So, there are a few things I could do:

1) Try to apply to any job better than my current one that pays enough for me to move out of my parents' house and devote my time to building a portfolio. But I'm wondering if this would really be best, because I think it would still be hard to be noticed without that Computer Science BS and I may even end up taking a pay cut. Not to mention, I wouldn't know what job to take in the meantime while I get this sorted out.

2) Go back to school and put aside being an adult for another few years. Take out some loans through FAFSA so I can pay my tuition and live on my own. In the meantime, get some internship experience under my belt, get a better GPA, and work on projects on the side. In the mean time, I'm thinking of taking some basic courses (Calculus I, etc.) at a community college for this semester, but I have to act fast since registration closes on Tuesday. The disadvantage to doing this, though, would be that I would be putting being adult aside until I get my degree, plus putting myself further in debt.

What do you guys think? Is going back to school worth it, or are there better, faster alternatives?"

Struggling to even get an interview 1 year after graduation,CSApplicant_X5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2swhze/am_i_too_old_and_inexperienced_to_get_a_job/,"I'm getting past the point of desperation, haven't been able to find a job in the field since graduating last December (2013), and I'm beginning to question my abilities and worth.

I've certainly had a non-standard educational experience, and I'm beginning to think there's no way to explain it in a way that doesn't make me look undesirable as a hire. I started at Oklahoma State University studying CS, studied abroad in Japan for a semester in my junior year and decided that I really liked studying Japanese. The university didn't have a major and only had a few Japanese classes, so I looked at transferring. I had met some people from the University of Pittsburgh while I was in Japan, and looked in to their Japanese and CS programs, and liked what I found. When talking to admissions, I was told that most all of my classes would transfer, with the exception of one or two, and so I thought it would be pretty easy to finish my CS major and work towards a Japanese degree as well. Upon actually transferring, I was informed that half of a major's courses must be taken at Pitt, despite having classes that would have transferred just fine (I ended up with something like 24 credits of ""unspecified computer science courses"" that didn't count for anything). Long story short, it took me longer to finish my almost-finished CS degree than it did to complete my barely-started Japanese degree.

In the middle of my studies at Pitt I had a major depression episode and was in the hospital for several months. I didn't return to Pitt for a couple of years, and had minimum-wage jobs in the interim to pay bills and such. When I re-enrolled, I actually saved a ton of money by qualifying for in-state tuition, so I feel like that all kind of worked out.

I finally graduated with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in East Asian Languages and Literatures in Dec 2013, but the job hunt hasn't been going well. I had 1 internship while I was at OSU, and 1 while I was at Pitt, neither of which ended up with future offers, and it's been quite a few years since those internships because of the time I wasn't going to school. As a transfer student I was often ""left behind"" on typical hiring-track activities offered by university (for some reason I didn't get added to the CS mailing list where job offers and fairs were advertised, and I didn't even know there was a mailing list until my last semester, for instance), so I feel like I missed out on a lot of opportunities that could have been present.

Now I find myself applying for essentially any and every job that has even the slightest resemblance of skills I think I possess, but I have yet to make it past an HR interview. The most common thing I hear is that they're looking for a candidate with more experience. I've always been sort of a generalist: I like to program in C++, work up a website quickly in PHP, make an Arduino project to animate a wall of 1500 LEDs, play with Processing to visualize realtime sound data, work on video game ideas in C# with Unity, etc., but I don't know how to get any of this across without feeling like I'm claiming to be an expert in areas I'm not. I don't know what it means when an entry-level job listing asks for ""# of years experience in X"".

I think my age (32), combined with a lack of experience in my supposed field is really hindering me, and I don't know what to do about it. I feel like if I could just get an interview with an actual programmer or developer I'd do fine, but I don't know how to present myself and my past to actually get to that point."

I'm currently a computer science major, in my third year. I currently have a GPA if 2.76, and I don't see that raising above 3.0 as I'm applying for internships and eventually jobs.

I've been leaving it out on my resume, but should I list it regardless?

Also, a lot of internships in their 'requirements' have 'must have a GPA of 3.0 or higher,' considering this requirement and my current GPA, should I even apply to those?

2swope,3,2015-01-19,Should I cancel/how?,softdevthrowaway2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2swope/should_i_cancelhow/,"Right now I have an on-site interview scheduled with a big 4 company around the end of this month.
I have already decided that I will enter a PhD program this fall (I have an offer deferred from last year when I decided I was interested in trying a software job, but remained unemployed, and more applications sent this year). It seems that most likely I will start halfway through August, and will probably need a few weeks or so beforehand to make arrangements for the move, to move, etc.

At this point, I'm wondering whether (or how) I should cancel this interview - it's possible that in the future I might want to intern or work at this company, in the research or software divisions. Even in the best case, I'll be working for around 6 months, and wouldn't want to piss them off if I quit too early.

On the one hand, I wonder if I'm just rationalizing my desire to avoid the stress and anxiety of another interview, but on the other hand, I've been unemployed for a year and a half now, and it would probably be nice to earn some money.

Would it be ""wrong"" or burn bridges to go into this interview or job, knowing that I will be quitting in &lt;=6 months?"

All this aside, this year I've started trying to participate on bigger projects, open source things mostly like *Code For America* and some other local groups and well...

* I feel extremely weak in the design pattern area.
* I get overwhelmed by the many directories and files and understanding how everything is connected.(when looking at existing projects on github)
* I get confused about which directories to save libraries and packages, dependencies, paths, and setting up environments in general .(on my system)
* I feel like everything was dumbed down in school by using eclipse and visual studio to click buttons that do everything in the background for you...this is not the type of software engineer I want to be, I want to fully get what I'm doing.
* I don't understand the structure of things and because of this feel like I can't contribute to a team or work to my full potential, I want to improve but I'm not really sure where to look, I don't know where to start.

I have a few internship interviews coming up for the summer and I don't want to tell them I can work in a team towards a bigger project while feeling like I really can't do any of that."

I've been developing software now for about 3 1/2 almost 4 years.  I worked in Java for 1.5 years and c# for a little over 2 (27 months) years now.

Before my current job I was working as a junior developer in c# doing big data work for a startup.  We had a software architech, a lead c# developer and myself i was working 70-90 hours a week learning everything i could from them.  The company came to me and said i wasn't doing enough for them so I decided enough was enough I was not making market rate for my employment, I couldn't get a title or a promotion to support the work load/role i was playing at the time. So i found other employment.

So i found a consulting company that would give me a title based off of work history and promises of market in 6 months. I started as a senior developer worked my but off an after 2 1/2 months got a title promotion to lead developer as the previous developer really screwed up the project and got canned. however this title comes with no pay increase just more responsibility.  We have sense lost the project due to the previous lead and i still remain a lead developer for an internal project at the company (3 developers, 2 testers, an intern and a business analyst all reporting to me).

Questions:

Now this is where my questions come in, I've kinda just been left to flounder on my own as a ""lead"" and have no training in it what so ever. looking at my recent day to day activities and what I'm doing, I've got basically 0 time to develop any code on the project without spending extraordinary amounts over over time on the project. I spend the majority of the day either in meetings with management talking about the progress and working on time tracking and utilization of employees. or helping everyone on the team answering questions and helping developers get back on track.

Is that normal?

secondly I know I'm grossly underpaid to market rates but only having 4 years of experience before becoming a lead developer how long should I sit here before moving on?

TL;DR - Became a Lead developer without a pay raise (Already well under market) by another employee's incompetence and I have no idea what I'm doing.."

From what I've heard this is rather low even for an entry level programmer. I say small company because there are only 10 developers, but most of our company is located in another state. Started off as an intern here, but got hired last May full time with benefits.

I've got a Computer Science Degree and I've been out of school for a year and a half. This is pretty much my only real job experience as I was a full time student and never had a ""real"" job in highschool aside from helping my brother mow lawns and help my grandfather with renovating houses.

Since I never really had a job until after graduation, I of course have student loans I'm paying off. If that weren't enough, I recently had to have some dental work done and found out my coverage won't become effective on what I had done for another 5 months. So there's another 3 or so grand I'm going to be paying off. I recently had to change my student loan payment plan over to the income based payments, still awaiting approval, so here's to paying off my student loans over the next 30 years...

As for the main reason I'm here, I don't know what I should be doing. 30k a year for programming is pretty low judging by how much some friends of mine have made from their jobs, but I also am losing interest in programming due to this job. I don't even care to look at programming things outside of work at all and it's starting to appear in my day to day at work with me taking slightly longer to do any actual work. I don't know what else I would do for a living though as I can't even think of something I want to do every day for work that wouldn't become boring to me within a year or less. Am I already getting burnt out of the profession I paid so much money to get a degree for?

Hi, so…. I just think I need a little advice! I know there are worse relationship and people having some hard time, but 
I'm trying to solve this by my own and I can't, I need advice.

I’m in a long distance relationship for 7 months. We live 6 hours apart and see each other every month, sometimes even more. In the beginning it was heaven, he was funny, caring and romantic, we did (and still do) talk everyday on Skype in every possible minute. As we dive into the relationship he became more quiet, stressed and a bit possessive. I used to think that was because he has lost his mother 4 years ago (I didn’t had a chance to met her) and it still hurts him.

But then, he start acting at way I don’t feel comfortable, for an example, he complains if I tweet something or even if I read my facebook (he thinks I should be talking to him instead, but I do talk to him every time! After I come home from my internship, I talk to him to the moment I fall asleep!), and thats okay if we are on Skype facebook is quite annoying, but if we are not on Skype and I’m available at facebook messenger, he gets mad! Or even If I’m talking to him on whatsapp and during the conversation my phone “sleeps” and I don’t appear online, he starts to argue!
Okay, I try to understand and change my habits but then, he complains if I watch a movie by myself! Or even, if I play some videogame! I had to wait for his good will to watch twin peaks because he got mad cos I started by myself! And he makes me play Grim Fandango with him, I was really into it, he doesn’t even likes it, but he made me feel guilty saying that I was paying more attention to the game! Once, he even complained that I was taking to long to answer and I was watching a class in college and he knew!!

So, I’m quiet person. I don’t have many friends, I don’t go to parties, and I’m not the kind of person who drinks until gets drunk. But if I talk about having some beer with my few geeky (and all gay) friends, he starts getting suspicious, but he can come home drunk at almost midnight? He can just decide he wants to go the movies alone and not tell me anything? But I got to be telling him where I’m all of the time, why?

And, don’t get me wrong. I always try to help him. I always talk about his feelings, encourage him to make his life better, to get him to do what he wants, to find a good job and improve his career (non existent until this point, he has a low self esteem and I’m trying to work on that). I’m not jealous, he has a lot of a female friends and I even like them! I’m totally okay with him going out with his friends, or by himself, if he feels like, and everything else because I respect his individuality! Because I TRUST HIM! 

And I just wish he could do the same, but he doesn’t understand! He says I don’t like him and that I only care about myself (because he thinks I care way too much about my career) but I do everything I can for him! But all the time, I feel like he’s trying to own me and make me responsible for his happiness and I’m not! There are times that we could be, you know, having fun and being happy but he’s complaining about my twitter or that I did these, I did that, having fights that will lead nowhere!
On the other hand, I feel like I should not fight because of these things, I think he has depression and I’m afraid to drag him deeper, you know? I feel like the worst girlfriend, I just wanted to help him! 
What Can I do?

* How was your experience?

* What kinds of problems/challenges do you get?

* How much experience does one need? I really only have experience in Java from a couple quarters of University.

2t0r4k,7,2015-01-20,The Meaning Of Christmas,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2t0r4k/the_meaning_of_christmas/,"At this moment, it is 11:22 PM, January 19th – ten days after Christmas.

My bags are packed. My ticket is booked. Tomorrow, I’ll be leaving for Ohio to live with my old friends from college. My family doesn't know why. If they ask, I’m going to have to make something up. I thought about saying that I had an internship. Now that just feels dishonest. 

I just want my family to understand how I’m feeling; to understand how much this is taking its toll.

I’m going to say I’m leaving to get treatment for depression. 

At least there’s an excuse.

On Christmas Eve this year, my Grandma died.

She fell down a flight of stairs. She cracked her head. I wish it ended there.
Before I continue, I have to tell you about two people: my Grandma Fern, and my cousin Connor.

For three years prior to Christmas, Fern had been suffering from dementia and Alzheimer’s. She was always spacy, but after my grandfather passed away, she started to deteriorate a lot quicker. She became a recluse. She locked herself in her house. She would miss family gatherings. She wouldn’t go out at all, even to restaurants for Mother’s Day breakfast. After a while, she even stopped sending the grandkids birthday cards.

This really put a strain on my parents. My mother, her daughter, kept trying to get her to move in with us. My father was against it. My two aunts wanted to put her in a nursing home but my mother wasn’t having it. Eventually, family get-togethers turned into a hassle. At Thanksgiving, they fought about Fern. At birthdays, they fought about Fern. There wasn't a waking moment where they didn't.

Being me, I stayed out of the way. She was my grandmother.They were their children. It’s not that I didn’t feel bad but it wasn’t really my responsibility.

I felt the worst for my cousins. Whenever their parents fought, they’d always be caught in the middle. They’d sit there in the next room, playing video games or dolls or whatever, but nobody would really be paying attention.

The worst of it was my cousin Connor.

Whenever the adults fought about Fern, he’d break down into tears. His logic was always really heart-breaking: “It’s Easter. They shouldn’t be fighting. It’s Thanksgiving. They shouldn’t be fighting.”

On my Dad’s birthday, my mother stormed out of the house. Her sisters were pushing the retirement home issue again and she wasn’t having it. 

While everyone else was fighting in the kitchen, I found Connor in the living room, crying, as usual. It was hard to make him out since he was crying so hard, but I tried to reason with him.

""Connor...if you don't talk to me, I can't help.""

""Christmas is soon. I just want one Christmas. One Christmas where they won't fight...""

I'd never been a great counselor. I'm going to school for engineering and people had never been my strong suit - but this was my cousin.

""Connor, look. The meaning of Christmas is to be together...and if you want to be happy, you have to make all the bad stuff go away. They might fight sometimes, but if just remember how much everyone loves you, then it's going to be a great Christmas.""

Connor sniffled, nodding. He didn't say anything. Somehow, my mind drifted back to how Grandma Fern had stopped sending him birthday cards. 

""And don't worry about Grandma,"" I added. ""She might not be here...but she's old. She still loves you.""

""No, she doesn't,"" Connor snapped back at me. ""She doesn't love anyone.""

I was shocked. I didn't know what to say. Just then, his mother walked into the room, and since mothers take priority over cousins. I left.

I didn't see Connor until next Christmas - this Christmas.

We all came to my house for the holidays. To my surprise, my Mom got Grandma Fern to make an appearance. She wasn't speaking to anyone, and she didn't look happy, but she was there.

Before the rest of my family showed up, I begged my Mom, ""Mom, please, don't fight about Grandma today...let's just enjoy ourselves...""

""Don't worry, honey,"" Mom told me. ""It's Christmas.""

To my surprise, she was right. We made it through dinner. We made it through dessert. We even made it through presents without anything happening. 

The whole time, Grandma Fern sat there on the side, sometimes smiling, sometimes talking - but if you tried to talk back, her memory didn't really stretch past three minutes ago. There wasn't much to say. 

Still, it was Christmas -- and for once, it seemed like we were actually going to finish  without an outburst.

Right after presents, the adults started drinking. I guess I'm an adult. It just feels weird to put myself on the same level as my parents. 

Halfway through, Grandma Fern got up to use the bathroom. 

My Mom volunteered to guide her, but Grandma was pretty insistent about going herself. Since everyone was in pretty good spirits, nobody argued.

Five minutes later, there was a crash from the other room.

It's hard to remember what happened next. People rushed to her side, trying to rouse her. My Mom cried, hugging my Dad in the corner of the living room.
The next thing we knew, my whole family was gathered in the hospital's waiting area. My cousins were a mess at first. My Aunts and Mom were even worse. 

Then after awhile, we started talking about Grandma before her mind had gotten warped - how she'd taken us to the park; how she'd always argued with waiters when we went out for breakfast on Mother's Day. It wasn't Christmas but it didn't need to be. Somehow, we forced ourselves to be grateful. We talked about how my graduation was coming up. We talked about how everyone would be there.

Once we were all leaving, Connor hugged me around the neck. 

""You were right, Julie..."" Connor said into my ear. ""You were right all along.""

""I'm sorry, Connor,"" I said. I hadn't heard him really. I just squeezed him back as hard as I could. ""I love you. I'll see you on your birthday, okay?""

""It's okay,"" Connor said. He looked me, teary, smiling. ""Nobody's fighting now. This was the greatest Christmas ever...""

And that's when I realized that Connor hadn't been with us in the living room when Grandma fell.

He'd been upstairs.

I also started a working-but-currently-unfinished ""remake"" of Galaga with some help from tutorials.)

However, I'm currently stuck in a bit of a mental rut. While I hope doing these little side-projects will help me *eventually*, I have a nagging feeling I'm wasting my time and I can't exactly explain why.

For those with careers or recent internships are there particular languages or projects you would recommend concentrating on? (Or potential pitfalls to avoid?) My (eventual) goal is a internship in about a year or so and/or a potential career position when I graduate in about three years."

A little background information about me first. I'm 27 years old living and working in Vietnam as a high school math/science tutor. I am also student teaching in a programming/robotics course in a high school. I figuring out that teaching is not something I am interested in for my career. I've had the opportunity to talk to the sysadmin/networking guys at the school I'm student teaching at, they've giving me a tour of the network and I've found it very interesting. Since then I've decided to start studying for the CCNA, but I realize that before I can get a job, experience is crucial.


I'd like to propose some kind of internship with the school I'm at and I'm seeking some advice on how I can approach the sys admin in regards to an internship. People who have done internships before, what are some of the tasks and experience you were able to get? Are there any current sys admins who have taken on an intern before? What have you let them do?


I am moving to the DC area this summer and would like to have a job lined up before I get there in August. Security+ is another cert I'm looking to pick up after the CCNA.


Any information is greatly appreciated."

I went to a hackathon this weekend. first time, freshman cs, never coded before college. Worked with a couple of other random guys I met but I ended up doing most/all of the work (they went to tour the city, have fun, etc). We ended up getting a prize, and the representatives of the sponsor prize went up to us and asked if we'd be interested in summer internships. he went on to describe in full detail the details of the internship, how excited he was, and how we could possibly continue the project at the company; he said we were guaranteed interviews.

- Do internships based off of hackathons (experiences like mine) usually go well? If I haven't taken data structures should I tell them that and hope they go easy, or just start studying now? should I expect the rep to pull for me?

Thanks a bunch guys. Appreciate it!"

A bit of my background:     
- About to graduate with a CS major in a few months    
- Been offered junior sofware engineer positions back home and here in the Canada.   
- Both offers are from startups    

Canada: (A product company)
Pros    
 - 2.5x more pay than the position back home with progressive company share   
 - Small team, major role in development    
 - International experience   
 - Pave ways for my permanent visa if I were to stay.    
Cons   
 - Have not worked with the team before   
 - I fear that my learning curve will not be as steep   

Home:  (An agency/consulting company)
Pros:      
 - Worked with the team as an intern     
 - Small team, major development role     
 - The founder (also lead developer) is very patient and very willing to teach, I believe I can learn a lot from him    
 - Will be working to revamp a website with 10million active users   
   
Cons:    
 - Low pay    
 - No international experience     
 - Unsure about future opportunities after the aforementioned website revamp     
 - I don't foresee myself working in the country for long (not a lot of software companies here, tech scene is very small)

Of all the places I could ask this, I hoped this would be the best!

I am looking for career advice, I have worked in the IT field since I was 18 years old, I am now in my early 30s! I got into the field as an intern my freshman year of college.  I had a knack for the security side of IT so slowly but surely I was put in charge of our old PIX firewall and general security of our servers and desktops.

While doing this as an Intern I continued to go to college for a computer science degree which emphasized programming quite heavily.  Several years into college I was offered a full time position as the network administrator for a company that sizes in at around 1000 user accounts globally, centrally managed by myself solely here in the states.

So for the past 15 odd years I have designed our datacenter through all the ongoing changes that technology faces.  In the beginning we had server sprawl,  then vmware consolidated everything,  and now of course we have the cloud.  I would consider myself somewhat a jack of all trades,  certainly not specialized in any one area.  I am quite versed in Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012, Citrix for application deployment, VMware for server virtualzation.  I use EMC and Netapp for SAN data storage.  Our ERP system runs on MSSQL, I built all of our locations phone systems with Asterisks and of course I do have my CCNP, so I do feel pretty comfortable when I need to work on Cisco equipment.

So that is me in a nutshell, so now onto the question.  I feel as I get older that it is more and more difficult for me to stay up on all the technologies that keep me employed.  I am starting to think even though I might be a bit late to the game that I should possibly specialize in a specific area of IT.

Google intern interviews are supposed to be easier (supposedly) than amazon and Microsoft intern interviews.

I literally did every binary tree problem in existence, i studied hash tables, linked lists, graphs, traversal algorithms, and all of that other shit, and NONE of it even showed up in the interview. They didn't ask any sort of word problems that would test my knowledge on data structures, all of my preparation was LITERALLY USELESS. I feel extremely hopeless right now and I feel like I have everything working against me. What if I end up graduating and i never pass any of my interviews and I end up being a homeless fucking bum and I just live alone (cause no woman in their right mind would date a jobless dude) till I die or I commit suicide?

My resume looks really great and I've got alot to offer. My biggest set back is GPA. At 2.7, most corporate finance gigs that I'm aiming for arn't even batting an eye. I've applied to 50+ jobs ( not all are corporate finance, alot are small analyst / excel based jobs) and have had 10 or so interviews in the past 6 months for a full time position. I've gotten to the 2nd round of interviews with a couple company's. 

I like to believe that I have great interview skills and match HR's criteria for the most part, but when GPA is brought up, they probably feel like the only choice is to next me.

I'm not losing hope, and will continue to job search and try and better myself. I believe that my last options are to lower my standards and just accept that I won't get my first choice out of college. I've applied mostly through my college's career center with employers who are looking to hire out of my college specifically.




QUESTIONS: What advice ( or job recommendations) do you guys have for me? I've tried indeed, but I just think it's hard to score an entry level job, especially since most employers on there get 1000's of applications with no face or personality to match.

If you think I would benefit more from posting this somewhere else, just let me know. I honestly will appreciate any advice / insight dearly. If you have any more questions that I could answer just let me know. Thanks!

2t51xy,5,2015-01-21,"College freshman software developer intern, is it okay for me to ask a promotion in my circumstances?",kambabamba,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2t51xy/college_freshman_software_developer_intern_is_it/,"So I've been working for a small (~130 employees) rapidly growing tech company based in San Francisco since June of 2014. The summer right after I graduated high school I got an interview through a connection in the company and got hired as a full-time software developer intern for 17$/hour which I was pretty happy with as this was my first “real” job.

The company CEO also happens to be an extremely hands on CTO who I got the privilege of working with and knowing personally. Fast forward six weeks, I brought up the question to the CEO if there was a possibility of me being able to work remotely when I went to college in the Fall. To my surprise not only did he say yes, but he raised me to 30$ /hour for my remaining 4 weeks of summer.

I obviously accepted the offer and now remotely work part time for them from school. 

Now, I know that I have definitely become an even better and more efficient programmer since my raise to 30$/hour 6 months ago. My mom who is a QA engineer suggested me to pop the question of a potential raise before I start working for them full-time in the summer again. My mom even hinted something about 40$/hour.

Here are the reasons I’m for/against enquiring about a raise.

Against

- I feel that even 30$/hour is very respectable for someone my age (I’m still 18)

For

- I have lots of experience programming outside of my job. An example is I a game development business I run on the side which my boss (The CEO) knows about.

- I feel a lot of respect from the company:
	- I am trusted to work independently on features/projects until final code review amongst 		developers.
	- Higher ranking developers sometimes ask me for input on something they are working on. Really 	nice to know that senior employees find me beneficial.

- Not sure this matters but I’ll throw it out: I’m an Electrical Eng. major.

What do you guys think? Is it okay for me to ask for a raise up from 30$/hour knowing very well I’ve become a better developer since that time?

2t5j5k,4,2015-01-21,TIFU by peeing my pants in front of my crush,happyfaqeer,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2t5j5k/tifu_by_peeing_my_pants_in_front_of_my_crush/,"Hi reddit, this is my first ever post on here. Also English is my 2nd language so please be nice. 

This happened quite a few years ago now. I met this really cute and smart girl off this Desi social network (which got killed off by Facebook). She had been accepted to the architecture program at Waterloo University and was traveling the world doing internships. I am on the other hand quite shy and awkward and antisocial and just painfully average in every respect. So I was happy she found me interesting enough and just generally enjoyed basking in the afterglow of her charming personality. I never expected our relationship to get anywhere beyond the friendzone. I think she knew I had a crush on her though. 

We used to go walk downtown and hung out at libraries every so often. It was never anything more than that. So I was pleasantly surprised when she asked if I wanted to go to New York with her. I pinched myself and agreed immediately. The plan was to drive my car down there ( I live in Toronto), do the tourist thing for the weekend and come back. I knew a family friend in Brooklyn and she had a friend in Queens. I was excited. 

The day I pick her up for the road trip, she decides to tell me that one of her male friends is coming with us too.I was really bummed but didn't want to miss the road trip with her and said fine. He turns out to be some good looking guy that she had wanted to bone and they were all over each other. All my excitement drained out like  spent fireworks but I figured oh well at least I'll get to see  New York. 

It was a long 10 hour drive. They were making out in the back while I was being a dutiful driver. I was upset, horny, hungry and smelled bad cuz I forgot my deodorant at home. To top it off, pretty much as soon as we crossed the Lincoln bridge into New York, I had to go pee really really bad. I had been holding it in for a while thinking I could make it to Brooklyn but the pressure was just getting too much now. What was probably a trickle had by now become a torrent for sure. 

Now if you have never driven in Manhattan, it can be chaotic at the best of times and we arrived just before rush hour. Bumper to bumper traffic and I am desperately trying to find a place to pull over so I can take a leak. Well I failed. I couldn't hold it in and peed all over myself, the driver seat, the steering wheel , the gauge panel, I mean Everywhere. 

To their credit, my crush and her friend kept their cool and didn't laugh at me or freak out. I died a little bit that day though. The rest of the car ride that day was spent in silence. I suffered through a wet smelly drive to Queens first and then to Brooklyn. All while never having been in New York before. I think my heart aged a few years with all the stress and shame. My family friend was kind and gracious and acted like he didn't even notice my wet sticky pants and the smell. Oh god the smell. I spent that night cleaning the cab of my car and wallowing in self pity.

Saturday was fun. I took the subway over to Times square. Went to the wax museum, took the guided tour around south Manhattan on one of those double decker buses, ate pizza while sitting on the Brooklyn bridge and then headed back to my friends house where he had made me an epic meal. We went down to the coney island beach and walked around the boardwalk. Later we played some late note cricket under flood lights in an empty parking lot on a hot summer night. It was a good time. I forgot all about the day before. 

Sunday was ... Well ...depressing. I picked up my crush and her friend, loaded up and headed back home. They pretty much ignored me the whole time with a few snide comments here and there. We never saw each other after that. 

Looking back, I still shudder about the whole thing but oh well, its the past, it can't hurt me now.

[Germany],pyotre_man,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2t602h/getting_a_java_enterprise_job_with_bachelors/,"Hello. I would like to know how hard it is to get a job in a Java Enterprise. From what I hear they have a pretty good being-hard/paying-well ratio. But at companies I have been interviewed or had internships at all the business work seems to have been done by seniors with Master's or even PhD's, while younger guys dealt with other stuff.

I am asking because I need to decide whether I should even learn anything in JavaEE or all those positions already given to more experienced people. Currently I have the chance to design the backend of an online-shop as a 1-month-full-time college project and document it describing the characteristics of all those frameworks etc, but that surely won't be sufficient enough to get an actual, paid job?!"
2t695e,5,2015-01-21,How much of a contribution do you have to make to open-source projects in order to put them down on your resume?,Turin_Giants,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2t695e/how_much_of_a_contribution_do_you_have_to_make_to/,"So my story: I am trying to switch careers from working for the transportation department of my county gov to something in IT, mainly IT security-like pen testing, etc. Now I know that isn't really a computer science area but I know A LOT of coding goes into security and knowing how to code is very important in order to be successful in this industry so that's why I am writing this entry in this sub. 

That being said, I need experience in order to build up my resume. I have been building connections, going to group meetings, joining clubs, etc. I am just trying to get my name out there as much as possible. The area that I am lacking is, obviously, hands on experience in the area. I have looked every where and it seems that an internship is out of the question because I have a fulltime job currently. So that leaves doing stuff in my free time and I have heard that working or contributing to open source projects is good start for beginners in getting their foot in the door and getting a feel of what goes into IT projects. 

With that being said, how much does one need to contribute to the a open source project so that it can go on a resume? Does contributing a couple lines of code, fixing some errors in the present code, or adding a patch count? Do you need to do some significant work on them in order to put down that you have actually worked on a project? Obviously if you got a job because of your work on an project like that they have on the internet you would have to show you know what you are talking about but how would your employers know if you were telling the truth right off the bat?

For example,  I can't say I helped build the Google website when I only went in, saw the coding for the website, and replaced a comma with a parentheses, thus making the website a tiny bit more efficient. That was a really bad example, but hopefully you get what I am getting at.

Thanks all!"
2t6o8b,23,2015-01-21,TIFU by getting cute with my new boss,mcfuddlebutt,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2t6o8b/tifu_by_getting_cute_with_my_new_boss/,"I'm an I.T. manager for a fairly large company. Last July our Executive Director retired after 25 years with the company. While I've been involved with the company for 8 years, I'm actually one of the newest people working here. We have a pretty good office where we have a bit of fun, but also get our work done (we've been the number 1 office for several years)


Last week our Regional VP hired a new Executive Director. I could tell the new person was going to want more of a heavy hand in our day to day business because our VP has always given us shit about how we work (a typical stick up the ass VP) so you knew she was going to hire someone more like her.


Anywho, I decided before the new boss came in that I was going to talk with an Australian accent and everyone was going to go along with it. Things went great for the first week. She asked where I was born and I replied with a straight face ""Oh I was born and raised in Texas"". She gave me a weird look like she was asking herself ""Then why the fuck do you sound like Steve Irwin?"" 


So as the week went on, I started worrying that the joke wasn't going to land as I had planned. She just isn't the kind of person who laughs at work....Or ever..... Her computer was finally delivered and I had to set it up. Part of setting it up was calling into our National I.T. and get her log in set up. When the tech picked up I froze, he knows my regular voice. Do I keep it going? My hesitation made the accent that came out of my mouth sound something like Channing Tatum's ""My name's Jeff"" in 22 Jump Street. I decided to abandon the accent and get her set up.

After I got off the phone she looks at me stone faced and says "" I thought you were from Australia""

""I told you I was born and raised in Texas"" I replied with a smile on my face

""Do you think it's funny to deceive me like that?"" 

**Now this is when I start getting pissed off, and when I get pissed off I turn into a smart ass. I mean, I'm not an intern scraping his way through school. I'm a third level manager for not 1 but 2 of the largest cities in the company, I don't have any subordinates, and my reviews have been nothing but stellar. Besides that, I've been nothing but nice to this lady since she got here. Here's where it kind of goes downhill.**


""No ma'am, I didn't think it was funny. Everyone thought it was funny.""


""So everyone was in on this?"" she asked


""Well, I don't think anyone expects a co-worker to just start talking like he comes from the land down under ma'am.""


""Is this how you represent the company to our customers?"" 


""I dont talk to customers ma'am, I only talk to computers, and they don't care what accent I use."" 


""I think it's time for you to get back to work."" 


I smiled at her and said ""G'Day"", then left. 


Even with this first impression, I'm really not worried about her. I've always been one of those people that folks warm up to eventually. I'm sure she'll realize sooner or later that I'm an important part of this team and I get my work done with the level of professionalism that she expects. I just thought I'd share.

2t7xpk,2,2015-01-21,Should I complete my Masters degree in Data Analytics? Are degrees overrated these days?,zetsui,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2t7xpk/should_i_complete_my_masters_degree_in_data/," Most of the pertinent classes for my Masters I will take this Semester. Something I think about is how few internship (entry) opportunities their are for non-MS/PhD students. And that is one advantage of a formal program. Another is that few HR people rarely look past the minimum requirements that cite an MS/PhD in modern data analytics.

One point I always think about is, speaking to dozens of actual software engineers, analytics personnel, is how so few of them care about WHERE you went, WHAT you studied (on the level of a degree), as much as what you can OFFER. Many are more interested in your work, and the libraries you worked with, the langauge you use, the interests and value you can bring to a company, previous work, demonstrated interest in the industry.

So I have been thinking of the option of NOT continuing my Masters, especially since it doesn't offer full time courses and it is full time. I personally like it, but have a poor living situation (abusive religious parents who do not allow me to socialize). I also notice many startups are touted by engineers as a great place to learn, and contribute. 

Realstically, should I go for a job after the end of the semster and maybe attend university less often/transfer my graduate program (2 classes instead of 4)? The program is also not on for Summer, which is again just wasted time. I will have 1.5 more years to finish my Masters.

Why don't most students get an internship at a large company, go for fulltime employment with it on their resume, leaving their less needed skills/years behind? How about, once you have the skills you need to try an network an opportunity in an industry you like, and take the general skills you have learned and hone them to that industry/specialization?

Am I wrong in thinking so many degrees, technical and CS are overrated and a waste of time and money today?

As far back as I can remember, I have hated school, done the least to get the most, and prefer to learn and spend my time on bettering my skills once I've done the initial investment of choosing my industry and researching my career. The thing I liked about this NYC local program is how practical it is, and how practical the datasets we've worked on have been, but I wonder if EVERY single class I will take, especially past this semster will be useful to me, especially if I want to work at a well funded start up/gas exploration data modeling.

Long pots, but lots of thoughts? I come from a liberal arts background and have been unemployed for about a year, but have always been doing some form of CS/programming/modeling all my life and enjoy it."

I feel like I am ""okay"", but not yet proficient in the way that I'd expect for professionals. I'm currently in NYC, but open to look anywhere that there might be opportunity. 

In terms of skills, languages I've studied are Python, Java, PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

I just finished my last credits for a B.S. in Information Systems, but I have not yet formally graduated. I have no relevant professional experience in anything tech yet, but I have been working on independent programming projects in an attempt to show potential employers where I am with my skill set. I've also taken the usual IS coursework like Database Systems, Systems Analysis and Design, and I've done Software Testing training in addition to the courses. 

Is there any recommendation that someone can give for finding relevant work experience so that I can earn an income while I hone in on my skill set more? I have been looking into several cities with a tech scene. If anyone has advice on long-distance job interviewing, that would also be helpful.

I've been looking into internships, coding schools, and just continuing to teach myself, but ideally, I'd like to be making an income in something relevant while doing that.

If my lack of experience hinders landing an outright web dev position, are there any related job titles I can shoot for at this point if my goal is to just make a livable income while building my skill set? Are there certain things in particular that you'd recommend, like niche skills to look into?

Sorry if something like this has been asked before. I have been reading the FAQ, and it has been really helpful so far. 

Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: How can I gain somewhat relevant (hopefully paid) experience even if I am still developing my core skills?

I've worked here for 5 years now (went there straight from graduating school).  Recently, I've had the chance to do some work on the side for a friend of mine that's building a startup and I enjoyed it.  My current salary package including benefits is $73,000 (canadian $) plus 5 weeks of vacation/flextime which is pretty good in my opinion. My friend has offered me a full time with his startup that currently only consists of him and one other person for $110,000 yearly + performance bonus (potentially between $10,000-$50,000/year), more vacation time than I currently get, and presumably more flexibility as well.  However, I'd have to pay for my own additional health insurance benefit (dental/physio) and life insurance (extra $1000-$2000/year).  The gov't does provide free health care here which is nice.

I felt more enjoyment out of the small work I did for him more than I do at my current job, but I don't know how I will cope with the culture shift.  I have friends at my current job and my boss is a good friend too.  The social change seems big to me (going from working in a routine and having friends at work to something much smaller scale).

On the other hand, at my current position, I don't really see a future to be honest (that is, I don't want my boss' job and the tech/product we make is something I don't want to do forever) and they don't really give out raises (I got a 1.5% raise last year, and this year I suspect I won't get any raise at all).  The company is nice for the most part, flexible and has given me time off when I wanted it for example.  The culture where I currently work is pretty nice (have a few friends), though a lot of younger people that have gone through here usually leave or don't come back after being an intern.  I want to experience another company as well with more young people and I've been contacted by recruiters before, but staying here for the last 5 years has also taken a toll on my skills (specialized in maintenance of older systems).  I feel I may not currently have the necessary skills to stand out in an interview.  I do however have interest in exploring what else is out there since I've only worked here, but I guess the fear of the unknown has stopped me from looking too hard what else is outside this company, especially when it's been secure and provided me enough for now.


I'm looking for some career advice of what I should do, perhaps someone else has been in this position before.  My friends and family have advised me to take a risk while I'm still young and don't have a family, so I am inclined to take the career risk while I still can.  My current debt is my apartment where I live and a few monthly bills such as property tax, condo fee, car insurance, internet bill, phone bill.  I have about a year's worth of savings saved up in case I need emergency funds and worst case scenario, I rent out my apartment and move back in with my parents (they live in the same city).

Also, forgot to mention I am 26 years old, and live on my own.

I'm a second year CS student and recently I've been looking around for internships, mainly for the obvious reason of gaining experience and partially because I'm really unhappy with my living situation. While moving out would be achievable working in more accessible industries (retail or hospitality), it would take a significant amount of time out of my week, time that could spent coding/studying.

As such, I've found myself in a bit of a rush to get some form of employment in the IT/CS industry while studying, although it seems like a part-time or casual position in the industry is very rare.

However, I've noticed a lot of ads in my uni advertising full time Junior Developer positions at local startups. I know that it's relatively unheard of to land a job like this with little-to-no experience, but I was wondering if (on the very off chance) I manage to get hired at a startup, would it be a good idea to postpone my study and take the position?

Thanks!

2tanhj,17,2015-01-22,How do I make a cover letter sound less BS-y?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tanhj/how_do_i_make_a_cover_letter_sound_less_bsy/,"Hi everyone,

I know there's a weekly resume/interview thread, and internship advice thread, but I've posted the before and usually my posts never get any visibility so I thought I'd make a top level submission.

What's the general consensus on cover letters for internships? I heard they should be short and to the point. Do you guys agree with that?

 What kinds of points should I make in a strong cover letter? What kinds of points and statements set off BS detectors?

Here is my cover letter for an internship for a company I *really* want to work for. I like this company because I'm genuinely excited by the things they make and honestly want to be involved with the things they do. WHen I try to put that into the cover letter though, it ends up sounding like the run-of-the-mill ass kissing a lot of people do in cover letters. How do I make it sound more genuine? Also, do I come off as arrogant in the cover letter?

&gt;Hello!

&gt;My name is &lt;John Doe&gt; and I’m a computer science student and enthusiast at &lt;Hogwarts&gt;. Although I am only a freshman, I have been taking computer science classes since my sophomore year of high school.

&gt;The reason I am so drawn to computer science is because it is all about solving problems. There is nothing I enjoy more than spending an afternoon with an interesting problem or puzzle and trying different approaches to find a solution. I generally see programming in the same way an astronomer would look at a telescope. It is something I am knowledgeable in and use everyday, but it is ultimately an invaluable tool in a greater goal: in the astronomer’s case, understanding the universe and in my case solving problems.

&gt;However, although my interests tend to lean more towards the abstract and theoretical side of computer science, I also love to create. It’s a great feeling to look at a project that I’ve worked hard and long on and feel proud of the end result.

&gt;That’s why I think I would be a great fit at &lt;BCISBC&gt; and would love to work with you. My interests and skills align perfectly with &lt;BCISBC&gt;’s mission to solve problems by making sense of data. I am a quick learner and I pick up skills rapidly, especially in areas that I find interesting. As a Software Engineer intern at &lt;BCISBC&gt;, I will strive to make quality software that makes an impact.

&gt;Thank you for your consideration.

2tatq4,1,2015-01-22,Please judge my qualifications for an entry-level software development position,ActionCactus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tatq4/please_judge_my_qualifications_for_an_entrylevel/,"Hey all,

I currently have a software development position, but it's for a tiny company.  The job I currently hold was sort of a lucky find I'm not sure where I stand with the rest of the world.

In my year of employment at this place I've done a bunch of varied tasks from customer support to client-side software customizations, and beginning around August of 2014 I began software development after pushing for a project.  For that project I had proposed a tool that would make one of our internal jobs easier, and I spent the fall managing an intern and developing that tool in VBA.  We've released this project.

Since I hate VBA I've pushed for a new project, this time in C#.  I'm managing the same guy again but I've also got further in to development.  I've designed our object model (which has been approved by our upper-level software guys) and we're working on implementing it.  

Also in my portfolio is a web interface for a database I created along with a few other people from my school.  This database is being improved as well as the interface, but we hope to be shipping the site to a company very soon.

Now, the issue I have is that I don't have a CS degree yet, and my grades haven't been too hot, but my managers are very, very pleased with my work at the company, and I've exemplified a (short) history of developing software and shipping products.  I've got all the core courses covered (other than my algorithms course, but I'm studying that on my own) and I have experience in C#, Java, VBA, PHP, Python, HTML and MySQL, along with various IDE's and DBMS's for these.

If you were a software company, would I be a candidate for hire once my current project is complete?  How do I stand against my peers (fresh college grads)?

Thank you for any input."

Looking for some advice...I recently completed an internship, on my last day my boss asked me to come into his office and told me to come by after the holidays and they would be happy to set me up with something if I wanted to make a few bucks on the side while I continued my studies. 

Needless to say I was thrilled and came back to the office on the first week of January. The office was pleased to see me again and my former boss invited me back into his office and seemed relatively pleased with the idea of me being back, he asked what days I'd like to work and I told him I was fine with whatever worked for him. 

He told me that he'd look at their schedule and give me a call next week...well it's been almost two weeks now...and I still haven't gotten a call. 

I sent him an email--granted he doesn't really respond to emails, but I felt it was the more professional thing to do.

Was he just trying to be nice? Is there really not an opening? Should I continue to try and contact him or am I just being a pest at this point? 

Basically...am I missing something here? "

[Since your company is a bit of a start-up and new to the whole large performance space was curious on how you guys came together, how did it start and what were some of the largest hurdles.  Also, how easy/hard is it to contact some of the performers, and who was the hardest?  What is the process on getting them booked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxbw8j?context=5)|I went to high school with Jordan and we bonded over our love for live music and hilarity. After college i worked for Superfly, where i met Yoni who was interning there at the time. We were all friends and once we decided that we could do what our respective bosses were doing on our own, we made the jump and launched Founders. We also identified that that were a void in the NYC market for festivals and we jumped on that. It's very difficult to get artists on board, and the strokes were the toughest. The process works like this - you send an offer to an agent, they reply with feedback and availability, and you go back and forth until both parties are comfortable with the deal points. Lots of talking, negotiating, and feelings. - T.
[Are there any changes to VIP this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxaynn?context=5)|We have hired a new VIP decor company this year in an effort to make the VIP experience more special. While in past years we have featured simple decor and seating, this year we are making an effort to make it much more high end and classy, while also featuring the important features that people want like clean air conditioned bathrooms, comfortable seating, etc. As with past years, each stage will have a dedicated VIP area, and each of those areas will have incredibly close stage viewing, choice food vendors, cell phone charging stations, and more. - T.
[What changes are being made in the infrastructure / site of the fest? Are the grounds being expanded?  Is the production of the stages changing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxb1ht?context=5)|3 of our 4 stages are getting an upgrade - The Gov Ball NYC Stage, The Honda Stage, and the Gotham Tent. Expect bigger stages, more elaborate production, more video, more lighting, and more ""Wow"". The grounds are not being expanded from 2014, but we are making tweaks to the layout to make it flow better (e.g. moving some tents around, opening up some areas more, etc.). We are adding more water stations, more cell phone charging stations, more art installations, more entry/exit gates for quicker entry, and an additional enclosed liquor lounge in Honda stage field. - T.
[Interesting - I thought the Big Apple was the one that probably needed it most - you could barely hear Bastille and several other acts unless you were DIRECTLY in front of the stage... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxbh5i?context=5)|We're talking about this as well and it very well may happen. Your comment may be the reason it does happen! - T 
[My biggest pet peeve from last year was the unfathomably long lines for the food trucks/tents and bathrooms. I had to wait in line for over an hour to order food, and it was one of the shorter lines! What are you guys doing this year to combat that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxekm2?context=5)|Cashless!  We're implementing an optional cashless program this year (we'll still be accepting cash and credit), which should help significantly reduce lines this year.  It'll be super easy, simple, and safe - you attach your credit card to your RFID wristband and then create a 4 digit pin.  When you ask for a beer (or food or whatever), you'll tap your wrist on the POS system, type in your 4 digit pin, take your item, and go enjoy yourself. We're also making quite the effort to simplify menus and work with vendors to ensure they can be incredibly efficient with the items on their menu without sacrificing quality. -YR.
[I've thought of another question. What improvements or additions will there be this year in any aspect of the festival?  Best, Ben Rosner.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxd7e4?context=5)|Solid question.  Biggest thing I'm most excited about is that we're doing all RFID wristbands this year.  And we're offering the option to do cashless.  So to be clear, it's only an option to do cashless - we'll be accepting cash and credit too.  The goal here is to make the experience better for people by reducing lines and just making it easier.  There'll be no Gov Ball bucks or anything silly like that - plan is to just attach a credit card to your wristband and create a 4 digit pin for add'l safety. Whatchu think? -YR.
[Is it necessary to purchase transportation tickets? it looks like not horrible walking distance from where ill be staying… whats the biggest thing people usually miss at this festival and are sad about later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxc1f4?context=5)|It's not a necessity. If you can walk, we advise that! I think the thing people miss at the festival and are sad about later is the lesser known artists that play earlier in the day. We are huge music fans over here and we carefully pick artists to play at the festival. LOTS of times the bands that play earlier in the day go on to blow up and become huge (e.g. Haim). So we advise that people listen to all the artists playing at the festival in advance and see who is definitely worth getting there early for. - T.
[Thanks so much for doing this AMA!  The Governors Ball team all have such impressive resumes. What made you decide to break away and create your own festival and entertainment company?  What are some lessons you have learned from starting your own business?  Do you have any advice for others starting in the music industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxc96o?context=5)|Thanks for the kind words. I was in business school and starting a music festival sounded significantly more fun and something I was oddly kinda qualified to do.  Plus it was really opportunistic - we had a really well rounded team with different skills and experience, plus there was a void in the market.  Timing was clutch too. Lessons - work doesn't ever end.  You don't clock out.  You're always on.  Probably more lessons but that's the first that pops in my head.  Advice - work really hard. Meet a ton of people.  Get them to really likely.  Godspeed.  -YR.
[Are there any surprises that we can expect for this festival? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxa86f?context=5)|Yes, and we're continuing to think about what else we can do to surprise and delight attendees. You got any ideas?! Without giving too much away, we're using a whole new performance tent that will wow and awe, more surprise busking performances that will get people shaking, bigger and better art installations that will impress and/or confuse, more delectable food offerings that will make people salivate, and much much more. - T.
[Is that in addition to the tent that was up last year or an upgrade on what was there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxb3vt?context=5)|Upgrade on what was there.
[Is there anything not on your site that you might recommend for a first-time Governor's Ball attendee? I love NYC, but have never been to Randall's Island or this festival. Looking forward to it so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxez4m?context=5)|I think figuring out how you are getting there and getting home is smart to do in advance, as it helps you plan how to attack each day. There are many ways to get to Randall's and the best method really depends on where you are coming from and where you want to end up after the show. Check out the Getting There page on our website for a bunch of info and if you have more questions, hit us up here or via email at info@govball.com and we can best advise ya. - T.
[Goldenvoice announced they are investing in Firefly and Hangout: Have they made an offer to invest in Gov Ball? Will they one day own every festival? One day the world?  How can we stop them from becoming self aware? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxe51x?context=5)|Live music industry is doing well these days, and the bigger players (live nation and AEG) are making investments and acquisitions. They've both talked to us, and they'll likely continue to make moves in the industry, but we aren't interested in that at the moment. We're focused on one thing and one thing only: Creating the best possible festival experience and making sure NYC has a festival it's proud to call it's own. - T.
[As someone with a desire to get into the music industry, I am curious as to where you guys got your starts in the business and what I can do best as a senior with not much in the industry on my resume (one short internship\).  Oh and do you guys have a summer internship I can use to finish my degree this summer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxaz2y?context=5)|I got my start in the industry while going to Tulane University in New Orleans. I got an internship at Superfly, who does Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, and they were doing exactly what i wanted to be doing in the industry. After getting the internship, i basically worked my ass off until they offered me a job. Timing worked out well, but more than anything i just proved my value and was the first one in and the last one out every day. We do offer internships! Email us at info@govball.com. - T.
[If you could build your dream lineup (artists still alive or passed away\) who would headline? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxa8mg?context=5)|T: Talking Heads, Bob Marley, Pearl Jam.
 |I'd say Talking Heads Reunion, Phish, Radiohead, and for passed away (or partly passed away): Bob Marley, Pink Floyd, The Beatles.  Also quite bummed we don't have Alt J, Sylvan Esso, and Jungle this year.  Pumped about Ratatat -YR.
 |LCD Soundsystem. Pearl Jam. Beyonce. Radiohead. Eddie Murphy. 
[Why do you guys have a one-entry-per-day limit? I would really like to get out and see the city between acts...is there any chance that you would re-evaluate the policy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxfhkr?context=5)|King Joffrey? Is that you? While we personally think that Robert Barathian is the true heir to the throne, everyone's entitled to their own opinion. Anyway, back to your question - unfortunately we are unable to allow more than one entry per day due to our security protocol and the suggestions of the NYC agencies we work with. Sorry we can't sway on this! - T.
[This is my first Governor's Ball and I splurged on VIP. Problem is, none of my friends wanted to spend the money so I'm going solo. Am I going to fare alright on my own? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxbtqb?context=5)|That's up to you, my friend.  We have full confidence though.  People are friendly.  You'll be great. You can hang with your friends outside of VIP too and then make them jealous when you get to go back into your more comfortable, spacious area with nicer bathrooms, shorter lines, and better viewing. ;)  -YR.
[Do you guys work for Govball year round, or is there a chunk of the year that you're active? What's a day in the life of an employee?  Also, are you hiring? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2tat2j/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cnxe9mu?context=5)|We do work on it year round, and some months are busier than others. We launched a new festival this year (Farmborough) which has taken up a bunch of our time as well. We are not hiring at the moment, but keep in touch with us and if we are we will let you know! - T.

What should I be looking for and am I being delusional with my search?",lifesthrownaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2tbou5/xpost_post_replyreality_check_30_no_serious/,"I've applied to every job I think would be qualified for (secretarial, flight attendant, bank teller, waitstaff, barista, retail...) and not get any hits back. I am aiming too high?

Background: 30 yo, some college, history of major depression. I have been on disability for it in the past, and my life has been stunted because of it.

My work history is few and far between, but the jobs I have had have been professional and not exactly ""entry level"" because I am fluent in three languages (English and two others which have no demand outside a very small circle of immigrant community). Those jobs were temporary positions (fill ins) for 2 months to one year, and most of the companies are gone now (bought/sold/owner shut it down for retirement).

I have excellent computer skills (including excel certification). I enrolled in a local college to get some history given that my high school transcript was abysmal (health+family issues), and I am waiting to hear back regarding my acceptance into the program in the fall [it is an evening program]. I am very good at planning and organizing, and have a lot of knowledge about industrial design and the fashion industry.

In the meantime, I've been looking for a job for two months, and have not even gotten a call back for retail during the holiday season, which I found devastating. I have sent more than 200 applications out, most of them with those ungodly taleo forms which I don't know how to use to my advantage.

I've had my resume reviewed by a mentor as well as my school's career services (before someone says they are useless, they have placed alumni at Google, Macys corporate, major ad agencies, and other highly competitive companies, so I believe that they know what they are talking about). My mentor suggested internships, but many of them are contingent upon being in school, but I am currently not, so that's out of the question.

All I am looking for is something that will help pay the bills, provide health insurance/minimal benefits, and let me go to school/learn more. I am incredibly frustrated because my money is running out quickly (I am pretty frugal and my only expenses are my rent and food).

What should I be looking for in terms of jobs I am qualified for and where can I find them?

2tbv8v,10,2015-01-22,TIFU By browsing reddit at work,legendaryX1,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2tbv8v/tifu_by_browsing_reddit_at_work/,"Alright some background info:

I'm a senior in high school and work at a fairly small software company as a part of work experience program. I got employed in a sort of paid internship (for which i was ecstatic) with this company and started working as a software tester. I have a lot of background with coding and computers so this it wasn't that hard to adapt and learn how to do my job, especially since I was new and therefore wasn't given much to do.

   
Skipping forward 2 months

I'm basically a pro now (not really but i feel like it), doing all my tasks extremely quick, but my workload hasn't increased. I can literally do all my tests in about 1/2 the time that I'm supposed to be at work for so I end up having a lot of free time. Usually, I end up spending a lot of it on youtube, twitch and reddit to pass the time. 

My manager found out but he is by far the most chill guy I have ever worked with and said that as long as I get everything done, it doesn't really matter what else I do. My boss on the other hand is pretty uptight (not that I blame him or anything as it is his company) but basically if he ever sees someone not hard at work for the company he kind of loses his shit. Luckily for most of us, he isn't at the office most of the time since he travels a lot. 

Skip to a few days ago

So I finally finished the 1st semester at school and I still have the job and plan on continuing it, since its pretty good money and I enjoy working at it. Been pretty busy week so I haven't been on reddit almost at all recently, finish all of my work and decide that it's time to catch up on the whole Jenny situation. Boss comes in for today even though he should't have been here today. My desk faces away from the entrance to the room so If you come in behind me, you can easily see what is on the monitor. He calls me into the office along with my manager.

Ohfuck.jpg  
I'm internally freaking the fuck out on the way there as this is my first legit job (Only other jobs were part time work in like concession stands and the like). We sit down and he asks me how I've been benefiting the company with my time here. I explain all the things I do and such, my manager agrees and even adds a few that i missed, but boss seems uninterested and kind of nods whenever I say something but is essentially showing me that he doesn't really give a shit about what I'm saying.   

He turns around a computer to show me internet history, apparently he has been tracking my internet usage over the last little while and after what he saw today says that i'm not doing anything, and believes that I am more of a detriment to the company than a help. Manager continues to defend me saying that I get all the work done and he has allowed this himself because there is nothing else that they can give me to do. Boss gets even more pissed, stands up and tells us both to ""get the fuck out"" and that we are fired. 

I try to tell him that it wasn't my manager's fault, but he says that it doesn't matter since he was suppsoed to be watching me so he is just as guilty. We go and clean our desks out and leave, I try to lighten the mood a little with a joke (bad idea) and manager tells me to fuck off and that I ruined his life. As much as I want to say he exaggerated, he has a wife and 2 daughters so he is probably right. Furthermore, when I told my parents, they got pissed and essentially forced me to give them all the money from my account so that I can't spend it since I'm not making any anymore. So now I'm broke and feel like shit.

TL;DR: Senior in high school, browsed reddit at work, boss found out, got pissed, nice manager tried to defend me, both of us got fired, parents got pissed and took away all my free money, so now I'm broke and I ruined a nice man's life.

I am aiming too high?

Background: 30 yo, some college, history of major depression. I have been on disability for it in the past, and my life has been stunted because of it.

My work history is few and far between, but the jobs I have had have been professional and not exactly ""entry level"" because I am fluent in three languages (English and two others which have no demand outside a very small circle of immigrant community). Those jobs were temporary positions (fill ins) for 2 months to one year, and most of the companies are gone now (bought/sold/owner shut it down for retirement).

I have excellent computer skills (including excel certification). I enrolled in a local college to get some history given that my high school transcript was abysmal (health+family issues), and I am waiting to hear back regarding my acceptance into the program in the fall [it is an evening program]. I am very good at planning and organizing, and have a lot of knowledge about industrial design and the fashion industry.

In the meantime, I've been looking for a job for two months, and have not even gotten a call back for retail during the holiday season, which I found devastating. I have sent more than 200 applications out, most of them with those ungodly taleo forms which I don't know how to use to my advantage.

I've had my resume reviewed by a mentor as well as my school's career services (before someone says they are useless, they have placed alumni at Google, Macys corporate, major ad agencies, and other highly competitive companies, so I believe that they know what they are talking about). My mentor suggested internships, but many of them are contingent upon being in school, but I am currently not, so that's out of the question.

All I am looking for is something that will help pay the bills, provide health insurance/minimal benefits, and let me go to school/learn more. I am incredibly frustrated because my money is running out quickly (I am pretty frugal and my only expenses are my rent and food).

What should I be looking for in terms of jobs I am qualified for and where can I find them?"

I'm in a little bit of a bind here. I have two internship offers on the table right now and I'm not applying/anticipating any other jobs. One is from my old company and the other one is a new company I really wanted, but is asking me to take a $12/hr deduction in pay. I'm a junior and am set on entering grad school (artificial intelligence) after I graduate. Here are my two choices, I would REALLY appreciate some upfront, sincere advice on my situation:

&amp;nbsp;

**Take the return offer:**  
+$30/hr pay  
+I already know/like the team and the software I'll be using  
- I like the environment but the work isn't challenging  
- 90% of the work is PowerShell scripting which I feel isn't a sought-after, ""I'm ready for Grad School"" kind of skill
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Take the new offer:**  
-  $18/hr pay, leave ~4000 dollars on the table  
+ Work varies between signal processing and network security, which   professors are saying is more related to my AI grad school goal  
+ Diversify my professional skill set (c, c++, signal processing, networking)

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone have any insight of any kind that I might not be considering? **THE MONEY IS NOT THE BIGGEST FACTOR**, but I don't want to take the pay cut just to find out that this new job won't boost my resume the way I thought it would."

(Texas),VampirePirateNinja,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2tczvo/how_best_to_hire_a_foreigner_for_an/,"My husband and I run a small martial arts gym (under 50 students).  We offer Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, no-gi submission grappling, and MMA.  In the future, we are considering expanding.  The problem is many gyms that expand, whether it be by having 100+ students or adding new locations, lose the quality of the original gym and instructor.

The solution we have come up with is apprenticing a young BJJ black belt and teaching him/her our business practices and philosophy in gym culture, etc.  The apprenticeship would probably last 1-1.5 years.  After completion of the apprenticeship, we would likely hire or partner with our former apprentice.

The problem is the best qualified young BJJ black belts are Brazilian.

The question is, once we have identified one or several possible apprentices, what is the best way to bring them over for a year or so for training and then hire them.

I have looked into hiring, but I would have to offer to pay them and we would like the apprenticeship to be like an internship.  We would offer room and board and probably a small stipend for necessities and entertainment. 

I have also looked into creating a training program and bringing them over on a J-1 visa, but this requires me to get certified and to have at least 5 participants in the program.

I have also considered having them come on a visitor's visa for the apprenticeship, but am concerned about the legality of this option and the risk that once we got to them job offer stage they would be unable to obtain the proper visa after coming on the visitor's visa so much.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated on how to analyze this issue.  Thanks!"

Would it just be a matter of practicing more and applying, or is there some aspect of programming employment that I'm overlooking?  
I like the idea of back-end programming, since it's closer to what I do on my own time anyway (if that makes any difference).  I'm not opposed to front end programming, though.


Some background:

I graduated at the end of 2012 with a BA in History and a minor in CS.   I started out majoring in CS, but switched after having a terrible time with the upper division math requirements (a decision I've come to regret).  I've continued to study programming since then, mostly through interactive tutorial websites like codecademy and udacity.  I have a strong basis in Java, along with knowledge of C, Python and HTML/CSS.  I have a ways to go with C, Python and HTML/CSS since I don't have the same level of familiarity with them that I do with Java, but I'm getting there. 

Since graduating I've been employed as a sales associate at a few different companies, but sales never clicked for me.  After a long day of retail mayhem, I always turned to programming to unwind.  I love to write small bits of code in my spare time that solve small problems."

I'm a PhD student in computer science, and my research area is computer graphics. It seems that whenever I talk to recruiters (at career fairs or in the internship interview process), they quickly jump to the incorrect conclusion that I am primarily an artist or designer, not a technical person. I actually do love art as a hobby, but when I talk to these recruiters, I am always interested in technical positions.

Typically, I will introduce myself like I did to this thread: ""I'm a PhD student in computer science, and my research area is computer graphics."" As soon as these recruiters hear the word ""graphics,"" they respond with, ""so, you're a designer?"" 

Then, I try to explain that I am not a designer, but I do make images appear on the screen. My actual work is about writing the code and developing the algorithms. 

However, at this point, the recruiters seem completely tuned out to everything I am saying, because 10 seconds ago, they jumped to the conclusion that I was a designer. And they are not looking to hire designers, so why pay attention to me at all? 

Then sometimes they will be like...""Why don't you talk to Bob? Hey Bob, talk to this girl, she's a designer."" Then I will have to start over again explaining to Bob that I am not actually a designer. 

Or sometimes they will say, ""We are really looking for a strong coder (...not you) for this position."" Then if I try to point out that I am a strong coder, they won't take me seriously.

I am concerned that this problem will affect my chances of landing a computer science job after I graduate. I am trying to figure out why this is happening to me, and what I can do to change it. What do?

Most of them were new grad/entry web development positions at popular mid-sized companies (think Twitter, AirBnb, Dropbox etc.). Despite spending the past 2 years or so following everyones' advice on here to prepare, I've gotten flat out denied from all of those applications except 4 of them which offered me a chance to interview. To be clear, this is everything I had and thought I needed for a good application:

* Well structured resume, peer reviewed several times on this subreddit
* Relevant internship experience at a reputable company
* Good GPA ( ~3.8)
* Extensive portfolio/GitHub (I have +50 stars on two GitHub projects, if you care about that sort of thing)
* Carefully wrote personalized cover letters for each company
* Decent extra-curricular achivements including leadership of a school organization, minor contributions to open-source and winning multiple hackathons 
* Ensured I met all/almost-all of the requirements for each company usually including lots of experience with their relevant technologies

Here's what I don't have:

* Attending a top 10 school (I'm at a school on the east-coast that's actually pretty well regarded locally for its CS program but most people in the Bay Area have never heard of it)

What makes me even more suspicious that this is what got me denied is that I noticed on a lot of applications for these companies (including the ones mentioned above) there's a field that says ""school attended"" and lists about 15-20 schools. All of them are schools with top-rated CS programs, so I had to select the option ""other"" and fill-in my no-name school. I have a feeling all of these applications that put down ""other"" schools get trashed.

The applications that accepted me were either much smaller companies or one of the ""big 4"" (I heard they don't care about schools as much anymore), and guess what: none of them had a ""school"" field on their applications. I've performed pretty well at interviewing at these companies so I have a feeling I would've done at least decently with the others if they gave me a chance, but I'm at a loss at how to get their attention in the future. I feel like I'll forever be in a rut of only having the option of working at either unheard of places or the big 4 because I didn't go to MIT for undergrad, and I don't want it to be that way.

So my company, $wedoIT, just lost an employee to $webuildcarsandstuff. So we reached out and interviewed some students from local.university. Now as a little background, we're a pretty laid back company. There are only 3 full time people in my division with a couple of interns that handle the basic level one stuff. We're all pretty close and have been working together for a while, so we get along well and are all pretty good friends in and out of the office. 

In walks this kid, wearing some kind of faded jeans, sneakers and a tie. I look at the other interns, including the one he'll be replacing... *Well, this is interesting*

Interview gets underway and this cat is just as nervous as can be, I've never felt hands this cold and sweaty. Pretty informal, basic questions that anyone could answer. We're more interested in personality and communication skills rather than pure IT knowledge, you'll learn what you need in time at our company.  So we ask our standard questions, ask him if he has any and head out of the conference room.

Being the nice guy that I am and thinking the kid would like a tour of the NOC, I invite him to come check out our equipment. Give him a basic rundown of all the servers/network equipment etc. The kind of stuff that'll get a young IT major all doe-eyed. Then all hell breaks loose.

We start getting calls and tickets and emails about this and that being down. Lo and behold, our firewall that connects all of our clients back to the datacenter and provides a tunnel for them to connect to applications they need, has royally shat the bed.

&gt;$Intern Kid: ..........  
&gt;$Intern_Overlord: Well....maybe it won't be too bad.  

It was bad. The whole thing was shot, we were ripping memory out of old firewalls, figuring out which ones still worked, etc. Typical Friday hell story. Prospective intern is just sitting and watching the whole time.

&gt;$IT Director: Well, son. I guess you can stick around if you don't have anything better to do *shrugs*  
&gt;$Intern Kid: O...Okay. Sure. Have you tried &lt;insert dumb suggestion here&gt; &lt;here&gt; and &lt;here&gt;  
&gt;$Intern_Overlord: *sigh* Yeeeeeeeep.  

*Tl;dr: Intern shows up for interview during a warzone, sits and offers unhelpful advice for 2 hours while we reconstruct our entire setup.*


Fast forward a few weeks and the intern is brought in for a second interview with $President. Now I didn't have to go through this process (thank God, because $President asked some tough ass questions) but the new hires all do now.

&gt;$President: Nice to meet you, $Intern. Let me tell you a little about $company.  
&gt;$Intern: O-o-okay. Sureeeee.  
&gt;$President: #too long, didn't listen  
&gt;$President: so, now I have to ask, what is your biggest weakness, and how do you think you can improve upon that with our company?  

The kid FROZE. It was like something out of a movie, I've never seen someone clam up and have no response like this in my life. So after ~2 minutes of awkward ums and repeating the question. $President comes to the rescue with a story from when he was asked that question.  One of the best answers you could imagine someone giving spews out of his mouth. The kid looks even more horrified and at this point he's probably ready to send his resume out to more companies. Then....**BOOM** 

&gt;$President: Well, $Intern, I'm pleased to offer you the position, and you can start immediately!

I was going to school doing all of my fun classes there with C, java, c++, and was experimenting with side projects in Perl, Python, etc. I was working in support at a SAAS company and they noticed I was just about done getting my degree and took me in as an intern. I've been developing in C# and ASP.net ever since! While I genuinely love C# as a language, and find ASP.net kinda cool, I really don't want to be a ""one-trick pony"" as far as work experience. 

So where do I go from here? I'm looking at probably working with either PHP, Python, or Ruby. And using their most popular associated web frameworks. I want to put together a legitimate big project that I can show as a work example and maybe land a remote/part-time job as a php, python, or ruby developer? That would be pretty cool. Otherwise even just having the personal experience would be fine, but I just don't know how to pick one. -_-

**TL;DR: Intermediate .Net developer here, should my next project be in PHP, Python, or Ruby? Or something else? Or should I just shut up?**"

I'm a Computer Science Major, currently a Sophomore, and I have about 4 semesters left.

I'm an intern for a medium sized company with over a dozen fulltime developers on our staff. Mainly, as an intern, I do menial webmaster duties, and stuff like that, but sometimes I get tasks to actually do some programming in some of our applications that our clients use. Usually I do pretty well but my inexperience does show.

In the past year I've been exposed to the full web stack (SQL, C# and .NET, and more advanced JavaScript). 

I have completed several programming side projects including Reddit Bots, fixing up broken WoW addons, various simple Javascript based games, and making several hobby-related websites.

My career goal at the moment is to be a full stack web dev (although I've read that's really hard ~~nigh impossible~~ to do super well).

Basically, my question is how do I stack up against maybe some other CS majors? How ""competitive"" am I?

I feel like I might be competitive for my school (small class size, community college), but how might I stack up against other CS majors from more competitive schools?

I'm really interested in Artificial Intelligence but I know for a fact that I need to get the basics down first. What should I focus my independent study on? I'll be in AP Computer Science next year too and in that class I'll be learning Java.

**Here are my questions:**

- What books should I be reading? (I've read *Singularity* and it's an amazing book!)

- What language should I focus on learning?

- What should be my primary goal?

- Would it be too difficult to learn Ruby and Java at the same time?

So far I have only applied to big well known companies and thought that it might be advantageous to apply to smaller ones. The problem is, how do I find them? It's easy to apply to big ones because you know who they are and what they do. But how do I find interesting smaller companies that I've probably never heard of?

I live near Boston and want to find an internship there. The problem is that I go to school out of state (It's a good school) but I'm afraid I won't have a chance because I don't go to MIT or Harvard. Last summer I had a tech internship at a local college. I am a rising Junior with a 3.5 GPA and personal projects. I have experience with Java, Python, and Ruby on Rails. But I'm not a ""coding ninja/rockstar/samurai"" with any of them lol 

I feel like I would be rejected at startups for not being a ""culture fit"" because I'm a woman and part of a minority ethnic group. But startups seems so interesting to me!

For anyone that found an internship at a local or less well known company, how did you find it? Or if you haven't but have advice. Also, how do I apply for startups?"

I did it as a hobby and when I found out that I could make some good money off of it, I practiced even harder.

I finally got my first real web development internship. I make about $12 an hour and I have the possibility of being a permanent employee (I really do hope I get a pay raise, though). But as nice as my co-workers are and how beautiful my office is with a view that allows me to see the whole city... I don't think I want to be here permanently.

I know I'm an intern, but dammit this job really wasn't what I expected. What we're doing is basically putting Drupal sites together. And I am in charge of making the pages, content types and whatnot but everything I'm doing is being done through the Drupal dashboard. No hardcore programming or design patterns. Just a lot of configuration.

We aren't doing top-to-bottom web applications like I had hoped. We're just throwing something together really quickly for clients.

We get a number of hours from our client, requirements and just do it. It's like I'm on a freaking conveyor belt. I've only been here 2 months and I can see that the projects are just going to be the same.

The most fun I've had at this job is when our client was using a PHPFox CMS and I had to develop a module for it with no prior experience or documentation. (PHPFox's documentation is REALLY bad.)

My very first internship that I got laid off from... they were developing an actual product. It was a top-down web application that was being polished on every corner. I absolutely loved that and I was devastated when I was let go.

I dropped out of school so I could practice web development even more. So I have to make this work. I want to know if there's more to the field than this. 

I am so lucky to have had this internship and it makes me really sad that I'm already bitching about it. But I feel as if there has to be more to it than this.

I have gained a huge interest in Ruby (I've been learning how to make custom RPG Maker VX Ace scripts with it) and would like to know the prestige in me transferring over to Ruby on Rails. But I'm hoping that it's not just the same story, different technology with that.

I graduated last June with a BS in mechanical engineering. At the end of October last year I got offered a contract intern position creating CAD models/drawings. The only reason I took the offer was that they said there was potential for a full time position where one of the responsibilites would be performing FEA on their products. That was exciting and something I wanted to do.

Three weeks ago they gave me a full time offer. Now I was expecting something in the 40k-45k range, but I was mistaken. It is almost 45% less than that. At the time I was more shocked than anything and started second guessing myself, ""Was I expecting too much?"" So I ended up silently agreeing to it. Looking back, I clearly made some mistakes and should have done things differently in the ""full-time offer meeting.""

Now I'm here resenting myself, since I know I should be able to get a job paying more than this. So my questions are:

* How do I explain this to potential employers when they inevitably ask, ""Why do you want to leave your job of 3 months?"" I should mention this on my cover letter, right? What about the resume?

* Will it look bad to potential employers that I want to leave?

* Should I continue working here until I get an offer or should I just quit? If I continue working here, will potential employers be more flexible with interview times?

I wanted to start doing something on my own after the first year but i realized that i don't know as much as i need to start anything. I then though maybe ill learn a lot more in second year. Well that didn't really happen, it felt as everything was still going at the same pace and we didn't really learn anything too complex. I decided to look for internship for summer and managed to find one (with help from college) in another country (Note:  i'm located in Europe*). I don't feel like i learned a lot from it.
Anyway i then thought maybe we will start doing some bigger projects or something in 3rd year in college. However that's not happening, i still feel like were going in the same pace. 

This now made me realize that it will probably stay the same for the rest of my time in university.
This year i managed to get an invitation and attended the Google Open House, they explained the different options available for graduates, talked about working at Google and had some engineers answer student questions. What i got from that open house talk is that they like graduates who have participated in some open source projects or have some projects of their own to show. They also recommended to attend the Google summer of code which i'm planning on doing this summer. 

This event really got me thinking for some reason. I realized that i really don't feel that confident in my abilities. I started researching a bit and understood that when people say ""there's a high demand of programmers"" it really means that there is a high demand for GOOD programmers, there's plenty of average programmers. 
I'm now in a position where i feel really useless, i want to do something to learn more, but i don't know what to do. I feel like the college is only getting us ready for local companies (where i don't have a particular interest in working.) My dream is to one day work for Google, but the further i go the more i realize that this dream is slipping away from me. I'm still trying to not give up and do something useful to make me a better programmer. From reading quite a bit of posts on this sub-reddit i saw that there's a lot of experienced people here who have the knowledge and answers. 

I hope people can understand what i'm trying to say as i'm just spilling my thoughts into this post.
So how exactly would i go about becoming a good programmer? what does Google really look for in graduates? any recommendations? have any of you gone through something similar as me? do you have any interesting stories on how you became a successful software engineer? I understand that a lot of this is just rambling but i'm really just a lost student looking for any kind of hook that i can grab on to."

In the past year, I've managed to pull myself out of the negative cycle and completed a chunk of my degree requirements here at UT.

As cliche as it may sound I would like to work at one of the big tech companies as an intern as well as a full-time position. 

However, I've explored other paths available in software development. One of these paths is computational finance. I find the field interesting and have also looked at positions in this route, and I feel that there are still great companies available in this field as well i.e Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, etc. Although this path is interesting and something I would consider doing, I'd much rather work in pure software development and preferably at one of the bigger tech companies.

I've been applying to various internships, and I feel fortunate in saying that I was given multiple offers to choose from. I've narrowed my choices down to 2 companies, but I would really like help choosing. I said the above blurb so that you have an idea of what I'm looking for and where I stand academically. I'd like to show larger tech companies that I've contributed significantly to some major projects and that I do have strong coding abilities. Hopefully a project at one of these internships can show that, and I'd really like some help choosing.

**Internship #1: Small trading company - Comp finance.**

* Experience: All i've been told is that I would be learning software development as applied to automated trading. However, they have learning sessions where I can also learning trading and valuation.
* Benefits: **very** high pay, even tops a major tech company. 

**Internship #2: Large defense contracting/rocketry Company**

* Experience: They haven't told me either, but from what I've read from other sources, it would either be Identity and Access Management work or web development work. 
* Benefits: Would be great to have a full-time job offer here after graduation

I feel really fortunate to be in this position and would really appreciate your input on which one I should take based on the experience I've listed and what I'm interested in. I'm more inclined to take the larger company but I want to make sure that my decision is based and not due to naivete from just having a large company name on my CV.

We do not live together (we are both 25 but living at home with her finishing school while I am about to start a career following my recent graduation). 

From our limited contact together she has told me that the issue is that she doesn't like what she is doing anymore (at school) but because her parents are helping her pay for it she feels she is obligated to her major and has no way out.  She has a bachelors degree but is completing an internship and masters level courses for an advanced degree.

I have told her that whatever she does I will be proud of her and support her but her father, even in spite of her attempt, is mad at her for not finishing her schooling.  He actually told her in his visit that he is mad at her for not being able to complete her courses and that she is not right and needs to be locked away for life. 

My question is what can/should I do. My parents and I have offered her a place in my home while I start my career and build my way financially to a place where we can live together. Part of the problem is that she fears what her father will do to her if she moves out without being married and not finishing her schooling.

On a side note my brother took his own life 8 years ago so I am working through some rehashed feelings of my own. I know it's complicated but any advice/words of encouragement are appreciated."
2tlfcb,4,2015-01-25,"21 years old, zero job experience, quite depressed",mindstormer12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tlfcb/21_years_old_zero_job_experience_quite_depressed/,"I am currently a junior who recently switched from an accounting major to a CS major. I found I had no interest in pursuing an accounting career and to be honest only wanted a career path that was likely going to be high pay for not very brain-intensive work (more knowledge-based instead). I am also an introvert and was never motivated to attend career fairs or do any sort of networking, especially in a field where I had no interest in (I had good grades in accounting courses, but it meant little as a career in business is based so much on networking).


I switched to a CS major because I was always interest in finding programs that perform specific tasks and I wanted to learn how to write my own to tailor to my needs. Introverts are not uncommon among programmers. The only CS-related courses I have taken are Java 1 and 2 (I never fully committed to studying programming on my own time) and I don't feel confident in my coding skills. I did not initially imagine doing anything programming-related because I see programmers who began coding at the age of 7, 13, 16 etc. and here I am, watching beginner Java tutorials at the age of 21 on Youtube (and never having any kind of job before) while they go on and do worthwhile things and paid well for it. I feel that my current level of motivation and curiosity could never compare to one who began coding at a young age and I learning will be at such a slow pace that I could never be competitive to land a high-paying job. 

Since I just switched to a CS major and have only taken 2 Java courses, I don't think it's possible for me to find a worthwhile internship (or is it? I never even thought of looking for one because I don't have a resume completed... I have literally nothing to add other than my personal information and my interest for CS--no prior work experience, no accomplishments, etc., quite embaassing, really). I have no clue what a relevant internship for me entails and why anyone would want someone that has no prior experience and has only taken 2 courses... My GPA is ~3.3, although technically my GPA for my major is higher. 

What should I do now toward a successful career path? How likely is it for me to find a worthwhile internship and how do I actually find one given my resume is practically a piece of paper with my name on it? I really want to begin and build a competent resume over the summer and not waste what little time I have left. Or should I instead fully solely on studying and somehow find an entry level job after college? Other than studying, I have been trying to learn to use Linux, which programmers prefer to use. 

Any comments, advice, anecdotes, etc. are appreciated--I don't know anyone that i can talk to regarding the career path since I switched majors recently.

P.S. 

I've read a thread 5 years ago where the OP asked what work life was like for programmers/software engineers. It was quite astonishing how a significant amount of them stated they are constantly stressed out, trying to meet unrealistic deadlines set by their bosses and how they were required to learn a ton of stuff quickly to accomplish what they need to accomplish. Is this true for the most part? I don't think I can keep up with that kind of environment, especially when kids these days are more tech-savvy. I can already imagine being 50 years old and having a person in his twenties come out of college and potentially replacing me--it is quite bleak and depressing. "
2tlfot,3,2015-01-25,Questions for a .NET internship interview?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tlfot/questions_for_a_net_internship_interview/,"Hi everyone.

I have a phone interview on Thursday for an internship as a .NET developer. The company isn't in the ""big 4"", and I wouldnt even say it's particularly large/well known. But, it'd be my first ever internship (I'm a sophomore) so I'm not being too picky.

The thing is, I applied to this internship on a whim through my school, and I didn't expect to land the interview in the first place. I don't have much experience with C# OR .NET (I literally don't even have .NET or C# listed on my resume...) 
I'm preparing for it just by going over things like data structures, some CTCI questions, and some stereotypical algorithms. As far as I know I will not be having an on-site interview as well, assuming the phone interview goes well.

My main question is: what kinds of questions do you think an engineer would typically ask a student applying for an internship that specifically deals with .NET? I don't really consider myself a .NET guru, so I'm kind of worried.

Thanks everyone."

I am an international student applying to Waterloo to study CS.

I have heard some amazing reviews on Waterloo's co-op, but Id like to get a more realistic picture.

How common is it for a student to get at least an internship at one of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Apple? Assuming the student has decent grades. Or are those only reserved for the top few? Meaning the rest will intern at a not so well known company?

My second question is with regards to obtaining a visa as an international graduate. Assuming I receive a visa to work in Canada, is it possible for me to land a gig over at USA? Or do I need to apply for another visa, and how successful are applicants at obtaining one?

I don't really have experience in front-end development, I always use basic bootstrap(or foundation) styles, nothing special.

My quest to make a good career is just a part of my plan to attain a happy life, and its very important. I have a few questions about things that I just dont know due to lack of experience, and I really need the response in order to take the best possible decisions. 

If something is hard to understand just ask please, I'm kinda rushing this post because I have to go but I need to get info asap.

This is a throwaway account since I want a fresh post history for anonimity, although as always I tried to choose an original nickname for it :p

My situation right now, omitting everything that doesnt really matter, is that I'm in my last year of college and doing an internship as a software developer (In which I actually develop software and do no grunt work! I really took care of that when choosing my company), when this internship ends in march, I will have 8 months of (part time) working experience. These guys offered that I stay with them for 6 more months after this through some university program that will pay my salary (which makes me think that if it wasnt for that program they would just drop me, but whatever, I dont want to work for them on the long run anyway), but I just checked and with that program I would work more hours and earn hourly *much less* than I do now, with a schedule that I dont like, but I can and will deal with that if it helps with my ultimate goal, but there are other companies that I can work for once this internship is over, but I figured that maybe if my resume states that I worked for a company for a while then got hired again then I would seem like a better candidate, **is that right?, or maybe it doesnt matter and its better to, for example, go for another internship in a bigger company?** because if its not the case then it doesnt matter. Also, how high is the risk of ruining my career by getting a small company of 10 employees mad? because right now if I reject to stay with them they dont have the time to hire anyone else, but thats because they told me about it when I was doing my exams and also getting info on emigrating so I didnt really look into it until a bit later (also because I assumed my boss was going to get information on the required paperwork himself, which I found later he expected from me instead), something else that complicates the situation is that I'm starting my college final project with them and if I go away in february we may not be able to end it, but I dont care about ending it by myself or starting another one at all, I only fear their potential bad references.

So you get some context, the place I live in is going through some shit and right now internships are all I can hope for (and I'm still attending college anyway), and my ultimate goal is to get a job somewhere else in europe afterwards, hence that need for a good resume.

Thank you, I think I forgot nothing but I may add info later or even rewrite the post."

Laptop comes with Vista pre-installed, but I put Windows 7 on it. Seems to run a bit better, but doesn't help much.

I'm kind of short on cash (grad school soon, won't make much during my internship), so I'd rather do a temporary fix rather than getting a new computer if possible. Suspecting that it's probably the processor, but maybe I'm missing something. Is there any way to fix this, or is my laptop done for?

Some basic info:

- I am a University student in the UK looking to move to Canada and hope to gain Canadian experience by doing 1 year of work in 2016 as an Intern (Paid) as part of my degree, Mechanical Engineering.
- I have British and Irish citizenship so I can apply for a visa with either of them. I am leaning towards applying with Irish because they have more visas and a smaller population.

I am looking for advice on how to approach this. I have emailed my University and thus far have not been particularly helpful. Probably because I am a year too early but I like to be prepared.

I hope anyone who has had any experience dealing with or has indeed done a placement year (Internship, whatever) in Canada would come forward and help.

I am happy to answer any further questions about information not covered above.

2tnx37,2,2015-01-25,Calc 1 in eight weeks.,dbu8554,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2tnx37/calc_1_in_eight_weeks/,"Alright so I am taking 8 week classes instead of 16 because I am way behind but this summer I'll be able to finally take calc 1 then I can start my engineering courses. The only problem  is instead of a 12 week class it's 8 week and I'm terrified of it.  Taking two precalculus classes now, wrapping up algebra then trig. Anyways is 8 weeks too fast to learn calc 1?

So after reading peoples replies here is the info on the class.

Mon-Fri 2 hours per day, I have total free time because I only work weekends. So you all think Calc 1 is do able in 8 weeks I am 31 and this time last year I could not do any algebra and did not know what an exponent was, I am starting Trig in 6 weeks YAY FOR ME!!!!


Anyways so I did have to take a ton of remedial classes no biggie, but Calc is what put me off from becoming an engineer for years because I did not think I could do it. Calc has me scared, like way scared.

I can take the 8 week Calc 1 class but then I can also follow up with an 4 week Calc 2 class all over summer.

It would be a huge boon to graduating not only on time, but it would leave the next three summers more open for internships and not having to catch up with math.

But I have seen so many people on this sub say Calc1/Calc 2 are super super hard. Except I live and breathe this shit man, I talked about engineering principals and idea's not long before I realized I wanted to be an engineer. Solving problems and math/science is the shit I have been dreaming off since I was a wee kid. 


So is Calc1 and Calc 2 doable over a summer? I worry with the fast paced math classes we usually do not have much in the the way of word problems, and those always fuck me up with the way they are worded as they are usually poorly worded (is that on purpose?) Anyways I am going to consider taking both over the summer. If I pass maybe ill buy myself a new car.

So 8 week Calc 1 + 4 week Calc 2 only those classes beast mode studying every day, do able?"

2torsb,5,2015-01-25,TIFU by getting 'white girl wasted' and getting kicked out of Justin Bieber's concert afterparty thanks to Cody Simpson.,nightjesus,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2torsb/tifu_by_getting_white_girl_wasted_and_getting/,"This happened in December 2013 but the memory only resurfaced it this morning and dear god did I cringe. 

So back a while, I was doing an internship in Sydney with a company that fit in with my degree at university (college) along with 40 other uni students. We were all living in a college accommodation and it was my Birthday weekend. You all know what follows. 

As a natural light weight, I was gone pretty quickly. As we were discussing which part of Sydney we should go to (we all came from different cities and states), one girl goes 'Oh, Justin Bieber's crew is going to this night club for their after party, let's go there!' 
Now, I am not a fan of Justin Bieber, but my drunk mind thought that was pretty awesome. I could get free alcohol and hang with A-listers. That's a way to spend your Birthday weekend in Sydney. So we head off. 
An hour into partying, the club starts cornering off a section of the club. This was it. I'm gonna meet Justin Bieber, get free alcohol and maybe a check for a million dollars and move to LA and live happily ever after. 
Oh boy was I wrong.

So all the cool people start coming in and here I was with my friends behind the velvet rope on the, I guess, 'peasant side' cause that's how they fucking treated us. As I was on the normal side, a nice girl did hand me free alcohol and was trying to find a way to get me in. However, the more alcohol that went in my body, the more stupid I became. I saw Justin's guitarist, Dan Canter (I was a fan when I was like 15 when he was just staring out don't judge me) and I was like 'holy shit Dan Canter!' And he told me to 'chill'. My friend backed me up and made fun of him. Probably a bad move. 

I then saw one of our crew had got in. I wasn't having any of that so over the rope I went. I was in. 

I went up to her and asked how she snuck in. My brain thought I was silent but I wasn't. She got kicked out two minutes later. My bad. But holy crap was I was having the best 5 minutes of my life. Until I met Cody fucking Simpson. This kid was 15. But at the time I was like, oh cool Cody Simpson that kid. I went up to him. Introduced myself and shook his hand. 1 minute later he got me thrown out. 

I was thrown out by a 15 year old at a over 18 night club. The dick. 
I some how got back into the night club (I'm not sure, I was really fucking wasted. They were giving out shots in the VIP) and got back in again. I talked to the girl I met before who was giving me alcohol and she told me to tell security that if I get kicked out again to let them know that I was with her and some creepy dude named 'Magician'. 

So I went to get a shot. Some background dancer yelled and told security that I wasn't in their party. I tried to find the girl but alas I was too late. I was thrown out and not allowed back in.

Now I'm someone from a small city that's 1,500km away from Sydney. I had no idea where I was and everyone else was inside the club still. So what's a terrified girl's natural response? Start crying and call my friends.
So I called my crew and they came out and decided to go home. I had pretty much ruined the night. Go me. 

When I woke up the next morning I had the biggest hangover and I realised I had thrown up in my bed and I had slept in my own vomit. It was disgusting. Not the best way to celebrate my 19th Birthday and now this night haunts me and makes me cringe. 

**TL;DR** Got really drunk, snuck into Justin Bieber's after party, 15 year old Cody Simpson got me thrown out. Now every time I see Cody Simpson on TV I cringe. 

PS: Fuck you Cody Simpson.

We have been exploring around while staying at a family friend's house. I just recently graduated from college and was going there to do some intern work that I acquired through this same family friend, but they came with to visit for a couple weeks, after which I'll stay and be working for a few months.

Yesterday, we flew from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, and have been staying in this nice hotel on the beach. This had all been very kindly paid for by the husband of a different friend of my mother's. Their (the friend and get husband) plan was to show us around the island state, getting us a dedicated taxi to drive us around, and have been even paying for our meals. The entire time my mother has been trying to get them to let us pay for at least some of this stuff, but they have simply smiled and nodded and then secretly paid for everything while we weren't looking, or paid in advance, etc. It's the obligatory Asian habit of hosting visitors all out of their own pocket, and denying any attempts to help pay their own way. This pisses me off personally for a variety of reasons, some which may come clear throughout this story, but I will refrain from speaking about that.

So last night I decide I want to go try and meet some people. I've been stuck with 50+ year olds and a 12 year old for a week and a half and I really needed to get out. By nature I'm a rather independent person and like to be by myself and so being dragged around, while nice to get introduced to the country and what not, was really draining for me and it was starting to affect my mood. I ask the husband about bars in the area and he tells me there are many just down the road and some downtown. I let my mother know I'm going out and I'm on my way, leaving at 10pm or so. I speak to the front desk attendant and he tells me not much will happening at the local bars, and that downtown would be the place to go. Waking down the road I see that he is correct and call a taxi.

On the way, the taxi driver picks up two Australian girls who are sisters who are going the same way. I start taking to them and end up linking up with the group they are meeting. This was nice, else I would have likely gotten a few beers and gone back home a little bit more poor. We end up hopping between a few bars, a night club, a karaoke bar and so on and have a great time. I end up not getting home until 5:30am.

This morning, my mother expresses surprise that I'm even capable of getting up for breakfast at 8:30am. We meet up with our hosts and we head out by the mentioned taxi at 10am. We tour around the island for a few hours and see some sights and have lunch and stuff. However I am starting to get confused because the plan kept getting changed on whether we were going to continue the whole day or just do a half day. We decide on a half day because my brother was feeling sick. I had been talking to the group from the night before and they were wondering if I might be interested in meeting them at the beach (they were staying at a hotel just down the road). I ask what was still planned for today because I wasn't sure if the times would work out. They say that we were still going to look around downtown first before heading back to the hotel. They ask what was up and I express my interest in meeting up with these people again.

This is where the husband starts getting offended, angry that I would rather spend time with these strangers than with them, after they had spent all this money hosting us and what not. I'm quick to try and clarify that I had not made any plans and was not trying to seem ungrateful, but the damage was already done and quite severe. I try apologizing and expressing my appreciation for everything he has done for my family and I, but he is having none of it. He starts yelling about how ungrateful I am, and disrespectful, and how I am an irresponsible child and treating him like a ""shit dog"". I'm at a loss and everything I try to apologize does nothing but make him yell more. Turns out he was mostly angry that I did not consult him about going downtown, about how incredibly unsafe it was, especially going out at 5 (which obviously was a misunderstanding), how as an American I'm especially prone to be targeted for kidnappings, death, etc. He angrily speaks about how he is responsible for my safety, etc.
We end up skipping the trip downtown despite my panicked attempts to explain that I was not suggesting any such thing. We get to the hotel and he quickly gets out of the taxi and tells me to go enjoy my time with my stranger friends and storms off. 

I'm pretty upset needless to say. My mother and the wife talk to me right afterwards, explaining how he is very paranoid about safety, that he was being rather harsh, etc, basically trying to defend his side while making me feel better. I finally manage to explain what I really meant and they are understanding, that I really should be very careful and that he just wants me to be safe. I'm expressing my frustration, how I'm not completely stupid. I absolutely understand the risks and where he is coming from, but on the other hand...I'm graduated from college, have a $60+k job waiting for me when I get back, I'm living on my own, and very importantly I already live in a neighborhood where muggings and attempted abductions are common, even gunshots going off outside my window and a stabbing a few blocks down. I'm upset that I'm being treated like a child, and that I should be made to feel guilty for going off on my own.

I even voice my frustration to my mother in private how I resent that I'm supposed to be mindful of other people's cultures, namely how Asians tend to be older before living on their own and so should understand his perspective on my youth, yet I do not receive respect for my independence stemming both from American culture and how I was personally raised. I say this with the disclaimer that I am of part Asian heritage myself, and am speaking from experience. Further, that our host was using the money argument to make me feel ungrateful for something we did not even ask for (that's not to say that I ever felt that way at all).

As the title says, I'm now eligible for dual citizenship. A few relatives of mine were already successful in getting their passports and I plan to start the proccess soon.
 
Right now i have no preference of countries. I'm looking for the place where i have the biggest chances of getting a job and I am seeking for the best work-life balance. I have no preference about climate neither although i've lived my whole life in a country with warm/hot climate (I think the lowest temperature i've ever experienced was -1ºC). I have no desire to own a car so a place with good public transportation would be preferable.
 
My reason for wanting out is more related to wanting a better life than to the novelty and adventure of travelling (although this sounds nice too). 
My current life is okay, I don't have big financial problems (living with my parents made this easier) nor health problems.
But i don't feel safe living here. I've been mugged a bunch of times, my house was already broken into, etc. And as it's known, my country has one of the highest homicide rates in the world...
Also i'm very disappointed knowing that most part of the tax-payer's money over here is completely wasted (too much corruption).
I believe that most social problems that Brazil has won't be addressed properly so soon, so I want out.

**Following the posting protocol**:

* 24 years old (turning 25 this year).
 
* Finishing Bachelor degree in Computer Science this year (it's not from a top university, but my uni is recognized by Germany according to [this](http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/institutionen.html) website).
 
* 1 and a half years of internship as a web developer.
 
* 3+ years of full time work (44h/week) as a web developer (mostly backend development) for a small company.
 Main technologies used: PHP, Oracle, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Zend Framework.

* Languages: 
Mother tongue of course is Brazilian Portuguese.

Acceptable English skills. Although i already understand most parts of movies and series without subtitles and read books completely in english I don't consider myself fluent because i've never lived in another country so i never had to rely on the language to get by.

Very basic Spanish and German (not nearly close to being able to hold a conversation).

I don't mind having to learn a new language, but getting it to a proper level takes a lot of time and practice so i guess my best options are places where i can rely on my english skills (at least in the job).
 
* Approximately 19k Euro with current BRL to EURO quotation (my lifetime savings so i need to make this work on my first try, i also could get some monetary help from my family but i prefer avoiding that =x). How long would this last?
 
* No criminal convictions

Before knowing about the eligibility Germany was my first option because i could try going for a Masters as a way of getting into the country (from what i read, there are many Masters courses taught in english and the courses are free/have low costs) or trying the job seeking visa path. Now with the citizenship i would be able to search for a job from day one so i guess i'll leave the studies for when i'm already established and can provide for myself.

I've been reading about the economy in EU countries and about their IT market but i'd love to hear from you if you have any experience/knowledge to share.

Thanks in advance for your attention and possible help! =]"
2tpv4c,4,2015-01-26,32yo married male being pursued by 16yo girl,expendable4000,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2tpv4c/32yo_married_male_being_pursued_by_16yo_girl/,"A bit of background - I'm 32, happily married, wife pregnant with second, work as sound tech for theatres/venues.

A few months ago I was working a gig I've worked several times before - a talent show for a number of local high schools. It's usually an easy gig - get in, get out, fast cash. This year was different though. I was assigned ""an intern"" - a 16yo girl with an interest in all things theatre. I was initially a bit dubious as she was very shy and I didn't know how to talk to her. After the first night we were getting on quite well and we even had a few in-jokes. The second night she was far more familiar and comfortable and that's how the week continued. By the end of the week she had a nickname for me, we jokes about the bad acts and she even bummed a few smokes off me when we snuck out the back for a cheeky smoke. On the last night, I told her to contact me if she ever needed a reference or any advice on getting into the industry.

The run ended and life went on. One night soon after, she sent me a friend request on FB and, like an idiot, I accepted. Under the child safety regulations I adhere to as part of my work, this broke the rules. I knew I shouldn't have but figured it wasn't that big a deal. Over the following weeks she started to comment a lot on my posts, ""liked"" old photos and even wrote on a particularly old one of me in my early 20's ""My god! you actually used to be kind of hot!"". Lots of smiley faces and winks etc... My wife even twigged it and started saying things like ""You'd want to keep an eye on that"" and ""be careful there"". We had a few interactions on FB and it was all pretty innocent.

Last month while working on another gig we bumped into each other again. She was working back stage and I was rigging the sound system. She ran over and gave me a great big hug. I hover-handed and stepped away after maybe 2 seconds. The problem was/is... I wanted to hug her back. I was starting to kind of like this girl. She was exactly the type of girl I would've gone for when I was younger - cute/hot rather than hot/hot, smart, funny with a dark sense of humour, sci-fi geek.

That evening there was an after party and I decided to go for a while but planned on making a quick exit early in the night. I got into a drinking round with some of my burlier colleagues and before I knew it, I was was pretty drunk. I was sitting chatting to one of my friends when someone came up behind me and hugged me. It was her. Her hair fell down over my face and was completely intoxicating. I caught a hold of myself and stood up to offer her my seat. She refused but stayed with me for nearly 2 hours talking about the first show we did together. Eventually the conversation moved on to guys and relationships - I must've said the phrase ""Well my wife..."" 20 or 30 times but she never really engaged with it. She told me how guys her age were all asshats and how she wished the guys she knew were more like me. She wasn't drinking and I had slowed down as I knew I was in a potentially disastrous situation. I played that last part down and told her that I wasn't so great. She went quite and just looked at me. I knew a sticky situation when I saw one so I made my excuses and said my goodbyes to my colleagues. She was outside smoking when I went to catch a cab. She hugged me again... and stupidly, I hugged her back. If I'm honest it was more of an embrace. We held each other too close and I'm pretty sure she lightly kissed chest. I sniffed her hair and gently squeezed her. After longer than was appropriate, I snapped myself out of it, said my goodbyes and walked off to catch a cab. She stood looking at me as I walked off. I was trembling and felt like some kind of monster. I went home, crawled into bed beside my pregnant wife and held her close. I felt as though I had betrayed her/us. I still feel terrible about it.

I woke up yesterday morning with another FB message - ""We should hang out again soon. I miss you! ;)"". I've decided to just phase out contact but what can I do? I'm terrified this will spiral. What should I do?

TL;DR - 16yo has a crush but is being full on about it. Could make life difficult."
2tq1dk,2,2015-01-26,Graduate Student - Full time work or internship?,sexyofficesupplies,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2tq1dk/graduate_student_full_time_work_or_internship/,"Hi Everyone,

I am a first year graduate student at a top 10 University and I'm hoping for some advice regarding current and future employment strategies.  Currently, Im contemplating between three options:

1. Full time student + summer associate internship.  The pros of this choice is that I will be able to focus on school 100% while applying my graduate level courses in the form of a summer internship.  I will also be able to become very active the student community and allow myself enough time to complete homework and extracurricular activities.
The cons are obviously financial based.  If I decide to pursue this route, I will be using student aid to pay for school and probably not have income during the year.  I am fortunate enough to be in a position where having no income is not a entirely out of the question.

2. Work full time + attend school full time.  The pros of this option is that I will be able to have income, health insurance, benefits and a generous education stipend where my entire graduate school will be paid off.  The cons of this choice is that I will be incredibly busy with FT work and FT school.  I think due to the difficulty of the program, I may not be able to perform as well and also not be able to be as active in extracurricular life.

3. FT job + study PT.  A combination of both 1 and 2, but the biggest con of this is that it may take 3+ years to graduate rather than finish in 1.5.  Ideally I wouldn't want to take too long to complete school.

Thank you everyone!"

I'm currently finishing my physics degree and I find data science jobs appealing. I'm wondering what would be the best course of action to be a good candidate for these jobs. 

I have the following related ""skillz"":

-Maths: Calculus, linear algebra, mathematical physics (some complex analysis, differential equations...) and some stats (mostly applied to thermal and statistical physics)

-Numerical analysis: I have seen somme stochastic models and numerical methods in computational physics and intro to algorithms classes.

-Prog: Python (scipy), C , C++, Matlab, Mathematica

I know there are tons of ressources online but I ask myself if a masters degree in CS with classes in machine learning and AI would be more valuable to an employer. 

I also am looking for an internship this summer and I am not sure what to look for in terms of what would be best for a data science career. 

Any of your advice are welcome!

I would like to know if anybody has any experiences in any of the work areas listed above.


A data technician here, is a 5 year long intern contract consisting of ~20% school / 80% work. 


In both places I'll be getting a ""tour"" of the different kind of areas I can work in, things like : Customer support (helpdesk), consulting technician, network guy, hardware specialist / software specialist.



I'm currently at a crossroad, the people at the consulting company seems to have an incredibly healthy relationship to their boss/CEO, people are happy and I know they get a bunch more in pay compared to other places; but you're required to work more intensively, there may be extra work during weekends which is nice for me as a single man wanting to work. The consulting company consists of 40-45 people, and they're expanding.


Then there's the ISP, you can imagine it being pretty huge, I have little idea of how the ""health"" of the organization is, the people I know who work there seems to be able to do the work they're assigned for, but they lack passion. I know the technical lead as he's been my neighbour for almost 7 years.


Have any of you worked/is working in either of these kind of companies? I could imagine a decent bunch of you working at a consulting company."

I only know C, C++ and java. I am currently learning Matlab, Verilog and assembly language is this semester (but I am total noob;first time using them).

I had always been a ""smart"" kid but coasted through school with a lackluster academic performance. I had not realized how severely depressed I had been when I graduated and have done little since then to move towards full employment. Anxiety, isolation, and continuing depression have been making things worse and worse for me. In that time I have only worked a few, small jobs and have tutored sporadically.  I really want to make some changes and move out of my parents house ASAP.  Sadly I don't know where to begin.

1. I haven't had a real-ish type of job since summer 2010 when I was an intern at a major defense contractor. At this point I have no idea how to explain the gap or cover this up on my resumé. I can't see this not coming up, so how would I handle this?
2. I am in the process of learning to code and brushing up/(re)learning statistics. I do not feel confident with these skills, yet. Should I advertise these on resumé as skills?
3. I really don't know how to find a job or network. Are there any particularly good resources out there to point me in the right direction? Is applying though Craigslist/Indeed/company websites effective? Is there any way to stand out when applying through these methods?
4. How do I manage my expectations? I really want to change my life quickly, but it is a tough job market and I am probably far from an ideal candidate. My goal is to obtain steady employment so I can try to make it on my own but I don't know if I should be pursuing internships or something else instead.
5. Is contacting people at larger companies and offering to work for free to get experience, skills, and knowledge a viable idea? Volunteering seems like it could be a stop gap but I am worried it might not help me develop relevant skill sets.
6. I am looking for some sort of technical work (ideally). Are there other things to consider as opposed to some general office job? I probably have taken lots of relevant coursework, but I have forgotten so much of that I don't really know how much I can say about these topics anymore.  Is it worthwhile to include them on my resumé regardless?

Hi do you find the job of your life? How did you know what you wanted to do before you started your career? Do you still like it and do it with passion?

I finished engineering studies, I'm master of science. I have about 3 years experience in IT team in consulting firm. Most of my work is programming and doing stuff with data. During my studies i thought that I like IT and programming, but after internship and work I think that programming (or at least coprorate-programming) is not for me, it kind of a triumph of form over content. That is the reason why now i have a lot of thoughts about changing career path, but it is really hard to decide or find something I'd like to do. On one hand, I'm kind of interested in business - I'd love to do some business/strategy consulting/wok, on the other hand I think that I sacrificed a lot of time for my studies and it could be worth to use IT knowledge - I was one of the top students, I learned very quickly. But when I'm looking for it jobs most of them are either it support (which is extremely boring), system/network administration or programming. Then I found out about IT security - can anyone say more about that? It seems interesting, but I'd like to hear an opinion from somebody who works in it - is is a nice job, how to start, what and where to learn?
Also other ideas that came to my mind - data science, r&amp;d, but I don't have much knowledge in those fields, since it is not really possible to find anything related in my country. But also one of my dreams is to work abroad - and i'm open to almost any direction.

Are there any other interesting IT related jobs? Or any jobs that require and use strong analytic thinking?"

My other option is an internship that pays significantly less with an opportunity to transfer to full time, with proper compensation after it is over. This is the overall direction I would like my career to go, working for a big company doing back-end development.

My question is: How easy is it to transfer from front-end to back-end development in a career? Will I be looked down on for coming in with a background in front-end? Will I have to move down in pay scale to transfer over? Should I take the money and opportunity now, or pay my dues for a little longer for something I would ultimately enjoy more?

Both degrees provide a one year internship so that is not a separating factor.

Ideally I would strive for a career (as most of my peers have accomplished) in Management Consulting, Financial Services or Commercial Real Estate, but despite having a Masters Degree, I feel like my lack of experience is proving detrimental.

Before you ask, yes, I have been applying to graduate schemes, as well as paid internships, and have been doing so for a while but no bites thus far. I am relying on help from my parents from abroad, and it's fast become unsustainable, and I'm becoming overwhelmed by guilt.

I hope you guys might be able to provide some insight, career guidance, whatever. Any help is greatly appreciated.

I never coded before college and haven't taken any super intensive classes yet, so my experience and projects are a bit lacking (connect 4 was an in class assignment and the sudoku solver was a ~10 hour project on my own). My biggest concern is the description of my projects, I want to make them longer so I can take out my relevant coursework section as advised. I don't really have much going on outside of classes so I'm really struggling to keep the space filled. I'd greatly appreciate any advice. "

I understand all the concepts in theory, but not the actual coding part. i can understand and read code, just not do it because i basically ""cheated"" my way through and now i really dont know how to practice those concepts... even though now im fully into school because of these internships that i feel im not up to par with.

2tt6ss,1,2015-01-27,"Broaden my horizons at a new company for less money, or take the pay bump and go with the same company for my final internship?",throwaway195815,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tt6ss/broaden_my_horizons_at_a_new_company_for_less/,"Hey all. I've got an interesting situation, and I'm not sure what the best choice to make is - hopefully some of you with more professional experience can give me some insight! I'm keeping this somewhat vague as I know some of my co-workers are Redditors, and I'm not sure if they browse this sub or not.

I have received an internship offer from company A (western US) a couple days ago - a two-year-old startup in a field I am passionate about, but their product isn't public-facing yet. The figure they named for my salary is more than I was making in my previous internship, but somewhat low in a high cost of living city, and would require me to defer my graduation by a year, as they want me to work for at least 12 months. The tech stack they're using is quite similar to the last company I worked at, but I may get some experience building a very new project from the ground up with a very small team. 12 months is also a huge commitment if it doesn't work out - if I quit my job, I'll fail the work term and it'll affect my GPA. I know it shouldn't be about the money, and I've tried not to let that be a major decision maker, but it does come in to play a bit given the duration of the potential term.  The real draw for me to this company is the opportunity to make connections in a field I'm passionate about, to move out of my hometown for a while, and to get another name on my resume for when I grad.

However, the company I worked at previously in my hometown - let's call them Company B - has expressed that they would love to hire me back, and are willing to significantly increase my pay (to a much higher salary than company A is offering.) I would only be working there for the summer, and could stay on track to graduating when I intended and then start looking for a full-time position - or stay on at company B full time - next summer. I'm not part of the target market for their product, but it's something I believe in and have no problems working with. They're a much more financially stable company that is maturing out of the 'startup' sphere, the team is great to work with, and I already know the system - I could jump in and become productive right away - but I would only be around for four months. Additionally, I'd be either living at home or rooming with friends, so I'd be leaving the job with money in the bank to pay for my last year of school and ideally stay out of debt as much as possible.

What would you do in my situation? Part of me wants to broaden my horizons a bit and get some experience boarding a new company early in its life, but another part of me wants to graduate and start working full time as soon as possible - and depending on how A and B are doing, it's possible I could reach out and explore opportunities at either post-grad. I also realize that there will be many more opportunities than what's available to me as an internship seeker, so the broadening of horizons might be something I should leave until after I graduate.

Thanks! "
2tt6x1,1,2015-01-27,Choosing the better degree for the future?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tt6x1/choosing_the_better_degree_for_the_future/,"I started to teach myself programming last year, but I figured there would be some things I simply couldn't get without the education, so I worked for a bit saved up money and now I can spend 4 years getting a Bachelors of science in CS.

I have to choose between three programs and I would really be interested in what everyones opinions. I'm not asking you guys to choose for me, as I have to do that myself..but I realize there are many people in the working field here, a few project managers even etc that I could benefit hearing their opinions.

Option 1:

Option 2:

Option 3:
http://www.sfu.ca/surrey/programs/software-systems.html

I did some looking into the last option, because it has a weird name to me. I found out that SFU used to offer a software engineering degree, but because of some reasons (unknown to me), they wanted to take out some of the more pure 'engineering' requirements and make it more compact in the 'software' side of things (but I did see there exists still courses like making a compiler and other similar CS things).

Option 2 is a bit weird, you get a 'Bachelors of Engineering' in just 2 years of studying the same things as the regular computing science majors in their first 2 years, but in China. Then you finish your degree back in Burnaby. All 3 have the ability of joining co-op (which I will sign up for in addition to searching for jobs by myself).

If you were in my shoes and wanted to pick between these three, what would you do (assuming you also had the knowledge of what interviewers like to see).  I know the whole 'it doesn't matter, do internships co-ops open source projects blah blah', but that doesn't really help me right now.  Thanks very much guys"
2ttdzk,1,2015-01-27,"""Diversity"" Internships. What are your opinions?",jack612blue,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2ttdzk/diversity_internships_what_are_your_opinions/,"I notice some of the internships offered through my school prioritize minorities, underrepresented groups (females, LGBT),etc...

What are your guys view on these types of internships? I mean they're not just some office jobs, these are prestigious national organizations and companies.

There are two viewpoints:

1. White
2. Minorties/Underrepresented/LGBT

And I can see the pros/cons from each perspective. The following below are in itself stereotypes, but there are some truth to them.

1. White- If you're white, chances are you come from a middle-class background. You've had family members go through college, and thus have networks of educated family members and mentors. You don't need an ""advantage""

2. Everybody else- Generally you're in the middle class category, but many are also in lower class. Your immediate and extended family is probably from the more recent generation( 1st,2nd gen americans). Your family may not have members with college degrees, thus no network/mentorship (at least in the higher education sense). And thus you need some boost/advantage to catch up on the playing field.


Is that the general consensus as to why diversity requirements exist?"

2tu6p1,0,2015-01-27,Computer Science degree: Waste of time?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2tu6p1/computer_science_degree_waste_of_time/,"Hello,

this is my first reddit post, seeking for some advice. As the title might indicate I am currently studying computer science. I finished the Bachelor last year and doing my master right now. I was always interested in programming and computer games, but not only playing them rather understanding the science behind it, especially the stuff about computer graphics. I have recently (a year ago) decided that I really would like to work on game engines or other interesting projects regarding computer graphics/visualization of data.

Of course I am aware that you need some decent programming skills and experience with bigger projects before you start working on a big project like a game engine. Therefore I always tried to improve my skills somehow while studying and recently applied for an internship at some bigger companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Google. Although having an GPA of 1.4 (1.0 is the best one possible in our country whereas 4.0 is the worst), being awarded with one of the best scholarships in my country, winning the first price in a state competition with a project in computer vision and working on some smaller hobby projects I was not considered by any of the companies except Google. The first interview at Google was kind of those worst case scenarios. Let me put it this way: Agreed with the recruiter to be interviewed in C the interviewer nevertheless decided to interview me in Java. Not having touched this language since two years lead to confusion, asking a lot of questions and not finishing the task in time.

Now I have the feeling that studying and especially trying to get good grades was kind of a waste of time if you want to start working in my mentioned areas of interest. Most of the stuff I learned, I could have learned way faster by myself without wasting time to prepare for a particular exam (but this doesn't grant me a nice sheet of paper which tells me I am a ""Master of computer science""). Maybe I shouldn't have tried to get good grades but instead take the time to work on a big project?

At the moment I am just following my old path, getting good grades because I have no time to start working on a bigger project since only one year is left until I finish my master. In the meanwhile I am reading books and programming a little bit to improve my programming skills as far as I have time besides my studies.
What I fear the most after graduating is ending up in a company where I have to work on a boring project especially with people with low ambitions who are not striving for improvements but only for a secure salary. I have seen enough of those people (ca. 90% of the students) at several universities. They are not studying out of curiosity, passion or to improve their skills but rather to get a high paycheck at the end of the month. I'd rather sit at home and teach myself new things than doing such a job. Same goes for doing an internship where I don't learn much just for the sake of filling my vita.
But how am I supposed to get a decent and interesting job where I don't stagnate, when I am not even considered for an internship by most of the companies?

This is basically my current situation and the way I think about this whole system. Working my butt off over the years hasn't brought me closer to my goal so far. I fear that neither will it bring me closer to it in the future. So I am kind of stuck right now and not 100% sure of what to do next after graduation.

I moved to london for over a year again looking for media work but because of money I had to take a job in retail (at one of the most famous stores in the world, a store that caters to the super rich) unfortunately because of the expense of living down there, the low pay and the amount of hours I was working I wasn't able to do internships in the media so it never turned into anything.

I quit went home to the north but was unemployed for over a year (depression, plus no jobs in my area and for a long time it was up in the air if I was going to move house or not).

We eventually did move and I got a temporary contract in a super market for the christmas period, was let go then a few months later got another job in retail where I've been ever since.

I'm 28 years old, I hate retail and their not promoting me, not that I'd really want to be.

I want to get out but the problem is everything I apply for I feel like I'm not qualified to do, like I'm looking at an office job description and they want at least 12 months experience.

And even then I don't actually want that job, its just it doesn't seem as  bad as retail and it pays more."

As with a lot of people I am trying to determine which of the many IT paths I want to head down. I need some guidance where to focus my energy.

My Background:

I took 4 years of AP Computer Science in High School specializing Java application development. I also took AP Calc and AP Stats.

I had a 1 year internship doing Xbox Live Indie Game Development in C#, which I decided wasn’t my forte

I fell in and out of Android application development, nothing serious published however.

I’m good with hardware: rebuilt desktops, laptops, cell phones/tablets, etc just as a hobby

I worked at Sprint troubleshooting mobile devices for a year and loved it, however the retail/sales aspect ultimately led me to look for other work.

I have now been Level 1 IT Admin for a large engineering company for about a year doing ADUC/Exchange administration and Desktop Support, among other things. Not long into this job I got a little bored and created some batch files to help automate some of the tasks we perform. I then got together with some co-workers and designed a new Call Monitoring desktop application in C# that ended up getting rolled out to all of IT. I am now currently working with our SysAdmins to develop a script for the group policy to automate SCCM health troubleshooting.

At this point I’m a little lost on where to go now. I love coding, however I don’t think I could honestly do it day in and day out. My main skills are problem solving, learning quickly, optimizing tasks, and customer service. With hours spent researching I’ve narrowed down possible interests in Systems Administration, Software QA and Automation, or a roll communicating between clients and developers on mobile app development.

My questions are:

Are there any other careers that you may recommend based on my skillset and background?

Are there any good transition jobs I should look at to jump toward these positions? I ask this because all of the QA and SysAdmin jobs I’ve looked at required a degree or 100 years of experience.

Are there any specific certs I should do to boost my knowledge and resume?

Thanks

2tvdb5,0,2015-01-27,I have 12 months to transform myself into an MBB internship candidate. where do I begin?,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/2tvdb5/i_have_12_months_to_transform_myself_into_an_mbb/,"Some quick bullet point background info on me:

* Economics undergraduate at University College Dublin (Ireland, QS ranking #139)

* Half way through my 2nd year of a 4 year degree (including 1 year exchange next year, probably to University of Toronto)

* GPA of 4.0 (in the Irish system; 4.2 = A+, 4.0 = A, 3.8 = A- etc)

* Some good extracurriculars from my secondary (high) school. Eg student council president during my final 3 years, part of a student peer mentor programme, selected for a volunteering trip to Ghana which raised €79k etc etc. I also have a great reference from my schools VP describing me as 'outstanding'. The school that I attended is also one of the most prestigious in the country, although my exam results from this time are painfully mediocre

* Very little in the way of extracurriculars over the last 18 months. I haven't been out partying etc, but my interests are so varied and difficult to quantify on a resume. I have a deep interest in all things related to fitness, wellness, health, etc (nutrition, strength and conditioning, posture, mobility, meditation, mindfulness, yoga, human movement, 'biohacking' etc etc) but, as I said, I have no formal education in these things, nor any 'qualifications' to include in my resume.

To cut a very long story short, I was a gifted kid who didn't apply himself in school, f***ed up my LC (SAT equivalent), got into an undergraduate programme that I felt was beneath my ability, and decided that I wouldn't let myself down again. Thanks to my first year exam results, I've been able to transfer from that programme to a slightly improved one, but still feel like I let myself down. Fast forward to now, and my ambitions keep growing as I achieve more of my goals.   

  

I've known for a long time that I was never going to live in Ireland once I got out of college, but I've been reluctant to accept the reality that if I want to improve my lot and live the lifestyle that I expect to live, then I can't go on ticking the same boxes that everyone else around me is ticking, because their aspirations aren't the same as mine.  



SO, to get to the point... rather than apply for an internship now at a big 4 with my mediocre resume, I have decided to take an extra year to go on exchange to a university abroad(one with a little more prestige than UCD), while also taking this time to build my resume and acquire relevant skills and experience. I have decided to aim for MBB straight out of college (hopefully through a summer internship programme in the summer of 2016, although only McKinsey have offices in Dublin, and I can't afford to pay rent in London with an unpaid internship), and if I fall short, well then I'll work a while in a big 4, try to make it into a solid masters programme, and then try again at MBB during the masters recruitment process. 



What I'm asking for here is information on what MBB and other major consulting firms are really looking for on a resume. I'm confident that I have the level of intrinsic ability needed to succeed as a consultant, but I need to bag an interview/internship if I'm ever going to get there. Anything related to the profession of consulting itself, or just particular extracurriculars which appeal to recruiters, as they show qualities of leadership/analytical ability/any other relevant skills for a consultant. My university doesn't have a case study club, but if there's one at U of T, I'll definitely get involved.



The way I see it, I have the following time periods to build up my skills, resume, knowledge etc:

**Feb 2015-May 2015:**
Remainder of the current college year. I have lectures/exams from now until May, so really I feel like this is a time to make plans and build a foundation for the next period, while fitting in as many extracurriculars/reading as possible. I could also look for a summer internship with big 4 during this time. Do you think this is worthwhile?

**June 2015-Aug 2015:**
Summer period. I had been playing with the idea of a summer work visa to the USA or Canada, but considering the fact that I'll hopefully be going to college in Canada in the next period, I'm open to any suggestions as to how I should spend this summer. My dream Summer would be an internship in a US office of an MBB, but again, need rent money..


**Sept 2015-May 2016:**
Exchange year. I have a choice of some really great universities, listed [here](http://www.ucd.ie/international/going-abroad-with-ucd/exchanges/where-can-i-go/)

(College of Arts &amp; Celtic Studies and Human Sciences//School of Economics from the dropdown menus)

NOTE: UCAL applications closed before Christmas, when I wasn't even considering this exchange :(

I am mainly looking at University of Toronto, but if any of you can see anywhere else on the list that is more of a 'target' school, then I'd be happy to consider other options. I should note that this year has no effect on my GPA and my results are simply pass/fail.

I will also need to arrange an internship in roughly Jan-Feb of this period, so effectively this is my deadline to raise myself up to MBB standard.

**June 2016-Aug 2016:**
Internship Summer. Hopefully at McKinsey or similar, but either way I'll continue to build on my skills and hope to attract an offer during my final year at UCD.

**Sept 2016-May 2017:**
Final year at UCD. More of same. Building skills, making contacts, looking for that lucky break.




**TLDR:** Looking for ways to beef up my resume over the next 12 months so that I can bag a job at MBB and live happily ever after. Also looking for recommendation on the best university to do an exchange at from the list [here](http://www.ucd.ie/international/going-abroad-with-ucd/exchanges/where-can-i-go/)

NOTE: UCAL application deadline has passed :(

I'm currently a jr. linux sysadmin with about 2-3 years experience, and have only coded for college cs and internships, so I'm a fairly weak dev.

I have a choice between an academic institution where I could grow more into more of a full-fledged sysadmin role with a mentor, and an industry position with a an established and rapidly growing startup, where I'd be working more on development in Flask, R, and mysql. The industry role is a much more hands-off role in an environment, and unfortunately it is pretty badly siloed (IT there is tiered and doesn't mesh well between their own departments, let alone an unexperienced dev in an entirely different sector of the company.)

I am currently interested with security and IoT, so a role that lets me work with SaltStack and keeps me up to date with current security practices is personally more appealing, but I want to make an informed decision of what I'd be missing."

Hi all, fresh CS graduate here from Southern California and I feel like I'm stuck in a bind of panic and paranoia regarding the next step of my career.

I have been working an IT internship at my current company for 9 months and have worked a few internships since my sophomore year of college. Last week I was offered a full-time position at my current company, but for a technician/glorified helpdesk/pseudo-junior-sysadmin position for $32k/year.

The offer certainly isn't great, but I saw this coming and have been sending out applications since I graduated. Currently, I'm in the middle of interviewing with a company in hopes of landing a junior developer/software engineering position as I know that, even if I get lowballed, I'll be making significantly more money working in a field that I enjoy.

The problem that I'm facing now is that I need to give an answer to my current company by Thursday evening, and I don't know if it would be a good or bad idea to commit to this full-time job, only to quit anywhere from a few weeks to a few months later.

While I've been here for 9 months as an intern, I'm afraid that accepting the full-time position and then promptly quitting a month or two later for a better-paying job in my preferred field will reflect badly on me, despite having just graduated in December and having the ability to line up a new job while I'm currently working. Unfortunately, after talking to a variety of friends and family for advice, I'm getting mixed messages and I'm frustrated and undecided throughout this whole ordeal.

Am I over-worrying here?

I responded by saying upfront that PHP isn't exactly my strongest language, but I'm willing to go through the interview process.

The more I spoke to them the more I started to actually like the company more and they seemed to like me as well. I got an email earlier today saying they'd like me to go on to a final interview with the CEO (it's a small company). Included in that email, from the recruiter, was that:

&gt; Other candidates they are considering with your level of experience are looking at $50k - $60k...so hopefully this is within your range.

My level of experience includes two internships at large companies, one in big data and one in web dev, and about five years of front-end web.

I immediately called the recruiter up for the first time instead of emailing and said that I was a little surprised at the range and the response was along the lines of ""well, you're a new grad,"" because I graduated in December, which just irked me a little. I explained that I didn't really do all that work while in school to start at that range and reminded the recruiter about the initial message I received with the initial compensation range. 

I'll still follow through with the interview tomorrow, but I'm now much, *much* less interested in the company. Advice?

**TL; DR:** Told a position would pay $70-90k. After two phone screenings, an on-site interview and a take-home programming assessment, seems like they're looking to offer around $50-60k."

Plus a 2 TB HDD and a 120gb SSD. 

Oh yeah, 16gb 1866mHz ram

Before anyone suggests intel CPU, I might be working at AMD soon as an intern for the CPU team so I really think I should stick with an AMD cpu, even though I know Intel is better, especially at single core performance. I plan on dual booting Linux Mint and Windows 8, linux for programming and windows for gaming.

Anyone see any problems with the build?"

I'm writing you from my last semester in grad school for CS. Perhaps I'm doing this early as I've not yet crossed the finish line, but it so happens that the deadline for applying to a University for the next semester happens in April, and maybe my story  will motivate someone to take the leap.

My story: My background is in the film industry. My undergrad degree is in film production. I worked there for over 10 years before accepting that it wasn't for me. But I always loved trying to make little programs, even back in the days before stack overflow when there was no help to be found for the self-directed. So in my 30s I decided to go back to school and get a Masters in CS. Best decision of my life. Even having to go through a highly compressed undergrad program to get there, I've loved every minute. But I would never have made it without the structured environment of a University. Had I tried to do this through online learning, I would have failed long ago. But now, I'm 36, in my last semester at school, and with an internship developing game AI. You know you made a good decision when your student internship pays more than any job you had before. I've done all this while having a wife, a toddler (with another now on the way), through heart surgery, all kinds of obstacles.  My point is: if my dumb ass can do this, anyone can. Especially you. You can do this.

I see lots of people here trying to learn fast, learn online, do it quick and dirty so you can get out there and get a job. Nothing wrong with that. People need programmers, it's good money, and the sooner you get there, the better. But consider really going for it and getting a Master's degree or even a PhD. Why learn a language when you can be language-independent? Why not give yourself the edge for the best development jobs? More importantly, why be a coder when you can be a computer scientist? Sure, the world needs hackers, but what the world really needs is smart, disciplined software architects who can help build the future and do it right. Be that person. Go for it. It will be the best thing you've ever done for yourself.

tl;dr - If you skipped to here, this post might not be for you. Or maybe it was especially for you. You decide."

Just a little background about me: Aerospace Engineering senior, graduating in May. I have four years of AFROTC under my belt, with tons of leadership training and experience in the cadet wing. I was on track to commission but they offered to let me walk away from my 5-year contract without paying back any of the money I would ordinarily have to owe (they paid my tuition, books, fees, and a monthly stipend), due to US military's attempt at reduction of force. I took the opportunity because ""hey, I'm engineering! A job will be easy to find!"" Or so I thought. I had one research internship at the university doing systems design for a space-bound modular robotic system that lasted eight months before I called it quits. Now I work at a nightlife startup company as an operations officer, and I also do afterschool enrichment teaching basic engineering to children at schools around my city, both completely unrelated to aerospace or engineering in general. Anyway. Enough about that.

 I have been applying for literally HUNDREDS of jobs since the start of the Fall 2014 semester, and I feel hopeless at this point. During our university's career fair in fall, I met with some great companies like Lockheed, Honeywell, Raytheon, Textron, Orbital etc. I spoke with countless people, and landed a few interviews with Textron and Raytheon, but otherwise it was pretty much the usual ""oh, apply online and we'll take a copy of your resume and put it in the fucking pile of hundreds of other students."" The interviews went well, but I never heard back from them. Not even a courtesy notification. Since then, I haven't received one call back from any of the applications I have submitted. I feel like I have everything they're looking for... experience, communication skills, leadership potential, and a high GPA (3.85). Yet every day or so I get an email saying ""We're sorry, we went with someone else."" I have a massive Excel spreadsheet with aerospace companies large and small, and I have applied to each one with no results. I have had my resume reviewed by industry recruiters and I get positive feedback on it every time. No luck, still.

As you can tell, I'm pretty bitter about this. With the spring career fair coming up, I'm feeling more and more hopeless that this will be a repeat of Fall. What am I doing wrong?

It was a fascinating experience that I was able to learn a lot from, but unfortunately most of my time was spent learning all the ins and outs of business software design and practices in order to complete the projects I was assigned. This kind of code was much different (and larger!) than anything I had previously worked on for school or personal projects.

I will be returning to the same company as an intern again this summer and I wanted to get back into the swing of things by working on projects similar to what I experienced there. Unfortunately I don't exactly have the time, money, or expertise required to create something on that scale.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could practice developing for enterprise software? I'm currently reading Martin Fowler's *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture* but reading just doesn't seem like it will be enough. 

In case it helps, here is a list of technologies that I worked with last summer and expect to use again:

* Java
* Ext JS
* Spring Framework
* A Database (IBM DB2, but I think it would be easier to use something like MySQL for learning purposes)
* Git (I've got a firm grasp on this I believe)
* JUnit (I definitely need practice with unit testing in general)

I am currently an intern at a residential treatment facility as a Psychology student. While on the job I realized how terrible their computers were and have since moved my role from Psychology related jobs to being their full time IT.

I have helped them upgrade machines, set up a shared partition for documents, set up their networked printer, and turned some ten year old desktops into Ubuntu 14.4 LTS machines for the residents to use and filtered the webpages with OpenDNS. 

My next goal for this placement is to move the shares folders off of an administrator's work desktop onto a dedicated server, and set up a firewall for the Ubuntu machines to have a more robust filter than OpenDNS's free options, and block downloads of mp3s via a squid proxy probably through pfSense. 

However, I have no training in any of this stuff, I don't even have a comp sci minor. This is all out of my hobbyist nature and well practiced  Google-fu. I would like to set that server up, but they do not have any funding for a project like that and I'm not sure a dual core 4gb RAM desktop they have in a closet would be suitable for that. 

For what it's worth, I'm only looking to firewall 3 machines and the files I would be sharing would be less than 5gb. Any advice or a direction to another subreddit would be wonderful!"

So weird situation, but first my background. I'm still a student, but I've been programming enterprise applications (and enterprise mobile applications) for 3 years now, full time. My current job, I was hired full time, and the deal was that this company wanted to eventually join the modern era with support for HTML5 on their site, and a mobile app for their enterprise customers. I was hired on with the expectation that when the time was right I would do that, but at first I would be working with their classic ASP.NET code and just learning the ins and outs of their software as it currently stands. Basically I did tech support fixing bugs and stuff in their old software, with the promise that eventually I'd be helping them get into the 21st century and modern.

Well the company is approaching that time, and the support work for the old application has died down as a lot of bugs have been fixed. We are, as a company, getting started on making our new program Evergreen and getting some new modern features slowly built out. Except I'm not doing any of that. They still have me just doing support for the one or two tickets that come in a week.

Now they are starting to micromanage the entire company and they want to know down to the minute of how much any project has been worked on. That's not too big of an issue, but basically I see hundreds of new tickets being created to make new things and develop the modern application, and not one of them has been assigned to me. On top of that they are questioning how in the world I'm able to work 40 hours a week but still go to school. The answer is I have class 4 hours a week, and homework isn't that long either, so its easy to manage.

Anyways, then they started getting new servers with new hardware and software, a month ago. They just told me about it and it took about 3 days to get access so I could start setting up my dev environment on it. On top of that we are getting new customer support systems, new git repository hubs, new IDE licenses, and I'm always the last to know because either I'm not in the emails or no one is telling me on the company calls.

It is getting frustrating, but it also feels like they just want me to quit rather than fire me. Though, I haven't ever been late with a project, and I'm actually the cheapest engineer they have. I have no idea why they would want to get rid of me but really it feels like they just want to do without me.

My largest concern is that if they do either force me out or fire me, I won't have a place to work and school is expensive and I could lose my apartment. I've been looking for jobs (I'm in the Salt Lake City, UT area) to see if there are any I qualify for, but the only ones I see are unpaid internships. There are a few jobs I believe I could do but they all want a degree, but I'm still working on mine.

How can I resolve these issues with my current company, or where should I be looking for new work?

Thanks everyone :/"
2u0axr,0,2015-01-28,23F Canada -&gt; UK: How I got out,ironyinabucket,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/2u0axr/23f_canada_uk_how_i_got_out/,"I initially got to the UK (London specifically) with a Tier 4: General student visa, having applied to complete my M.Sc at a school there. The process was fairly simple and straightforward; there are lots of students applying for student visas everywhere so getting help is fairly easy. I'm not going to go into detail about the process or my requirements because really the university told me everything I needed and what to do. If you're looking to go to postsecondary education abroad ask the universities you want to go to about it, they know a lot more than I will. Being on a student visa made it pretty easy for me to arrange having a bank account and accommodation; both for while I was a student and upon my return to the country (should my new visa not be issued it'll be a bit of a pain ending leases and cancelling bills and things though - it was a risk I took).

I was issued a student visa that began September 2013 and ended January 2015. My program was from September 2013 until September 2014, with the option to extend if you took on a summer internship (which I did). During the time between my internship and my departure before my visa expired I worked on my dissertation and applied for jobs. In the end I got a contract for 3 months at the company I did my internship for, on the condition I got a visa of course (this was potentially easier because it's a start up with only 4 employees . . .).

Upon returning to Canada earlier this year I applied for the Ancestry Visa as my grandfather (my father's father) was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The process wasn't as straightforward as the student visa, although it required less documents and money. I followed the instructions from [this page](https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa/overview) as well as some advice from forums and reddit.

The list of documents I included were:

* My long-form birth certificate
* My father's long-form birth certificate
* My grandfather's long-form birth certificate
* My parent's marriage certificate
* My grandparent's marriage certificate
* A bank statement showing I had £2000 in my UK bank account
* My provisional offer of employment
* A copy of my CV
* My letter stating my National Insurance Number - a number required for employment in the UK, although only attainable once you're in the UK. You can start work without it. 
* My lease agreement
* 2 UK sized passport photos
* My current passport
* A certified copy of my previous passport, which was retained by passport Canada because it was damaged
* My previous passport before this one, expired

I sent originals of everything except the bank statement (it was printed from my online account), the provisional offer of employment (it was printed from my email), and my grandparent's marriage certificates (it's an old document, I didn't want it damaged). The birth certificates were obtained from the Ontario government (mine and my father's) and the Scottish government (my grandfather's), all of which I ordered online and I can speak about further upon request. I chose to prove that I had employment and £2000 that was not a requirement, but because the Tier 5 visa requires £2000 and I knew it'd look better to already have work.

The application form for the ancestry visa is available online. I filled it in and went for my biometrics appointment 2 days later. The VFS office was worse than the Worldbridge office I went to for my Tier 4, and the staff was much less knowledgeable and less professional. It took a while for them to get through all my documents and I left feeling really nervous and confused, but my fingerprints had been taken and my photo had been taken, and my documents were in a package to be processed in New York.

Two days after (Friday of last week) this appointment I received an email saying my application had been opened and processing times were currently at 5 days. Today I got another email stating my visa had been issued and my documents should be shipped within 2 days, and they included a tracking number. Turnaround was a week plus 2 days after I filled out the online application, a week after I went for my biometrics appointment.
Sorry for the wall of text, I can answer more questions if you have any to the best of my ability. To be honest I feel like this came a little too easily for me, but there are not a lot of recent forum posts about Ancestry visa requirements so this might be a good resource for other people, maybe.

Now they have expressed interest in having me work in office this summer, and I was wondering how much I should ask for.

Company B: Mid-size startup in SF, $6000/month, ~$1000/month to be used towards housing, plus usual tech company perks. I would have to find housing here as I'm on the East Coast - 1k will certainly NOT cut it, and it is quite competitive to find housing.

My questions:

1. Anyone that has interned in SF, how did you find housing? Has anyone tried something like extended stay hotels?

2. Company A asked me something along the lines if I had any questions or problems about my offer...I feel bad asking for more money since they are such a small startup and a great team. Should I tell them about Company B's offer, and how should I ask this without sounding greedy or unappreciative?

I was able to come up with a solution, however I feel that I did not articulate my thought process enough to the interviewer. This was somewhat confirmed when today I found out that they would not be taking me for the internship.

How do I get better at describing what I'm thinking during an interview? For example, I needed time to think about my solution and thus I did not talk during these periods and sometimes coded without explaining. This lead to times where there as an awkward silence as I simply needed time to think rather than talk. Does this mean I'm not well versed enough in the content? Or does this sort of thing come with more interviewing experience?"

For as long as I've known him, he's been talking about how his life is shit and how nothing works out for him: ""everything's fucking pointless cause this, everything's fucking pointless cause that"". I can't talk sense into him at all. I never was able to my entire life, but he would always say things like ""when I leave this world, I hope you remember me."" I thought this fucker was joking, but I can tell he's not and he's getting serious about it. I'm fucking infuriated because I feel powerless. I feel like a veteran psychologist can't change his mind, and he blocks out everything I say. He says that I'm being selfish because I want him to ""keep on suffering,"" but this fucker doesn't see it the other way. He doesn't see it that I want him alive. And I tell him that, but he doesn't acknowledge it in any way. He just acts like I'm saying it so I can make him suffer more. Fuck no, I think he's a great person. Sure he's a bit quirky, but that doesn't mean he's some low-life that he always claims to be.

This guy fell in love with a girl in college. He claims that he's tried everything to break his ""weaboo"", ""beta"" stigma by working out, drinking, stop watching anime, etc. From the looks of what he's told me, he gone out on a date with her at least once. Apparently, it didn't work out and he's thinking about ending his life. He claims there's more to it, and I'm sure there is, but how many fucking things can go so wrong in your life that you have to kill yourself.

This guy got an intern to Microsoft and he's looking to intern also at Weebly. He's fucking good at what he does, so it's not even like he's going to have a shit future.

I think his parents divorced long ago and I don't think they give him much attention. I'm sure this must have had huge impact on the way he thinks about things, but people around the world have this kind of shit going on all the time. They grow up, they get out of that shit hole. I don't think he's even trying. I think he's so stuck on one belief that he's not going to listen.

I don't fucking know what the fuck is going on and I'm shaking because I'm pissed as fuck, but I need to do something for him before he seriously kills himself."

This summer will be my transition from undergraduate to official grad student and i am looking for an internship. 

I have taken the following courses:

-Signals and Systems (Basics of analog signals, fourrier transforms, and filters)
-Basic analog and digital circuits (very basic two courses on designing circuits)
-Semiconductor Physics (two quarters of undergraduate, one graduate course)
-Nanostructure Devices

Of course I have also done plenty of physics classes: Analytical mechanics, Quantum mechanics, Statistical mechanics &amp; Thermodynamics, LOTS of electricity and magnetism (3 courses covering everything from maxells to relativistic effects), particle physics, a condensed matter course..

I am also a CS minor and have taken Data Structures, Networks, Machine Learning, Computer Architecture, Assembly, and  Theory of Computation.

Even with all this I can't find an internship. I don't have as much Electrical Engineer knowledge as the actual engineers (I don't know jack-squat about designing advanced circuits or ICs), and I don't have as much software ability as the actual computer science engineers.

I also lack big company experience, the only company i have ever interned for isn't even on the internet yet because they are super duper small start up and want to stay private for a bit.

I am a pretty smart and quick learning individual, i just can't ever get an interview because no one wants to give me a chance at an internship. I have applied to KeySight, Maxim ICs, Intel, HP, Linear Technology Corp and so far all i have gotten is rejection.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

I am trying to learn circuit design on my own right now before taking some other classes next quarter on it. I love building circuits that do cool things but is more of a hobby for my workbench but i also love firmware and microprocessors and digital signal processing, i really enjoy all aspects of ECE, but my real passion is in the theoretical.

I decided to switch my major to computer science, even though our program isn't very big, and from what I hear from everyone, not very good either. I've only taken the first intro class where I learned Python. 

I have plenty of past work and internship experience....but none relating to coding. I have a lease that goes through the summer too, so staying in DC would be preferable for the summer. I've applied for a few comp sci related internships, but I don't feel like I'm qualified enough to actually get any of those internships at the moment.

So I have a few questions I'd like to hear suggestions to:

1. Should I just major in something my school is actually known for like business or international relations, and just minor in comp sci?

2. For the summer should I just intern at some place my qualifications currently fit with just for the sake of getting any type of job experience, take summer classes (which are very expensive at my private school and there's no financial aid available for the summer), or just bootcamp self teach myself over the summer using sites like codeacademy and coursera while working to make rent.

3. Should I just try to transfer to a different school?

Here's a link to my resume. Maybe there's anything there I can use to get any sort of compsci related internship that maybe I don't see.

Just curious to get everyone's opinion. I have been trying to learn how to program for about a year now and have used a number of the different online learning outlets. I started in a 12 week course in Ruby on Rails at a place called Betamore (in Baltimore, MD).

I currently got a job as a QA Intern with OrderUp and soon should be moving into a Jr Programmer role. I have been moving more into Android development as well as that is a need within the company.

Anyway... I have used the likes of TreeHouse and Code School at first. Then recently have tried out Udemy for Android courses, as well as Lynda at the moment for another intro to programming course.

I find myself constantly moving from resource to resource. I also find myself constantly ""starting over"" in a way by doing the same ""Intro"" courses but from different resources. I both like and dislike this method. I like it because it constantly has me cementing the foundations of everything but I dislike it because I feel like I can never get off this ""intro"" plateau I seem to have myself stuck on.

So my question is... Does anyone really recommend one online school over another? And if so why? 

Like I said, I started in Ruby on Rails (very much a noob) but have since started migrating towards Android development.

Look forward to reading everyone's take on the subject! Thanks so much in advance!"

I have decent experience. I've actually done one unpaid internship in high school as I lived with a cousin who was basically running the startup and it was good experience at the time. I also have a lot of projects and when I posted my resume here on another account, a lot of people were surprised that I was only a sophomore and said I should be getting good offers.

I have sent out maybe 80 applications so far. I have been contacted by a few good startups and actually interviewed with Venmo and Fog Creek but did not progress past the technical interviews. I also had an introduction interview with MongoDB with someone in HR for basically 5 minutes and for whatever reason they decided not to continue past that. I was kind of confused as it went fine, maybe they just didn't know I was a sophomore. 

Anyway, I am applying to only NYC companies as through a family friend, I have been offered an amazing apartment for the summer for free in an awesome area and I was told a few friends could live there too. So my two best friends from high school are also looking for internships and we could have a very memorable summer in NYC. 

I just had a second interview with a smaller ecommerce company located in NYC and it sounded great. It's basically a team of two developers and they're looking for two interns for the summer. Basically they will be building a new product from the ground up and the team will have free reign over the project. It will be built in Python which I have been falling in love with. I really liked the guy I interviewed with who was the senior engineer and his description of the culture seemed positive.

The only caveat is that they cannot offer me any kind of compensation and want me to respond in about a week. I currently do not have any other offers, and the only companies I have interviewed with have not progressed past the technical interview. 

What do I do? Should I try to negotiate pay? I am considering it as it would be nice for the resume and it actually seems like I'll learn a lot. It's also confirmation that I would be able to have a great summer in NYC with my friends. If I am working for free, maybe I should explain that I won't be working 40 hours a week and I wont be rolling in at 8. What do you think? It's nice to have an offer but I want to really think this out so I would really appreciate any input."

2u51u8,1,2015-01-29,"Enterprise Rent-a-Car rented me a car without insurance, even though I told them my provider wasn't going to cover the rental.",seekingcaradvice,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2u51u8/enterprise_rentacar_rented_me_a_car_without/,"So, I’m a 20-year-old college student studying “abroad” in California for the time being (originally from NY). I rented a car so I could drive to my internship. My college has a deal with Enterprise where students between 18 and 20 can rent a car. A month ago, before I came to California, I found out my home insurance provider wouldn’t cover me in California. As a result, I needed Enterprise’s insurance coverage.

My dad, who is paying for the rental (my internship is unpaid), instructed me to ask for 3 price quotes when I got to Enterprise. I asked the man behind the counter – let’s call him Dave – for the following: a quote for a car without insurance for the entire duration of my stay (a little under 4 months), and quote for a car with insurance for a month, and a quote for a car with insurance for the entire duration of my stay. The reason I asked for all three was because we were considering having me rent a car for a few days while my dad shipped a car from home out to me.

When Dave told me that the quote for the entire duration of my stay, with collision and liability coverage on enterprise’s behalf, would be around $2800 (I can’t remember the exact price), my dad was pleased with this price (I called him from the store to verify) and I went ahead with the rental. I was instructed to sign a contract in a bunch of places, including 2 boxes that, unbeknownst to me, meant I was signing not to have collision or liability coverage. However, when talking with Dave, I told him that I did not have coverage from my home insurance and, according to two of my friends who were with me at the time, asked him: “this does include insurance, right?”

However, being 20 and new to this sort of thing (and admittedly stupid for not reading carefully), I assumed that what they were having me do was the right thing and I signed the contract without reading it much.

So then, yesterday, I very stupidly hit my boss’s car when trying to park next to it. Not my smoothest move, but she’s understanding about it. There was minor damage to her car (a scratch or two and some scuffing on the rear driver’s side bumper). There was more damage to my rental; a few scratches that covered both passenger-side doors and a dent to one of the doors. I exchanged insurance info with my boss and later that day, drove the rental to Enterprise. Dave was there, and asked if I had contacted my insurance provider. I told him I was using Enterprise’s insurance. That’s when the contract was brought out, and he said his “understanding” was that I was not using Enterprise’s insurance, even though I told him I needed it. He showed me where I signed that I would not be using their insurance on the contract (two very small boxes that I initialed).

So all this time, I was renting a car without Enterprise’s insurance, and without my own insurance, which means that I was illegally driving with no insurance. I’m super lucky that nothing worse happened and that there was no police report filed, but also very angry. I am now liable for the damages to this rental car (which will probably be between $1000 and $2000) and my father is very unhappy, understandably. He spoke on the phone with Dave for about 10 minutes, with Dave giving him quotes for a rental with insurance – turns out those quotes were much higher than what I was told, to the point where we cannot afford to rent a car. I returned the rental to Dave and made it clear that I was very unhappy (I was uncontrollably sobbing on the phone with my dad in front of him and other employees/customers. Not my finest moment).

Now I’m without a car and relying on other students for rides. That’s fine, but I’m so upset over the horrible customer service and misunderstanding that is costing my family so much money, and I feel very manipulated and like I was taken advantage of for my lack of experience and familiarity. I know I'm an idiot for not reading the contract more carefully and have certainly learned my lesson there, but I am wondering what the legal implications are of Enterprise willingly renting a car to me without insurance when I had provided them with the knowledge that I did not have my own insurance covering the car.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Details and riddle inside!",[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/2u5iis/24m_belgian_lf_advice_about_travel_and_work_in/,"Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this. The riddle is at the bottom. I'll edit the post to look more organised and I may add more specific info or questions when needed.


I am a **24yo male from Belgium** and I want out. Without going into too many details, I've felt this way for the last few years and through circumstances haven’t been able to make the necessary steps.  
**Here’s my plan for the near future: Find full-time work in Belgium to save up for a few months OR find work abroad. -&gt; Travel around Asia until money starts running low -&gt; Find or return to work abroad.** 


Recently I’ve found the resolve to set myself a **goal** – I want to get out before summer and do one of two things:


1)	Find work in Asia (specifically China, Japan, SEA or Korea. Not entirely limited to these countries)


2)	Go travel / “Vagabonding” around Asia, starting in China.


**Some questions I have right off the bat:**


1)	Where/how do I effectively look for a job abroad? I’ve been searching online for a few weeks and have had very limited success finding actual jobs that are somewhat interesting AND paid. Most opportunities seem to be related to teaching English and I’m not from a native country unfortunately.


2)	What are the main differences between recruitment in the EU and Asia? Anything I should be aware of? (Better not to mention X, but be sure to mention Y)


3)	How do I determine the legitimacy of potential work? For interesting ads I usually could not find any reviews or detailed information. While I can usually determine from the ad and a possible interview how the work experience will be here in Belgium, I can imagine it’ll be different.


4)	I recently found a very interesting opportunity about teaching snowboarding in Japan, which came with an instructor-course and internship. Does anyone have any experience with the Educating Adventures organization? I’m a bit wary about the fact that I’ll have to spend money on the course and I’ve been promised a job opportunity afterwards before. 


5)	…


Here follows some background information:
Currently, my situation in Belgium could be much better. **Employment is unstable** and I have **limited funds**, although prospects of getting temporary full-time employment in the near future are looking decent right now. When it comes to work though, I’d definitely choose working abroad.


I could definitely use some advice / help concerning work in Asia. It’s definitely important to note that, apart from finishing school out of necessity, I have **no other formal degrees**. One of the more important reasons why I didn't pursue further education is because I have very little compatibility with modern day education. 


Here’s a list of some of my talents, skills and abilities:

I possess a healthy interest in - and like most Belgians a natural affinity to - foreign languages. 


English &amp; Dutch: Excellent


French: Decent


German: Basic


Japanese: Very basic


I'm enthusiastic and interested in learning new skills and won’t shy away from theoretical knowledge either. 

I have completed several courses in various subjects: Shiatsu massage, the relation between cooking and health + a good understanding of cooking in general, First-aid (no international degree), life-guard (no degree), self-defence…



**These last few years I’ve worked in various different sectors from waste-management and event organizing to forest maintenance and kitchen staff.** This has allowed me to have a broad development, in stead of a very narrow one.


When it comes to work, **I’m interested in the following sectors:**


1)	(Eastern) Culture related


2)	Bio/environment/flora &amp; fauna related


3)	Exercise related


4)	While I don’t mind the occasional office work, I do prioritize opportunities that involve at least some physical work.


5)	Anything unique, organic and vibrant – work that makes me feel alive!


6)...


Riddle me this:


*A part of a bird*


*That is not in the sky*


*That can swim in the ocean*


*And always stay dry.*


Tl;dr: It’s a bird

2u5p5u,718,2015-01-29,The intern from Hell - Pt.2: Some falling out,shelbon22,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2u5p5u/the_intern_from_hell_pt2_some_falling_out/,"[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2u41wh/the_intern_from_hell_the_interview_and_first_day/) [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2u7n9p/the_intern_from_hell_pt3_key_conundrum/) [Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2u8763/the_intern_from_hell_pt4_and_now_for_the/)

It's important to know that about a month before we interviewed intern from hell, we had found out that the client, whose site we were at, had decided to not renew their contract with the large IT company I was employed by. We had known for a long time that the 10 year contract would be ending that coming March but we had no idea they weren't going to renew the contract until it happened. I'm guessing LIC decided to hire the intern just help clean things up for LIC to exit smoothly from their support contract.

Several managers had been laid off the in the months prior and only the leads at our various sites across the country and the upper management for the contract stayed around. This is also partly why we basically had no way of dealing with our IFH.

Shortly after we hired IHF, we lost some more management and the guy in charge of the contract decided to make grey-tech the new tech services manager for all sites. So that basically means now at my site it's me, tele-tech, and IFH since grey-tech is now upper management. This was a site of 700 people across 8 building being supported by two techs and an intern who refused to do any work.

Since the second day of work, IFH came to work in a pantsuit, I guess better but it was still really nice clothing and needed her to crawl under desks and move computer and printers. Needless to say, it didn't work out so well. Since I was not technically her boss and I saw how well it went the last time someone suggested she dress appropriately, I went to the highest manager I knew and told him about her.

Now, at this point upper management did not care one lick about what was going at my location, they were trying to get things ironed out before the contract was up so I had to be picky about the issues I addressed with them. But someone from management called her and said she needed to wear appropriate attire. Cool. So that was now solved... sort of.

The issue here was now she new the name of one of the high-up account managers and she was clever, this girl, I'll give her that. This will come back to hurt later on but at least one problem is out of the way.

This particular day, I had just finished imaging a pallet of new computers we got in and had them setup on our ""outgoing"" bench before I left so IFH could deploy them in the morning. Tele and I discussed ways to keep her busy so she and I could keep doing our jobs without having to babysit her too much, this was one of those ways.

So she shows up 15 minutes early as usual. You may think this is a good thing but we purposefully did not give her keys to anything, all she had was a badge to get into and out of the building so she would get there 15 minutes early everyday and wait in the break room so she could get paid that little extra even though she wasn't working. This was brought up to management and HR since she was lying on her timesheet but no one seemed to care so I let it go. Anyway, she's there waiting for me to unlock the door to our IT area...

&gt; Me: good morning, IFH! Got some new machines that need to be deployed. Each one has the ticket printed out and taped to it so you can see where it goes for which end user. All you need to do is a direct swap, everything has already been; just in case they ask about data or programs.


We walk in and she looks at row of computers it was around 12-15, easily enough to keep her busy most of the day.

&gt; IFH: You want me to deliver all of those?

She says incredulously and with a hint of disdain.

&gt; Me: Yes but don't worry, it's not super urgent. Just take your time and make sure it's all done properly.

&gt; IFH: sigh... okay I guess I'll get started.

And I'm guessing that for her, get started means sit down at her computer and check yahoo news. Whatever, I've got my own shit to do, I just want her out of my hair while I do it. And I honestly didn't care if it took her 1 day or 3.

later on, tele-tech sees her not doing any work and only a few machines had been taken off the bench. So instead of arguing with her...

&gt; teletech: I'm going over to hangar___ to install some new wireless access points. They're all ready except for needing the antennas screwed on, mind helping me?

&gt; IFH: okay sure, what do I have to do?

&gt; tele-tech: each of these access points needs 6 of these antenna screwed in. (there were about 8 access points so only 48 antenna total) I'm going do some more work in our phone system but I'll just be at my desk so let me know when you're finished.

I'm in the next room, doing inventory stuff but all the doors are open so I can hear all that's going on in there. About 30 minutes later I start hearing some banging sounds and then this:

&gt; tele-tech: What have you been doing this whole time!?

&gt; IFH: Just screwing in the antennas like you asked me to. AM I doing it wrong?

&gt; tele-tech: You've only done two and half access points... IN 30 MINUTES!!

Needles to say, tele was pretty angry and I found out later on she had just been sitting there on the floor with a box of cisco hardware and just texting on her phone.

&gt; IFH: You said to let you know when I was finished, you never said how quickly you needed me to do it. And you made me sit on the floor the whole time and now my legs and butt are sore!!

At this point, I don't really remember much of what was said because it turned into a yelling match and that ended poorly. I was told by tele-tech the next day that she would no longer be dealing with IFH as IFH had turned her into HR for harassment. Apparently HR had a really thorough discussion about it and said that disciplinary action would be taken if another complaint was filed so yeah... IFH won that round.

Not even a month later tele-tech left for a new job. She and I had already been offered jobs doing the same thing with the new IT company (NIC) for when they officially took over support but she didn't want to stick around long enough to see if IFH was going to follow us.

About a month after that, grey-tech left as well leaving me completely alone with IFH and only two managers for the entire account, one of whom was so high up, I had never actually spoken with him until that point in time. 

Stay tuned for part three...."

Some companies might still be open for internships.

That said, here is my resume: ...

I have changed the name on the top in an attempt to show as much of the resume as possible.

There are a couple of things here:

1. I'm currently at a community college. I'm finishing my final semester and I'm enrolled in a degree where, as soon as I finish the classes in this college, I will transfer to a UMass campus and enroll to finish the final 2 years of Bachelors in Computer Science. I specifically wrote that under the ""Education"" section, but I'd love advice on whether not that's a good idea.

2. I built this resume by using advice from here as well as guidelines from elsewhere. So it may not be perfect, so if you need to rip it apart, please go ahead and do it. If possible, just please let me know how I could improve the said area too.

3. I have done a lot more personal projects out of fun. I tried building an operating system with a simple boot loader and GUI once. I built a sidebar for Windows that contained links to settings and programs that I needed the most. It would always be docked to the side of the screen. But adding all this will likely make it more than 1 page, which you guys have been discouraging.

I had a resume before this, which was multiple pages. I applied with it and got rejected from everywhere. I then came here and asked this sub to review my resume. I received amazing advice. Someone went as far as editing my resume and pinpointing where I was going wrong and then creating a resume template for me. I have used all the valuable advice given to me and produced this.

So please, if you see anything wrong, even the little-est thing, please let me know. As I said, it help a lot if you let me know how to improve in the area that you review.

Thanks,
Much appreciated!"

It was mostly a great experience, certainly better than I expected after reading here for the past year or so. Unfortunately, one of my first calls was from an infamous user.

We'll call her Sandy.

&gt; internthrowaway (IT): IT Service Desk, this is internthrowaway.

&gt; Sandy (S): Hi, I'm having some trouble printing a PDF.

&gt; IT: What sort of problem are you having? Is it giving you an error message, or is it not printing correctly?

Great. One of my first calls and it's already something about a printer.

&gt; S: The alignment isn't right. Can you remote into my computer?

&gt; IT: Ok. Can I get your IP Address please?

&gt; S: It's X.X.X.X.

&gt; IT: Just one moment please. Ok, it seems there's an issue with your computer, and we're currently unable to connect to it.

&gt; S: What do you mean you can't access my computer? What are you doing working in IT if you can't do this? Do you even know anything about computers? I demand to speak to your manager.

After 10 minutes and some smooth talking on my team leaders part, the issue was finally resolved. Turns out she was trying to print a PDF that had been made from a print out of an email that mostly consisted of a picture (probably a scan) of another form, and was wondering why it wasn't taking up the page right. He worked some zoom magic and managed to get it working. (I won't go so far as to say he made her happy.)

It later turned out that nearly everyone on the service desk had had a bad call with this user at some point, and the team leader was the only person she would ever actually listen to.

3 months, 500+ password resets, and thankfully no more calls from Sandy (for me, anyway) later, and I am happy to say that I'll probably never have to talk to her again."

A little background: 
I'm a student and got hired by my university last semester to be an intern for the Multimedia Support (MMS) division of our IT Services. Basically my division takes care of all computers/projectors/video walls/cameras/and the lovely (/s) program that is $Tegrity in all classrooms and meeting spaces. All of these computers are networked into our office on the IT floor so we can see everything going on at any time. (that last point is the topic of this story)

The story:
I came in to work a little late the other day (15min) and my boss punished me by having me go swap out some computers on the other side of campus. Luckily, the main transportation on my campus is golf carts. Fast, gas-powered, pick-up styled golf carts. I throw the towers and monitors in the back and head on over.

Once I get to the building I run into a Campus Police (**$DPS**) Officer I know from an old job and joke about me stealing the computers in the back of the cart. He laughs and says no and after some chit-chat I carry the PC's up to the rooms I'm swapping out.

I go up to the room, unlock the computer cabinet, and do the job I've done for months now and everything is going fine. I unplug the power, A/V, and Ethernet cables from the old PC and start to plug in the new one when I hear heavy boots running down the hall. Lots of heavy boots. All of a sudden the door to the room bursts open and what seems like half the **$DPS** force comes running in the room. Remember when I said all the A/V computer systems are linked to our office? Well they're also linked to the command center of the **$DPS**, which I forgot about. So while I was unplugging all kinds of stuff from the back, little sirens were going off in the **$DPS** HQ and they called all available units to go see what's going on.

I look up from a pathetic, cross-legged position on the ground to see a bunch of cops starting to circle me asking what the hell I think I'm doing. At the end of the crowd of men in blue was my friend I mentioned earlier.

&gt; **$friend**: ""Shiiiiiiiiiiiit, **$UsernameAT**, I thought you were kidding when you were talking about stealing computers!"" and he bursts out laughing.

It takes about 10 minutes of him and I explaining and proving that I work for ITS and I'm just swapping them out which eventually lead to calling my boss. Luckily he's an awesome guy and said I'm fine. So not only is he giving me crap about coming in a little late, I'm also never going to hear the end of this... Great.


I have some other ones from working in MMS, especially stories about the golf carts. Let me know if you want more!"

My school has this wonderful program named SSJP (Student Success Jobs Program) which is affiliated with Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital. Apparently the program is incredibly difficult to get into with a narrow 4/100 students being accepted (just my school's statistics; 90 students in the program total out of every school in Boston.) but somehow I was admitted almost effortlessly. An essay and 3 minute interview later and I have a paid internship at BWH.

I wasn't even the slightest bit nervous first day of work in Central Transport. I had hoped for a desk job like all the other students but instead got a position where I easily and tediously push patients from one hospital building to another. I asked for a change but they refused, my boss saying ""What are you complaining about? You have one of the best jobs in the program and only have to work 10 hours a week."". I pushed through the next couple of days in the hospital (quite literally) but then began calling out every day up until today. I told them it was for things like Science Fair, Counseling, and made-up afterschool meetings with my teachers and they suspiciously understood.

I've already spoke with my boss about quitting but instead she reduced my required hours per week down to 7. While this change helps, all I really want to do is stop working in a job which I hate so I can actually start making the lies about meeting with my teachers afterschool truth. I want my grades to be the best they can be. There are three classes out of 7 where my grade fell below a C- and I have to face the decision of working; which would give me a nice resume for the future and a potential $1000 scholarship in two years, some SAT tutoring for free, and some Math and Chemistry tutoring now, (which is pretty unnecessary) (and some obvious dough earned by working.) or quitting; Which would let me feel happier, allow me to actually experience my youth, and get better grades -not only in the upcoming 3rd semester that's just 5 days away, but the rest of high-school.- 

I would love some advice on what I prioritize first,
(As much as I hate to separate these two categories:)
Work or School-Life?

I've tried juggling both but well ... I can't juggle even if my life counted on it, and at this point it kind of does.

Growing up, I was horribly enslaved to a religion, otherwise known as Jehovah's Witnesses.

The cult, which likes to hide behind its awkwardly different name, is actually pretty terrible.

Most people know them as the weirdos that don't celebrate holidays, not even their own birthdays.

What they don't realize is that, as a JW, you technically aren't supposed to ""associate"" with worldly people. Worldly being anyone who is not a baptized (or trying to become baptized) member.

You can be acquaintances with them, though even this is a ruse as they just want to appear friendly enough so that the person won't be turned off by the religion. 

Bottom line, if the person has no interest in converting, you aren't supposed to hang out with them. It's like a really fucked up pyramid scheme.

Because of this, I lived a *very* sheltered life during crucial social development years (ages 6 to 12). This has turned me into the antisocial abomination I am today.

The cognitive dissonance in this religion is extreme, to say the least. They forbid their members to Google any information on the ~~religion~~ cult that isn't published by the ""Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society""... which is the headquarters of the church. This is because of the many gaping plotholes that exist in their failed prophecies and teachings. 

If you question their teachings, or give any inkling you think they might be wrong, or not God's word, you risk being marked as ~~sane~~ an ""Apostate"". You are then considered a threat to the flock, and promptly disfellowshipped. *(Parents will literally cut off their own children for apostasy. Literally will not speak to them or help them in any way. The only loophole to this is if the child was never baptized, they cannot technically be disfellowhipped, and therefore cannot be shunned. This is the only reason my mother still talks to me, as I was never baptized.)*

The ironic part about all this is that they don't exactly lie to you, they just spin the facts the same way an abusive husband would to his battered wife.

For example *""Do not Google us, for you will read Satan's (untrue) words and it may shake your faith. Do you really want to ruin your faith and risk sacrificing your chance at everlasting life???""*

They're admitting what you might find will make you lose your belief in the religion, yet somehow they pawn it off as mystical satanic voodoo and scare people away from doing it.

It's ironic that you can rape and kill, and be forgiven, but the one unforgivable sin is ""apostasy"".... basically questioning the religion.

They even go as far as saying *""it is prophesied that we will be persecuted""* and use this as justification for someone like me posting about how crazy the religion is.

That's pretty much the equivalent of an abusive husband telling his wife *""Hey, when you go outside today they are going to see the bruises on your face and call me abusive. I am foretelling this!""*

And then when it actually happens, the wife is dumb enough to believe that he is God and foretold it, and thus her cognitive dissonance builds.


Anyway, the people of the religion are for the most part good, they're just all trapped in the same hell. Many of them secretly doubt the faith (like North Koreans) but fear speaking out because of the harsh ""apostasy"" rules.

The best part is, when I was 12 I once told my mom *""Boy, it sure is good that I was born in the truth, because if I wasn't I don't think I would be able to be converted based on our logic.""*

At the time I genuinely was glad I was born in. I literally thought that I was going to live forever in a paradise Earth, and was grateful that I was born in versus having to be convinced, because I was a very skeptical person by nature. I knew that if my eternal life depended on someone winning me over with their arguments, I was doomed.

By the time I was 15, I was not following the religion how I should. I appeared to be, but was secretly fapping like crazy and attempting to fornicate with girls left and right. Deep down I still believed in it all, and felt horribly guilty for being a normal horny boy.

Around this same time, an elder (JW speak for deacon/pastor whatever) in our congregation befriended me and became a mentor. He had me intern at his mortgage company he owned and even paid me minimum wage. I made all kinds of business connections, and it even paved the way for me starting a little software business at 16. I was very grateful to him.

As I grew older, I started to doubt the religion more and more. By 17 I was living with an unbelieving relative, and thus was under no pressure to attend the ""meetings"" (JW speak for church).

As I faded out, my only friends (because I wasn't allowed to have worldly ones) began to shun me. They felt that based on my low meeting attendance I was a bad person, and thus bad association. I might influence them to fornicate or something.

At 18 I had no real friends, all the JW ones had left me and I didn't have any wordly ones because I was internet schooled and wasn't allowed to have any growing up. Sure I met people at work, but my social skills were all kinds of fucked up so it was really hard to make new friends.

I will forever credit Sid Meier for saving my life, because soon after my 19th birthday I began playing Civilization IV. About halfway through the game, I zoomed out and noticed all the different religious symbols on the map. I saw how they pushed on eachother, how they started wars with eachother because *rawr my cross is better than your yingyang rawr* and I just realized how silly it must look to a God, if there is one.

It was in that moment that I had an epiphany, and began to research the forbidden ""apostate"" materials I wasn't allowed to before. 

I remember being crouched over my computer at work, instinctively as if a JW was watching me. As I researched more and more on the ""forbidden websites"" about the JW's, I realized there was no bombshell, no red herring.

I literally learned almost no new information, they just spelled out everything I was taught matter of factly, and in such a way I realized it was all bullshit.

The best way I could describe it was they took the comma out of the sentences. Suddenly ""I'm ready to eat, Grandma"" became ""I'm ready to eat Grandma"" and I was horrified.

The JW's had tons of failed prophecies dating back to the 19th century. Every time something they foretold would fail, they would gaslight their members into thinking it was never a prophecy. To this day, you will be told you are crazy if you try to bring them a book from 1906 saying the world was ending in 1914. They will literally tell you, despite it saying ""copyright Watchtower Bible and Tract Society"" that it is a forgery, and you are an apostate for even entertaining such an idea.

It was really earth shattering to go from believing I would live on a paradise earth forever to realizing I just spent 1/4 of the only life I had squandering it. 

The best way I can describe realizing your sudden mortality would be an 18 year old being informed that the average human only lives to the age of 25... and all this time they had been planning their great, wonderful long life.

That's pretty much how it feels. It's like being diagnosed with a terminal illness that everyone else in the world already has, except they accepted their fate long ago and it hits you like a ton of bricks.

Fast forward to my early 20s. I have no friends and a crappy job. My little software business had failed and I was in community college. I felt my life was going nowhere. I decided to try to re-connect with the mortgage guy mentor I had when I was younger. He was super smart, owned a company with over 50 people. Surely he would see the logic in what I found, and together we could save the world from this cult.

I called him up and told him what I had found. To my surprise, he listened and seemed sympathetic. He even offered to meet me at a local Panera to discuss my research. He seemed genuinely interested in getting to the bottom of this.

Little did I know, he was the equivalent of the FBI agent in the movies giving the encouraging ""uh huh, go on"" while motioning for his partner to activate the line trace.

I showed up to the Panera, only to find him flanked by another member of the congregation leadership (another elder). I knew there was trouble.

I sat down at the small table and both of them pulled out bibles. About three scriptures in, I just got up and left. It was hopeless, and honestly I felt more betrayed that he ""set me up"" for an ambush than if he had just told me off over the phone.

Years later I tried reasoning with my crazy mom, who is also still a devout JW. After a 6 hour phone conversation with her, I finally thought I was getting somewhere. I had dropped logic bomb after logic bomb, and she was starting to crack. I was finally starting to think that after all these years I might have a normal mom under all that crazy.

She started to fight back tears and basically told me in so many words that ""without the religion she had nothing to live for"". 

I pretty much realized that by telling her the truth about the truth, that I was tearing open the very wounds this ""religion"" sealed in her before I was even born. 

She was a broken person, and this cult was the only reason she didn't abort me (which she often brings up), and is the only reason she is still alive today.

I broke off any discussion of philosophy or reason. It was then I realized she was not my mother, but a patchwork of blind faith and a mental corpse. My real mother was long dead, a victim of whatever horror she faced early on in her life.

It was like a really fucked up Star Wars, to finally confront the most evil thing in the Universe only to find out it's the very reason you exist.

I was not sure how to feel that night, and to be honest I'm still not.



TLDR: Grew up in a crazy cult, tried to save the two people that ever cared about me out of it, only to find out the cult is the only reason I exist.

EDIT: I am 27 now, both of these events happened a while ago. While I am doing fairly well economically, these experiences have permanently scarred my ability to make *real* friends or having meaningful relationships with women. I truly believe this religion is abusive and indoctrinating children into it is wrong.

Edit 2: For those of you saying ""I was a witness too and it wasn't that bad"" you either had parents who weren't that devout and let you have worldly friends or you were in a congregation with lots of kids your age. If you're in a congregation with few other kids, you're socially fucked.

Also if your family has money or your parents have a leadership position you will be treated much better and some things will be overlooked. If you are someone who lived a broken life (or the kid of someone broken) people will silently judge you and it's a lot harder to fit in there and make friends.

Edit 3: I clearly struck a nerve with some poor guilt ridden soul. All my comments, even in other completely unrelated subs and topics received a mysterious single downvote.

In any case I hope my message will stay with you and that you will eventually see the (lack of light) and get out before you squander the only life you have.

Edit 4: To the guy saying he's met tens of thousands of witnesses and they're all happy.

Plot twist, he's Jesus and met the 144000.

No but in all seriousness, he's referring to the international conventions they have where they sit in a shitty football stadium while some old fossil on a podium spouts as many commas in a sentence as he can, and everyone applauds after each pause like it's Lord ~~Helix~~ Jehovah himself speaking.

Apparently drinking kool-aid next to a bunch of strangers you barely know counts as having met tens of thousands of witnesses.

With that logic every time I go to a football game I've met hundreds of thousands of people.

Though the reason he thinks this way is the cult is constantly pushing this sense of a worldwide ""family"" as a way to comfort you over the fact you have no ""wordly"" friends. If you consider a bunch of people on a flaming bus together that's hurtling off a cliff as friends, then yes they are your best pals.

2u9noi,3,2015-01-30,Internship vs. startup,pr0cedural,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2u9noi/internship_vs_startup/,"For background, I am a sophomore at a liberal arts college on the east coast. I landed an internship at a recognized and well-established company last summer (solely due to a connection, for which I am very grateful), and that company has offered me another internship for this coming summer. 

However, I am currently developing an app for a startup consisting of myself, a friend, and a few other college students. We are hoping to receive VC funding this spring. This poses an issue: if I go for the second internship (or an internship with any other company, for that matter), I will very likely have to sign paperwork that makes my IP property of the hiring company. 

Suppose the startup I'm working for does get funding, enough that I can be salaried at the same amount said company would offer me. Would it be a better idea (w/ respect to my career as a developer, and possibly a project manager at some point) to take the internship or continue with the startup? If there is not a decisive answer, what factors should I take into consideration, and how heavily should I weigh each of them?"

2uacbw,1,2015-01-31,TIFU,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2uacbw/tifu/,"Although this happened awhile back, I decided to post this. It's a long read with some non key parts taken out to make sure no one can link it back. One important thing to note is that I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which manifested itself as paranoia, moody, childish and impulsive. Only 20 people at my school know this, and of the 20, only 5 of them are students. Not even my girlfriend knows.

**Backstory**
Back in my freshman year of college, I secured my first job at a cafeteria that was the most social spot on campus. Working there was meh; the business wasn't organized to the best of its ability however the workers made up for the job. I never was a great employee at first, because I knew management promoted on mainly favoritism and not work ethic and skill. I studied abroad and came back, working in a retail store which changed my perspective on work ethic and responsibility to your job. 

Coming back, I got my old job back and was promoted to supervise the area I was in, which was a step to becoming student manager. Some people were unhappy about my promotion, because I was a hard worker but liked to encourage a strict but fun environment (free range of music regardless of regulations, let workers go home early and gave them full hours if the work was fully completed and they helped the other areas close down, etc.). I was nice to everyone until they started being rude or lazy(the other supervisors ran things differently which often came up during supervisor meetings where debate would become fierce). When it came to me working with new people, I would have them work solo in a particular station to test their skills to see where they needed improvement and jump in to handle stuff when things backed up and give them pointers and tips so they could grow. I also had the rule of ""If you want to listen to your music, you must earn the right to by learning how to work each station."" And I do admit, my music is a mix up jpop, kpop, alternative, jrock and anything that I find catchy. I had mixed reviews, and stuck up for my coworkers even if they talked about me behind my back. I wasn't perfect. 

I had a thing for student government so I ran and was elected to become an elected official in my 3rd year. Since I worked and ran under the motto of ""Doing things because it made sense and was right for the student population--No Bullshit more party"" I personally began taking a less involved role in my cafeteria job, working as a supervisor, and focusing more on my elected term(I was paid for both, and could only work a max combination of 18 hours total). During my term I made a lot of enemies by publicly calling people out on their favoritism (such as granting an organization over thirty five grand for an event that had 100 people, mainly their friends and not much anyone in the campus), bullying, and doing things not for the sake of the students, but to practice politics and use students as a stepping stone to get their foot in the door in the world of politics. I know that is politics but I honestly hated this. I was known as the unpredictable master of bureaucracy because I learned all the rules to give me more time when people shot down my ideas because it didn't help their political career and I told them in public and in private that I wouldn't be a tool to do so. 

Eventually, I caught the eyes of the student government president in which I was appointed as a chair of a taskforce to work with student employees to improve working conditions and prevent unionization. After taking on a number of interns and committee members in each department that handled students, I gathered working reports for the eyes of me, and the vice chair which was the president of the student government which detailed average hours given, typical complaints, recorded interviews after screening the interviewees, and their policies on how to preform and how they trained. Of every department, it can as no shock that the department I worked in took advantage of their students (they hired students that didn't speak up because they needed a job that was flexible and didn't eat into their schedule) and offered less benefits (free drink per 4 hour shift...) than other departments (for example the bookstore; students received 20% off of all purchases.) yet claimed to pay the highest (second highest) and more benefits (The bookstore had overpriced text books and you couldn't do inter-library loans for textbooks for classes if the bookstore had it. Hence, if you had a friend that worked there, you were set.) Creating a secret sub committee, I had various interns interview different employees across the cafeteria department and compiled a damming 12 page report only ultimately led to asking for 6 things:

*Proper Training
*Proper maintenance on machinery 
*Better resolution of sexual harassment 
*Heat resistant gloves for stations that operated grills
*Not be scheduled during classes. 
*Not to be overscheduled (Payroll reduced hours to *all* students to 18 from 20 due to the department working 24+ hours a week)


I do admit I was rude about it in hindsight, which explained why a lot of them tried to get my fired or impeached; (they got me demoted and transferred to a marketplace run by the cafeteria but was soon put up for promotion in a different sub department), but I stood up for what I was elected and paid to do. During the course of the working in the marketplace, I had to call in sick a lot due to my immune system failing due to the accumulating stress of dealing with all the aftermath of politics (rape accusations, false rumors, impeachment, thefts just to name a few). Keep in mind that I also struggle to deal with Borderline personality disorder, which only made things worse.

Now, this report was brought to the student legislating body near election season. It took 5 months, 100+ interviews, 30 surveys and countless anonymity disclosures. The students that participated in forming the report knew that if their name was on it they would get fired for. I signed agreements stating I would never reveal them to their bosses or anyone that asked. When the report was discussed with the student government, it became a shitshow real quick because aspiring government officials came and got the backing of the department to publicly shame and renounce me. The people who showed up in support chose not to say anything and/or listened in shock as I was literally made out to be a terrible person that was not respectable, spread lies and slander, and brought up all false rumors and accusations against me. Live.  

To make matters worse, I check one day to find I had no hours assigned to me for the week of the discussion of the report, and went to upper upper management to find out that I was under investigation and in line to be fired due to missing work. Asking for my records to be brought up, I found out the supervisor who was part of the same oppositional political party of my elected peer had gone in and changed all my sick calls to no shows and added the note I was hanging out with friends when I have multiple witnesses that I was actually sick and went home to take medication and sleep. Now, after that live report, I found out the next day I was terminated from my job and blacklisted. And since that debacle was recorded live, every one now sees me as a rapist (I was also investigated by the school on false accusations which made it worse when people interning there leaked to everyone about the investigation and after everything no one believed me). 

To make matters worse, the people who helped create the report thanked me for trying before blocking and deleting me from social media, and ignored me from that point on trying to not get fired for knowing or associating with me. 

I have since then found out I am blacklisted from working at the college(all departments check your previous employment if you worked on campus, and the person that made it their point to get me fired got promoted to manager that can speak on behalf of the department and is the one that answers the mainline for the department before transferring calls for reference checks). Oh, the icing on the cake, the college is in the midwest, where the economy of that particular town sucks and every job I apply for reference checks.


**TL;DR** I can't work in my college and my only work experience I have that spans multiple years blacklisted me. All because I joined student government and stood up for my coworkers after learning we got exploited.

**Lesson to be learned**: Politics shouldn't be in student government and sometimes, it's better to not call out your bosses for their bullshit even when you have the power to do so. (or believe you did)

2uavy5,1,2015-01-31,College student not sure what to do,KevCah,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2uavy5/college_student_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Hey guys, Can I get your thoughts on what I should do with my life.

I'm a 4th year Civil engineering student. I'm on a decent enough grade in college (2.1 degree), and I expect to graduate later this year. 

So, I need to start making decisions on what I should do once I graduate. Here are the options that I see for myself:

1) Run for a position in the University Student Union
All, through University, I have been involved in the Student's Union, Clubs and Societies on campus and anything to do with students. I really like university life here and I like helping all sorts of people. I have held many positions on the committees of the student ran Clubs and socs and really enjoyed it. I have also been involved with student council as a rep of my own course and as a rep for clubs and societies. 

Downside to this position is that it is elected by the students. That means I need to run a campaign. This will involve getting t-shirts printed, creating a video, and spending a week of my life trying to convince people to vote for me. I have no problem doing that, but the campaign is the week before my Final dissertation is due. This dissertation accounts for 15% of my grade in college. 

This position is only for one year, and the wage is low. (I'm not it for the money though.)


TL;DR I want a job in the SU, but my grades will suffer. Want to stay in college one more year.


2) Do a Masters
Fortunately, I amn't choking in student debt and have made it through my undergrad debt free. A masters however will change this. A masters programme where I'm from will cost around 8k in fees and then I need to consider leaving expenses etc. I have looked into doing a masters in Denmark where there is free fees, but cost of living is much higher.

Why do a masters? Is undergrad not enough? Well, yes and no. I am interested in working in a design office who work on large structural engineering project. My dream is to work on the of design a skyscraper. Problem is I need to become a chartered engineer. The institute of engineers have changed how they award charter-ships. You now must have a minimum of a masters degree. The charter-ship is important so that they company (i hope) to work for will get the interesting projects as they have a large number of chartered engineers. 

There's three paths I can take with this:
-Do it now and pay for it myself (w/ loan)
-Work for a year or two and save up and do it then. (I'll probably get more out of the masters this way)
-Do a masters part time and ask the company i'm working for to help me pay for it. (they will help to pay for it not sure how much tho) 


TL;DR Need to do a masters. Not sure when to do it. Want to stay in college for another year.


3)Get a job with the company I did my placement with.
So I worked with a well known company on an internship as part of my undergrad. I worked with them for 8 months and got on OK. I was based in the infrastructure department. After working with them, I know I don't want to work in this area. I didn't find the work engaging and I didn't enjoy the office. It didn't help that I didn't enjoy the city I was working in either. The city was on the other side of the country. I came home each weekend on a 3 and a half hour bus journey. I just didn't settle in well at all.

I applied to my old boss for a job to keep my options open as much as possible. I emailed him at 11 o'clock yesterday and I got a phone call at half 3 saying that my contract was in the post. Only down side is that I have to decide if I want the job in the next 2 weeks......

Now, I don't want to send ungrateful, but I would like to see if I get accepted for a masters first and see if I win the election for the SU. I'd like to decide after that. If I ask them for more time to decide or if I can work in a different part of the company, I feel like they will say no. Also the pay with this company is below industry standard, €22k.


TL;DR Applied for company I did my internship with. They give me a job but only have 2 weeks to decide if i want it.


4)Get a job with another company
The company I did my internship with is my dream company. I just got landed in the wrong place and wrong department. I do have other options I could be a site engineer rather then in the design office. A site engineer will earn more now (€40k) but less in the future. I should go on site to get some experience of what that is like but i have been told by lecturers that it is easy to move from office to site, but it is very hard to move from site to office.

I have applied for other companies but the response from them has been poor. 

5)Take a year out, travel, see the world etc.
I'd love to do this but finance is a problem. My family would also be against it as well. They don't see the point of going to see different places on a shoe string budget. They would much rather me get a steady job and then see the world as a holiday. I have gone through the education system without repeating any years or staying back. I will be graduating at the age of 20. I want to do some thing or go somewhere before starting my real career.


What do ye guys think I should do?


TL;DR College student hasn't a clue what to do with his life."

I'm at a point where I have to make some big decisions about my future. I'm in 3rd year computer engineering, but I registered in the internship program in my university which allows me to take a year off to do a 12-16 month internship before my final 4th year.

I had been having no luck with jobs up until this week. I got an interview with two companies. Company A is for a more general Engineering Project Management position, whereas Company B is for a Software Engineering position. Company A is in another city, Company B is in my hometown.

Here's where it got tricky. I had the interview with Company A on Thursday, and it went well. So well apparently, that they offered me the position the next day on Friday. I have to let them know if I want the position by the end of the day Tuesday. My interview with Company B is Monday afternoon, which I  feel pretty good about, but I'm not sure if they can make a decision in a day.

I'm in computer engineering and I've been trying to focus as a software engineer. Company B would provide me with great experience for that, but is not guaranteed and is for 8 - 12 months.

On the other hand, the offer I have with Company A is 16 months, decent pay (~21/hr, 40hr/week), but is focused more on engineering project management (I'll say its municipal project work for the public, I just don't want to say the company name). 

Would you guys think taking the position at Company A would be good? I'm scared that I will trap myself into engineering project management work, which will hurt my chances if I decide to compete for software engineering jobs with other computer engineers after graduation.

I got the weekend to think this through, but I would really appreciate some advice.

2uc3er,17,2015-01-31,Anyone here interned/worked for VMware?,VMwareIntern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uc3er/anyone_here_internedworked_for_vmware/,"I received a solid offer from VMware for the summer as a Software Engineering Intern ($38.65/hr or about $18,242 for the entire summer). My offer was due to expire next week, and I received calls from Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon last week to schedule interviews with them. Long story short, I turned them all down because I they said that they wouldn't be able to get me through their interview processes before my VMware offer expired (call me crazy, but I feel like I did the right thing).

Has anyone here interned/worked for VMware? I've heard that it's a great place to work and the project I was assigned is extremely interesting, so no regrets with my decision. Personal anecdotes, general info on day-to-day life, or any other tidbits would be great to read before I head off this summer!"
2uc3vv,1,2015-01-31,A few questions regarding resumes,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uc3vv/a_few_questions_regarding_resumes/,"So I'm a freshman looking for an internship at a startup, and I have a few questions about my resume:

1. I have no prior internships. What should I put in my experience section? Should I just list the prior jobs (tutoring, mostly, and a little bit of volunteer) that I've had?

2. Should I list the app I'm creating with my friends in the projects section, even if we basically have no code completed?

3. I think that my strength as a freshman candidate lies in the fact that I'm well into my school's CS core (took intro, OOP and data structures, discrete, am taking systems programming)-- should I list the CS courses I've taken? Also should I list the grades I received in each of them?

4. Is it realistic to expect an interview at a startup with essentially no experience and basically no side projects?"
2uc43b,8,2015-01-31,How common is it for sophomores to get internships?,Raekor,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2uc43b/how_common_is_it_for_sophomores_to_get_internships/,"A lot of companies exclusively look for juniors and seniors, but there are some that only require, ""pursuing Bachelor's degree of X."", without specifying year.

Does this mean sophomores have to compete with upperclassmen for the spot? Is it expected or uncommon for 2nd years to land a relevant engineering internship or even co-op?"

I’ve been looking for a job for two years after doing college and graduate school back to back. It’s getting harder and harder. I found out I’ve been qualified for a certification, since the start of my job search, who’s eligibility requirements changed while I was studying for my Master’s degree. I did not know this until late last year. I got a study guide in December and have been trying to study, but my mom keeps telling me that applying to jobs is my priority. I’m now finally looking at sustainability jobs again—-I discontinued my search and had been searching for something else because I was told I’d never get a job in my field. I have only sustainability and business degrees, but I don’t have real experience. I’m hoping that I can be more qualified for sustainability jobs in the area I’m hoping for if I pass the LEED Green Associate exam but I haven’t studied so much. The president of a sustainability-based company found me, for an internship on LinkedIn, and it’s a type of company I’ve been looking for. The other interviews went well, but the last one didn’t and I feel I blew it. I was so nervous, hungry, and even forgot to close my shoes.

I’m afraid to apply for part-time work to get off being financed by my parents. I’ve heard that the jobs you start with can determine whether you’re hirable. My parents want me to find a good job. I don’t want to disappoint them. Job descriptions are also very intimidating. I feel like I only have limited things to say in a cover letter because I don’t have much experience besides unpaid internships (1 seemed like administrative plus other random things and the other…it didn’t seem like they cared).

I’ve never had a paid job and I’m halfway through my 20’s. My parents wouldn’t let me get a job while I was in school. I wasn’t able to get around and do stuff without someone driving me the year and a half before I moved. (Driving makes me nervous and my wrists ache when I drive too often.) I’m in a more walkable area that has more transportation now.

I’m an introvert but am also social at times. I’ve been afraid of making friends here because everyone else has a job or more job experience than me. I’m afraid of being asked “What do you do?”

I’ve been trying to figure out how to get out there and do stuff that would help me find a job, and also apply to more jobs. Applying to 5 jobs in one day takes all day. It takes time to personalize each cover letter to each job. Then again, with so little experience, there’s only so much I can write and change. My cover letters have gotten better the more I write them. I’m unsure as to how I can divide all my time to best do everything: find jobs, apply to jobs, study for professional certification exam, networking, do something else that’s productive towards my job search (i.e. Volunteering). I’m trying to figure out how I can volunteer for the Urban Green Council even though I have little work experience.

I’ve had may interviews that were for sales jobs and failed some of them because I couldn’t convince myself that I wanted to be in sales. I had another interview with a company I’ve been looking for for two years. Two days before the interview, I convinced myself that I didn’t want it as much as I truly wanted it because of a couple bad reviews when they really aren’t a bad company. I knew that but thought I didn’t know much about them and wanted a paid internship, since I’m not in school anymore. I focused on the monetary and the negative. I didn’t think of it in a positive way because of the reviews that were contrary to what I knew. I crumbled because of uncertainty. The one that interviewed me also has a lot of connections. I understood her personality and conversation style immediately. I feel I know what went wrong but also feel like I don’t know how it happened. I was fine that morning. I’ve been partly blaming being hungry and forgetting to close my little boots.

I’ve now been thinking, now what? And why can't I do more interviews right. Why do I lose persuade myself to the negative? Why am I so afraid of saying the wrong things? etc..."
2uce27,2,2015-01-31,Experience with WL Gore internship?,Dools93,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/2uce27/experience_with_wl_gore_internship/,Has anyone ever worked with WL Gore for an internship in Flagstaff or Phoenix in the summer? What was your experience like? What did you like or not like about it? Also any suggestions about whether working in phoenix as opposed to flagstaff aside from the hot weather? And how was the social life for you ?
