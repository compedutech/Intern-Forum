I have an upcoming phone interview for a position as an administrative assistant. What can I do to be fully prepared for this? How can I refresh myself with knowledge of Microsoft Excel, Word, etc.? I was laid off my last job working as a product tester for a computer company so I have general knowledge of computer software/hardware. 

Within the past two months I've applied to 30-40 jobs online and followed up with a phone call to all of them to find they aren't hiring. (I don't know why they list the job as open) So what are your tips on how to be prepared for the interview and the responsibilities of the position in general? If i don't end up getting this job, where are some good places to apply or what are some things i can do? I've had my resume reviewed by my school's career placement services. Are there any good jobs that I can intern at that would be worthwhile?
No money to go out so I really need some advice because I am sick and tired of being home 24/7."
euw1a,2,2011-01-02,"I am 21 about to kick-start a very successful career, when I graduate and I have never picked up a girl or had a girlfriend and everyone around me makes a big deal out of it, but it means nothing to me. How can I cope?",Sickofsocialstigmata,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/euw1a/i_am_21_about_to_kickstart_a_very_successful/,"First off this is a throw away account as I don't want this to be traced.

To put it bluntly I am a 21yo virgin who knew what they wanted to do when they were 16 and dedicated their life to finishing high school with the marks to get into it and I did not fit in with the regular crowd, whilst my colleagues were out under-age drinking and chatting up girls I was playing my Gamecube and watching Red VS Blue. When high school finished I made more friends with the academic staff than I did students and as a result I get work at my old school paying very well cash in hand and great people to talk to. My colleagues are either exactly the same with the exact same group of friends out of high school or changing their degree for the second time, not ALL of them, but you get the idea. When I got to college I felt right at home, but still didn't get along with 95% of the people in the course as they wanted to go out drinking pick up chicks or whatever, this just never appealed to me. I preferred - and still prefer - having a 2L bottle of Coke and playing World of Warcraft whilst watching Battlestar Galactica. I get along with everyone at college in my course, as I am a humble person, if you knew me and read this you would be surprised i'd be saying all this. Once again I am good friends the teaching staff as I learn a lot from them out of lectures, but I only have two good friends out of 180 people.

Fast forward a year I got an internship with a tier 1 company and got a bucket tonne of experience with them and when I finished with them I took a massive leap career wise getting another internship at another company, something only a few lucky people get the chance to do. A lot of my college colleagues are jealous and some people I know are suddenly like ""Woah holy shit, you're going to start a career I could only ever dream of"" they're happy for me, but naturally a bit jealous. People from high school are suddenly, shit, I would never expect that from you. When I finish my final year I will graduate and can potentially earn $100k, including extras.

I am happy with myself, I love my hobbies, I am a smart guy who loves what he does and I feel that is what has gotten me where I am, I am a hardcore geek and eccentric. In addition to all that I hate drinking and only do it willingly twice a year, the other times is just to 'fit in'. 
Recently I was out having drinks with some work colleagues and they said I needed to pick up, get out root women, they were giving me tips on what to look out for and then 'go in for the kill', I appreciate their advice and I know they're doing it to give me a good time. However, it just doesn't interest me that much, sex isn't a 'Omfg I want to tap that' thing for me. I hate clubs and loud venues and I just can't comprehend the thought of sleeping with someone I met 5 seconds ago, I will admit I find some girls hot or beautiful, but it's just not me to go out and sleep with them on a whim, I need to get to know them. It’s something that normally doesn’t bother me that much, but when I am surrounded by people who talk about it all the time, which is fair enough, but they bring me into it and I don’t feel comfortable as I lack experience in that area as well as interest and it’s getting hard as I get older and still have no philanthropic stories to tell and even my parents make comments about me not having a girlfriend. It’s just hit me recently and I am asking myself, do I really want a one night stand a fling or a relationship? It seems everyone has to fit the stereotype of having a job and a family. I certainly wouldn’t mind someone to wake up to everyday and I won’t deny that I don’t ask the occasional person out (With a majority ending with, I have a boyfriend), my job is my priority at the moment and I have no need or desire for a relationship, but I feel I ‘need’ to have one and as time goes on I feel I am making things worse by having no sexual experience and dread what would happen if I said to a woman as a 29 or 40 year old saying, i’ve never had sex. I just feel that I am just gonna get absolutely wasted one time and go out on a night in the town and just try and get it over with so I can move on. What do you think of all this, am I missing something, is there a variable I have overlooked, am I only caring because others bring it up and can’t understand my view on it all?

**tl;dr I am a 21yo who has never had a relationship about to start a career with a starting salary of $100k and I am worried not having a relationship or sex with people will cause problems later on in life when people ‘expect’ you to have the basics.**

P.S Sorry about the grammar, I am just blurting this out without thinking how to structure it. I hope you get what I am asking."

I want to get into programming for a living, but I'm not sure where to start. I've been coding C\C++ for more than two years now, but only as a hobby, mostly in gaming related areas. I'm tired of working at my soul sucking job flipping burgers and I'm ready to do something with my life.

A few of my projects:

**The Anniversary Edition Installer, a mod installer for the game Oni.**
This was coded in C++, using wxWidgets for the UI and boost for filesystem access. I would have used normal Windows APIs, but the code needed to be compilable for Macs, too. How it actually installs modifications isn't a topic I want to get into in this post, but I can on request.

**The Daodan DLL**

An engine patching DLL for Oni, it is replaces an unneccessary DLL the engine uses and instead patches and hooks the engine for whatever purpose desired. Coded in C, with a bit of assembly for hooks and patches. I'm not the original creator of it, but I am the sole caretaker at the moment. I know the code inside of it pretty well and I've added on several features beyond the original purpose of the DLL, which was to stop a crash caused by OpenGL extensions strings overflowing a fixed buffer.

**Flatline - Oni Multiplayer**

A very educational experiment in networking for me. Using the Daodan DLL as a base, I have started work on Multiplayer for Oni.

[WIP Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-L8g6UocCo)

Unfortunately the project is on hold at the moment while in talks with a certain company to get actual access to Oni's source. Currently any work done on Oni's engine (multiplayer or otherwise) is done by decompiling and analyzing the engine. Sounds fun, Doesn't it?

**Star Wars: Moviebattles II**

SW: MBII is a total conversion modification for Star Wars: Jedi Academy, which is based on the Q3 engine, written in C. A full description of the game can be found at http://www.moviebattles.com/about

I'm part of the development team. Fun stuff, currently getting prepared for a new content patch within a month. There aren't really any good videos or screenshots of my work on it around. My work there involves a lot of 3D math and such.

Hi

I am a masters student right now and I was applying for summer internships and I want a little help. I studied control systems mainly and now doing research work in power systems (got into it as an application of control, but now its almost all power systems) but before I began school I worked a little in image processing and have a handful of conference publications on that.

I was wondering if including those publications in my resume would help in the internship search now or job later on. I have no published work in my current field. Pretty much everything I did before coming to school is in a different field and without describing that my resume is pretty much just my personal information, it would look sad for someone finishing masters.

I used to do it till now and in the cover letter I used use phrases like diverse knowledge, etc. But now since I am almost fully into power, it doesn't quite feel right. Maybe that also explains why I never got back any replies. It might look like I cannot focus on anything. But honestly, I had an opportunity to work in research field in a good institution so I took the job.

What do you think?

Our network storage is hosted over the WAN about 15 miles away in our IT department. 
 
 
 
 
 


Our end user computers run XP, and our server is either 2003 or 2008 (I think they are in the process of upgrading).  In any case, the shared folder my office uses has become a gigantic mess and I've been tasked with building them a new folder structure. 

I keep reading that symbolic links and junctions are not supported ""to"" network shares, but I assume this is because of the folder synchronization over the network would normally require something like DFS.  

But... I'm not trying to mirror a local folder to a network folder...I'm wanting to mirror two folders within the same shared drive.





I've read extensively about linkd, mklink, and so on.  I've put together a batch file of mklink commands that could be ran to link the appropriate folders.  I'm thinking I can just have my sys admin run the batch file from the server?  Would someone with admin privs be able to run the batch file from my office?









For example:

C:\            this has windows on it

D:\            this is my dvd rom

I:\             this is the shared drive, hosted 15 miles away, that everyone in the office saves to




I'm not wanting to link a folder in C:\ to something in I:\ , I'm wanting to link ""I:\AwesomeFolder"" to ""I:\IhaveaHat\itsreallyawesome\ireallylikehats""


Is this possible?  Tell me yes, I really don't want to use shortcuts, they are lame.

* A friend of grew up in Florida her entire life.  After she graduated, her mother and step-father split.  They had been together 10+ years, but never married.  She went to live with her mother up north for over a year before deciding to move back down.  She enrolls in UCF and is denied Bright Future.  Furthermore, they decide she is an ""out-of-state"" student and that she must now pay a fortune to attend UCF.  She appeals.  They deny.  She appeals again.  They deny again.  Sometimes they wave part of her tuition.  Sometimes they don't.  I think the girl spent $60-70k to graduate with an B.S. in Biology before she was done.  **tl;dr**- Girl leaves Florida for a year and gets boned on both Bright Future's and in-state tuition, despite the fact that one parent remained in Florida the entire time.

* A friend of mine had put in ""x"" internship hours to complete her Master's.  She already worked in the field.  She submitted her own job for approval as an internship site.  They approved her application.  About mid-way through her final term, they send out an auditor to evaluate her in the work environment.  They conclude that her job isn't up to their standards and require that she start over somewhere else.  Furthermore, the nature of her work meant that alternative sites were not open during hours she wasn't already working.   **tl;dr** - Two months before graduation, UCF decides the internship site they approved isn't good enough.  Student scrambles to complete internship hours while juggling school and full-time work schedule.  

* I've known guys who got back into UCF after being kicked out for a) doing too much Cocaine and b) having so much sex with their girlfriend that they forgot to go to class.  I also know a guy who can't get back in, four years later, because he was denied an independent status on the FAFSA and couldn't get grants or loans.  Dude previously had a 3.8 G.P.A.  He wiped out two semesters later, trying to work enough hours to put himself through school.  It's four years later, and he's reapplied twice.  Can't get back in.  The dude who did too much blow went to rehab and came back in one semester.

**Edit-** I see a lot of posts about the residency thing.  I don't think the girl was surprised to lose Bright Futures.  Her beef is that a) residency rules are pretty arbitrary state-to-state, and b) that UCF didn't handle residency classification according to their own guidelines.

Here's what I know: Her mother moved to Massachusetts less than three months before she did and she got in-state residency at a Mass. university without a problem.  The girl lived her entire life in Florida, and one parent remained here, and she couldn't get Florida residency for **the next three years she attended UCF**.   

UCF could have used professional judgement to re-classify her as a resident.  Especially after a year.   [According to their own guidelines](http://www.catalog.sdes.ucf.edu/student_tuition_and_fees/florida_residency/Default.aspx), they should have done so.  She had florida registration, driver's license, off-campus residence (in her name), florida employment, in-state family, etc.

Forget Bright Futures.  Out-of-state tuition is 3x more expensive than in-state.  They waived some of the tuition some semesters, but it was always a last minute thing.  She didn't always know if she could afford to go full-time until add/drop.  UCF refused to follow their own guidelines, even after documentation and numerous appeals.

I dropped out of college in 2003 and joined the Army in 2005. I spent four years as an Airborne Infantryman and when I get out in May I will have served two years in Special Operations. I have already been accepted at the school I will be going to if I decide to go.

There are a couple different issues I'm thinking about. First, If I finish my degree it will be completely paid for, but my security clearance will expire while I am still in school. I don't expect too many people to know about that one, but if I know the reddit community someone will have an opinion.

I am 27 and have been building computers, diagnosing, repairing, and acting as family and friend tech support since I was 6. I had an internship with a global engineering corporation while I was in high school, and I was showing the IT guys how to do a lot of things (these IT guys didn't know how to use batch files or the command prompt). I was the go to guy in Iraq and Afghanistan for fixing people's DVD players or laptops or TV's or anything else that might be broken. Also, I taught the Special Forces communications sergeants I was working with a lot about networking, linux, and hardware. Problem is, I have no paper stating my qualifications. That's the second thing I've been thinking about. Is there a place someone like me can start and eventually work his way up? Or is this all just stupid and I need to suck it up and spend three years to finish that degree?

I don't necessarily have anything against going to school, but if it's going to put off starting the career I want, why bother?

Well I'm 17 right now, and would like to be in the US by the time I'm 20 (I've set myself a deadline of September 2013). I've been reading up all the FAQs and formal information I can find for almost a year now so I thought I would ask here.

Obviously, I have no qualifications beyond getting Level 1 and Level 2 NCEA (and Level 3 by the end of this year). I've arranged to get some minor qualifications for barista-ing and programming by the end of 2011 and I'm increasing my skills in the computer industry as fast as I am mentally capable.

Being a New Zealand citizen with no family in the US, I cannot get a visa via Refugee status or Family. I want to be able to work (and move as freely as I can between states). Preferably citizenship as well, but I'm aiming more for legally getting into the country for a few years first. I will not be studying in the US, so I cannot apply for a student visa (I couldn't afford the exorbitant fees even if I wanted to study).

I have mainly been using this site for my research: http://www.uscis.gov/
I have not contacted the US Embassy, but can if I need to.

How do you think I should tackle this problem?
Advice and personal experience is very helpful.

I would like to mention that as a teenager, I realise that my quest for actual information would be nigh on impossible for anyone older than me to take me seriously for I am still classified as a child in many, many countries. I want to go to the United States to work, because I know the skills I am training now are in high demand by corporations there. I also want to go there for a personal reason, mainly due to my successful relationship to a US citizen (but that's only a minor reason). I do not want to go there for the 'Television Illusion' that the media of my country happily distort other's minds with. I would stay in my own country for that.

Knowing my young age, I know this is will be incredibly difficult. At this point and time, I can get two options: International Internships or magically getting a Work Offer which would vouch for me.


tl;dr Trying to move from NZ to the US, most options of getting in are ruled out, including Refugee status and moving here as a student.

eynzp,0,2011-01-08,I need a nice way to tell a couple of best guy friends that I am very taken without destroying the friendships.,needs_a_vacation,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eynzp/i_need_a_nice_way_to_tell_a_couple_of_best_guy/,"So here's the situation. (TO NOTE: This is a throwaway account for this question, I am NOT a newbie to Reddit, nor am I fishing for karma or anything else).

Precisely 15 months ago I began dating someone I strongly believe is the one. We met about a week after I arrived at my out-of-state college freshman year. Long story short (since it's not too terribly relevant, but somewhat), I met Dave, fell in love, after a month left an abusive relationship I had suffered through for ~3 years on and off, and hooked up with Dave. Best decision of my life, no questions asked.

But, as most of us know who have been in any relationship of any length, no relationship is perfect. Dave and I have had our ups and downs. No details needed, I'm just stating that while we've had our share of fights, we've worked through our troubles and are still together and in love.

Now, meet Mike and John, both guys I met at college. I'm going to start with John, since he's the one who started this mess.

John is a guy who did me a huge favor at college by helping me with one of my labs. To summarize (I don't want this to be a ridiculously long post, but background is kind of necessary), we became Facebook friends but didn't really start talking until September/October of last year, but ended up being really good friends. Of note, I was going through my first real episode of long distance with Dave, who was doing an internship, and we were fighting a lot (mostly due to my immaturity, I admit). John was a big help during this time, which was also one of the worst quarters I've experienced of college, offering lots of support and such. We talked a lot online, since he was also on an internship. The trouble started when I went to visit him on my way to start my own internship during Thanksgiving break, and his roommate complicated matters by making him admit to being in love with me. There are more details, but you'll have to ask in the comments if you want to know.

Mike I met before Dave, actually (he was my first real friend at college). We became really great friends quickly. Here's the kicker: Mike is a member of my old church, which I have for the most part quit attending (mostly due to the people, not necessarily the beliefs themselves). I guess I should just tell you right out that I was raised a Mormon, and maybe that's why I'm so stuck with how to address this. I'll come back to this. 

Mike went away on a mission (church-related), but I promised to send him letters, since that is the only way anyone but family can communicate (they get to email). Which I have done, though not as frequently as I promised (letters take so much longer to write than you would realize). 
Mike has been pretty convinced that I'm still interested in being a Mormon, but the thing is, I'm really not. I made up a lot of really legitimate excuses for not going to church while he was at college and not on his mission. But I trust Mike, who has never been in the least bit judgmental of anything I’ve ever done, including the fact that I’ve lived with Dave basically since we started dating, or pressured me into going to church or anything, really.

So when John admitted to his undying love for me (I’m not exaggerating, he really did say I was the one for him and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me), stuff happened and eventually I told Dave, and asked him how I should address it. Dave said he was biased, so he didn’t really have any good advice that he could give me. So Dave, who knows Mike, suggested I write to Mike and ask him for advice. So I did, and was totally honest about everything. A few weeks later Mike’s reply came back. Long story short, Mike confessed that he had had feelings for me since we had met, but had kept his distance because I was in that horrible relationship I mentioned earlier; then Dave made his move, and well, Mike thought it best to respect my relationship then, too. So Mike then admits all of this, saying he can’t help, either, because he is biased as well. To top it off, somewhere in my letter to him he got the inference that I was sleeping with Dave, which, up to this point, I believe he did not believe I was doing. He of course did the Mormon missionary thing and flipped out with concern that I was “possibly breaking the Law of Chastity” (aka sex before marriage).

So now I’m stuck. I have three guys head-over-heels in love with me, and I only want one: Dave. But Mike and John are very important to me, and I value their friendship; they’ve been two of my very best friends, and I would hate to lose that. I’ve already lost countless guy friends to the whole “I want to be with you” thing when I was unavailable/uninterested, and I have no idea if it’s possible to avoid it, because I’ve tried every nice way I can think of to address it and failed pretty much every time. Do any of you wiser Redditors have any idea how I can NICELY tell John and Mike I’m not interested, without alienating them? And, above that, how do I address to Mike that yes, I am sleeping with Dave? It’s such an awkward subject that I’m really not at all comfortable with discussing with anyone. It’s a private decision I have made and I am content with. But I’m a terrifically honest person and hate to lie to anyone, let alone my best friend, so I feel like I have to somehow address the issue.

TL;DR: Girl is in a very solid relationship with guy she thinks is the one, but two guy friends have admitted to being in love with her. She needs to know how to address the issue without alienating her friends and at the same time not leading either of them on.

We'll cover the tech companies in the 2nd Street corridor in the SOMA district of San Francisco, and we'll talk about the type of future growth that careers like this will provide.

What do we get out of it? We will get a chance to meet several qualified young people who are interested in working.  We might find a great intern, part time associate or full time person.

I've been interning with this company since August. I was supposed to be done in December, but then they asked if I wouldn't mind staying on until May (at which point there might be a full-paying position available), and I agreed since I didn't have any other job prospects. (Should probably mention that I moved halfway across the country for this internship and subsequently fell in love with the area and don't particularly want to go home and move in with my parents)

They are taking advantage of me, and we both know it- it has been a while since I have actually been an ""intern,"" especially since I'm one of the few in the building that know my way around a computer and often end up being tech support for the whole building. I haven't made a big deal out of it before because it's a brand I've been really loyal to since I was a little kid and because the company is in the middle of restructuring itself so it doesn't go bankrupt.

That said, I do really enjoy the job and the company I'm working for, but I can't continue to live on $7.25 and hour in one of the most expensive areas of the country.

I am actively looking/interviewing for other jobs, but in the meantime, does anyone have any advice on how to tactfully approach the subject with the CEO that they need to either nut up or shut up when it comes to paying me?"

Have any advice?",thrownawayfromschool,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f02cb/got_kicked_out_of_uni_for_shitty_grades_no_idea/,"I've been doing pretty shitty in school lately. My frosh year I did pretty well, got a 3.8 or so in Computer Engineering and transferred to a much better university. Didn't do so well there for a combination of reasons my first semester and got about a 1.8. The next spring, I was doing so poorly that I withdrew from all of my classes. I still got a pretty good internship for the summer, made a pretty good bundle of money, and was asked to return the next summer. When I returned to school this past fall, I got a 1.0 and was dismissed from the university. 

I'm not going to blame anything or anyone for how this happened. Suffice it to say I've been in a pretty bad place lately in my life and I feel like nothing has good has been happening in my life. One of my best friends committed suicide, I found out my mom is sleeping around, I was in a pretty shitty and stressful relationship until about a week ago, and I'm pretty much broke. 

Honestly, I didn't really know that I was dropped until today. I came back for school a little bit early (a week before) so that I wouldn't have to unpack everything right as classes were starting, but then I get a letter from the school (as do my parents) notifying me of my dismissal. Now I have to pack my whole room up and leave for good.

The letter says that I can't even re-apply until next spring. I don't know what I'm going to do until then... My parents told me that it would be OK for me to stay at their place indefinitely but I don't want to be an unproductive leech forever... Honestly I've considered joining the armed forces or something like that because I don't feel like I have much direction in my life, just a bunch of people that have really high expectations of me. I don't know what I want to do with my life or anything and it is finally catching up with me.

This is probably the shittiest situation I've ever been in, and that's saying a lot. I've never been at such a complete loss as to what to do in my whole life and it makes me feel so useless and stupid that I got myself into this mess. I feel like I've let everyone who cares about me down, as well as myself, and now that this has transpired my life is irreparably fucked. Not having a degree means it is impossible for me to get any jobs in my field so I probably am gonna end up doing something I feel no passion for or am completely uninterested in. 

There's nothing I can do about getting kicked out of school directly right now but does anyone have any advice on what to do?  

tl;dr: got kicked out of school, no idea what to do next, any advice/help?

f0tc8,0,2011-01-12,"I screwed up my first 2 years of college. Even though I'm improving, how screwed am I for grad school?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f0tc8/i_screwed_up_my_first_2_years_of_college_even/,"Background: I'm currently a Computer Science major at a fairly renown school (I would say 1st-tier.). I was a bad student during my first two years and I have no excuse for it. My GPA sank down to a 2.5 at one point and almost got me kicked out of ROTC. Starting my third year I started to harden up although the process has been painful and gradual since. I'm going to graduate in May and head off to the Air Force doing Operations Research, but I would like to apply to a tier-1 (say...top 50?) graduate school in Computer Science, IT, or the like. I evaluated the pluses and minuses of my situation as follows:

Plus: 

* I have a decent internship doing network security at our school's applied research labs. NetSec is the field I'm interested in, and I am in very good standing w/ my boss.
* In addition to my degree I will have 2 certifications in Health IT (accredited by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology), and INFOSEC (accredited by the NSA).
* My last 2.5 years GPA will be above a 3.0 assuming I get at least a 3.1 this coming semester. If I get a 3.5 this semester my last 2.5 years will be ~3.2
* If I choose to wait until I exit active-duty, I will have 4 years .mil experience and TS-level clearance.

Minus:

* I screwed up pretty badly. My semester GPAs since my freshman year were: 1.92, 2.12, 2.63, 1.53, 2.92, 2.25, 3.15, 2.75, 3.42. I loaded myself with a lot of upper-div and rather difficult CS classes but I can't make that an excuse for myself.
* My official transcript from my school shows that I'm currently at a 2.7 (I know the #s don't sound like they add up but I transferred a lot of AP credit when I started), but my military education transcript shows that I have a 2.8 (the .mil counts more transfer classes than my school). At best I'll have a 2.9 cumulative GPA according to the military when I graduate, far from a 3.0 cutoff.

The school I am most interested in applying right now is Virginia Tech's Masters in Information Technology. Their minimum requirements are &gt;3.0 GPA in last 60 semester hours, no GRE, and 3 letters of recommendation (http://www.vtmit.vt.edu/admission/). I would apply to other schools but doing grad school while in the military gives me few options, and I would like to get a Masters before I leave active duty.

Give it to me straight, Reddit. Am I completely screwed or is there hope? If I give up going to a tier-1 grad school and instead go to a tier-2 grad school will it even be worth the education?"

- Fujitsu ESPRIMO Mobile (no power adapter, unknown error)  
- HP 2230s (no harddrive)  
- HP Compaq nx6325 (no keyboard, Fujitsu harddrive, unknown error)  
- HP ProBook 5310m (no harddrive, unknown error)  
- IBM Thinkpad R52 (misssing keys, taped, melted spots ...probably a gooner)  
- 2 USB sticks (4 GB each, one of them have Ubuntu)  
- A bunch of Installations disks for Windows XP, Win7 and OSX.  
- A bunch of other IT stuff like tools, network cable etc...  
  
I have put a Fujitsu disk into the HP 2230s and installed Win XP. It broke after windows update so I tried Win7 which breaks in the installation because of the foreign disk. Lastly, I have managed to boot up Ubuntu from USB stick but it wont run when installed on harddrive.  
  
I don't think the users would like to run Ubuntu on try mode. So what should I do? Go back to unpatched Win XP?  
  
EDIT: Like I wrote in a comment below: ""The previous IT guy is on vacation so I am alone for just two weeks. It's not as bad as it sounds. I could probably just tell them that we have no computers and that they need to order a new one if they really needs it. This is more like a pet project for me to get new knowledge while I have no other case to work with. I might be a little bit petty against this user as well since they ""lost"" their last intern computer.""

I have installed win XP again and it seems to run fine. It got SP3 but I will turn off automatic updates and install anti-virus.

High school I played video games all day, college was more of the same until I found myself socially, but by then I had already lost most of my friends.

Resume critiques welcome!,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/f32hf/looking_for_a_computer_science_internship_in_the/,"Link: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B3NrrA6KqG87NzhmZjIzYmMtMzk3OS00Y2E5LWI4ODktMDI2NDk0MGU3MmUw&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CK2X2cAN

Background: Undergrad in my senior year and looking to do an internship in the summer. I only have time for an internship as I will be getting my officer's commission and don't know when I enter active duty after graduation. It could be anywhere from several days to several months upon commissioning that I enter active duty, so I'm looking for internships just to be safe and to get additional private-sector experience. The specific field I would like to get into is network security, but software engineering experience in general works too.

Some related questions/concerns:

* The header looks extremely generic. Should I ""pretty it up"" or leave it as is? Any ideas for templates for the header that look nice and professional?

* My cumulative GPA is crap (2.77). I admit I screwed up a lot during my first two years, but I've made significant progress, especially my last 3 semesters which averaged 3.1. Is there any way I can minimize how bad my CGPA looks during the initial application or interview? Maybe by explaining my progress?

* I would like to mention the specific programming projects I've done but don't know if it's absolutely necessary since I am already exceeding one page in length. 

*Putting my LinkedIn profile URL on my resume: Y/N?

Thanks!"

I feel like I should start all over with school, but I don't have enough money to pay for classes and a place to live. My idea was to join the military and use the GI bill to put myself through college while getting on-the-job training. The Army has been giving me the run-around on getting an IT position in the Army, and I thought you guys might be able to help. I was wondering where to start looking for an internship position to help me pay for college and get on-the-job training without going the military route. I really like working with computers and would like to make that my career if possible.

Edit: I must go back to work but I will be home around 1730 PST. Thank you guys so much."

I had a crazy idea: form a non-profit that supplies free tech support to other non-profits. I'm not even certain if anyone needs tech support these days, and if it's free I might get a few bites, and I can teach the IT ropes to high-school age kids who want to learn more, padding the resume, teaching em' skills -  I know I had a hard time getting my first 'actual' job in the IT field and I couldn't land an internship to start, so I figure this is sort of like an internship light, and I can help out places that need the tech support but can't afford it, or don't have any major problems that require heavy duty tech support. I work as a data center technician for the past few years, so I have a *very* strong grip on hardware/software troubleshooting (including my A+) 
so, I ask you - what are some resources to check out? how long does it take to become a tax exempt non profit? also as a long shot, do you think any accountants would trade tech support and trouble shooting for helping me get set up?"
f4pbq,2,2011-01-18,What is it with this job?,boneseh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f4pbq/what_is_it_with_this_job/,"Everyday I hate this job more and more and was wondering what you guys thought about this situation:

I'm a master's level grad student living at home so I don't accrue as much debt as I would renting a place near campus.  I was jobless for the most part, I did some basic websites for people I ran into that wanted websites or needed their current ones updated; it gave me a little something extra to do with my time and I enjoyed it.  A few weeks into the semester a neighbor offers me a job to help them catch up on work, 10 hours a week, nothing much.  I figured what the hell; why not help the guy out, so I took the job.  I was filing and doing data entry, but within that first week I was already allowed to work as much as I wanted.  I worked close to full-time, ranging from 30-40 hours a week getting paid $10/hour.  I was being taught every single job at the business - it was a small shop, 20 employees at most.  My neighbor is the #2 guy and I had heard the owner is useless, sucks the company dry, and yells at people for no good reason.  He hadn't yelled at me and things were still going great so I was happy (with the exception of wanting to make more money, but I was doing work a monkey could do so I felt the pay was fair).

My neighbor knew I made websites so he talked with me about working on some websites for clients: I would get a slight pay raise to $15/hour when I was doing web design work.  I said sure since it beat filing and data entry and the next thing I knew I was in a meeting with the web guy, my neighbor, and the owner.  The web guy told them it would take anywhere from 2-3 months to get these sites done, so I was thrilled to have that kind of work for that amount of time.  As it turns out, these weren't sites for just ordinary small business clients; these were sites for...Coke's biggest rival - 12 of their brands. (Before you start thinking I worked on #1rival.com, these were sites for the brands to sell their merchandise through so the brand would always be the same regardless of what the brand was printed on.)  Well, I ended up knocking these sites out in 2 weeks - 2 months ahead of the projected deadline!  Needless to say, they were impressed, error checked the sites, and told me I did a tremendous job.

Next on my list is a smaller organization's website and this is where the shit hit the fan.  The owner comes up and sees me planning the website and goes off on me.  He said that just because people want websites doesn't mean they get one - even though this organization had already paid.  It didn't matter that I was instructed to work on this site, I was the person on his shitlist that day and he basically told me I did a ""tremendous"" job on the 12 sites, but now I am reduced to filing and data entry, no more art requests, no more website work.

Fine, fuck this guy, I was doing websites for $15/hour, that's his loss.  Welllll, now it seems as if that was the first knock against me.  Recently I had a complaint filed against me for talking too much to the web guy I helped.  First of all, I'm introverted and do not talk much at work, I'm either asking a question or answering a question. Second, I got pulled from doing the web work and haven't even been around the web guy in a month! (He's upstairs, I do the filing and data entry downstairs.)  The only reason the complaint was submitted was because the web guy's productivity had dropped since I came aboard, so it must be my fault.

Next thing I hear they're bringing in a new employee.  She is going to work part-time, less hours than me, and she gets the new computer I was supposed to be receiving.  Then she receives my desk + chair so I now get to stand or sit on the floor. This is her second week and they're already taking my hours and giving them to her even though she has been late and not reported to work some days because her other job made her work.  WTF!?  Is this the type of employee they want?  To me this is bullshit and seems as if they're trying to make me quit.

I hate this job more and more each day and would quit if it wasn't for the money.  I originally started grad school with the laissez-faire attitude of being able to pay my student loans back when I get a job, but now my mindset has shifted to not wanting to graduate with loans.  At the rate I was going I was able to work off the loans I accrued each semester with not much to spare.  I didn’t want to quit this job because they were flexible with my hours.  If I wanted, I was able to just take the day which was nice because I had planned on having an unpaid internship and I’d have to lessen my hours at this place so I could work at the internship place which would give me good experience and benefit me in my career.  I did not let them know about this since the internship hadn’t been set in stone and now it’s a good thing I didn’t because the guy I was going to work with is now transferring to a different place of business and I can’t follow him to that location and he was my in at the last place.

I’m thinking I should quit, but then I lose the income and I also feel as if I quit now I’ll quit the next time things get uncomfortable and I don’t want to be viewed as a quitter (many of the people at this organization live in my neighborhood and know me on a personal basis).  At the same time I’m thinking they’re trying to make me quit by just making my job suck and in that case I would rather continue working there just to shove it in there face.  In a third light, I think this could be a result of my introvertedness and letting other things pop-up and me saying “OK that’s fine” since I wouldn’t make things difficult and was easygoing.

I don’t know…what do you think reddit?

TL;DR: My job went from great to awful.  Boss told me I did a tremendous job then demoted me. I got a complaint for talking too much filed on me a week ago for a guy I haven't talked to in a month and I'm introverted and don't say much unless I am asking or answering a question.  The main reason I got the complaint filed on me is that the person I was ""talking"" to has had a decrease in productivity.  They hired a new employee who works fewer hours than me, does not show up on time and sometimes doesn't show up at all - yet she got my new computer, desk, chair, and they're now giving her my hours.  Are they trying to make me quit or what?  What do I do?"
f4k27,0,2011-01-18,How can I develop myself to become a better person( please help?) ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f4k27/how_can_i_develop_myself_to_become_a_better/,"I have been having some trouble in college for the past few years. I used to do computing sciences, and have recently switched ( after failing one year and retaking it) degrees to a degree in Economics.  I have learned HTML and some PHP, that's all I have taken away from 2 years of college doing that degree. I used to have a passion for computing sciences ( and still do) it was because I failed one single class that I just couldn't get past, that I can't go that route of where my passions lie. 

It's not going as bad as it was last year. I am sort of comfortable with things now. However, I fear that if I don't find an internship relating to my current degree, that I will most definitely NOT have a job.  And that's if I graduate, and I emphasise if. 

Now whenever I'm searching for jobs, I find that the demand is either in Web development or something else of the same nature. But no company wants to hire someone like me, despite the novice skills that I have developed in these areas. 
And I am also not confident that I can do these things, even if a degree was not necessary in said vacancy.

That doesn't matter. So I go look for internships, and they only take the top tier students. This shouldn't be a problem either, had it not been for the fact that my previous degree has put down my GPA, somewhat horribly.  And that no matter what I do now, it wouldn't help. 

 I'm still finding it hard to cope with things.
Watching all of my friends graduate, watching them get jobs already. While I'm here, still doing the same thing, and barely holding on. 
It's almost as if I want to quite college already, because it's stressing me out so much, that I haven't slept in the past few weeks. I just don't know what I will do if I fail this year. And it scares the living hell out of me. I can't sleep, suicide even crossed my mind a couple of times.

So what I am saying here is,

I am 21 years old, and I feel like I just don't have any skills. 
Are there places that deal with people like me, in the event that they fail university?   And is it really that bad? 

I just find it that the chance that I make it this year is slim, and the before mentioned fact of all of everyone I know already graduating, is taking its toll on me. 

 I would love a position where I learn something, while working. I value these, even above the degree I'm studying for. I just want some experience. But these sort of positions just don't appear to exist even. 



*Degree names have been renamed to a more ambiguous definition, to protect my identity. I have friends on this website, and I don't want them to know about this.

So Reddit, what do I do? What can I do?

Do I keep going. Try my best despite the feeling that I won't graduate or even pass this year, and hope that I can stand the mental strain that comes with this?
 
Or do I already start working on a contingency plan. And if so, how can a non-university level student get a reasonable entry level starting career?


Sorry for this post, I don't really usually do this.

f4ivi,1,2011-01-18,Should I take the job?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f4ivi/should_i_take_the_job/,"Ok reddit, I'll try and keep this short.....I just graduated from graduate school with a master's degree in elementary education specializing in science/technology education from a top 15 program. During fall semester I was required to complete a full time internship. 

Over the last couple of years I realized that I enjoy teaching middle school more than elementary so I fought to get into a local middle school that has an incredibly high percentage of at-risk, low-performing students (about 95% receive free/reduced priced breakfast and lunch). I excelled beyond my wildest dreams and so did my students. I became a teacher leader in the school and wasn't even a paid employee, it was a dream come true. I had visions and plans of staying after graduation, substituting, while waiting for a position to open. Then it happened...

The last week of my internship I was sexually harassed by my principal....Some background there....it is *very* common for the administrators, teachers, and school personnel to go and have a drink or two after work on Fridays. Everybody needs to cut loose once in a while. I have gone before and stayed for a drink so going out for a drink this time seemed completely harmless. After a bit I noticed that my administrators were on a mission...the principal was drinking straight bourbon and the vice principal was all over the place drinking rum, gin, long island ice teas, you name it. 

After the principal has had a few he grabs my ass and says to me, ""You have no idea how great of a body you have do you?"" and proceeds to ask me to go to his car to, ""kiss and hug him""....WTF???? I tell him very sternly that that was highly inappropriate and I am leaving...before I left he managed to slip in another comment about how I should get a tongue piercing...creep.

I left and was *really* upset. This man was a role model for me, I looked at him kind of like a grandfather figure (he's in his 60's easily, I'm 24) and the fact that he had the audacity to so blatantly hit on me literally made me sick to my stomach. I went home and slept on it...I cried that night. I felt violated. 

I talked to my university (they were LIVID) and my friends for advice. I decided that I would never get drinks with them again (duh) and that since it was an isolated incident and he was clearly under the influence I would brush it off as a onetime mishap.

About 2-3 weeks later, it was my birthday and I was bringing cake up to the front office (note: *always* get the front office people and janitors on your side) and ended up speaking with the lady in charge of booking substitutes. I told her that I was getting my tonsils out over break and would start in the middle of January. Little did I know, but my principal was standing behind me and as I mentioned my surgery he said, ""Now you'll be able to go deeper."" I ALMOST DIED! Seriously, WTF, he said this in front of someone, DURING school hours. This guy has some MAJOR balls. I didn't even know how to respond, I literally just turned and walked away, not saying a word.

I didn't go back to the school after that. I couldn't bring myself to do it and it eats me alive because I love those kids so much and don't want to leave them....Today I received a phone call from the school saying there is a full time opening and they want me to have it (legally they have to interview others but it's mine for the taking) and I don't know what to do. It is my dream career and it is tainted by some pervy old man. 

So, reddit, my question for you is: *what do I do*? I should also mention that I need a letter of recommendation from this man but I haven't seen him to ask...

Sorry it's so long! :)

Oh, and I'm driving for about 3 hrs today so I might not be able to answer for a little. Thank you so much in advance!"

I guess I should introduce myself. Well, I'm 19 years old, I turn 20 next month tho, I currently go to a community college pursuing a double major in Networking Technology and Information Systems Security, I like to play video games and guitar(if you couldnt tell from my username :P). If you wanna know anything else, just message me, I dont wanna drag this out.

Ok so, my issue here is that I'm really not sure what I'm going to do after college.  I currently work at Walmart in the electronics department, I have a 3.8 GPA and only 1 more year of college. Oh and I currently live at home, I have around $6,000 saved up because all I have to pay is my cell phone bill, credit card and gas money. I dont have to worry about loans or anything because I received scholarships that payed for my first 2 years, plus community college is pretty cheap anyways. Right now I'm trying to find another job or internship so I can get some IT job experience so finding a full time job will be a little bit easier when I get out of school.  I'm currently working on getting my CCNA certification, I've finished all of the classes, just need to study up a bit. I'm really not sure what would be the best route to go after school. My current plan is to try to find a job(obviously).  But if I have trouble finding one, I plan on joining the Air Force/Army to do something in one of their IT fields for job experience, or go on to a 4 year university to major in something else IT related, such as Software Information Systems and go from there. I feel that I'm more on track as opposed to most of my friends, who have no idea or any plans for when they get out of college.  I've tried to tell them that having a 4 year degree doesn't guarantee you ANYTHING, but it's like arguing with a brick wall, lol.

I have some comfort knowing that at least I have a couple of plans to fall back on.  But I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to be lost after I'm out of school.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, any comments/suggestions are appreciated.

**TL;DR** - Currently at a community college pursuing a double major in Networking/Information Security with a part time job that's unrelated and so far no job experience. Not sure of what to do after college if I have trouble finding a job. Considering Military or 4 year University.


Edit - Made a TL;DR"

f4vao,14,2011-01-18,Mobile Business ,Mahoney311,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f4vao/mobile_business/,"I hesitated before I decided to share my story because it is very personal. I have never shared it with anyone except close family and friends. Also, it may be a little boring at first and seem long but it is the reason I believe in an afterlife. 


When I was 12 my parents bought a new house across town. Even though it was in the same town I grew up in, unfortunately it ended up being in a different school district so I had to move schools. It ended up being a great thing for me because I met one of my best friends and we'll call her Jackie. 

Jackie and I stayed close throughout school and eventually parted ways and went to different colleges. I ended up moving across the country with my now husband and she stayed closer to home. Although we were so far apart, we remained close and talked on the phone often. 

My husband and I had a baby girl while we were living away. I came home with the baby a few months after she was born so that many of my friends and family could meet her. Jackie stayed the entire day at my side with my new daughter. It is a fond memory for me. 

In September, I got a phone call from Jackie for my birthday. Everything seemed normal and she sounded happy enough. My husband was offered an internship that was back in Chicago where we are from so Jackie and I talked about how excited we both were to have a reunion in January, just a few short months away. We said our good-byes and said that we would talk to each other again soon. 

About a week went by and my husband just left to go to work. I was at home with the baby and put her in her crib for a nap. She had this mobile above her crib that she was in love with. It played pretty music and had little fishies and such that hung down and sang her a lullaby. Eventually,  the baby fell asleep and I was sitting in the living room reading a book. 20 minutes past and all of a sudden I heard the mobile's lullaby. I peeked in the room and sure enough, there was the mobile turning in circles with the music playing as if I had just turned it myself. The baby was sleeping so I just played it off in my mind that there was a kink in the mobile and it just started playing again. 

My husband eventually came home and I of course told him about the mobile. He reassured me that it was probably nothing and we went about our lives. Well, we were all sitting in the living room, baby in arms, and there goes the mobile.. singing its sweet lullaby. This happened SEVERAL times throughout the evening..my husband was not allowed to leave me alone in ANY room by myself. 

The next day I got a phone call that my friend had hung herself the day before all of the mobile business started. You can imagine how ripped apart I was. I didn't really put the mobile business together with the suicide until about a month after everything happened. I strongly believe it was Jackie coming to say she was there. Maybe she knew I was going to find out and she wanted to give me a sign before that she was okay? Maybe she was saying good-bye.

I had a dream that I was walking up to a parked car. I looked in through the driver's side window and my friend, Jackie was sitting in the passenger seat. The only thing she said to me was ""please forgive me"" and I looked at her and just told her I wasn't ready to do that yet and walked onward. I remember ever single detail as if it were real. 

Months later I always felt her presence especially while I was in the car alone. I would tell her to leave me alone and then the feeling would pass.. it took me a long time to forgive her in my heart. 

Eventually I did get to the point of forgiveness and alone, in the car I said out loud to her that I forgave her and knew she was still around. That very same night I had another very real dream that Jackie and I met on a beach that we visited frequently in high school. We embraced and I remember my heart overflowing with love and happiness to get to feel her in my arms again. 

To this day, weird things seem to follow me. I was working once and a vase started to twirl out of the blue. It really freaked out a co-worker of mine but I honestly believe its her just messing around with people around me so she can see a smile on my face :)

I enjoyed it and earned good grades, but by my senior year I stopped doing projects in my spare time. I guess I lost the passion. Questioned whether it was what I wanted to do my whole life. So, I ended up graduating with a CS degree with no specialization. Now I'm having a lot of trouble landing a job. Obviously, I'm not actively seeking a programming/development position. I've taken an interest in areas such as configuration management, release management, program analyst.. etc.. but haven't had much luck as these positions don't seem to be abundant in my area. I can't even land an internship at this point. I just had an interview last week and was told that they didn't think I was a fit for configuration management, but told me they would like to interview me for a development position... and I told the hiring manager in the interview that I wasn't very interested in a development position at the time. Do I need to just go ahead and pursue a dev. position to get my foot in the door? 

I'm just lost at this point. I graduate in May with a 3.9GPA. I feel like I should be able to get on somewhere at least with an internship, but have had no such luck.

Do you recommend grad school for a CS major at all?

f5j4h,0,2011-01-19,Really need help understanding slope algorithms internship,[deleted],gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/f5j4h/really_need_help_understanding_slope_algorithms/,"I am currently doing a GIS internship with the NRCS soil department. They have been using the default ArcMap slope algorithm for their soil maps. I have been tasked with researching the various slope algorithms out there, and to determine which how they all work and which one is most accurate. I have found a few papers around the web that mention various slope algorithms. I posted on the ERSI forums http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/20607-Need-help-with-slope-algorithms-for-my-internship and got some good replies back, but  I am still trying to understand them and figure out a way that I could test something for accuracy. In the first reply on the ESRI forum post, he says:

 ""The ArcGIS slope function is not reprogrammable. However, most slope estimators can be computed as combinations of focal sums. Often this can be done with a couple well-chosen annular neighborhoods (one of them can pick out the corners of a 3 x 3 area and another can pick out the midpoints of the sides).""

Can someone elaborate on focal sums. Also if anyone can help me understand the calculus on the later posts, that would be awesome. "

I've coded little utilities in maybe 5 or 6 different languages, but these are always ""standalone"" and max 1.5K lines in total.

**So, my question is this: Where on earth do I start learning how to do something practical -- how can one learn the developer skill set? ** Even the simplest things in open-source are daunting to me, and I don't know who can help me get started. Often I don't even know what questions to ask (""uhh... where would I even begin in patching this simple bug?"")

I've studied coding, hardware design, and electronics before (degree in computer engineering... obviously not practical enough). I am actually very good at computer science, with a well above average ability to analyse and develop algorithms, and I even have some specialized algorithms knowledge for NLA, PDE, and optimization problems.

For various reasons, I never had any internships as an undergrad doing development. Now that I've graduated and am unemployed, I have no idea what to do (no interest in hardware engineering), because I'm not really qualified for any developer positions. I guess it's not likely I'll end up as a developer, but learning to do some open source stuff would be nice."

Both of us worked our asses off to bring a high-level of support to our users. Now, the other IT person has left to a different job, leaving me to do everything. Including all projects, hardware/software support, database management, etc. The point is, my new corporate IT bosses are not going to replace the missing IT person. They want to transition the support model, i.e. me, to mostly remote support. 

I am pissed. Transitioning to a remote support model will take at least 6 months. Not to mention, I am now the only one with extensive knowledge about this company's setup, applications, etc. 

Zero talk of a raise or title change. I currently make an interns wage, while basically managing everything.

We'd both be saving a lot of money if we shared a room and we spend so much time together that it seems like a logical next step.  I'm all ears... 

**EDIT:** Some more information about our situation:

* I'm 22, she is 21.  I will be graduating in June and she has one more year until she graduates.
* I'm relying on some heavy student loans to get me through college, plus a part time job.  Her parents still provide complete financial support for her
* We hardly fight, are madly in love, do everything together, spend every night together, cook nearly every meal together, and so on.  We both know each other very well (living habits, cleanliness) and definitely agree that we would make good roommates.
* I moved across the country when I was 19 (without my family), so now my entire life is on the West Coast.  It would probably cost me more to move back East after graduation than to stay out here, especially if I can secure a *decent* job / internship to either put off loan repayment or cover the outrageous monthly bills.  The reduced rent from sharing a room is a major factor.
* We have also mentioned getting a house with some other friends to reduce overall costs.
* Neither of us have a car, but you don't need one where we live.  "
f8wlx,14,2011-01-25,Little advice for a CS Undergrad?,thezboe,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/f8wlx/little_advice_for_a_cs_undergrad/,"I'm feeling a little bit down tonight, Reddit, and I'll tell you why. First, an introduction.

I started working at a department on campus in early 2008 and I've worked there ever since.  Now my job pretty much sucks.  Where most of the departments on campus have a fully staffed IT team, we have 2 part time students to cover everything (Server Administration, Help Desk, Database Administration, everything).

To make it short, I've had to pretty much take up all duties from software development for in-house software to Linux administration to helping everyone that walks through the god damn door.

My goal in life, however, is not to be a Sys Admin for the rest of my life, but to be a software engineer.  I have around a 3.75 major GPA and I have almost no accomplishments of my own, save for a MUD I programmed in my second semester in Java, which is my strongest language. Sure I know some C programming, and I've touched on Python, Prolog, Haskell, Ruby.  I know concepts like UML, Relational Databases, Design Patterns.

I'm at a point where everyone around me is getting internships and jobs at companies like Microsoft and Google.  I just feel like I'm getting left behind.  Every campus job I've applied for to try and break into software engineering has never warranted an interview, much less even a response. I've sent out my resume and applied to all the internships I could possible think of for this upcoming Summer, so I'm hoping for something promising there.

I thought just getting good grades in my classes would be enough to get me a decent job out of college, but I'm realizing now that that is not the case.  Hopefully it's not too late.

Why am I posting this?  Well I just need some advice, Reddit. What can I do to make myself more attractive to a software development position?  I think it may be my resume that needs the most work.  I like the look and feel of it, but the information on it is not really great for a dev job.

Any help is appreciated.

I would say that I have more experience than most freshmen in engineering, as I am already starting some of the core classes (circuits, signal processing). However, many of the companies I have talked to at job fairs are simply not interested in freshmen (understandable, as they are looking for eventual full time employees). I'd like to think that I have a decent resume (prior research experience, albeit in a different science, high GPA, etc.)

I guess my questions would be:

1. How should I go about approaching companies at job fairs? Is it advisable to mention awards, but add that I haven't had any prior internship / engineering experience outside of coursework?

2. What are my chances of getting an internship as a freshman? I hope in my undergraduate career to get an opportunity to work at both a start-up and a large corporation.

3. What should I put in cover letters if I don't really know which area of EE I'm interested in? I am enjoying signal processing a bit more than circuits at the moment, but I don't know enough about the field to really understand the current technologies and research. Should I mention that I'm open to anything, or try to narrow down my interests?

f9iqv,1,2011-01-26,"I feel like my mother is being controlling and prone to anger.  Is her behavior atypical, am I a bad son, or is it all in my head?",ButMomIm22,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/f9iqv/i_feel_like_my_mother_is_being_controlling_and/,"Backstory: I'm a 22 year old male, who's spent the past 3 years or so languishing in pretty moderate depression.  I blew my chances at a nice public college, spent a couple failing semesters at community college (my mom insisted I shouldn't drop out or take a gap semester/year ""because I'd be too lazy to find a job""), and just generally had a miserable time.  Anyway, lately I've found I have more energy and capacity to do things, and I'm willing to give college and life in general another shot.

My father passed away when I was around 12 years old, so my mom has raised me most of my adult life on her own.

My mom seems to be great with other people.  She has many friends and is close to many family members, all who seem to think that she's great and that I'm a horrible burden according to her.

For example, my mom's said that family members and friends have suggested that she:

*  Send me out to the Midwest (I live in the Northeast corridor) where I can work as a farmhand/take care of aging relatives/the disabled to learn some discipline so I can stop ruining things for her and my sister.
*  Have me live with my Korean war vet grandfather who would teach me some discipline and how people were expected to live before the hippies ruined everything or something.
*  Join the peace corps/army/navy (to learn some discipline)
*  Sign up for an internship program several states over so that I can... learn some discipline.  That stopped when she saw what the bill for such programs are.  (More than state college)
*  Drop out of community college and give up my dreams of going back to a four year school and ""get a file clerk job like [Harvey Pekar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Pekar),"" so that I quit wasting her money/quit making her anxious about my future.
*  25-30 is the new 21 in this era/economy, and I'm immature for my age, so I shouldn't move out anytime soon.

She says horrible things about me going to college and occasionally having trouble, like that I'm sending my sister with moderate Asperger's to a state institution ""where she'll be raped,"" unless I graduate ASAP, leaving enough cash for my sister to go to college herself (apparently, there is a fine line between living in a state institution and getting a liberal arts degree).

She often brings up that she worked as a state auditor in Missouri when she was 18 and had a free ride to a state college, and that I'm ""just different"" than her, and ""very much like a child.""  She brings up random stuff, like that she was buying her own clothes when she was 16 (but she specifically told me I'd be asking too much if I wanted a car/rides to get a job when I was just getting old enough to work).

She also frequently explodes over small things.  For example, I forgot to start the dishwasher after breakfast this morning, and missed a little splatter of grease on the stove last night (which wiped up in about 3 seconds).  She went off the handle about how I'm disrespectful to this household and could never live on my own.  And how my room smells sometimes when I'm putting off laundry (like I'm the only 22 year old who forgets to do laundry).  And about how people like me, when they live in houses, often the house has to be cleaned by professionals or demolished before the property can even be sold.

She also brings up my dorm room in college a lot.  When I lived in a single and was deeply depressed about 2 1/2 years ago, I made a bit of a mess of my room and didn't bother to use a hamper.  I also had a few coffee grounds on a table next to my coffee maker.  As a result, the room kind of reeked.  I've tried to explain to her that I wasn't the same back then, but she consistently uses this as evidence I can't move out anytime soon or support myself.  She also, oddly enough, brings up that I was a ""manipulative and sarcastic three year old.""

She's also said that if I get a job, I have to start paying rent, and that she won't let me move out to a place that isn't up to her standards.  For example, she doesn't like the apartments in my upscale town, ""because the people who live there might smoke/sell pot/you might get mugged.""  (I'm pretty sure it's just mostly low-income families and single people who can't afford a big house.)  And she doesn't want me moving/lodging in to a suburb in a less expensive area, ""because people aren't nice in most places out here like in the midwest.""  And she has control as she owns the title to my car, so I need to get enough cash for both a car and the downpayment and income stream for an apartment.  Every time I've wanted to leave the house against her will (say to visit my girlfriend, or go to an informal party with friends), she's said she'll call the cops and either say the car was stolen or file a missing person's report.  I know it's probably a bluff, but I don't want to test her.

She's fine around other people, but she seems to get really irritable when it's just me.  The only exception is my girlfriend, who she has issues with due to her atheism and the fact that she, too, has had trouble doing well in college until recently.  She doesn't outright attack my girlfriend, but she gets angry and stuff with me like she normally does when my girlfriend is over.  My girlfriend, who has very laid back parents, thinks my mom has issues.

My mom also tends to say that I'm a ""mentally ill child,"" even though depression is like the common cold of abnormal psychology, and I've recovered much.  I no longer take antidepressants, I get myself out of bed, I cook dinner for the family, and I get my work done on time for school.  I'd say I'm pretty functional for a person who is ""mentally ill.""

Anyway, I've had enough of this, and I'm working hard on raising my grades (depression GPA is a real pain, academic-aspirations-wise), trying to find a job to save up some money, and hopefully in the near future, I can either make enough money that I can get a new place to live, and hopefully either negotiate having her let me take the car (she has her own), or buy one of my own.  Sadly, the economy seems to be dead at the entry level in my town.  People with degrees and more experience than me are competing with me for the same jobs in this economy, after all.  Still, every time my mom and I get into a fight, I feel all the more committed to get a job.  I'm thinking I might try a temp agency at the end of this term, or even try to see if they can offer flexible hours durring this current semester.

I just feel like she's dragging me down with all the anger and negativity, and I want to move on in my life.  Yes, I'll probably make some mistakes living on my own, and maybe I might even have to move back if things really go sour, but I don't think just dealing with this current situation indefinitely is healthy.  I feel like 22 is old enough to start living my own life.

Am I being antiproductive to the household by wanting to leave?  Are these behaviors typical for the higher-strung type of parent?  Am I setting myself up for failure by trying to leave at this point?  Is my frustration at this household ""all in my head"" as my mom says?  Is there anything I can do to make things more endurable while I save up cash to leave?

Anyway, sorry if I sound kind of mopey or frustrated.  I'm just tired of having so many frustrating, demoralizing things happen, and my mom acting like it's good, productive parenting.

**tl;dr:** My mom seems extremely uptight and prone to anger.  Are my suspicions correct?  Is there anything I can do to improve my situation in the short term, while I save up money to move out?"

Some background information: I graduated from a state university last April with a bachelor's in TV/Film production. That summer I worked a post-graduate paid internship, and then a salaried job for a production company until December, when I was laid off. After a month of collecting unemployment and applying to probably over 100+ companies, I am finally getting some offers, these two being the most appealing:

Offer 1: Part-time position at a well-known retail store

Offer 2: Full-time intern at a well-known (within the industry) video/tv company

I would like to take both jobs, but realistically will only be able to choose one because training for both are happening the same days. The retail position pays fairly well, and it would help my social life, because there are dozens of employees (including a few of my friends), not to mention I would be able to take advantage of the employee discount and other perks. The only real con to this job is that it could be somewhat of a dead-end job, in the sense that it won't help further my career in the TV/film industry whatsoever.

The internship is another story. It's an intense 10-month training internship that pays nothing for the first two months, but increases every two months afterwards, so that by the 7th month or so, I'm banking. However, the internship is extremely hands on and in depth and can basically be viewed as graduate school or boot camp for the TV industry, so it would be amazing experience and definitely give me an ""in"" at pretty much any major network or production company. The cons: Obviously, no pay for two months is a cause for concern, but as long as my unemployment keeps coming in, I'll theoretically have enough for gas/living expenses. The internship is basically a competition with other interns for a full-time position within the company after the 10 months, and after all that time, I might not get it and be back where I started (unemployed). It's also about an hour's commute, there and back, every day. The hours are somewhat erratic and long, so that on some nights I wouldn't get home till 8pm or later. My social life would essentially suffer, as I probably won't have the energy/money to do much when I'm not working.

I'm leaning toward the internship, just because it would help me and my future career, but it's a big risk to take. Can anyone offer any insight/suggestions?"

backstory so I'll get right to the point.

I went to Church with my family last Sunday. I went with my step-dad,
his girlfriend, and my brother, who was adopted by my birth mom 
before she passed away.

Well, we are a odd family anyways.

The minister is halfway through a direct quote, ""... comes great 
responsibility,"" when an old man in front of me starts hacking, 
coughing, and the choking. He falls down on the bench gasping. 
Luckily he coughs up the impeding object (a tooth from his dentures
lol) before any serious damage is done.

The minister praises God and we all go about our business of prayer,
interrupted only once more by the medics who were responding to a 
911 call. Turns out one of the medics was my aunt, my dead mother's 
sister. 

Now, I had not seen her since the funeral about 10 years ago.
I remembered her afro perm and was happy to see she got it cut,
whether the reason was for work, I don't know, because before I could
talk to her, my step-dad's girlfriend starts acting like a royal bitch.
I never see her this way, and I can't be too sure what caused her
reaction. My brother gets upset too, and me and my step-dad have to
straighten things out.

Fastforward to last night.

I am with my girlfriend, who is much more honest with her feelings
than my step-dad's girlfriend, and I tell her about last week. She 
tells me that I should forget about it and focus on the problem at
hand. You see, I am an intern for a research lab that does
experiments with uppers on lab mice. Last month I stole some mice
and drugs.

Well, I used to keep the drugs in my car, and I'd keep the mice as
pets. Every so often I bring the mice with me to show my friends and
stuff. Sometimes they get loose. Sometimes they get loose on uppers.
Sometimes they get loose on uppers while carrying uppers along with 
them.

Last week when the old man was choking, I thought it was on my shit.
I freaked out. While my dad was trying to help my aunt and his 
girlfriend, I was at my car counting and recounting all the mice and
pills. Needless to say I sampled one or two while making a note to
add it to the final total. When I was satisfied that everything was
accounted for, I took a mouse and left it in the Church before 
going home. I resolved to keep all the contra in my apartment so that
this sort of thing doesn't happen again.

My girlfriend tells me that I can't keep the contra at my apartment
anymore. Well fuck, I say, where am I going to keep this shit? I 
don't know, she says, but I can't stand living with mice running all
over the floor, and, no, don't say you'll use cages. I know you hate
those things.

It's true.

So I bargain, and, Reddit, this is where I need your help. I say, if
I get rid of the contra, can we have anal sex? She has always said 
no to me before.

I hid the loot (in the Church lols) and we did it.

Reddit, if I drive around with my e-brake on, does it wear only the
e-brake pads? Or should I get someone to look at it?

TL;DR
Got anal sex, but not sure about my brakes. "

I am a maths student and i want to apply for an internship at ICAP(inter-dealer money broker). Firstly, I am not sure whether i can submit an application for both Business Services and Broking. I'd like to do this to increase my chances and because im not sure which one i want to do more.

Secondly, I am quite ignorant when it comes to business. However, i want to educate myself by reading books on business and finances. Could anyone tell me what are the skills needed and qualifications needed to become a broker or to work in Business services.

Lastly, Could you give me an idea of what would be my average day if i was to get the internship.

Tl;dr Applying for an internship need some info

faduj,1,2011-01-27,"Reddit, I'm losing my job, getting kicked out, and I'm a complete mess. What can I do?",cakenbacon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/faduj/reddit_im_losing_my_job_getting_kicked_out_and_im/,"I'm 22 years old and I've worked as a pastry chef for close to two years. I interned at this place for school and when my internship ended they hired me on for a full time pastry chef position. As I was getting ready to leave work on Tuesday two of my supervisors told me they found out that I (along with many others) am being laid off on Friday. They're close friends, so they were very upset about it, and told me if I wanted to leave now they would understand it and would be more than happy to act as references for my time at the company. I declined, partly from shock and partly because I didn't want to lose out on unemployment benefits, and said I would work the rest of the week.

Recently I moved in with my boyfriend at his parent's home, we share a room together and I pay monthly rent to his mother. I didn't decide to move in because of finances, I moved in because we saw so little of each other that I was afraid of the relationship failing.

When I got home, I told my boyfriend what happened and we sat down together with his mother to tell her what was going on. Her first reaction was to tell me to get my things together and move back in with my parents and I'm completely devastated that her biggest concern was the fact that I might miss rent. I paid nearly $2000 on furniture for the move, which may not sound like much but for me it was a huge expense, and now I don't know what to do about the furniture. If I take it with me, my boyfriend will have nothing but a set of shelves and a free-standing closet. But if I leave it here, I'll have spent $2000 for him to have a nicely furnished room.

Last week I got a used car, my previous car was totaled in an accident that sent me to the hospital and made me miss work. My finances are already tight but I was just making it and starting to get back on my feet. I'll get less than $150 a week on unemployment and I've never written a resume in my life. And I've got to get all of my things back to my parent's house by this weekend. I'm in shock, I'm extremely upset, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do besides cry and eat nutella straight from the jar.

tl;dr: Basically within a couple of weeks my life has been turned completely upside down and I have absolutely no idea what to do.

I'm sorry if I've rambled at all, I'm having trouble thinking straight these last couple of days."
fbzr6,11,2011-01-30,Near the breaking point...What do I do?,beyondhopeless,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fbzr6/near_the_breaking_pointwhat_do_i_do/,"I think I'm nearing the point of depression, or maybe I'm already there. I'm 20, in college, and I don't know where I'm heading in my life. I'm usually alone in my room trying to get some work done. Occasionally, I'll go a for a stroll alone around campus. Every once in awhile, I'll ask some friends to do something together. Sometimes, they agree, but usually, no. Aside from that, I don't have much contact with them. I don't get invited to hang out with them or do something together, so I don't really know if really are my friends. I guess not. I've tried doing the usual things on campus. Get involved with groups/clubs/teams/etc.  I usually try to strike up conversations with random people, but nothing really happens beyond the typical conversation starters and maybe some other things, but everyone has their own group of friends already and they usually leave me alone.  So I'm pretty much end up being alone, regardless of what I try to do.
I'm also worried about the future. I'll be done with college in about a year. I don't know what to do with my life from there. For the past few years, I've taken random jobs that have nothing to do with what want to do or enjoy; jobs that other people don't want.  At one point, I wanted to go into the actuarial field, but I'm not so sure anymore. I've sent out loads of resumes/cover letters in hopes of some kind of internship, but I've yet to make it anywhere. Not even an interview. 
I feel so lost. I don't have the support of my friends, and I've probably lost the support of my family. I'm close to having no future ahead of me. So why bother going on?"
fckbf,1,2011-01-31,I need some job advice!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fckbf/i_need_some_job_advice/,"I'm in my last semester of college. I am a business major with a minor in Information Technology. I'm really interested in getting a job in the IT field. I've applied to a ton of jobs but I've only had 1 interview. It hasn't been too long so hopefully some other jobs will request interviews. 

I'm most likely going to get a job offer from the small IT firm I interviewed with. The problem is that the starting salary is only 35k. I'm being told that they give out yearly bonuses and that I would move to 40k after a 1 year trial period. 

The problem is that I've interned at a F500 company, and they paid me about $16 an hour. I feel that I deserve a larger salary as a graduate. If my internship was a full-time salaried position, I would start at 50k - 55k as a consultant with no benefits. They were planning on hiring me upon graduation, but they ended up hiring interns who graduated and could start immediately. 

My first choice is to work for the F500, but they don't have a job for me. Should I try to get back in at the F500 as an intern after graduation or accept the actual job offer. As an intern, I'll make $16 an hour again. I'd hope to get a full-time position after in the department, or have them place me somewhere else in the company.

The company offering the job is tiny, and the interviewer asked several questions regarding if I'd stay in the area and work for there long term. He made it a point to tell me that it hurts the company when individuals quit within a year.

Should I accept the IT position for 35k and use it as a backup if nothing else works out?"
