To prepare, I've been studying CTCI, lots of Leetcode, and my notes and textbook from my recent Alg/DS class. From what I'd read on this subreddit and elsewhere, it seems like that's what they ask of interns at said company.

However, I was browsing stories of other interns and found this blog post:

http://danieru.com/2012/12/30/

This guy apparently had one of his interviews on bit manipulation. I haven't done bit manipulation since a class on it over a year ago, nor had I read anywhere else about MS having questions on it, I didn't think it was something they ask intern candidates about.

Should I focus on re-learning and becoming good at bit manipulation? This would take a substantial amount of time away from my other review, and I've got only about a week left. In addition, are there any other areas I'm missing that I should focus on?

Thanks!"

5rctzf,2,2017-01-31,Issue with Boss from Best/Most Recent Internship - How to Approach with Potential Employers?,ProjectMobius,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5rctzf/issue_with_boss_from_bestmost_recent_internship/,"Hello! I'm an undergraduate journalism student at a well-known university, and am graduating this June. Over the past fall, I worked as an editorial intern at a data journalism and visualization company in southern California. I was able to gain a large amount of experience and learned a number of things at my internship, and was able to write articles which featured on MSN and AOL, as well as other organizations.

However, while my work at my internship was fun and productive, my boss (who had newly become manager of the editorial department, and had no role in the internship program that brought me there) despised me. She viewed any action I would take that she did not approve of as me antagonizing and challenging her - although this was not the case - and reflected this in my final evaluation. For example, this excerpt from my eval:

""During a recent week, ____ asked about potential freelance opportunities — as the head of the department, I make those types of decisions. The hiring process includes members of the HR team and often executives at the company as well. ____ , unsatisfied with my answer, started asking other staff in my department about ways to circumvent that system. Not only did this put my staff in an awkward position, it was completely disrespectful of the direction I had given him a few days prior. When I spoke with him about it, ____ focused almost 100% on how his behavior was being misinterpreted, rather than taking responsibility for his actions. This was deeply troubling. Not only was it insubordinate, but it also indicated that none of my feedback about workplace behavior was internalized.""

To make a few things clear:

- When I first asked her about freelance opportunities, she (incorrectly, which I was unaware of) mentioned that it was a decision made by her and two other members of the editorial department. These were the only two other people I asked about freelancing.

- When I explained this to her, she insisted that she had told me something else, and felt that I had acted out of dissatisfaction and anger. To clarify, this was in early November, and the editorial calendar had just been filled out for December; she had previously told me that she would inform me of whether I would get work in December, but never communicated to me at any point before the editorial calendar was completed (i.e., she either lied to me or broke her promise).

- As made clear in the evaluation, she viewed this as ""disrespectful"" and ""insubordinate,"" although I was acting on false information she had given me and was honest about what had happened when I spoke to her.

So, needless to say, I don't have a reference I can use at this company. However, the only two other jobs I've had - interning at a local radio station and taking photos for a golf resort - don't have the same credentials as this internship, meaning I feel it's important I include this internship on my resume.

When future employers ask why I don't have a reference from this employer, how should I respond? Any help you have regarding the situation would be extremely useful, as I want to ensure that personal conflicts between me and my former boss don't inhibit my ability to get a job after I graduate.

Note: I have contacted my university internship advisor asking if he would be able to provide a reference for me, but he declined, saying that he ""just can’t unbundle the various accounts of performance and chemistry."" I wrote weekly logs about my internship, which he read, but he wasn't in any way personally involved with my work at the company."
5rdnxa,2,2017-02-01,Recent Grad - Resume help (Should I include independent tech work on my resume? How?),spinfip,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5rdnxa/recent_grad_resume_help_should_i_include/,"Hey all - So here's my situation:

I recently got my bachelor's in computer security, and I'm trying to get my foot in the door of the industry. I did an internship doing web development for a fairly recognizable firm, but unfortunately I haven't yet been able to turn that into a full-time job. My boss there liked me and is willing to put in a good word to other managers, but he runs a very small group and didn't have the need for another full-timer.

I still have hope for getting in at a different department where I did my internship, but I'm not putting all my eggs in that basket. I've been working on rewriting my resume, since the one I've been using has not worked while I was in school. I wasn't able to get any work in my field, and only a handful of interviews in several years. This means that my only 'official' job experience is from the low-paying service and retails jobs I worked while I was in school, and my military experience - which was in a completely different field, and ended in 2011.

The only way I've yet made money from tech skills was from ad hoc jobs I'd get from time to time. They ranged from hardware repairs/upgrades, virus removal, custom builds, network setups, and other stuff like that. I advertised on Craigslist, and put up fliers in my school hallways to get clients. My only semi-consistent customer was an internet cafe which would call me up every couple months or so to help out with their various needs. Unfortunately that business is now closed, as the owner was diagnosed and tragically succumbed to cancer - so there isn't really anyone from this period of work which I could use as a reference! I've been doing work like this for almost ten years, but not with any consistency - it might be months between jobs, as it was basically just to supplement beer money to my regular job.

So, in a single compound sentence, my question is this: Should I address the long-term IT work I've done independently to supplement my income on my resume, and if so, how should I talk about it?

Side note about the aforementioned military experience - This has been a mixed blessing for me. On the one hand, I was able to get through my bachelor's with zero student loans, but on the other, I spent several years doing it while other people were doing their bachelor's. Today, I am getting uncomfortably close to thirty years old without having worked a day in my field, and I'm concerned that this might reflect poorly on me for people reading my resume. You out there with hiring experience, does this enter into your perception of a resume that comes to your inbox? Or am I just desperately trying to fill in the blanks of the hundreds of form rejection letters I've read over the years?

==PRE-EMPTIVE EDIT==
While my degree is in security, I have the skills and learning ability to do almost any entry-level job. I wouldn't mind getting into application or web development, administration, networking, or any others. Hell, at this point I'd be thrilled to get in doing tier 1 tech support. Mostly I'm looking to get experience in the field and enough income to start getting certifications without having to sell my plasma or turn off the heat in my apartment."

I'm senior at a UC school and I'll be graduating in the spring with a BS in mathematics. My original plan was to go to graduate school for math but I've come to realize the job prospects aren't exactly what I'm looking for so I've become interested in pursuing alternate masters programs.

I'm heavily drawn towards computer science as it's very similar to math (essentially the same thing), but I just don't have the knowledge base required to enter these programs. Now I do have a lot of transferable skills but I really only know a basic amount of programming such as basic Python and C++. My current university does not allow outside majors to take comp sci so it's a bust.

So I suppose I have a few questions. Is it reasonable to self-study/take open courses from local universities to achieve a comparable degree of competency to that of a Bachelors in Computer science ? I was planning to take a year off, move back home (sucks but hey sometimes you gotta do it) and try to find internships or anything while studying for the GRE and learning various comp sci topics. Will I run into any issues? What do you guys recommend? 

And to note, I'm not just interested in the jobs. I find many aspects of computer science vividly thrilling.

I'm coming down to the deadline, and have simply been putting off choosing a path.

**Worries:** After having a chat with my advisor today about applying for schools and my fear of failing or finding no job, I'm finding myself scrambling for a direction of study. My main issue is simply I'm worried I won't be able to compete in my field, or there will be no jobs after I graduate. I have a few ideas that I believe could set me up decently for an employable future.

**Interests:** 

* I enjoy learning languages, and have taken a liking to German after 2 years of schooling and two visits to Germany. I was thinking of possibly picking a second language.

* I love computers and can see myself working with either software or hardware. I know Math is a requirement in the CS field, but luckily I love it!

* Really interested in all types of cultures! Recently took a Culturally Geography class and loved it all!

**Dislikes:** 

* Love math but cannot stand biological sciences. They seem super intimidating and I perform poorly in these classes.

**Ideas:** I have been thinking about following what I love and furthering my knowledge of the German language, and syncing up with a major/minor to match and broaden my options. Possibly even learning a different language!

I had thought that doing something with a combination of CS and German would be cool, and could put my language skills to use. Possibly even opening up some job or internship opportunities in Germany.

I'm just looking for some input or insight on what my options could be. Anyways, thanks in advance guys! :)"

I posted a question on this sub before, but it didn't really gain much traction - likely my mistake. Going to try again now with hopefully a more specific, better-worded question :)

There's a lot of emphasis for undergraduate students to obtain the coveted summer internship. I'm enrolled in a 2 year post-bacc CS program, and I just began a few weeks ago. Because I'll graduate in winter of 2019 I only have two summer to get that summer internship (the last summer hopefully turning into fulltime offer). My problem is this summer.

Right now I'm only taking Intro to CS and Discrete Math. I don't have a GPA or resume to even begin applying because I literally just started the course a few weeks ago. In fact, I most likely have already missed the boat for internships this summer, which is fine because I don't think I crossed that 'bridge' where I'm eligible to apply for summer internships having only taken intro classes. My question is, am I doomed if I don't get an internship this summer? It seems more realistic for me to look at fall or winter internships since I'll be more advanced in my degree program. Do you find that it is only the large tech companies that have structured summer internship programs? Should I be focusing on smaller, start-up companies for non-summer internships? I was told that the big4 have internship programs all year round..

My ideal goal is to end up at a large tech company when I graduate. 

Thank you verryyy much!

So right now I am working IT for my university's medical school. It's a basic walk-up support desk that pays $8.00 an hour. It is nice because I am able to work on my classwork during my downtime, and I have picked up a few tidbits here and there. Not to mention it has been flexible around my schoolwork. In addition to this I recently began work on 2 research projects that are a slow start now, but will require more time as they continue.

Now for my dilemma. Last semester I won an internship via my team placing first in a Hackathon. Though communication was fickle the past few months, they have finally got back to me and would like me to begin this month. It is a 6-12 week internship (yes it varies that much apparently), and will pay $12.00 an hour. Now, like most college kids, money is definitely a concern of mine, and some more pay would be helpful. In addition to this, it sounds like most interns receive a job offer, plus I would get to be doing some work for some bigger name companies. It sounds like it is a good place to learn and grow, but maybe not the best place to try and plan out a career.

I am currently trying to figure out how to balance these all. I am planning on asking my IT job to cut my hours from 14.5-17 hours down to 8-10 hours, as well as seeing if my partner on one of my projects would be willing to work weekends or squeeze in time earlier in the day. 

However, I am not too confident that all of these will work out as well as I would hope. I already had a bit of an issue with my IT job due to me getting my boss my Comp Sci lab dates a bit late. Due to them being flexible around school, but also restrictive on hours (19.5 max) I don't think they will have anybody available to fill in the holes I would leave by cutting my hours nearly in half.

I am fairly torn on what decision is best, and I could definitely use some advice. If there is any other information that I may have left out that would be of use for guidance, please let me know and I will deliver to the best of my ability! Thanks!"

So now I have to decide, I can take a minor in Math and graduate in May 2019 or I can -not- take a minor and graduate in Fall 2018. I'm looking to get out as early as I can but at the same time I've heard that most places look for grads coming out in the spring and so I don't want to have like 6 months of downtime waiting on hiring to start picking up.

I'm currently seeking a summer internship but prospects have been dismal so far. On my resume I don't have any personal projects, just school work and club involvement (ACM member, IEEE officer), but in lieu of an internship this summer I'll work on fluffing that part up.

5rgfey,31,2017-02-01,IAmA Engineer,Dunnohowimanengineer,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5rgfey/iama_engineer/,"Hello!

I am a mechanical engineer for a leading aerospace design and manufacturing company with about 3 years experience.  I used to browse this subreddit for laughs, questions, and a place to learn.

I began in the gas turbine industry, and switched to aerospace after some heavy thinking.  After gaining experience in the aerospace and turbomachinert industry for some time, I wanted to share some skills I think are truly important in being an engineer, and things you should not panic over as I once did.

If you are a mechanical engineering student and are looking to enter the aerospace or machinery industry, here are the things I think are most important, in no particular order.

Solid modeling, FEA, MATLAB, materials, document control, fasteners, corrosion, general organization, ergonomics, manufacturing, relative costs, GD&amp;T, drafting and design, heat transfer, and combustion.

These skills are skills that I exercise weekly, but should be taken with a grain of salt.  Solid modeling is pretty important as a mechanical.  More so than differential equations or calculus, unless you're designing new product in which case they might be equal.  FEA will make you tremendously marketable to any engineering company, and I highly encourage anyone to start using it.  Do not cut corners with FEA.  FEA in the hands of a good engineer is useful.  FEA in the hands of a bad engineer is dangerous.  MATLAB is awesome for running iterations and calculations for convergence, and will make you sharp as a tack and great at meeting deadlines.  Understanding strength of materials, grain structure, and capabilities in temperature varying environments will also help narrow designs very quickly.  As far as document control goes...it's tough to learn that in school, but understanding how organizational systems like Windchill or SAP give employers an idea of how you understand the document pipeline.  Knowing fasteners is a pretty admirable skill.  To this day, I'm not sure I've found an accurate equation for torque.  When an applicant can talk about proof load or pre load on bolts and clamp force, I'm always really impressed.  This kind of goes hand in hand with materials and corrosion.  If you can start learning about galvanic corrosion and coating applications to prevent this, that's a feather in your cap.  If you can, try to start in a machine shop as an intern, even if it's for free.  I did, and it was a straight path to my career.  You learn a tremendous amount about cutting tools, manufacturing methods, cost, material, inspection, and operations.  Sometimes engineers will design parts that just simply cannot be made at a reasonable cost.  The ability to design with manufacturing methods in mind will save you days, if not weeks.  Of course, additive manufacturing is closing that gap, but until then, it's important.  GD&amp;T and drafting is also pretty key.  You'll work with designers if you're lucky who will help draft drawings, but understanding a drawing, and being able to use GD&amp;T effectively can save a lot of money.  A lot.  It can be the difference between scrapping 1,000 parts and saving them.  That's always appreciated.  Heat transfer and combustion are important, but not to the level you would imagine.  Basics.  Nothing groundbreaking.  I have to open a text book every time I need information.

These tips aren't to scare you, or intimidate you.  I graduated with a 3.1 GPA from a school nobody bats an eye at.  I just had exposure to a lot of these skills early on, and employers like that.  Remember, you are a problem solver, not a number cruncher.  Formulas are plentiful, and damn near anyone can use them, but that doesn't make you an engineer.  Solving the problem efficiently does.  I got wrapped up in the technical game in school, and while it brought my GPA up to where it needed to be, I never use it.  I use skills that were left outside of school, and I think there's something to be said for that.

Don't panic.  Stay passionate, and you'll get there.  Feel free to ask any questions."

Most of these JSP files are really old files that have not been touched in years and are no longer in use, but still exist in the version control. The errors that are in there exist mostly because the signature of the Java function being called from within those files has changed over time, but those unused files were never updated.

Both teams seemed really great and the problems they're solving are interesting to me. I'm worried that taking a 16 month commitment to one company will prevent me from exploring other things. 

But then again, I talked to the manager at IBM and he said the position includes both development and some qa within the security area --- which really interests me. While the product of the startup only tangentially interests me.

Has anyone had experiences as an IBM intern? What was it like?

EDIT: not sure why I got downvoted (is the hate for IBM that real lol) but thank you everyone for your insights!"

If this is too much - you can probably skim and skip your way to the last few paragraphs just fine. 

I'm currently a Junior, credit-wise, at University of Washington's Seattle campus. I've got a rad internship that I scored through the NASA Space Grant, and I've been working there since June. I mostly program and do applications development for our various NASA contracts, but sometimes do embedded systems work. This whole internship thing is going great, and has let me learn a ton about what I want to do for a career. For a long time, I wanted to be an aero engineer but after learning C++ and programming a large amount I'm instead shooting for EE with an Embedded Systems focus.

Problem is, school isn't so great for me. My freshman year I was struggling with my academics and wanted to seek help for ADHD, but was stopped from doing this by my parents (through numerous unfortunately effective methods). I got treatment at the end of my freshman year, got a job in Seattle so I could stay away from my parents (and so I could afford therapy to help me learn to learn betterererer), and felt like things were looking up. I ended this year with a truly wretched GPA, &lt;2.50. I only had three weeks of medication-given clarity and solid work ethic to go on, and it wasn't enough to turn around seven weeks of being a bad student.

Sophomore year was tough but I don't have any large regrets. It felt like my first time ever actually learning or engaging in the learning process, and it was really hard work. I bombed a few midterms at first, but I was able to take these and learn from them and improve my study methods. I managed to recover from potentially failing a few of my classes to passing (2.5-2.90 GPA range), and felt like I had really picked up a ton during this fall quarter. Winter quarter I didn't catch the signs of depression until far too late (which is on me, to be honest), as I was sleeping through all of my morning alarms regardless of when I went to bed and how much I slept, and felt generally incredibly apathetic. I got that under control, but not until the end of that quarter. I ended up failing linear algebra. I was also unable to get into a statics class at UW since I had lost my pre-engineering status, so I rode the bus an hour north twice a week to take statics at UW Bothell. I ended up getting a 3.6 in this course, which felt awesome!

Spring quarter was one I was determined to tackle head on though, even with my absolutely mental 15 cr classload (this... was a mistake): Mechanics of Materials, Dynamics, Thermodynamics, and a second try at Linear Algebra. I tried so hard this quarter, and spent most of my time in the library studying. I downloaded extra textbooks for my classes and did tons of practice problems, and tried so hard to study in the weeks leading up to my midterms and finals, but still left this quarter with nothing higher than a 2.7 (my linear algebra retake...). This was truly my fault: I should've considered the realities of my learning abilities and where I was at mentally, before taking this courseload, instead of rushing to meet the application deadline for A&amp;A. Unsurprisingly, I was rejected from A&amp;A at UW. Additionally, I filed two hardship withdrawals to get grades cleared from transcript (a 1.7 and 1.5), but the office responsible for this at UW lost my paperwork over the summer and didn't notify me of this until a week before the beginning of Autumn quarter 2016.

I wasn't upset though, because it was at this point that I was beginning to realize that I really enjoyed the work I was doing at my internship, and my internship had offered to let me stay on indefinitely while I got my academics sorted out (I owe my boss, big time). I retook one course in the fall, and didn't take it seriously. Between working 8hrs 3 times a week, commuting, and getting my rescue dog settled in, I let my academics slip in priority. I got a 2.6 in this class: lower than my original grade of a 2.7 (ohgod). This (winter) quarter I decided to just take a 498 (pretty much just elective credits) in CUDA computing and programming. This is going well, and its a really enjoyable topic. I also cut down to only working two days a week, so I could focus better on school.

I'm applying to EE at UW and I don't think I'm going to get in - EE here has a small list of prereqs, and I completed most of those my freshman year with the bare minimum acceptable grade. I'm not really sure what to do now, though. I don't want to give up on engineering, as I know I can succeed in an engineering workplace and feel confident in my ability to get a degree (despite immediate family and some friends saying I should quit engineering).... but, my transcript is really weighing me down. In a move of highly ""debatable"" foresight, I've adopted a dog too so moving across the country for a different degree program is really tough. And again, my transcript is awful.

I'm not sure what to do, but I thought I'd offer this background as some context. Should I just choose a liberal arts degree, or other ""easy"" degree so that I can just get a basic degree and try to go back for a postbaccalaureate degree? My boss has stopped short of outright saying it, but its been implied that I'd be hired if I got an engineering degree. 

Should I do the aforementioned ""easy degree"" thing, but spend a lot of time building my programming portfolio and research portfolio (SBIR + STTR proposal writing at work, for example) and just try to apply for jobs I think I'm qualified for? I can write proposals at work, and my main project right now is pretty much building an entire application from the ground up. I've also got a healthy number of tech demos on github.

Are there other degree programs in the Seattle area that would be more understanding of my past, or have programs that are smaller and allow for more individuality? 

I'm really open to any number of options. I just want to get a *salaried* job in *something* related to systems-level programming, since I have come to enjoy this type of programming so much. But most positions require a degree, and I'm just not sure how I can progress from where I am now to getting a degree that would help me get a job I desire. I'm also not sure how much longer I'll be welcome at my internship - I don't think I'm wearing out my welcome, and people seem impressed with the work I've done thus far, but I'm also not sure what the etiquette/protocol on this thing is. Once I lose that, my financial situation becomes a lot tougher :/

Any input would be greatly appreciated. I'm not willing to give up yet, and I doubt I ever will be.

I recently received a FT offer to join Capital One's TDP program in either Plano, McLean, or Richmond.  I've scoured this subreddit for information about the program &amp; offer details, but still had a few lingering questions.

1) As a Japanese-American who wants some diversity (to connect culturally) in both the workplace &amp; living area, which location is best/most inclusive?  I understand people may only be able to provide a perspective from a single location &amp; that's fine! =) 

2) I'm leaning towards Plano, Texas simply because I hear the CoL is best there (plus no state income taxes, woohoo) &amp; because I hear it's super close to Dallas.  Any counter arguments for other locations (or additional things I should know about Plano)? Note that my base salary is the same for Plano &amp; Richmond, but the McLean salary is 9k more (but I hear CoL in McLean is superrrr high).

3) I talked to my recruiter to see if compensation negotiations are possible. The response was very vague and indicated base salary doesn’t typically move, but the other parts might. To clarify, I’ve been offered a base salary varying by location and a static signing bonus and static relocation stipend.  I have three weeks to respond.  

*I'm interviewing with other companies right now, but still don't have another offer on the table. I WILL have completed a Master's degree in CS beforehand, though &amp; have finished two summer internships at another fintech company.*

3a) Has anyone successfully negotiated any portion of their compensation package? And if so, by how much?
3b) Any tips on how to approach the negotiations with the info I have given (I can provide more info if it’d help)? 
3b) I read that some people were able to start in a senior position / an ‘uber’ hire and were thus given a higher compensation package.  Is this still a thing that I could ask about or was this discontinued entirely? 

4) What are some of the best teams to work on at C1? I've done some back end work, android, security, and various other things, but I'm mostly looking for high quality projects, ability to learn new, transferable skills, and great managers.  At the end of the day, I want to be a marketable candidate for the big 4 if I decide to move on from C1 in the future.

Thanks!!! =)"

Choose to stay at the same internship or trying a different one for the summer?,confused_student1889,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5rj4ve/internship_help_choose_to_stay_at_the_same/,"I'll be graduating soon, in about a year in a half. In my particular field of engineering, the community of both students and companies is very tightly knit. I had my first internship last summer, and it was very nice aside from the hour long commute from where I lived for the summer. They constantly asked me if I would return the next summer, and I, feeling the pressure, said that I would. They would also ask me if I planned to work with them after graduating, I didn't think I could make a decision yet but I hinted that I probably would. However, I just recently l got another internship offer from a different company, and I'd like to go so that I could have a different experience, to evaluate my options. If I do that though, it might mean cutting ties with my first internship company. I'm not sure what I should do. I want to go to the new internship offer but I feel obligated to intern again with the first company. I listed what each internship offered or will offer.

First internship Company:
--

-
                             - Gave me a one thousand dollar scholarship recently
-
                             - Always asked if I were going to return the next summer(I felt pressured so I said I would)
-
                             - Gave me an entire desktop so that I could do work for them part time while away in school        
                                (still have to return it to them)
-
                              -  Has a high turnover rate

Potential Internship Company:
--
                               - gives interns two thousand dollar scholarships
-
                               - larger company, more sought after by students (a large part of my school's graduates go there)
-
                               - I would be interning under a person that could potentially recommend me for more scholarships


Again, since the community is very close, I could possibly alienate the first company by going to the new internship offer. Any advice to the best decision in this situation would be really appreciated. "
5rjebo,2,2017-02-01,How did you guys pay your way through school?,OddaJosh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rjebo/how_did_you_guys_pay_your_way_through_school/,"I'm in a dilemma right now and I hope you can make me feel better about my decisions, /r/cscareerquestions... (tl;dr at the bottom)

Currently a sophomore studying CS at large state school paying out of state tuition. I got extremely lucky and got a well paying job through a classmate of mine towards the end of last year doing QA work and some business analyst work. I was originally supposed to be hired as a dev, but I somehow ended up doing what I'm doing now and I hate it (but I am thankful for it!).

I got an offer for a small consulting company for a software engineering intern position for this summer (2017) in December and I signed on it right away. It pays just under what I'm currently getting (which to me is more than enough) and I'm honestly excited to start it and to learn from it. 

My plan for Fall 2017 was to take a break from working during school (I've had a job almost every semester) so I could focus on interviewing for bigger and well known companies and focus on my upper level classes (and maybe relax a little).

The thing is, I'm slightly worried about having financial troubles for the next year. My parents provide almost no support (other than my dad paying for my first year of schooling), so I had to take out some hefty loans for this year and have been able to pay for things like rent, groceries and school supplies with this current job (along with some of this year's tuition). I will not have job I have now in the Fall if I do the internship and will have to take out some hefty loans or something. My friend who got my the job (who I'm very thankful for) thinks that I shouldn't even bother with the internship and just reneg and keep at where I am now because of the money, but I disagree because I want the experience (and I currently hate my job).

Do you guys think I made the right choice? Am I setting myself up for crippling debt for no reason? How did you guys pay your way through college? 


tl;dr: Have a good paying job (not really related to what I want to do) during school right now that helps pay for it. Not sure if I should do a software engineering internship or continue the job so I don't have to take out more loans for school."
5rjh6f,0,2017-02-01,"Trying to weigh between two offers for summer internships possibly reneging on one, could I possibly get A to match B?",ynot269,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rjh6f/trying_to_weigh_between_two_offers_for_summer/,"So I had met company B at a career fair, had the video interview, didn't hear back for many months (interview was october of 2016). 

Then I was contacted by company A, I interviewed with A, enjoyed speaking to them, and ended up signing on. A week later I heard from company B, one of their hiring managers was interested in me, I have no idea how he found me and I probably should've asked but such is life.

A's offer: In South Boston, 20/hr.
B's offer: In Cambridge, 27/hr and either up to 200 a month for commuting costs (I'll be an hour outside of boston), a commuter rail pass, or a parking pass. 

B is a much larger company - 25 * the size of A

A is a start up. 

A uses a lot of open source frameworks (which could come in handy in future job prospects).
B uses a lot of proprietary/ home built products (which is cool but wouldn't extend to outside their company). 

A is a start up, so I imagine the work is very intense and will possibly be cutting edge (cloud related), 
B is a larger company, established, and is more related to business related software (vague I know). 

I could see myself working at either in the future as a full time employee. 

These are both for summer internships. I signed on for A, but the extra 7$ an hour could really help for senior year since I'm losing my work study. 

As previously mentioned signing on to B means reneging on A, I wouldn't ghost, I'd be contacting them and letting them know. 

Is it possible to get A to match B's offer? I tried before I accepted A's offer to bump their offer up since 20$/hr seems to be on the low end for the area, but that's the highest they pay their interns or so i've been told. My main worry is that if I somehow get A to match B's offer, does that hurt my possible chance of getting a full time offer at A? If I did really well as an intern and was invited back, would my consideration to renege on A cause them to not give me a return offer. I really liked interviewing with B but I'm worried I'd be pigeon holing myself by working in a company with proprietary software / home built.


A: 40-1hour
B: 1 hour
distance from one location, 

there's another location I can stay which may be closer but distance is too much of an issue for me, taking A would mean that I'm paying out of pocket for passes and commuting.

During my time in school, I did not take full advantage of everything that I could have.  I was not disciplined enough to finish every reading or participate in every class.  I did not pursue an internship (largely because I would be so burned out during the school year).  I did not attend as many networking events as I could have.

Currently, I have been an Account Manager for an insurance company making 32k/year.  It pays the bills and I am learning quite a bit about a field I have no knowledge in, but I still do not feel the sense of fulfillment that I desire for my new lifestyle and I am concerned that down the line I will not feel terribly challenged in my role.

I have begun considering looking into applying for grad school.  I believe that now that I have a better skill set and coping tools at my disposal, I can really succeed at my classwork and have the confidence to apply for internships at companies that will set my career up better in the long term, whether it be in a field that gauges my interest more or invites a more analytical approach then I am currently incorporating in my job.

It all started when I was in Canada. I wont tell you where I lived but I lived in the Toronto. It all started when I moved out. I didn't have a lot of money and my parents were on welfare so I moved into the slums. I was going to a local collage so I decided to share a small apartment with 2 other students. For their privacy sakes lets call them Jay and David. Jay was a funny guy and a bit of a prankster, we got along pretty well, as we were into many of the same things and we went to clubs and stuff like that. We both were okay students and worked as interns at a nearby law firm. David was a complete opposite , he is a tall sturdy guy, with light blue eyes and blonde hair. He almost never talks and stays in his room all day. Everyone thinks he a freak but once you around him for a while it becomes normal, but the weird thing is that he has this weird twitch in his eyes and he always just looks like he's seen some serious shit. He said his parents died when he was younger but he didn't say why. For the first couple of months everything was going okay. Until I made the worst mistake of my life. Me and jay came back from a party drunk and stoned to hell, so we weren't thinking straight.

 So we decided to prank David by thrashing his room to shit and then staying at a motel overnight and leaving him a letter saying he got pranked, so we could come back tomorrow and see our master piece. We thrashed the room and left the note, so we went to a nearby motel and stayed the night. When we got back in the morning, it was weird. Beyond weird, i felt like really fucked up. It shook me, but at the time I tried to look manly to jay. Keep in mind that we are all in our early twenties. Another weird thing was the apartment was clean. Sparkling clean there was not a inch of dust to be found in any of our rooms and nothing was misplaced, except David's room was completely empty, we thought he got so pissed that he moved out, so he tried calling him, but he wouldn't pick. We never saw him for a while. Then it started, my living hell on earth. It started when I was in class and I got a text it was from David, it just said ""you did this to yourself"". I was a bit creeped out, but i thought he was just trying to get back at us. Thats when it started, everything I could see, has some messed up shit on it. It started with my phone, when a unknown number texted me, a picture of a gutted man hung ontop of the roof of my campus. I got this picture looked at by the best experts in the country and they say it is real, it was also when a air canada plane with the number 577 was flying over the campus.

 So when i went outside there was no man but the exact same plane. This continued for months, it was on walls, billboards, buses, no one else could see it, but me. It was a different picture each time, each more fucked up than the last. I thought it was me, just being fucked up, until one was real. It was a picture of my parents, with their intestines ripped out, and hung around their necks like a noose. Immediately after I got a phone call from a guy who said he was a police officer and told my parents had been murdered, I hung up, shocked and dazed, I puked.

 Then I put two and two together. I was set up by David and Jay, David wanted to get back at me so he was trying to fuck with me with the help of jay. I ran home, with only one thing in mind. I was going to kill those motherfuckers. I ran in jay was up in his room. I ran in and pounced on him. I got him pinned. I threw blow by blow, cursing and blaming him for destroying my santiy. He was knocked out and bloody by the time I was done. I knew i couldn't leave him he would tell the police. He held a grudge and I knew if he lived he would want me dead. I had only one option left, I had to kill him, kill or be killed. I thought of shooting him in the head, but that would be too loud, so i decided on sliting his throat. I got a knife and got ready to do it, but I felt so stupid that i was going to have to kill someone over. I started to get angry, and the I realized that David was a part of this too. I was going to kill the son of a bitch too. With that intention in mind, I killed jay, fast and painless. Then I heard the Clapping, and the motherfucker said "" You shouldn't have fucked with me""."

I've also started a company in the last 4 months that is picking up momentum and we have the opportunity to secure 10's of thousands in grants next month. Before I go further with the seed round, I want to make the decision on whether or not I'm willing to rescind my internship offer to go forth with this. There's no option of doing both, the company will need me in our launch city. 

My question is, if my startup fails (or even is successful), how bad will it look on my resume to not have an internship for my junior year Summer? I've had two previous software engineering internships and also worked for another startup so I'm not really lacking experience. Specifically, I'd like to work for a Big 4/5 or unicorn after graduation or after I exit my startup so if you have knowledge on how this would look to them it would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a CS student in the states, technically a junior (will graduate at the end of Fall 2018, so I have 2 summer vacations left). I'm currently enrolled in Intermediate programming (w/ java), a discrete math course, and calculus. I don't start the higher level, application-based courses (like software engineering, languages, web/app development, etc.) until the next fall semester. Would this upcoming summer be too early in my education for me to get a useful internship? Or do you think that some companies could find a worthwhile use for someone at my education level? I don't necessarily need it for the money, I'm more interested in getting some working experience in the field before I have my degree in my hand.

And if it is too early for an internship, does anyone have any suggestions for good part-time work to get my feet wet in the field of CS?

Thank you!!

I have general knowledge about computers and some slight knowledge on networking but nothing extensive. I also have slight knowledge on programming in Java.

5rni5h,0,2017-02-02,Third Year Check-up,MackoShark,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rni5h/third_year_checkup/,"Hello fellow Computer Scientists. Today has me celebrating my third year with my current company and also third year in my career out of college. I don't really know anyone in my field (other than my coworkers, whom I don't feel comfortable discussing this with), so I would like to do a check up of sorts on my career and sets some goals for the future. 

A little about me:
* 3 years of experience + 2 years of internships

* Entirety of my experience is with .NET, C# and SQL. (Java included).

* Graduated from UCONN with a BS in CS.

My current job is stable. Work is constant but mind dulling. Pay rate is decent ? I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I make 63k base and usually closer to 70k after bonuses. I live in CT away from any major cities. Benefits are standard. 401k, healthcare, disability. 

Here are my cons:

Pay increase is only 1%-2% per year. There is absolutely no room for professional growth. There is 1 manager in this office and everyone else is just a programmer. 

There is nothing challenging or new to learn. We are using C# and I doubt I will ever use anything else for the next 10 years if I stay in my current situation. I have the nagging feeling of being left behind tech wise. 

When I set out in CS I knew that I wanted to become a manager of sorts. I've always seen myself as a leader and don't shy away from public speaking either. At my current company there is no upward mobility. You are either the boss or you are not. 

Although I have planted roots in this area (buying a house) there is a decent number of options for careers within ~30 minute radius. 

My questions for you:

Is ~ every 2 years the ideal time to switch jobs as I read somewhere ?

Am I still too young and inexperienced to be making career moves ?

Would I be better off just staying in my currently stable job since I can afford a comfortable life style ?

How can I keep up with current technology while maintaining my work ethic at work ?

What level of salary should I be at for 3 years experience (roughly)? 


Thanks in advance everyone.

I changed majors in October from Finance to MIS. I did so because I realized working in IT is the direction in my life I would rather be taking. I never knew I wanted to work in IT until that time so I never sought to develop any skills or look into the field until around the time I switched majors. The only steps I have taken to developing my skills in IT is building my own person desktop, taking more relevent electives to my major (i.e. computer science classes), and trying to learn more about the field in my free time. 

The problem: I have no experience but I want it, and I feel that everyone else in my field already has more than me.

I've recently been looking at jobs and internships over during the school year at my university, and at other companies over the summerI can try to apply for that will get me the job experience I need. When I say I want job experience, I don't just want it because I want it for the sake of putting it on my resume (although that would be good too), I want it because I want to learn more. I'm just getting discouraged looking at other people who have held multiple jobs already in the IT field and are able to leverage that over to get the same jobs I'm applying for over. 

I'm not sure what to do. I don't have many connections in the industry which would've helped me get started somewhere. I'm going to keep applying for everything but it's difficult to apply for jobs that are looking for past experience when I have none. I'm not trying to sound like a whiny kid when talking about this but I legitimately am getting pretty discouraged and intimidated by the competition. Looking for any advice possible thank you.

I've asked about 5 other people at this point. Two of them are my former professors from graduate school who advised me on a professional project that is relevant to the work I want to do, but I think one of them is clearly ignoring me. For some reason, she didn't seem to like me, even though she commended me for the work I did and gave me a good grade in the class I took with her. Two other supervisors I asked were people I've worked with outside the U.S. -- one of them is out of the office and the other has been unresponsive to emails for a while now. I even set this person up with an intern this past summer and tried to get in touch again to update them on my life and just ask how things were going -- no response. It's odd because I was under the impression I had a good working relationship with all of these people. One of them in particular was extremely nice and even threw me a going away party and gave me a lovely gift when I left.

The job is full stack, but I haven't been told the exact stack yet so sorry I can't provide it.  I am currently trying to figure it out.  I will add an edit if I do in the near future, but it is probably Java based.

**1. First decision: Mac or PC (Please no flame war):**
I have always used a windows machine.  But after an internship where I was doing full stack on my own machine, I grew tired of having to trouble shoot my environment seemingly every step of the way.  As far as web goes, it seems like unix based operating systems are winning.  My largest barrier is I am not familiar with the OSX, but I have heard that it is fairly easy to pick up.  I am definitely better using the unix shell than windows cmd though.  

**2. Second decision: Beast Laptop vs. Alright Laptop + Desktop:** This job does have some on call duties so I could see the appeal of just having one computer with everything on it, but I know that you can always just remote into your desktop if need be.  Alright laptop will have better battery life if I need to go to meetings, but I don't think this will be a gigantic factor.  

Thank you for you feedback.  I know all of this comes down to personal preference, but this is my first real job out of college.  I just want to know what has worked best for you in the past.

I moved recently to Germany. I plan to live here, in principle, for most of my life. I was quite eager to come here, so I accepted a job contract in VIE terms. The VIE is, basically, an internship available for french people or for europeans that go to work to a french company. One of the requirements of such contract is that, while I'm working as an intern, my main bank account has to be a french one.

However, as I already imagined, I need a german bank account to do some payments more easily (for example, it's not possible to add money to MyAlditalk if your account is not german). A friend of mine told me to try opening it in the DKB but I was rejected. I have read that, once they reject you the first time, they will continue to do so if you insist, so there goes my first option.

Since I'm not very informed about which bank accounts can offer me the best deals and my German is quite ""meh"", I was wondering if you guys could help me a bit to narrow the options.

Just as a bit of information: I'm living currently in Stuttgart and my net income is around 1800 € (I imagine it will increase once I can re-negotiate my contract with my employers, but this won't happen until the end of this year). Right now I have already 2 bank accounts in other countries (a Spanish and a French one), so I would prefer to try to find something which is not too expensive to maintain. I already have a credit card, so this is not a mandatory requirement for the moment (although at some point I will also need a German one, since I plan to close the other bank accounts I have).  I don't know if it's worth anything for this, but I have already gone to register as a resident and I have my Meldebestätigung.

Thank you all very much in advance!"

It took years for me to get back into being myself again and I wasted a lot of time on doing stuff like producing music and just working random jobs to pay the studio rent. (While all my other friends studied)

After a few years of doing that I started a ""vocational"" education in programming (basically not worth anything when people ask for a bachelors degree in any computer science related field), that took two years of my time. I started working as a mobile developer through my internship I got at a rather well known startup where I live. They hired me and after two years of doing that I got offered a position at a small startup where I am now.

I'm currently 26 years old and most of my coworkers consider me as a ""full stack"" kind of guy. I've been doing everything from java backend, elixir backend, react frontend, android and swift (some obj-c). The problem is that I have very little knowledge about everything else that is related to a bachelors degree, like all the complex math and engineering skills and I'm wondering if it's actually worth it for me to start over again? It would probably take 4-5 years and I'd be 30 by then. 

What do you guys think? I just hate the feeling of stupidity when all the people around me with bachelor degrees ask me stuff about complex algorithms etc.. I even feel a bit ""stupid"" since all girls ive dated and had relationships with were studying to become lawyers or doctors and I literally have almost no eduction, I'm pretty much just autodidact.

I still feel like I have a chance on doing this but it would probably set me back 5 years in salary and experience (I'm very happy with my current salary as it is way above avg for my age and knowledge). My current boss really likes me and I got a lot of good feedback from my first place and colleagues. 

I feel confused and I don't know where my life and career is heading..

PLEASE give me some advice and share your thoughts.

My title sounds like I will be coding but the description seems like qa at best or maybe some high level design. 


After talking with my manager he still doesn't know what my exact position will be and the talk was somewhat odd because I had different expectations due to what my recruiter had said I would be doing.

So I got back from a 3 month backpacking trip in Southeast Asia 2 months ago.  Before that I was living in NYC (just finished college), but sold everything and moved back home before my trip. I left New York for many reasons, mainly for the reason it's so expensive and that I would never be able to travel--which is my passion--so I basically had to sacrifice it for a better quality of life. Travel is my meaning in life and I'm willing to make sacrifices to do it. 

I'm back home now with two job offers. My intention is to save up so I can take another trip, hopefully in the fall.  The problem is one job is working retail (on commission) and its seasonal so it might end in May/June, and the other is part time helping out at a small (run by two people) marketing agency.  I'm torn between which to choose.  My parents want me to obviously go for the marketing position as it's what I went to school for, but after multiple internships, I realize I don't really like marketing and office environments. With the retail job I'll be able to make and save a lot of money and will be able to travel months at a time. My ultimate goal is to be a freelance writer, which I'm getting into now, so no matter which job I take I'll be doing that on the side with the intention of eventually doing it full time (hopefully). 

I just want to see what everyone thinks.  Should I take a risk with my future and go with the retail job, but have the freedom to travel like I want? Or should I suck it up and go the safe route and do the secure job that will ""build my resume?"" I've always believed that everyone should do what they love and that you should work to live, not live to work, but now I'm having doubts that I'm not investing in my future and years down the road I'll regret it. I left New York so I could have the freedom and means to travel, which makes me think why did I ever leave if I'm just going to go back into a job that I could've done there that wasn't bringing me fulfillment?

This happened the last October as I was doing an internship as a computer technician in Florence, Italy. I’ve never lived without my parents so I was still adapting to my new life.

I shared the flat with two people I met one month before. They were somewhat nice to me but they weren’t too social as they always were in their rooms with the door closed avoiding any kind of social relationship.

When we arrived at the flat for the first time we saw a really great place to live, not very far from the city center. Even though it was the 6th floor it had a backyard (bigger than the house so it was perfect for doing barbecues with my friends). The kitchen furniture was made entirely of wood, they were very old but would do the job for us.

The house was perfect but the TV was absent.

We spoke to our landlord about the TV and asked in a horrible Italian where was the TV and why there isn’t one in the house.

“No no, the television here is paid (PPV) and it wasn’t included in what you paid”

**LIED.**

I didn’t understand a simple word but one of my flatmates who knew something translated what he said.

Three weeks after I was alone in the house as one of them were working as a hairdresser and the other were in Spain attending some personal issues. 

I was being slowly eaten by the biggest boredom I’ve ever experienced in my life when suddenly I remembered that inside the storage room I found a little CRT TV along with its cables and a small antenna.

I know a bit about TVs, where do I have to plug the cables, tunning the TV in order to see any canal and such.
So, me, in an attempt to be a hero for my flatmates and me and improving our relationship, decided to mount the TV, tune some channels and when they arrive at the house we could watch Italian TV.

All of the plugs in our kitchen was being used but the most accessible were the one being used by the fridge (and freezer) which was very close to a furniture piece made of old wood (less than 10cm, 4 inches for our American brothers). I looked for a multiple socket until I found one, it was small but I thought it would do the job with no sweat.

**BIG MISTAKE.**

When I plugged in the fridge and the TV I ran to get my phone (which was in my bedroom) because my parents were calling me. Meanwhile I was talking to them I went back to the kitchen to turn the TV on.

I heard a buzzing noise coming from the fridge so I left the phone on the table meanwhile my mother were speaking to the emptiness and I started checking everything in the kitchen.

* Checked the oven, nothing. 
* The burners, nothing. 
* The microwave, nothing. 
* The fridge, nothing. 
* The TV, nothing.

When I realized where the buzzing noise was coming it was pretty late as the kitchen was filled of **WHITE SMOKE**, the small the cheap-y multiple socket where the TV and fridge/freezer were plugged **CAUGHT FIRE** while it was sparking sparks, burning the TV cable and creating a small fire on that piece of furniture (Note that all the furniture were connected so if one of them starts burning, the whole kitchen would burn)

Then I ran faster than Flash itself to turn off the whole distribution panel of the house. Took the glove used to take things from the oven (What the hell was I thinking?) pulled the fridge/freezer plug by the cable while doing the same with the TV. Took a small cube, filled it with water as soon as possible and threw it to the furniture that was burning to mitigate the fire.

My mother was still talking to the emptiness. 

I dismantled everything after cleaning the mess I created with the smoke, the smell and I hid the burned part with a pizza box.

Our internship is finished and I’ve never told my flatmates about this. You are the first people I talked about this.

TL;DR: Tried plugging the fridge, the freezer and a TV on the same plug, ended burning the plug and the TV cable, filling the kitchen with a horrible smell and burning a side of a piece of furniture.

I've been programming, developing, software engineering and hacking for 5 years now. Started as an intern at a video game studio which transitioned into a contracting job, moved to a start up doing mobile development, then a short job at a corporate place still doing mobile but then moved across the US and working happily at my new front end web development job remotely.

I come here asking for some advice from making that transition from Software Engineer to Senior Software Engineer or Software Architect. My employer is looking for us to create 5 tasks that we could measure that would help us grow into better software engineers for the new year.

I was thinking of looking into more Software Architecture but that seems like a difficult thing to measure within just a year.
The other thing was to be to become part of a open source project but it seems so overwhelming and I already have my own projects that I work on during off hours.
I've tried to read through Skiena algorithms but good lord it's so dry and boring. Are there any other books that might be more interesting to read?

I guess with that, do you have any thoughts or goals?
And thanks for reading!

5rsi5i,1,2017-02-03,Back to finding a job - Newly Graduate/Entrepreneur Looking for a Job/Internship,lee714,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5rsi5i/back_to_finding_a_job_newly_graduateentrepreneur/,"I'm currently having financial issues, and need to start working ASAP after I graduate, as I owe loans and won't be able to help with rent. But before all of this I was going to pursue my business ideas 110% after I graduated. And before that I was set on getting into networking and actually bought the CompTIA Network+ book to study and to take the exam for the cert, which I never did. But currently I am still running a business that brings in side money for food, gas, etc. I am also pursuing some other ideas while being in my last semester in school. Hopefully those go well. All in all, my end goal is to work for myself and start a successful business but in the meantime I need cash flow. And I'm still in my early 20s.

So I will be graduating in May of this year with my Bachelors in Information Systems. I have zero work experience with anything I.T. related. My only I.T. related experience consists of personal hobbies such as running game servers with Navicat, MySQL server 2010-2012, mssql server, and running sql scripts. I can also code a website in html/css easily if I follow a guide as I know what's going in the code, same thing with python but I will need to look up code but I get what's going on with the code. Also, I'm usually the one setting up routers at home, and doing other stuff such as port forwarding. I'm usually asked by friends to troubleshoot windows 7/10 issues on their computers &amp; on their macs, and restoring their computers/laptops with a bootable disk/flash drive to remove viruses. I also know a lot about piracy and can find anything online including CBTNugget/CompTIA supplements easily. Everything related to Microsoft Office and the Adobe Creative Suite I’m experienced in too. 

So I am currently taking a networking course right now and out of all the I.T. related courses I have taken in the last two years at my university, I think I'm highly interested in relearning about networking again and if Ima work I would want it to be networking related.




So my questions are:

1. What can I specialize in networking with my past experience with game servers, basic coding, etc.? 
2. Which certificates are worth getting at this point in 2017?
3. Should I still pursue certificates at this point?
4. Should I be finding an internship and hoping to get hired after the internship period, or should I actually find a paying job right away? I eventually do want cash flow but I'm willing to take an internship if it’s a valuable company.
5. Are there any other I.T. specializations I can go for/might like with my past experience? 
6. Anyone else in my shoes, and what did you decide to do?
7. Any other Entrepreneur/I.T. guys out there? What advice can you give me?
8. Anything else to add?

In the past 3 years I've had
six flags staples oit massmutual developer erportal 

6 jobs, 4 of which were tech related. 

One was a cloud engineering internship last summer, and the second was a part RnD job for my school at the same time as my internship. 3rd was IT for the school and that was my longest job (left recently). 4th was/is my current internship at a local startup. 

Is this uncommon? How screwed am I for the full time search next summer? I've accepted an offer for a bigger start up in a more tech area (Boston), but I'm considering reneging for a bigger company who's also given me an offer (better but possibly not as fun). 

so that would make 7 jobs, am I screwed for my fulltime search? I wanted to gain as much experience as possible so I delved into multiple fields and applications of CS. 

my resume has all my software related experience btw

I'll try not to gush/vent much since this is a more practical subreddit, but all my time at university I've always felt that I've been inferior to everyone around me and that I don't belong and this introduction was basically a giant ""Guess what? You're right.""

It's time everyone to write a C.V. for prospective internship providers to have a look at it. It hurts to even type this shit it's so pathetic, but I have absolutely nothing to my name that would make me look remotely useful. Due to matters partially out of my control (difficult home life) but mainly due to being a lazy coward, I've never had any kind of job (attending university from home) or constructive hobby. The punchline to this whole situation is that, being a socially awkward jobless recluse studying a computer course(I know), one might think I'd at least have good grades, but I'm hanging on by a thread as it is.

The only saving grace in this situation is that applying for internships only begins in September, so I have the rest of the term and the summer months to try and cobble together something of value for a C.V. Need advice as to how I can turn this around by then."

The internship is a program designed for sophomores and freshman still in college and I am a sophomore. I'm aware I should try to prepare as much as possible but I have been freaking out all week thinking I'm not prepared enough. I kid you not when I say for the past week I have spent at least 4+hours a day preparing, practicing, and reviewing.

But as far as to actually writing the complete code solution is my biggest issue. I am a big fan of this companies product and have been a user since my freshman year of high school. I genuinely do have an interest in the company, personally think I would be a good cultural fit because I love what they are about.

I have some questions about going to graduate school in a field that isn’t closely related to your bachelor’s, relevant coursework to be eligible for grad school programs, recouping lost internship or research experience, and post-bac work. For the sake of this post I’ll frame my questions as they relate to psychology (one of the fields I’m most interested in), even though they apply to other fields as well – political science, medicine, and law are others that I’m interested in learning more about.
 
What would the best course of action be for someone who’d like to go to graduate school for something psychology related if they don’t have a bachelor’s in psychology? I know that besides relevant coursework, laboratory/research experience is important. How could you obtain this experience after leaving undergrad?
And for someone who’s still in undergrad but isn’t going to major in psychology, what basic psychology courses should you take to quality for a graduate program down the line, *if* that’s the road you end up deciding on? Intro to psychology, a class on research in psychology, maybe an intro to stats course, but what else? How do you even know what basic classes are required in each field, and doesn’t it vary by school? Finally, for someone who didn’t take many (or any) basic psych classes during undergrad, what are the best options for post-bac? Do you have to do it at your alma mater, can you take the courses from a community college or at least a cheaper state college, etc.? 

I’m still an undergrad student, but I’m very undecided on grad school. If I went, I don’t think I’d go immediately after getting my bachelor’s. The thing is, there are several fields of graduate study that I’m interested in, and I really don’t think I’m going to figure out which direction I’d like to go in before I graduate in two years (all so that I could select a major best tailored to said grad school path). Right now, I've pretty much decided on a major in science and technology studies, because I've been told by faculty in the major department that it's the most well-rounded major if you'd like to go to grad school eventually, but don't know for what subject. I’ve already taken one basic psychology course and would like to take more just in case, but even that I’m not 100% sure about.

5rvwzf,1,2017-02-03,Mechatronic or Computer Engineering - UTS or USyd,Chrismare,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5rvwzf/mechatronic_or_computer_engineering_uts_or_usyd/,"I'm a student in Sydney, Australia in my second year, looking to transfer from my civil major into something else. I've narrowed down my options to Mechatronic engineering and Computer engineering.

However I am also not sure whether to remain at my current university, the University of Sydney, or to transfer to the University of Technology Sydney. I've laid down pros and cons below for each of them.

Mechatronics
Pros:
- A wide range of things learned, gain skills in mechanical, electrical and software
- The range of things learned appeal to my indecisiveness
Cons:
- Doesn't seem as employable as other majors, especially in the US
- Jack of all trades, master of none dilemma
- Worried I'll always be passed over in favour of a more specific engineering degree
- My interests don't lie in robotics in particular, more just the wide range of knowledge

Electrical (Computer)
Pros:
- Seems much more employable
- Get to learn more about software and algorithms, which appeal to me
- Good mix of software and hardware
Cons:
- Seems a bit limiting in regards to what I'll be able to work in in the future, no knowledge of anything mechanical
- A field that I don't think will change much over time, stale-ish
- Not sure I will enjoy purely electrical enough to solely pursue it in a degree
- Seems to be the most difficult major, not sure if I'm ready to go full nerd mode for the next 3-4 years

USyd
Pros:
- My current university, no change complications
- Offers an electrical (computer) course
Cons:
- Not as good of an engineering faculty
- Don't know anyone that's done electrical at USyd, worried that it may be a weak course at this particularly university

UTS
Pros: 
- Better engineering faculty
- My friends go there (dumb reason but I'd really enjoy their company with how lost I've been feeling lately)
- One year internship as part of degree
- Simply more comfortable and at home there, at the campus, than at my own university
- Summer semesters to catch up in
Cons:
- Electrical major involves power subjects which do not interest me, not sure if I can replace them with computer related subjects yet
- Extra year of my degree, although one year of it will be working. Not sure if I can scrap the year of internships
- Chance of not all my subjects becoming properly transferred, will probably still get the credits for all of them, but some as electives, possible repeating of first year subjects

So there's my list, I'm applying for my American citizenship, so I'm considering moving there sometime after a graduate, which is why it's important for me to get a degree which will have value over there.

In regards to what I want to do, I've always been interested in simulations and modelling, particularly the physics engines you see in video games. 
Obviously I understand how common it is to see young dudes wanting to enter the video game industry, and how rare it actually happens. 
Im not interested in working with video games in particular, I'm mainly interested in the mathematics behind the engines.

Simply the thought of working at a company at all depresses me beyond anything. I'm aware at how absurd it is (especially for engineering) and I'm working on seeing a therapist over it. But I would definitely lean to whatever would give me an edge towards possibly working independently, on my own.

I already have credits in engineering so I probably won't consider something like computer science or anything non engineering related.

Im 20 and a second year, I get the whole ""you're never too old to be learning"" thought, which I totally believe in, but I feel extremely old and insecure to be where I am and I really just wanna study and finish and move onto other  projects in my life.

I just want a solid degree under my belt, what I plan to do after that, I really have no clue. I'm aware that this isn't a great idea when it comes to something like engineering, but I'm tired of idling around, I need some kind of path to follow.

I would love to hear advice from people doing either of the two degrees, at either of the two universities. Or just anyone in particular with something to say.

Thanks in advance for any advice given."

When anxiety hit my life I was 21 living a fun life! I lost all of my friends and relationships. Anxiety ruled my life for 4 years. I would be able to go to classes here and there and I'd be able to go on a date depending on how I feel that day, but had no friends, so going out wasn't really an option anyway! As the years went on and I was on medication, things got better, I finished a program, completed an internship, went out with friends I made, got a full time job! But those friendships didn't last, I developed a routine; home - work - relax - sleep- repeat. Granted, some days anxiety took over (my fear of anything stomach illness related) and I stayed home from work but going on 3 years strong there and love it? I am able to do things with my family and my brothers but when it comes to be social when I'm out is like EH to me, I have times that I really want to keep plans and then the day of, I cancel...EVERYTIME..hence, no boyfriend. I'm ok with it. But I don't know why I get anxious if I break my routine, if schedules are different during the week and there is some type of obligation or plan, I just can't do it, I just feel like I have to stay in my routine and prevent anxiety so I can work etc. weekends I'm more social, go out to eat and have some drinks or smoke with my family and brothers. It's hard to explain. I don't feel like I have social anxiety to the point where I can't even go to a store but I have no desire and no drive to break my routine and cause my life to be anxiety filled. 

Anyway,
It's hard to explain but I hope you stayed with me and can maybe relate!"

5rxlsj,1,2017-02-03,Hesitant about job offer.,jobofferthrowaway2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5rxlsj/hesitant_about_job_offer/,"Hi all. I'm undecided about a job I was just offered and since I am not experienced in job offers and negociations I thought some feedback could help me make a decision or get a better offer. By the way, English is not my main langage so my usage of verb tenses was  probably fucked up and I keep and I keep repeating lots and lots of words. Me hope you'll have a good time deciphering this post.

I've been working for company A, a small tech company, for almost a year. They kept me after I did my internship there so I don't have a lot of experience. I love most of the job (it's diversified and has a lot of freedom) and I get along with my 3 (most direct) colleagues pretty well even tho they are usually pretty negative towards their own tasks and some clients. 

I can usually squeeze the good mood out of them troughout the day but one of them happens to also be an oblivious-loud-talker-who-fear-showers-and-has-a-tendency-to-throw-a-tantrum-every-times-he's-stuck-on-a-task type of guy. He's by far the most toxic of the group, we tried talking to him about it but it's like he doesn't have the capacity to admit faults and improve himself, he'll just keep complaining on a ""happier"" tone for the rest of the day then go back to his toxic self the day after, and we'll have to call him on it again and again. At first it was kinda funny I guess but it gets pretty tiresome after a while, but I digress. 

Not two weeks ago I was contacted by a competitor (company B, a slightly larger tech company) for an offer for the same job I currently do.

Apparently, a company B employee who happens to be an ex-colleague of mine told her Boss about me, about how I would ""fit in"" and how I stay easygoing and positive despite my toxic colleague(s).

So, Boss of company B tells me they ""absolutely"" need someone like me ""because programmers are usually introverted and negative"", saying they are overwhelmed by projects and they're only looking for ""special people"" like me.

I accepted to meet him and his company's office last week so we could talk. He really wanted to sell me his company, showing me how they were the greatest and happiest bunch and so. He was basically selling me the Tech Startup Mentality ™. He insisted on the fact that I would fit in, that I looked calm and confident, that we got along well and that he was stressing about how to convince me to work for him. It seemed over the top, but hey, some people are like that I guess. I was mostly curious about the tasks and job security and tried not to show too much entusiasm about the company because I didn't want him to think it would be easy to ""steal"" me from company A and have an interesting offer (while staying in a very pleasant and curious mood because I didn't want to appear uninterested, something something upperhand). I told him about my skills which seem to be way more polyvalent than what he's asking for. He said I could cover the tasks of  two different roles according to my skills.

I was honest with him, told him that i'm being open to offers but in order to make me leave the current Job I like, the salary would have to be better than company A's (to which he agreed). He didn't offer anything specifically and he didn't ask my current salary. He said the hourly wage scale for the offered job was from 16 to 22. Since I'm currently at 16, I told him I was around the bottom of his wage scale and I would be interested by an offer near the middle of said scale. Which is true, anything between 18 and more would do. I believe 16 is pretty low, I barely make both ends meet and saved next to nothing during the last year. I wanted him to say a number first since he really seemed to want me to accept the job, and try and negociate from there, you know? Maybe I was wrong. I said that even tho I do not have a lot of experience in this sector I can take any task he throws at me (which I believe to be true according to what I learned about the tasks). He said not to worry and that he would have an offer I couldn't refuse since he really needed me and he would contact me later with a salary offer, saying I could take my time to think about it before making my decision.

I was expecting a small increase and was probably going to accept the offer.

Now, he contacted me yesterday evening. He begins by saying he really wants me to ""choose his company, his team, his mentality"" so I would keep my current salary with a eventual salary review after 6 months. Oh and I have to give him my answer by monday.

I'm a bit turned off. Am I right to be? I feel like this is contradicting everything he's said so far. He's expecting me to leave a job I love (even tho my colleagues can be toxic) without even trying to offer a better salary (something he previously agreed on)? All this talk about how I'm THE guy they want, about how he's got the best offer for me because he absolutely needs to convince me, for that? Was he just bullshitting me? What for? 

I don't know what to think anymore. I used to think the offer was interesting... the job looks less stimulating somehow, from what I understood. But the mood did seem to be better than the one at my current job (something I can't be sure of without taking the job) and I would get away from Mister Stinkytoddler (which is probably what he's betting for). Also, I would have to comute for twice the distance I'm currently doing daily and that would almost require a 2 dollar increase just to cover for it.

I get the feeling that  either he is so confident in his company that he believes I will gladly take anything else from my current job either he thinks I'm stupid or I don't deserve a better salary than the one I currently have.

Can I still try to have him offer me a better offer? Should I?
Also, would it be a good idea to get a counter offer from my current boss?

I'll gladly take any feedback or advice. Sorry you had to read that and thank you for doing it."

When it came to explaining my approach to a problem and what data structures/algorithms I would use and why, I heard my interviewer say great things. But as far as to actually writing the code out I struggled a little bit, but he was kind enough to help me through the problem.

I come to seek some advice on how to keep moving forward with my current study and career.

Some back story: I am a beginner at any programming, period. I am almost 29, and have been a cook/chef since I was 16. Currently, I hold an Associates in Culinary Arts and a Bachelors in Business Management. For a number of years I wanted to get into game development (no lectures on this field, please. I'll explain below), but for years was put off because of how people treated it.

So, last year, I finally got fed up with my current line of work and am currently getting an Associates in Computer Science (it is in game development, but at this point in life I am A-OK with just doing CS work in general if I never become a game dev.), but as the name states I feel like I am going backward. I am so novice at programming currently, (a little Python and HTML knowledge, currently enrolled in C++ and JS) that I have no idea where to even begin to start looking for employment. I have given myself a personal goal to be out of the kitchen environment sometime in the summer. What I am noticing in entry level positions, and even internships, are pursing 4yr bachelors in CS or having numerous years of experience in CS already. This is pretty disappointing to see, and disheartening. I enjoy what I am learning, and want to be good at it.

So, I have started my quest to exit cooking and find a entry level job somewhere. I feel I would learn a heck of a lot more once I got into a job somewhere, but I have zero clue how to start or where. My current jobs hours make study difficult, and my free time is so limited between work and study I can't just start making programs as some have suggested to me in person. That, and I'm pretty iffy on things still. 

Sorry if this seems all over the place. Thanks for any tips and advice in advance. "

5rz410,3,2017-02-04,Should I graduate now and start applying for jobs or graduate in December and continue to look for summer internships?,Robotigan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rz410/should_i_graduate_now_and_start_applying_for_jobs/,"I'm slightly drunk which is probably the only reasoning I'm opening up about all this.

So I'm a CS/Math student at UW Madison.  My GPA isn't spectacular and I don't have any formal internships within the major (I've done summer jobs that basically amounts to the lowest level of IT you can imagine and a manufacturing job that amounts to ""had job"" on my resume).  Because the school I transferred from, UW Parkside, transfers Math credits more readily than CS credits, I took a lot of math and stumbled fairly close to a Math major upon entering Madison.  I'm not sure if it's appealing at all to companies, but I really respect the discipline.  So right now I'm declared for a Computer Science major and an Applied Math in Computer Science (basically replace some math courses for CS courses).

My mindset right now is that if I stay an extra semester I could complete a ""pure"" math major and also getting a *real* internship would give me a stronger resume when I apply for jobs next semester.  I'm not sure I can effectively communicate how important of a personal goal completing a ""pure"" math major is, but I can say it's nontrivial.  It's probably unhealthy, but I basically equivocate math aptitude with overall intelligence.

Right now I've gone through Glassdoor spamming and Career Fair schmoozing as a prospective software engineer intern and so far that process has been discouraging but not unexpected.  From what my CS friend told me rejection is the norm.  I think I made a mistake by not putting keywords ""Linux"" and ""Bash"" on my resume for several, early applications (I guess I figured that went without saying) and so I hope that didn't fuck up thirty applications with that simple error.  I also feel at a loss when I'm asked about personal projects (which is the next step interviewers take after noting how irrelevant my former employment is), basically all I've completed outside of school is various coding challenges (e.g. a short Java program for finding all the paths between two nodes in a graph).  I wouldn't know how to begin a large-scale project without direction.

On top of all this, I think I realized all too late that I have a passion for Computer Engineering, i.e. low-level hardware design stuff.  I didn't take physics or any of the other plethora of introductory classes required for the major (aside from the math, obviously) so there's no way I could ever get the formal degree, but I've enrolled in a lot of the CS courses recommended for ECE students (Operating Systems, Compilers, now enrolled in Computer Architecture).  I tried applying to Intel for an engineering intern position, but they basically responded with ""Fuck off, apply for software developer positions"".

So questions: How important is it to have a formal internship when applying for jobs (should I graduate or wait)?  How do I convince companies I'm a worthwhile candidate without GPA/internships/projects to back it up?  What do I *really* need to include in my resume?  Is there any way to get involved in lower level engineering/am I disillusioned about its desirability?"

This might be handy to freelancers who are working on projects and cannot share the code on Github and also for your pet projects / scripts that you wrote but aren't willing to share it with the world yet. 

I've been programming for nearly 18 - 20 months now. Till a couple of days back I wasn't aware of the fact that private repositories are available for free. I used to store my code on a pen drive for backup. I have two operating systems running on my laptop and private repositories have made my life easier. Just letting you know that private repositories are available for free and can make life easier :)  

All of you are probably aware of GitHub and the fact that they provide  public repositories for free. I absolutely adore them and my GitHub profile helped me bag an internship. You have to pay them in case you want to have make your code private.

Off late I started writing scripts and programs that I wouldn't want to share with people. Also a few programs are just for one time use and I haven't bothered to write them well (hence might discourage prospective employers), I just use them for the problem in hand and throw them. I didn't want to share them on my public profile but I wanted to version control and store them in the cloud just in case I have to use those scripts again especially on different computers.

GitLab (very similar to github) and BitBucket provide free private repositories. Do give them a shot."

I started my academic journey several years back with the intention of getting a degree in computer science. Unfortunately, I wasn't prepared academically nor was I mature enough for college.

Since I've started this job I've also made the choice to to back to school as well. I am currently working towards a degree in IT and I am actually enjoying what I'm learning. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to take classes since summer of last year as I have not been able to get approved for a loan. I think that it's a result of me having several thousand in credit card debt. However, I will have that sorted out shortly.

Spent the last year and a half working on personal projects I was passionate about (and fortunately had resources to do it). Started applying to rejoin professional workforce just before the holidays, got two offers near the end of January: one in South Bay working at a big 4 as SDET, other in NYC in fin tech. I accepted the NYC offer already, but I want to gauge how I negotiated/should have negotiated.

Full Med benefits
Half of 15% matched 401k


When interviewing I had specified both my previous salary in the low 100s (albeit 2 years ago), as well as a desired range from 125-140. From reading here and other subs this was a mistake, but oh well. The range i gave is based on current market rates for people with my experience level. 


Negotiating:
Received offer 2 first, used it to bump offer 1 to 130, wouldn't go further. Offer 2 wouldn't move on base, but bumped relo to 10k, housing, and full pack/ship. 


Thoughts:
I commuted down to South Bay before and hated it, also didn't want to move to the burbs. I feel like this was a large factor in my decision. Based on the salary range I was looking for (after doing research, etc.), having the top of my range initially offered threw me off, as I felt like I had limited myself. But based on glass door, pay scale, etc., the 140 figure was at the top of the range for people in that role with my skill level. Overall I am extremely excited for the new opportunity and very happy with my decision, but of course if I had been able to negotiate a bit more successfully it would have been nice :)

TA was in the room and suddenly got angry and told me that was the stupidest thing he has heard and that the way I was doing these problems was a bad idea and not real engineering and I am not very ""engineery"". Im sorry what? I get stuff like that all the time and it frustrates me alot when people belittle your work, even though it gets you the desired answers correctly and much more fast and efficiently. What gives? I ignore it, but lately its been frustrating me, I have very few engineering friends and I am worried because I dont want to work with people like that in a year when I graduate. Staying strong, have high grades and am hearing back from companys for summer internships, so why should I care. Meh, sorry, just wanted to rant, but engineering students can be real ass holes sometimes. It shouldn't be that way."

With the job fairs coming around the corner, a lot of local start-ups and companies are opening up internship positions for CS. However, my question: is there any specific types of internships at certain companies I should avoid? 

This might seem like a silly question, but I wasn't sure how it would be to take a government internship vs a start up internship in terms of experience and how it would reflect on me. Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I have thought about driving into oncoming traffic, or buying a gun and ending things... but those thoughts are daydreams that I know won't happen.  Recently I've started to dig myself into a hole, and rather than deal with it in a constructive way, I've gotten hung up on how I can avoid dealing with things directly and ""reset"".  The thought of ending things has started to enter my mind more often, and I want it to stop.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Job**

&amp;nbsp;
I graduated last spring and started working right away.  I hate my job.  Every single day, from the moment I get in I am counting down the hours until I can go home.  Sometimes when I walk through the hallways, I feel empty and ready to collapse.  I've been unable to focus - and even intentionally avoiding work by browsing the internet instead.  I've had an assignment for a few months that should've taken a couple weeks, and I've made zero progress on it.  I'm afraid that my managers will grill me on it one day and fire me after they realize how productive I've been.

&amp;nbsp;
One reason why it's been hard to focus, and the main reason why I hate my job is because of the industry.  To a lot of people, this would be a dream job.  I'm a software developer in a very stable industry, in a prime location.  But I don't want to be involved in this negative industry.  As an added bonus, the hard skills I gain from this job would only help me get a position within the company or the same industry.  Without putting in my own time outside of work to learn other skills, there is no pathway out.

&amp;nbsp;
Of course, when I get home from work and try to be productive, I lose focus again.  After dinner there's 4 hours of free time before I need to sleep.  I halfheartedly set goals and ration my free time, but then I think ""well what's the point?""  Instead of being productive, I waste away my night playing games - not to have fun, but to take my mind off things.

&amp;nbsp;

**What's The Purpose?**

&amp;nbsp;
Last year I had an internship in a city away from any friends or family.  Although I was alone, I loved the internship.  I dreamed of working for this company, I had a great team, and I enjoyed working on my projects (I didn't return to the company for a variety of other reasons).  However, after work I would always have a ton of free time on my hands and I didn't always fill it with things to do.  On days like these, I would sometimes ask myself ""what's the purpose of life?""  I eventually came to the conclusion that you either:

* believe there is some greater purpose - a destiny to fulfill, or a path you must follow
* realize that there is no purpose, and define your own
* realize that there is no purpose, and continue on without one

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
So I decided that there is no true purpose in life, and that I would need to define my own.  The thing is... I'm having a hard time settling for ""I want to be happy, and I want to make other's happy"" and I keep wanting something else.  Why is my purpose to be happy?  How do I know that that is a good purpose?  There must be something bigger that I'm missing.  With my life purpose being so cloudy, it's hard to set goals and find the motivation to follow through with them.

&amp;nbsp;

**Bonus Issue:  My Girlfriend**

&amp;nbsp;
The other thing that makes it hard to sleep or focus is that I don't know what the future will be like for my girlfriend and I.  We've been together for a few years, and ""I think we should just be friends"" has been on the tip of my tongue through numerous conversations.  One of my biggest concerns is actually her family.  Due to their internal issues, she suffers constant heartache and frustration.  She vents about it on a regular basis, and some of that heartache and frustration inevitably transfers over to me.  I know how her family treats each other, and I never want to be a part of a family like theirs.  But after having these thoughts, I always think ""maybe I just need to grow up and learn to love them.""

&amp;nbsp;
Family aside, I'm still unsure of whether or not I want to be her partner.  She's my first girlfriend, and I don't know if I'm still with her because I truly want her, or if I'm afraid of losing her companionship.  She shows me an incredible amount of kindness, love, and support, but due to my uncertainty, it's becoming harder and harder to reciprocate.  When I'm with her, we both enjoy each other's company.  But I rarely initiate things, and when we're apart I can keep to myself for days while she's always hungry for contact, attention, and affection.  I used to initiate all the time, and I'm not sure if I stopped because the honeymoon phase ended or because my interest in her dwindled.

&amp;nbsp;
Finally, I know that if we were to separate she would be devastated.  She has a lot of long term and short term struggles that she deals with, and she needs love, comfort, and companionship.  I do not want her to experience more heartache, or lose the support that she needs...

&amp;nbsp;

**Current Situation**

&amp;nbsp;
With all that in mind... I just don't know what to do next.  I'm tempted to quit my job - with my current savings I have enough money to cover 6 months of expenses.  In that time I could attempt to sort things out and try to find a job I'd be happy with.  I could also break my lease and move in with my family, but they're out of state and away from my girlfriend.  When I think about either ""solution"" I just feel pathetic.  People would kill to have my job, they'd kill to have an SO... my issues aren't significant... I'm not even suicidal, just lazy and unmotivated... I'm just looking for an easy way out, and a good enough excuse to buy me more time.  I still hang out with friends, and share smiles with family... but when I'm alone with my own thoughts I just want to disappear."

So I'm considering going back to school to get a second bachelors in computer science at a local state University (same school I got my first bachelors from). I will need to take the computer science core classes at a community college before I can gain admittance to the computer science major at the University.

Now, I could take all my sophomore classes at the community college as well, leaving only 30 credits of of upper level courses to take at the University and knock out in a year.

However, this would mean I couldn't take advantage of the University's career fair in order to find an internship for the summer before my final year. The community college as no such career fair. I would just be cold calling business looking for an internship.

Would you recommend spending the money to enroll at the University sooner so to take advantage of their career fair and land a swankier internship? The university costs about $4,000 per semester and they only admit in the fall, so about $8,000 all said and done.

Any thoughts?

Thanks so much!"

I'm definitely fortunate, or at least I should feel like it. I'm in a decent STEM program. I have some internships from decent companies under my belt. I *seem* like I'm not totally incompetent.

But...

School is killing me, maybe literally. The finish line is in sight but I can't quite get there. I'm taking a full course load, and I can't afford to drop any courses. It's just a continuous onslaught of work and tests and exams. I basically haven't done anything else for years, but I'm still always behind. I feel like I can pour all my hours into studying and still just barely get by. My grades are shit and have been since 2A, and I have no one but me to blame for that.

I'm introverted and awkward. I've long lost the art of communication. Even among my friend group I'm pretty sure people think I'm annoying and awful at talking. Hell, even *I* think that I'm annoying and awful at talking. 

I can't help but feel like I'm actually stupid, and that I've just been too stupid to realize for all these years. The signs are all there: I'm awful at technical interviews, awful at critical thinking, awful at reasoning things out in general. This school is so full of actually smart and competent and well-rounded and *likable* people that I more-than-occasionally feel like I don't belong here. I'm not even sure if that's just the impostor syndrome talking.

I have basically no skills outside software engineering/""writing code"". I thought that I would turn out fine if I just worked my ass off and hyper-optimized for what I thought was important. But I've sacrificed everything else and more, and I have no idea how to fix that now.

I should probably start looking for a full-time job soon. My biggest fear is that I'll be stuck in some dead-end web dev software ""engineering"" job after I graduate, and burn out when I'm 25. If my work terms have been any indicator, that's exactly what will be happening. And I don't feel like I'm impressive enough to get hired at any interesting company.

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading. I know I should be seeing someone for help, but everyone says the campus counselors are terrible. I have no idea where to go.

But another problem I am facing is people usually say learn a language that will contribute to what you're trying to do and here is where I think my dilemma starts.

I can scratch out game developing as I hear the woes in the industry and I don't think I'd like it. I find netsec really interesting but when I check out /r/netsec it's a lot more than just programming its like a whole other world out there. Then there is just Software Engineering which for the most part I understand but with SE I then am roadblocked with my first problem that is: Am I ready to learn another language.

It's just overwhelming how much cool things are out there and I just have no clue what to do.

This is my first time posting on Reddit so, yeah, a newbie on the internet hehe.  

I'm currently in my 3rd year as MEng undergraduate, and would most probably repeat a year. I loved maths and understanding the principle of how things work. I like to see and analyse how little changes affect the entire system and experimenting and applying them in real life. I love to figure out puzzles and have vivid imaginations (especially good at thinking out of the box). And once I set my mind on something, I don't stop. I'm currently on scholarship for uni so that's good.

Problem is:
When we had to make a choice of our study course, I really really wanted to do computer/IT engineering or environmental engineering, but my brother convinced me that MEng is the best choice and that there isn't much market for computer engineering. Even though I have no interest in MEng I did pretty well in my first year (currently studying abroad and classes are in the country's native language). I've been battling several mental illness for years now which worsened and now it's crippling my everyday life, so yeah, my grades were terribly affected, even more so that I'm forcing myself to study something I don't like.

I really want to try out computer/software/apps related job afterwards but when I look at most internship requirements, and comparing them with my uni's syllabus, I realised that to even consider applying I will most probably need to self-study them especially to master programming language. Any free time I can spare I try to learn the basics through Codeacademy, reading through JavaScript how to books (got them 2nd hand) and mobile apps book, even have a coding app in my phone. But I don't think it's enough. 

I'm also expected to serve my country by working there after graduation, but as I browse through internships for MEng, the most I can relate to is CAD (3rd world home country is more on mass manufacturing while the country I'm studying in right now is more on R&amp;D). In other words, I don't know how what I'm studying will benefit me at all.

So, am I wasting my time? Should I just focus on MEng? I was also thinking of taking a year gap to get more experience and new perspectives via trying out part-time jobs (simple programmings) and catching up with my studies (since my Mi has taken pretty much a year and a half of life). I feel like all the doors have been slammed shut and I have no one to talk to about this...

Sorry for the long post, I'd appreciate really any comments. Thanks in advance!"

I'm in my third year now, and I have to find a 16 week placement within a 17 week availability timeframe - if not then I would be rushed into moving onto a 3 year course.

I've been trying to find an internship since September of last year, but have only had one interview (thought I did well), 4 coding challenges (failed one test case in each -&gt; rejected), offered interviews but for internships that wouldn't fit in the dates criteria (off schedule or not meeting 16 weeks requirement). My university isn't lenient about the situation (which is the case for about 5 / 15 people on my course). Just to note, I've sent over 150 applications since September (had a couple of referrals that led nowhere). I've continuously worked on my resume to change it up every so often. 

The deadline for finding an internship is a little less than a month from now. Should I continue applying to US internships or just continue to apply to ones in the UK? The pay at UK internships is really mediocre for the work that they would demand (I'm talking about companies that reply to applications). I would strongly prefer an internship abroad.

I am a CS graduate that took some time off the study after graduating last Spring since I was comfortably working at another IT related job. Have a 3.5 GPA however I have not practiced programming until this month. I have been going thru Indeed searching for any software jobs until reality hit me. I am rusty as hell. 

I got a little discouraged and disappointed in myself after I was applying for QA, It Specialist, IT Support jobs with no success, made it as far as getting around 4 phone interviews out of 8 applications sent(I know it is a very small amount in applications). I graduated with an IT concentration as well as a Programming concentration. I felt that I no longer had the ""skills"" to bother applying to Software Engineering jobs. All the entry level jobs I found overwhelmed me with their requirements. I felt that school did not prep me enough for these ""entry-level"" jobs.

Fuck getting an IT job, I also studied software engineering FFS. I want to feel the same feeling I got after creating an android app that took me 80 hours to complete for a final project that I was really proud of presenting to the class. I have been feeling nostalgia reviewing my old projects and visiting HackerRank. I started again from Hello World and am reviewing recursion/algorithms now. 

The reason I come here to you guys is for reassurance of my planning I guess. I've spent the majority of my time coding in Java. I briefly touched C#/.NET in class, Swift, and MySQL. Also I like using Javascript/HTML5/CSS which I'm planning to use to create some kind of portfolio to show off with my job applications. 

From now until I get my foot in the door, I am going over harder algorithms in Java which is similar to C# so that I can have a strong language(s) to fall on during interviews. I will buy a domain name and create a website where I can display my web making abilities and lead visitors to my GitHub page containing my Java and other programs. I want to have a database in that website with x information that can retrieve/store with. I am also using HackerRank to learn Ruby, Python, and C# better because aside from Java, I see those languages required a lot. I am practicing every day and want to know what you guys think. 

Also is every internship in the summer? I did not get any software internships in the summers due to my job. If I cannot land an entry level job I would settle for an internship as long as it is for software engineering/web development. It is now February and summer is too far away. 

Sorry if this was a long read but I felt like I needed to get this off my chest and ask for help. I have been reading posts here for the past week and what I got is: projects projects projects. Also apply A LOT and be ready for rejection/silence, while not feeling down. I really want to make myself proud."

I've narrowed down my options to Mechanical &amp; Mechatronic engineering and Computer engineering.

However I am also not sure whether to remain at my current university, the University of Sydney, or to transfer to the University of Technology Sydney. I've laid down pros and cons below for each of them.

Mechanical &amp; Mechatronics
Pros:
- A wide range of things learned, gain skills in mechanical, electrical and software
- The range of things learned appeal to my indecisiveness
- Learn more about physics and the physical world, as opposed to only computer related topics
Cons:
- Doesn't seem as employable as other majors, especially in the US (referring to mechatronics)
- Jack of all trades, master of none dilemma (referring to mechatronics)
- Worried I'll always be passed over in favour of a more specific engineering degree
- My interests don't lie in robotics in particular, more just the wide range of knowledge associated with the degree
- Not as qualified to work with computer software as a computer engineer would

Electrical (Computer)
Pros:
- Seems much more employable
- Get to learn more about software and algorithms, which appeal to me a lot
- Good mix of software and hardware
Cons:
- Seems a bit limiting in regards to what I'll be able to work in in the future, no knowledge of anything mechanical
- A field that I don't think will change much over time, stale-ish
- Not sure I will enjoy purely electrical enough to solely pursue it in a degree
- Seems to be the most difficult major, not sure if I'm ready to go full nerd mode for the next 3-4 years

USyd
Pros:
- My current university, no change complications
- Offers an electrical (computer) course
Cons:
- Not as good of an engineering faculty
- Don't know anyone that's done electrical at USyd, worried that it may be a weak course at this particularly university

UTS
Pros: 
- Better engineering faculty
- My friends go there (dumb reason but I'd really enjoy their company with how lost I've been feeling lately)
- One year internship as part of degree
- Simply more comfortable and at home there, at the campus, than at my own university
- Summer semesters to catch up in
Cons:
- Electrical major involves power subjects which do not interest me, not sure if I can replace them with computer related subjects yet
- Extra year of my degree, although one year of it will be working. Not sure if I can scrap the year of internships
- Chance of not all my subjects becoming properly transferred, will probably still get the credits for all of them, but some as electives, possible repeating of first year subjects

So there's my list, I'm applying for my American citizenship, so I'm considering moving there sometime after a graduate, which is why it's important for me to get a degree which will have value over there.

In regards to what I would like to do, I'm just interested in emerging technology, I'd prefer to work in something related to that than a simple manufacturing related position. I enjoy coding and mathematics, particularly the mathematics behind the physics engines you see in video games.

I'd also just enjoy working in anything physics related, I love mathematics and I'd love to apply it to real world situations as much as I can.

Simply the thought of working at a company at all depresses me beyond anything. I'm aware at how absurd it is (especially for engineering) and I'm working on seeing a therapist over it. But I would definitely lean to whatever would give me an edge towards possibly working independently, on my own.

Im 20 and a second year, I get the whole ""you're never too old to be learning"" thought, which I totally believe in, but I feel extremely old and insecure to be where I am and I really just wanna study and finish and move onto other  projects in my life.

I just want a solid degree under my belt, what I plan to do after that, I really have no clue. I'm aware that this isn't a great idea when it comes to something like engineering, but I'm tired of idling around, I need some kind of path to follow.

I would love to hear advice from people doing either of the two degrees, at either of the two universities. Or just anyone in particular with something to say.

Thanks in advance for any advice given."

At first, I was extremely nervous about how I would interact with people. I was (actually still am) a usually shy individual, and I tried to avoid too much human interaction. In the summer before my junior year, I started volunteering at St. Jude's Medical Center in their Cardiology and Telemetry Department. Needless to say, I was worn out, physically because of the discharging and delivery, mentally because of the many struggled greetings that I tried to give to many nurses introducing myself.

As junior year finally starts up, I look at my class schedule: 5 AP classes. I thought about my sophomore year, in which I had Bs even though I had so much time in my hands and I had only taken two that year. In addition, I had signed up for an additional hospital volunteering shift at a closer hospital, so I thought about how I was going to get through this year. 

Well, it's been one hell of a junior and senior year, and I can honestly say that devoting my time to service at the hospital has been a ride I'll never forget. I have made new companions that have instilled me with valuable traits, and my grades did not suffer (only one B in my first semester). But, after my 200+ hours of service at these two hospitals, I feel so sad that today's Sunday shift is my final one. 

Before, when I walked around the hospital and performed my duties, I found myself staring at the floor as strangers and patients walked by me. But now, as I perform these duties, I am able to hold my head high and smile as I cross paths with other strangers, hoping to make their life better as well :)

I loved every minute I spent at these two hospitals, and I know in Nashville I will definitely become a volunteer. Even though I'm Asian and underrepresented in Tennessee, that wouldn't stop me! Wishing everyone the best of luck in the college process!

5sa64t,2,2017-02-05,Spend money to earn my dead father's blessing,s_ilentium,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5sa64t/spend_money_to_earn_my_dead_fathers_blessing/,"This post includes stuff of mental illness, so please don't be bothered or skip reading. Below is a Tl ;dr.

Hey there. Today's the day. I got to realize I have a problem with spending money on things I don't need nor even really want. I don't know too much about this whole topic, but I think it's quite normal to deny at the beginning. But some day comes the point you have to realize. 

I found out as I thought about how I will finance my apprenticeship I wanted to start this summer and for which I have to do an internship before, connected with a move to my boyfriend. He isn't flush at the moment. To be honest, he is searching for a job and has loads of debts. 

It isn't as if I had no saved money (thanks to my parents), so there would be enough for emergency theoretically. It's even not that little. But I just can't handle it. 
Whenever I got some cash or my monthly wage arrives, I have to spend it. 
I tried to collect all receipts and write them down in a book called ""Kakebo"", but I forget it. I've tried different apps, even the ones that cost (how ironically lol), but I'm afraid to use them. I'm so afraid to see how much I spend on useless stuff. Cause I could be disappointed. I could come to hate myself.

But this is honestly the last thing I want. I had this, low self-esteem, all the hate, all the disappointment. The point is I was mentally ill. (I still am, but there's no valid comparison to before I went to the clinics and received treatment and medical aid.) I was a shy and calm  kid, then my dad died out of  nowhere when I was eight and I've been a retiring person ever since. When I was twelve I finally realized and planned my suicide for my 16th birthday (which it wouldn't come to, at least not the exact day I calculated). 

But something changed and my inner me saw I just wanted to live for both of us (as he was only 39 when he died). And I began wanting to improve myself, which isn't the worst idea at first sight. But I exaggerated as I mostly do. Started with eating disorders in all of their possibilities, then doing drugs (amphetamines mainly, cause they're the best thing you get when desiring to lose weight, aren't they?) and as if I didn't yet spent enough money on food supplements, sport courses and my ""happy pills""(that would strengthen my paranoia and effect psychotic episodes), I wanted more. 

I wanted to be better. Wanted to live life to it's fullest. Wanted to learn everything that interested me (due to the fact I abandoned school at age of 16 and with lower grades I could've had, I suppose), wanted to improve my skills on basically everything. I wanted to learn playing the piano (my father was an enthusiastic player), wanted to learn Swedish to do a canoe/tent trip over there (just as he did in his youth), then felt guilty about my mother and wanted to copy her all the same. But nevertheless I wanted to become a strong, independent young woman, I didnt want to lose myself in all of this. So I needed some hobbies, right? Stuff for those hobbies. Money to pay my ballet classes and my riding lessons. Money to buy clothes that were at least as fancy as the ones of those girls around my school (or when I didn't go there anymore, I compared with the perfectionists on the world wide web). 

It was so exhausting. So disappointing to never be good enough. To know I could be better and make my dead father proud, or at least me. 
I slipped into depression. I also may have been maniac from time to time. But that's the past. I'm not depressed anymore. I can figure out when losing my mind on negative thoughts. I don't do drugs anymore since my rehab. I eat normal. It could be the perfection I always seeked for.

If there wasn't this f*cked up money problem. The only thing that hasn't  almost changed at all. I still think I need things over things to be worthy. I think I could find the time someday to do all of the things I thought were important to live a fulfilled life. On the other side it gives me a feeling of safety. 

I just don't know what to do. Or if anybody feels the same, has comparable reasons to buy buy buy. 
I just want to get an overview without  hating myself, so I could eventually be able to change my habits. That's the most important thing I should ""improve"" - my ability to spent money in consciousness. Will you give me some tips? I would really appreciate. And please excuse my English, it's not my first language and I hope it's understandable. If not, please ask.

Thank you very much for taking time and reading.

This company has an ""intern program"" where interns are assigned a mentor and they also get to develop and grow professionally through various activities such as networking events within the company and chances to do presentations to the company. That's great, but not when I'm excluded from all of that. Every time I ask someone why I'm not part of the intern program, I get a different answer and no one can give me a straight answer. All my boss expects me and my partner (also got screwed out of the intern program like me) to do is code all day and doesn't care about professional development. I didn't come here to code all day, I joined the company as an intern because I wanted to grow with the company, yet they aren't giving me that opportunity. I asked for a mentor and the people running the intern program said they would give me one, but never did so far. The communication between different people in this company is horrible.

The team I was placed on is new and the code we are writing sucks. It's unreadable and there are no comments at all and it's frustrating to write code, especially since I'm a beginner programmer. I can't ask my manager for help because he doesn't know JavaScript, and my partner works on different things because he's an expert, and when I do ask him for help, he gets frustrated over me being a beginner and just ends up writing the code himself and I don't learn anything that way.

I have at least one emotional breakdown a week. I didn't think I would cry over how miserable an internship could be. I feel hopeless and lost while the other interns get help with their intern program. I'm young and lost and I don't even know how to fit in the professional workplace. I'm not growing with this company. It's been 4 weeks and I have 13 weeks left and I don't know how I can continue for 13 more weeks. I also had depression last semester in school and I thought I would enjoy working, but I feel depressed again. My boss gets back from his business trip on Monday and I'm going to talk to him about how I feel, but I just needed a place to vent for now."

Now I'm fully committed to finding a CS job but in response to my lack of calls from recruiters (applied 100+ times last 2 month) and my growing knowledge from this subreddit I find myself with a crushing reality and many unanswered(unanswerable?) questions.

I neglected to do internships, I cannot really find internships allowing students who graduated, especially so ""later on"", entry-level developer jobs asking for experience in skills I don't have as many projects on (java development) and others I don't have any experience on but I'd still like to do like .net framework.

Regardless of this reality I've seen others discuss similar scenarios.  It seems the course of action I need to take is doing project demonstrable on github or a mobile storefront and then apply to such jobs but here's where my questions come up.

* I worry about doing projects in X language and X language not having as many job prospect later on, should I work in Y language if it seems ubiquitous (thinking .NET/C++ framework which I've found might have most prospects)?

* I have some web development and a bit java experience is there any real chance to hear back in junior java or junior c++? If I apply everywhere?

I am a junior looking for a summer internship. After throwing out about 65 apps, I have received just a handful (around 4) coding challenges. So far, I have managed to do rather poorly on all of them, which has led me to one rejection already.
What are your strategies for learning from LeetCode? Sometimes I find myself stuck on the same question for a couple of hours and I feel like that's not the best use of my time, but again neither is checking out the answers prematurely.

Say that the coding challenge has 3 problems and around 10 tests for each, if I knock the first two out but then get nothing with the third. Am I automatically disqualified for most companies? My problem is that I often times feel like I have the right algorithm worked out in my head. It's the edge-cases or Java conventions under time limit that are killing me. "

So I'm about 2 months away from graduating with a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics (I'm 23). I really do enjoy computer science, mostly the aspect of creating a product. When you work hard enough at programming something, you will typically see a result (via programming that is. I have less interest in theoretical computer science though I am alright at it). Anyways, I've always had a passion for art/drawing and video games. I've been creating comics since I could spell, and drawing since I could hold a pencil. It's always been ""my thing"", especially growing up. I've had family and friends tell me I should pursue it, however I was always scared away by the whole ""you'll never find a job in art, it's too risky money-wise"" thing.

Anyways, I worked my ass off in high school and got a high average with a 3 different scholarships into uni (I live in Canada), so I felt obligated to go. My other option was a graphic design course at a local college. So here I am, almost graduated. I've had an internship with Intel, which I really enjoyed but realized that I can't see myself coding libraries and tests all day, and would always draw on my whiteboard in my free time.

Since I had little direction/idea of where to go next, I decided on graduate school. I enjoy robotics so I'm planning on doing a thesis-based graduate degree based around that topic. However, I still feel like I know what really brings be happiness but I'm ignoring it out of fear. I don't want to waste my CS degree as I do enjoy it, but I don't enjoy coding near as much as I enjoy designing and drawing.

I'm open to any suggestions/experiences/ideas on where to go from here. Should I postpone my current graduate degree and seek other graphic art-based grad degrees in other provinces? Should I practice more in my free time and create a portfolio to apply for video game design positions? Should I stick it out? I'm completely lost."

My husband was in the military so we were bouncing around quite a bit so I was never able to commit to a summer internship in my field which left me less competitive than some of my peers even though I have an extremely competitive GPA in a STEM field.

I believe the lack of internships hurt my job prospects, so after searching for several months I took a job working as a credit analyst for a bank. The pay is not competitive and I don't feel like the job is a very good fit for me. This is being made worse by some of the companies I've applied to reaching out to me for interviews.

The issue is that I've only been with my current job three months. I have my 3 month review this week and it's important that I leave on the best terms that I can.

Is it appropriate to bring it up in the review? Saying I've got some concerns with my current position and that I've had other companies that I applied to **before** accepting this job reaching out to me for interviews? My boss has mentioned before that he is very selective when hiring people and that it typically takes him several months to find a candidate that he likes enough to make a job offer to. Can I give him a heads up that I anticipate leaving within the next 60-90 days and ask him how he'd like to proceed? I'd hate to risk losing my job by trying to give them as much of a heads up as possible, but I also don't want to screw my company over, they're good people and I like them, I just don't find the work fulfilling and it's a significantly lower compensation package than what the job interviews I'm being extended offer.

Is there protocol for this? If I do give my boss a heads up and they end up letting me go is that typically understood by new employers? I have a degree in Mathematics and am interviewing with engineering companies for positions that would literally double my salary, so I think they'll understand taking a job in the interim while waiting to start my career, but it's one thing to leave a position after 3 months for a significantly better position, and I'm afraid it might be another to have to say I was fired from a low stress bank position after 3 months.

Thoughts?

It is an internship but once they heard I had another offer they made a large offer of  an 85k euro salary plus benefits. This is would put me in the top 5-10% of income earners in Ireland, perhaps higher. In my first week in this role I wanted to quit as it was all too much. The learning and development hasn't been the best but at this salary they expect you to research yourself. No one talks to each other, everyone verges on being autistic. Think there was a week were I didn't speak to anyone. The people are nice though but always professional. Wouldn't talk about things we did on weekends off or anything. The theory of the work is semi tough, feels like an extended PhD. There's unlimited free food and loads of services like onsite doctors, gym, clothes washing and drying. If I stay on the salary would enter six figures in two years.

However I've suffered from depression in the past and can get fed up with life occasionally. My dad thinks it's up to me to manage this and it shouldn't have to do with the company I work for. If I stay in the financial institution I'd have to go to the gym more and look after my health to get through it. 

If you need any more information let me know.

I am a student about to graduate in 2 yrs. I was thinking about whether I should do a 1 yr m.eng program either at Cornell( my undergrad) or Berkeley. I know many people think master's degrees in CS are useless so I was wondering whether there would be any benefit at all in doing this. I am graduating school debt free and already have an internship lined up for this summer. I may want to get into finance someday and I hear a master's or phd are very useful for that field.
Also I started coding when I got into my undergrad so I figured more schooling would give me more time to own my craft.

 * What's the ambiance/culture of the firm like? Is it fun?

 * How many hours a week did you work, on average?

 * If you don't mind me asking, how much did they compensate you with? Was it enough to afford local housing?

 * What was the interview process like?

 * Were there many interns or was it really a startup culture thing with a few interns and mostly full-time employees?

In fact, when I have interviews for internships or summer positions one of the first things potential employers ask me is what experience I have with DDC, which I would have experience with enough to at least hold a conversation about it if the class were being taught, its entirely on DDC of HVACR systems.  However, our professor had back surgery between the fall and spring semesters and keeps getting the date when he's allowed to return pushed back.  The college also never set up the lab over break, so us the students are doing it under supervision of a professor who is clueless as to what DDC of HVACR equipment entails, and he has told us this multiple times.  We aren't even setting up the specialized equipment like controllers anyway, just running wires and mounting dinrail on the walls pretty much, learning absolutely not a fucking thing about what the class is supposed to be teaching.  When the semester first started, we were told the original professor would be back the second or third week of class, which isn't too bad, but it's now the fifth week of a sixteen week semester and we haven't met our professor or started any material.  I am seriously concerned about the quality of education I'm getting.  It's not just that we're paying to take a class that we are doing a job somebody else was to be payed to do, but I'm having potential employers ask me about DDC, I say I have this class, they want to know what we're doing, and we aren't doing shit that has to do with DDC.  Then next semester and the following classes will build off of this class and we haven't even started.  When I brought my concerns to the dean, he flipped it and made it me complaining about the professors involved. I tried to make it clear it's about how the college assigned people to cover the class who can't do it and the fact that our lab wasn't even set up, but its like he was dead set on making it seem like I'm complaining about the professors so that I would be afraid to press it any further to not have a shit relationship with my professors, and it worked.  I was actually impressed at how well he was able to take my complaint and twist it into something I wouldn't want to continue with.

I'm senior at a UC school and I'll be graduating in the spring with a BS in mathematics. My original plan was to go to graduate school for math but I've come to realize the job prospects aren't exactly what I'm looking for so I've become interested in pursuing alternate masters programs.


I'm heavily drawn towards computer science as it's very similar to math (essentially the same thing), but I just don't have the knowledge base required to enter these programs. Now I do have a lot of transferable skills but I really only know a basic amount of programming such as basic Python and C++. My current university does not allow outside majors to take comp sci so it's a bust.


So I suppose I have a few questions. Is it reasonable to self-study/take open courses from local universities to achieve a comparable degree of competency to that of a Bachelors in Computer science ? I was planning to take a year off, move back home (sucks but hey sometimes you gotta do it) and try to find internships or anything while studying for the GRE and learning various comp sci topics. Will I run into any issues? What do you guys recommend?

Some background :
Hi, I'm a sophomore undergrad studying in one of the UC schools in California. International student (F-1), Korean, and this is my fifth year in U.S. My current major is Cognitive Science - machine learning, with a minor in computer science.


Originally as an undeclared major freshman, my plan was to declare CS major in sophomore year, after taking all required lower-division classes (7 of them). I took 5, finished my freshman year, and went back to Korea for my obligatory military service for 2 years. However, after 2years, CS became a impacted/capped major. And when I returned to school (2017 Jan, Winter quarter) as a sophomore, I couldn't declare CS because it became a capped major; because it required 3.9/4.0 GPA, which I didn't have.


So my only option was to declare a major that I was semi-interested in; Cognitive science - machine learning. And minor in Computer Science.


=================

I'm not happy with the current state :


I'm not satisfied with my current major. Sure, machine learning/AI seems really interesting, but this wasn't the thing that I've always wanted to learn. I really liked CS, and I really wanted to major in it.


All of the CS classes I've taken/am taking are really fun; data structure, assembly, programming classes.. Those were the things that I really wanted to learn since High school. I actually enjoyed going to lectures when I was taking those classes. I want to learn more, deeper. Compilers, architecture, networking, security, anything.


So I decided to transfer to another school, in the upcoming junior year. But fall semester transfer deadline was in December/January for most schools. Damn. My only option is to transfer as a Junior, in spring semester. And yes, I might have to do one more semester in order to graduate, or even 1 year. I don't mind, and thankfully, my parents are supportive (for now).

==============

Some questions :

1. If I become a CS at junior year 2nd semester, would it be too late to prepare for side projects/portfolio? Will I have too less time to get an internship? a job?


2. I won't be going to grad school.. If I were not to transfer, can cogsci major be as competitive as a CS major when getting a job? 


3. Is this a good idea?


TBH I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do with my life. So I'm asking for help to pretty much everyone I know. And I thought reddit might give me some good advice as well.

I just wanted to inquire about my chances of getting into a graduation school in neuroscience/molecular cell bio. In particular, I would like to get into a school in either the UK or Germany. I am a US/Canada dual-citizen, so I know getting funding can be a bit tougher. I want to go to school in Europe because of the shorter time for a PhD (on average), with the eventual goal of going into industry back in the US.

My stats:
BSc from a top Canadian University
3.6 GPA with a strong upward trend
Lots of upper-level course-work in Neuro/molecular biology


During my undergrad: My most significant research experience was leading a collaborative project between two labs (Neuroscience and biomedical engineering), during which I did 3 full-time summers of research, funded by various research awards and when not working full-time, volunteering or researching for credit for 5 semesters of school. This work should result in a first-authored manuscript with a relatively high impact factor, which I am writing now. I also presented posters and published abstracts at two international coferences and a few local ones. 

After graduating I did a four month internship at a lab abroad, from which we have submitted a co-authored paper to a journal with impact factor ~19. 

Now I am working as a research assistant/lab tech at Columbia University, doing an independent research project and also finishing up a project for a previous PhD student. Hopefully one of these projects will lead to some kind of submitted paper before applying for PhDs. 

I will definitely have strong LORs from the different professor's I have worked for. I am hoping to go to UCL or Imperial College London (I studied abroad at UCL and really enjoyed my time in London), and was just wondering if there was any hope of me getting a fully-funded PhD there as an international student. Also, does anyone have any experience or advice about coming back to the US with a UK/German PhD?

NCSU has an amazing engineering school, which computer science is a part of. UNC is a litter tougher to get into than NCSU, outside of NCSU engineering, and has higher rankings than NCSU for just about every major. So instead of a wall of text I'll just give you the breakdown of both:


NCSU (Engineering CS):
-Fantastic and competitive engineering school (which CS is in)
-Strong industry connections
-Large alumni network
-CS department really prepares you for industry (according to a MIT CS freshman from my high school)
-Companies located directly on beautiful Engineering campus
-Have to take more engineering type classes
-Really ugly main campus
-Doesn't really feel cozy like more compact campuses
-55/45 M/F ratio


UNC (""Pure"" CS)
-Great CS department, ranked higher than NCSU
-Higher rankings across other majors
-Great campus
-Great athletics, especially basketball (chants ""not our rivals"" at games vs NCSU)
-Generally more competitive than majors that aren't engineering 
-farther from home, but not too far
-Prepares you better for higher education pursuits like graduate degrees and research opportunities (from the MIT CS freshman)
-40/60 M/F ratio
-Funding issues
-Not really known for its tech industry presence


If I'm being completely honest I'm leaning towards UNC. I believe I'll be able to get a job and internships at either since RTP is close by, and just see myself enjoying my time at UNC more. Is it worth sacrificing better industry connections for my preferred college experience?


That being said I would appreciate your logical and objective responses, not emotionally charged biased ones as people some people have about colleges.

5sjflr,3,2017-02-06,Should I graduate a semester later?,thsieh10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5sjflr/should_i_graduate_a_semester_later/,"I just read this: ""It's late in the recruiting season for in demand companies, which probably explains why nobody is biting."" and started panicking. Is it really too late? I know LinkedIn, AirBnb and a couple other big names are out of head counts for new grads. But what about the other big ones? 

Oh, I am not just blindly going after the big names by the way… It’s just that I am and international student and these big companies care less.

I started a bit late in terms of job hunting, because I only returned to school after the first half of 2016 Fall semester due to family/personal reasons. No good news yet, currently in the interviewing process with one of the Big4. I am honestly thinking about graduating in 2017 December instead of 2017 May, so I can possibly intern for the summer and apply during the hot recurring season(August~December?).

I think not having an internship experience is hurting my chances. I am currently enrolled in a 5 years, concurrent Bachelor's and Master's program; I spent my sophomore summer doing an equity research in an investment firm  (back then I was still exploring my options); junior summer I did a machine translation research with a well funded team which resulted in publication last year; senior summer I had to go back to my home country and serve military, so basically wasted. I don't go to a target school but it ranks top 10 overall in the nation; I have a 3.51 GPA for my Bachelors in CS &amp; CE and 3.88 for Master's in CS. I am not even getting interviews which makes me really think “it’s late in the recruiting season”. One of the Big4 is coming to school tomorrow for their internship, should I apply for an internship and graduate a semester later?"

This is my last semester of college. I am dual-majoring in marketing and economics. Last semester, I took a basic information systems management class and fell in love with the subject. 

I have started learning the basics of SQL and HTML because of my current internship. For all of you marketers out there, what are some good programming languages to start out with? Should I take the route of web design and learn HTML, JAVA, Visual Basic, etc.? Or should I start out with something more data oriented such as SQL, Python, R, etc.?

I guess I haven't really decided if I wanted to go into a career in market research/research analytics, or digital marketing, software development, web design, etc. 

I am looking for any advice from anyone in the marketing field, research and analytics, or possibly any business-related environment. I know this is a broad (novice) question. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thanks Reddit!

Now im trying to understand how we currently work and what would be a good change to our current culture in order to get better.

our company develops a software that we use it ourselves as a service provider, but we also sell it to customers and support it as a service.

our major problems are:
1 - the software is not automation friendly: it requires too many manuall steps when installing/updating to a major release.
2 - our development cycles are too long (typical 3 weeks sprints).
3 - our own feature requests (from operations team in order to make the software maintainable) are mostly set to later dates (and then later, and later), because the customer requests have a higher priority...
4 - we dont handle the infrastructure as a code
5 - we dont have automated tests to run on every new build version
6 - we allways have problems when deploying to production
7 - our biggest fear is to deploy in our biggest customer, which has a big infrastructure (which we cant clone atm).

after learning a bit about devops i think i now know a couple things about whats going on and how to change that but still having trouble to some company intern decisions...

- now we were told we should automate the installation of our own complex software with some config management tools like puppet/chef/etc
    --&gt; the problem i see here is: 
            - first we have to eliminate those manuall installation notes steps.
            - this would work for our own instances, but we probably cant force our customers to use an extra tool only to be able to let us update our own software in their environment.
- the development cycle will probably not be shortened, because our biggest stackholder can only get features (major releases) twice a year. so we kinda base our development on that.
- how to act in 1/4 as a service provider, when working on customer system?

So I have an upcoming interview for a software developer job, specifically a c# software developer job. I have a few questions that I was wondering if you could answer for me before the interview.

1) The manager of the company contacted me asking me if I could come in for an interview. Would it be advisable that I respond with

 ""Yes, I will come in to the interview. However, because I want to be respectful of your time, is there anything that I can do to be better prepared for this interview?"". 

I originally got this idea from reddit because people made the argument that it shows the interviewer that you respect him and that you dont want to waste his time but I was wondering what you guys thought about this.

2) This is more of a point combined with a question that I wanted to make. I have interview a total of 4 times. Each time has been so different. Two interviewers never asked me any coding questions, rather they gave me logic exams and that was it. 

Another company seemed more interested in my past projects, classes that I took in school, and if I could get along with others.

The last company wanted to know if I understood basic concepts such as loops, arrays, assembly, delegates, etc. Fundamentals I guess.

So how do you prepare for interviews? I took the rest of the week off from my current job to sharpen up on my c# fundamentals. In my internship I worked with MVVM but man was that confusing. So right now I am on pluralsight learning the basics of MVC and sharpening up on c# fundamentals. 

I guess what I am asking for is advice on how to best prepare myself for my interview that I have in 3 days. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

I'm a sophomore who's been rejected by lots of companies (as I see is the trend), but I can get a kinda crappy local internship where I live at some noname insurance company if I need to.  What I've noticed about myself, however is that I'm terrible at serious coding interviews.  My resume was good enough to get coding challenges and phone interviews at some decently known places (I interned freshman year and have some kinda interesting projects) but I failed all my interviews and coding challenges.

So I was wondering, to optimize my chances of a really nice internship next cycle my junior year, would it be best to just say screw it and spend my summer doing interview prep (leetcode, CTCI) and *hopefully* boss my interviews junior year, or should I accept this boring internship with the opportunity cost of staying kinda bad at interviews? I have a heavy workload during school and can't really adequately interview prep then, and I don't want to commit to serious interview prep during my internship because I'm still young and I want to breathe during my summer lol

So, people who are more experienced than me, what would you do in my shoes? Shine up my interview skills and confidently go for a big4 or a well known place next year, or take the below average internship this summer, potentially reducing my chances at a good internship next year?

5sngx0,17,2017-02-07,For those on the fence about masters - A little tip,thenetdefend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5sngx0/for_those_on_the_fence_about_masters_a_little_tip/,"I see couple post asking if Master program in CS is worth it. The answer is: it depends. There are scenarios where it's a no-brainer:

1. Your past degree is from a non-CS related area and you want to increase your credentials to getting a CS-related jobs. 
2. You want to specialize in an area. (ie: Most data scientist or machine learning engineer ask for a Master CS degree minimum)

edit: If you are an international student interested in working for another country it might be your #3. 

There are scenarios, however, where it's debatable. 

1. You are having a hard time finding a job so you want to do a masters to increase your chances. 

Getting a Masters degree 'resets' everything. What I mean by that is that going back to education gives you the opportunity to apply for internships and new-graduate positions. But you have to know that this is basically a roll of the dice. You are wasting 2-years + ~40k worth of tuition + opportunity cost from your past job for basically another roll of the dice. If you are moving from a top 100 school to a top 25 school, then yeah it might be worth it. However, if the program doesn't give you more then what you did for your undergrad, you might have to rethink about your choices. 

I say this because employee are constantly being aware that education =/= proficiency. You can come out from a top 10 university and still fail that easy interview questions. If you have 2 years to get yourself a job and you have CS-background, you can learn so much on your own. Creating IOS/Android application that gets downloads will get you interviews. Topping topcoder and winning coding competitions will get you interviews. Contributing to open-source frequently will get you recognized with the network. And all of this is free and on your own time. I will iterate here what is said so many times before: education will only open doors for you, it won't tell you how to get in.

2 You want to meet college girls/guys. - I should actually move this up to the 'no-brainer' section. "

So last Friday I received an offer at Huntington Ingalls for $24 an hour this summer, about 20-25 min from my house. I got hired in the Process Standardization &amp; Integration department. I'm a junior ECE, and I honestly am undecided as to what exactly I want to do with my engineering degree. I am currently trying to decide between grad school and industry. 

While I am happy that I have received an offer, I am apprehensive to accept it immediately because my true passion lies within biomedical engineering. My school does not offer a BME program so ECE is the way I'm going for now, in order to transition to BME later. I have applied for a few REUs this summer and am hoping to hear back from some of them soon. I want to decide whether I even like research first before committing to grad school. I am hopefully graduating on time in May 2018, but in all honestly I may take an extra semester to graduate because I had quite a few personal issues freshman and sophomore year to work through. I am doing better now, and I have a 3.5 GPA so grad school is still an option. 

I honestly feel stuck. I want to enjoy my summer, as last summer I was bored to death with summer classes and helping around the house. I have had previous internship experience at NASA for two summers before (before my freshman year and after my freshman year) and currently have a management internship at a small local electrical engineering company for the school year. 

I still am not 100% sure what I want to do after graduation. Ideally, a R&amp;D position in some type of medical engineering context would be awesome, but I think that requires grad school most of the time.

If I wanted to pursue a Masters in Bioengineering, what honestly should I do from this point on? Should i take the summer internship and just try to fit research in my free time/next semester for a class, or should I accept and then wait to hear back from other REUs and then negotiate from there? Will having industry experience vs research experience hurt me in a grad school application context?

 I feel so lost. I don't admittedly know too much about the position, so I was going to call tomorrow. I have to accept by this Friday. I feel so stuck :( 

Please let me know if I need to clarify anything."

Coffee. Change rooms. Handshakes. Panic. One of those four should not belong, and it’s not that delicious early morning Starbucks.

As I wrap up SWE internship interviews and start my usual midterm cramming, I ask myself: why did I do so much better than last year? Or why did they go so poorly last year? How have I changed my approach, and what could I have known last year to better prepare myself?

A year ago, I was in your shoes: a nervous, eager freshman studying Computer Science at the frostbitten University of Waterloo. Around now, I was interviewing with software companies for the first time in my life. Fun, right?

It was a terrible experience. In high-school, I won a few programming competitions and coded a lot because I didn’t go out much, so I was pretty sure of my abilities. Needless to say, I ended up not preparing much and got my butt whooped.

But why did I fail my interviews? At the time, I honestly had no idea, and to be fair, unless someone had straight up told me the honest truth, I don’t think any amount of preparation could have helped me.

---

Before I dive into the gritty details, let’s look at what people say about preparing for these interviews. A quick Google search for “software engineering interview tips” yields advice like: “learn to solve X-based problems”, where X is something like data structures or recursion, and “answer questions with passion”. I mean, they’re not necessarily bad advice, and you certainly need a solid grasp on CS fundamentals before working at Google. But this post isn’t about your CS 341 class; it’s about an in-depth strategy guide to handle technical interviews correctly.

---

The first tip will be more helpful to those who already have strong CS problem-solving experience. It is: for 99% of technical questions, there is only one correct answer – the one that the interviewer has in mind. It is your job to verbalize not just the solution, but the thought process that led to it. Let’s clarify this confusing sentence with an example:

&gt; Question: We all know that the Fibonacci sequence is defined as f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2), for f(1)=f(2)=1. Let’s define a neo-Fibonacci sequence as g(n)=g(n-1)+g(n-2)+g(n-3), for g(1)=g(2)=g(3)=1. How would you efficiently find g(n) for any given n?

If you’re relatively new at these questions and you start off thinking of the recursive solution, then you’re on the right track to the “desired” solution, after a hint or two (which is perfectly fine). If you’re an experienced programming competitor (or really good at math), your first instinct might be to jump to the dynamic programming solution, or even better, the matrix multiplication solution straight away. You might even write the textbook-perfect implementation in a single take. Well, congratulations, pack up your bags, you just failed the interview.

---

You’re bewildered. You think, “I just wrote the asymptotically-optimal code that’s probably on par with the standard library implementation. Why did I fail that question?”. The reason you failed is not because you were technically wrong, but because you failed to grasp a crucial part of technical questions: to give you a chance to elaborate on your reasoning and explanation skills.

An interview is not your math or CS exam. It’s a chance to see if you have chemistry with the interviewer – if you can collaborate well with her. That’s why most of the time, if you’re stuck, she’ll be willing to provide a few hints to get you moving.

On the other hand, if you just quickly state the solution, which is something like “we keep a list/vector/ArrayList storing the progressively bigger values of g(x), for x=4 … n”, and write down the thirty-line implementation in three minutes, it literally tells the interviewer nothing about your communication or problem-solving skills. You might have seen the question before, or know the concept of DP beforehand. What would you if the question didn’t fit neatly into an existing concept?

The reason you failed is that for every question, the interviewer has a preconception of what the “ideal” candidate should think through. And it is not “state the final solution and write the code”. The actual promising candidate should say something along the lines of:

&gt; Hmm, this question reminds me of the Fibonacci sequence, which has a recursive solution, which means the runtime would scale something like O(2^n), if we want to find the n-th number. I think if we apply the same logic for this sequence, the naïve solution would be O(3^n). Hey, what if we store the solution as we go along? Then we can use g(1), g(2), and g(3) to calculate g(4), use g(2), g(3), g(4) to calculate g(5), and so on, until we reach g(n). Then for each step from 4 … n, we perform a constant-time calculation, this solution will be O(n), which is a lot more efficient than O(3^n), at a cost of O(n) memory. Do you want me to code this solution?

Do you see the difference between the two approaches? I’m not saying “play dumb”, but more like “show your steps”. Remember, the question is designed not so you can prove that you’re a walking CLRS textbook, but rather to help you gain brownie points with the interviewer for the reasoning and communication skills you said you had on your resumé.

And don’t even bother with the O(log n) matrix multiplication solution. Chances are, unless you’re interviewing for Dropbox or something, the interviewer doesn’t know about that solution (not everyone nerds out about algorithms), and explaining that would be both time-consuming and pointless. (I’ve personally made a mistake like this before involving the “sweep-line” algorithm, and ended up confusing both myself and the interviewer in some edge cases.)

---

To sum things up: technical problems are for showing off your problem-solving skills, and more importantly, your ability to communicate your reasoning and thought process. Don’t be the robot who can only market himself as a walking algorithm encyclopedia. Be the colleague that the interviewer would be happy to work with in the future. That’s how you ace a technical interview."
5so9os,3383,2017-02-07,The One That Got Away,bookshelfghost,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5so9os/the_one_that_got_away/,"Lily Harrison and I met at a graduation party when we were eighteen. As soon as I walked into the house, her bubbling laughter caught my attention. I couldn’t help but grin because it was so contagious, and she’d noticed. Already a couple drinks in, she pointed right at me and shouted, “Hey. You’re cute. Come be my partner.” So, after hours of beer pong and Fireball shots, I held her hair back while she vomited for thirty minutes and she planted sloppy kisses on my neck and cheek the entire ride back to her place. She scribbled her phone number on a napkin stolen from my glove box and stuffed it in my shirt pocket before falling out of the passenger seat and onto the gravel drive. She apologized profusely, peed herself with laughter, and finally stumbled through her front door. She was a fucking mess, and I couldn’t stop thinking about her. 

The next day I asked a few of our mutual friends about her and they all said that she was pretty much too good to be true. “She doesn’t know what she wants, man,” my co-worker Josh told me. “She’ll tease you and lead you on and it’s honestly such a waste of time. I’d pass if I were you.”

But I couldn’t. I was determined to get to know her. I worked up the nerve to text her, and despite my friends’ warnings, we wound up growing incredibly close that summer. She would kick my ass at video games, feed me popcorn at the movies, and constantly gave me this overpowering desire to get out and adventure. She showed me hidden hiking trails on the outskirts of town that I had no idea existed, taught me how to stand-up paddleboard at the lake. We laughed and cried and I fell so in love. 

She also broke my fucking heart. 

I was naïve and hopeful and stupid. I thought everything was falling right into place, like she and I were meant to be together and that we’d have a happy ending. I’m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but it sure as hell wasn’t realistic. We were both preparing to attend different colleges starting in the fall; colleges that were at least 500 miles away from each other. She had also never guaranteed me any kind of commitment, but I had just been so sure that she wanted to be with me. She hardly ever wanted to hang out with anyone else, she’d play with my fingers and snuggle up next to me when we watched scary movies, and I’d catch her staring at me with those piercing gray eyes dozens of times throughout the day, as if she was trying to put me together like a puzzle. I tried making a move every now and then but it just became exhausting to be disappointed each time. Even still, she would keep staring and touching and spending so much time with me to the point that everyone assumed we were an item. At one point, I just decided to stop questioning it; maybe she simply didn’t like labels and besides, I was happy just to be in her company.

When that summer ended, we said our painful goodbyes and went off to school. Within two weeks of classes there was some new asshole all over her Facebook page with his arms around her waist and his chin nuzzled into her shoulder. She called me one night to talk about the new season of one of the TV shows we’d binge-watched over the summer and I asked her about him. “Isaac,” she said, “don’t worry about it. Go hang out with some cute girls at your school. Don’t stress about me and what I’m doing.”

I didn’t have the balls to say much to that. I think I just mumbled a half-assed “goodbye” and hung up, then cried for a long time. It was the first time she had actually said anything about our relationship, and I could no longer pretend that we were anything more than friends. I was devastated. Day after day I felt the distance between us tugging at my chest until I finally just learned to live with it enough to get through my classes. Our line of communication grew slimmer and slimmer until eventually I didn’t hear from her at all. I deleted her number and unfollowed her on social media. I could no longer stand to see how seemingly happy she was with this new asshole. I tried to distract myself from the pain by partying and hooking up with almost anyone willing. I woke up next to strangers on a frequent basis, only to be met with a sinking feeling of disappointment when I realized that the brown hair cascading across the pillow did not belong to Lily. 

Five years passed. I graduated with my bachelor’s of science in biology and snagged a pretty decent job at a research lab that I love, just thirty minutes away from my hometown. My social life greatly improved. I managed to find a couple of close friends to drink beer and play Overwatch with as well as a gorgeous blonde working on her nursing certification with the greatest tits I’ve ever seen. Even though I still heard Lily in acoustic solos and smelled her in every shot of whiskey I took, I finally felt like I wasn’t constantly sad about something that I was so helpless to fix.  

It was a Friday night when my friends decided to go out to our local sports bar to celebrate one of them landing a pretty serious promotion. It was about eleven and the place was packed. My head was swimming violently and I could hardly stand up; I was the drunkest I had been since my college days. My buddies had started a pool game at the other end of the building and I was perfectly comfortable with my spot at the bar. I’d shot several drunk texts to Callie, the nursing student, who said she was too busy studying to join me but that she would give me a ride home if I needed one. I shoved my phone into my back pocket and decided to talk up the bartender instead. I was opening my mouth to call out her name—or whatever I thought her name was—when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. 

“Isaac?”

I turned around so swiftly that I knocked my drink over and spilled the bourbon all over my white shirt as well as onto the woman standing in front of me. I thought I was hallucinating, thought for sure that this was just a stranger who was about to start screaming at me for ruining her dress, but I couldn’t bring myself to speak, because the woman in front of me looked identical to Lily. 

I frowned, so painfully confused in my drunken stupor. “Wh-?”

She started to laugh. A sweet, warm, innocent sound that gathered in the base of her throat and rose like champagne to her red-stained lips. The sound sent a wave of goosebumps across my skin. My eyes caught the gap in her front teeth and my heart dropped into my stomach.

It was her.

She held a beer in one hand and was wiping at her dress with the other, making feeble attempts to get the Crown out of the fabric. Her long dark hair was pulled back loosely with several thick strands framing her blushing cheeks; her storm-cloud eyes blinked sleepily, holding my own in a drunken gaze. I couldn’t do anything but stare back at her. I didn’t care about my shirt, about the wasted seven bucks on the drink, about whether I was really so trashed that I was actually just imagining this. All I could do was stare.

“You okay?” She giggled. I felt her fingers brush against my shoulder again, an electric current I thought I would only ever feel again in my dreams. 

I struggled to nod at her, slowly grasping the reality of the situation. She hopped into the stool beside me and set her beer down on the bar. “Sorry if I scared you.” She said, still clearly amused by my behavior. 

“What are you doing here?” Was all I could ask. 

She shrugged. “I've been really sick lately. I finally started feeling a little better so I decided to take a short trip to my parents' and go out to see some old friends. God, I’m so glad you’re here.” Her entire face was lit up like a child’s on Christmas morning. She was more beautiful than I’d ever remembered. “Let me buy you another drink.”

The night flowed on like a daydream. Once I got past my state of shock, we talked as though it had only been a week since we’d last seen one another. We shared our college experiences and reminisced on the memories we had shared that one particular summer. There wasn't an atom within me that detested her for how much she'd hurt me. I stopped drinking after the replacement she bought; I needed this to be as real as possible. I needed to remember it forever. There was just something about the cinematic nature of the moment and the way the bar lights shadowed her face that made me fear she would disappear at any second and I would be left with nothing but a T-shirt stain and a hangover. 

At one point, we got onto the topic of relationships. I lied and told her I was enjoying the single life; she grew quiet and avoided the questions I prodded her with. It was obvious that she was at the bar alone. No Facebook douche to be found. I mentioned him, and she immediately changed the subject by leaning in close, squeezing my knee, and asking me to take her home. My stomach rolled. I obliged and we left the bar. I didn’t bother letting my friends know; I had completely forgotten that they were even there. 

She told me she was staying in a hotel just outside of town because her parents had turned the spare room into a gym and the couch was overrun by cats. I smiled, remembering how much she hated being at home when we were kids because she was constantly sneezing, and how she would come over with a layer of cat fur stuck to her sweatshirt. She directed me to the main highway that cuts through the town and pointed me in the direction of a more deserted part of the county, close to the area where we would go hiking as kids. I was slightly suspicious, but still too buzzed and elated to question it elaborately. I probably would’ve driven her to Canada that night if she had asked. 

Between giving me directions, she curled her fingers into mine and nibbled at my collarbone, whispering the sweetest words into my ear. I was so buzzed and aroused that I could hardly see straight. To this day I still cannot believe we didn’t end up flipped upside-down in a ditch somewhere. 

It felt like hours before she finally told me to pull over. I frowned. We were still in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but dense forest and moonlight. No hotels. Not even a gas station. 
“It’s a little bed and breakfast off the road,” she told me with a drunk grin. “I promise.” She hopped out of the passenger seat, nearly busting her ass, laughing and pressing her legs together to keep herself from urinating. I felt like I was back in my dad’s pickup on the night we first met. I felt a lump form in my throat. “Follow me,” she said.

I did.

A trail had been embedded into the dirt by previous vehicles, leading off of the highway into the woods. I parked on the shoulder and allowed Lily to take the lead. She held my hand and hummed as we walked, an eerily cheerful gesture for someone hiking into a grove of pitch black trees in the middle of the night. After a few minutes my erection had completely gone down and my heart was no longer beating out of excitement, but out of fear. What kind of bed and breakfast was this? Was I maybe just dreaming after all? 

We finally reached a break in the trees. The ground around us was mostly dirt, and several thick branches were poking out of it in perfect rows like a makeshift garden lacking fruit. I tried desperately to convince myself that I was just overreacting when I realized the sticks looked disturbingly similar to bones. Lily was silent. She had stopped dead in her tracks, and her eyes grew wide as tears gathered within them. Her hand shook within mine. There still weren’t any signs of civilizations aside from the beat-up station wagon parked at the opposite end of the clearing, but her eyes darted around like she was expecting someone to come crashing out of the trees towards us.  

It was in this moment that I realized that there was never a hotel. Just the seemingly abandoned vehicle, trees, darkness, and an overwhelming scent of rot.

“Lily,” I whispered, “what the fuck is going on?”

She looked me dead in the eye and said, “I’m sorry. I just didn’t know anyone else who would have been willing to--“

She was interrupted by a piercing shriek that echoed from near the station wagon. It sounded human, female, and choked. It was a person in pain. I tore my hand away from Lily and took off in the direction of the sound, my heart pounding in my ears, my head whirling with the terrible combination of alcohol and panic. 

What I found still haunts me to this day.

A woman was chained to a tree on the other side of the vehicle, naked, malnourished, and alone. She was straining against her bonds, probably alerted by our presence, her bloodshot eyes wide and piercingly contrasted against the dark of the night. It took me a second or two to realize that her legs and arms had been sawed off at the joints, leaving her with nothing but bloodied stumps. A thick cloth was tied around her head, gagging her so tightly that her lips had begun to split at the edges. As soon as she saw me she made a desperate attempt to scramble back toward the tree, whimpering and gargling like a rabid animal. 

“You have to help them.”

I spun around to find Lily on the ground. Her clothes were tattered and hanging from her bones like curtains. Her skin was so pale it was almost blue. Like the other woman, her appendages had been brutally removed and the stumps were ridden with maggots and flies as though they had been left in the heat to rot for weeks. She had almost no hair left on her head and her face was so thin that she resembled a living skeleton. She was gazing up at me with tears streaming down her decaying cheeks. “Call the police before he comes back,” she sobbed. “*Please.*”

I fell to my knees and reached for her, but she vanished before my eyes. I vomited into the dirt where she had been crouching while I screamed her name. My phone started to vibrate repeatedly. I later learned that my friends had been frantically attempting to get in touch with me after seeing me leave the bar alone, so drunk that I was talking to myself. 

The last thing I remember is dialing 911, begging them to find me because someone had drugged my drink and I was convinced that I was losing my mind. The woman chained to the tree sobbed profusely as I collapsed, and everything went black. 


The cops showed up within twenty of my phone call and found me sprawled out top of my own bile, phone in hand. I was catatonic as they walked me back to my car. Apparently, the only sign of consciousness I provided them was my repetitive mumbling of Lily’s name. Later, I tried convincing them that she had been with me when I stumbled upon the scene, that they had to find her because she was in trouble, but they assured me that the only other person in the clearing had been twenty-three-year-old Clara Wilson, the mutilated woman in restraints. I was questioned harshly, as it was fairly possible that I was the suspect for whatever the fuck was going on in those woods. Fortunately, they caught the guy two days later when he came back to his campsite in a registered Uber vehicle with two women tied up, gagged, and drugged in the back seat. 

Investigators also found that the “garden” I had noticed when first reaching the clearing was actually an arrangement of human remains. What I had convinced myself were tree branches were the arm and leg bones of several women which had been buried over the course of four years. One set belonged to Lily Harrison, and her time of death was dated to approximately three months ago. No one even thought she was missing; the last thing her friends and family heard was that she was leaving to intern overseas for the summer and that her cell phone wouldn’t be a reliable source of communication, so she had been updating everyone through social media. Since her departure, her accounts had been accessed by David Ferris, her boyfriend of nearly four years—the guy from the Facebook photos I mentioned earlier. He was still an undergrad student working part-time for Uber who had taken on the charming hobby of kidnapping young women and callously torturing them at his campsite until they no longer had the strength to live. He had turned the station wagon into a makeshift tent; the inside was cushioned with blankets and towels, ridden with enough DNA samples to account for twelve missing women. His most recent victims, the girls found in his Uber car on the night he was caught, were only eighteen years old. 

He was sentenced to death. A proper funeral was held for the identified women, including Lily. When it was over, I sat in my car for five hours and sobbed uncontrollably, clinging to the shirt I had worn on the night she found me in the bar. As I held it, I noticed the corner of a photo peeking out from the front pocket. Knowing that I never carry printed photos with me anywhere, ever, I pulled it out.

My heart stopped as my brain registered what I was seeing. It was me and Lily, our lips pressed together as we tried hard not to smile. Behind us was the lake we had spent a majority of that summer in, the sun casting shadows and glimmers of light across the sparkling water. We looked so happy, so head over heels for each other, but it didn't make sense, because we had never kissed. This picture had never happened. It was fake. I cried out in pain and fury, a pathetic sound that no grown man should ever make but I didn't care. I was livid. Who the fuck would think something like this was funny? 

I tossed the photo into the passenger seat and pounded my fists against the steering wheel, screaming and screaming and screaming as if the hurt would go away. As if it would bring her back to me. I could hear her laughter, smell her perfume, I could see her crawling in the dirt on blood-caked stumps as David Ferris lingered behind her brandishing some awful weapon capable of mangling such perfect skin. I couldn't breathe. I glanced at the photo again, determined that I had imagined it. It was still here, but it had flipped over onto the back, and there was writing on the white cardstock. I picked it up, preparing to tear it into dozens of pieces, ready to wring the neck of whoever had put it in my pocket. 

But there, scrawled in an all too familiar bubbly handwriting, read:

In another place, it happened like this. You'll see it one day. It's incredible here. 
-Lily 

As the tears filling my eyes blurred the words, I swear I heard her laughing somewhere outside of the car. "

I'm a junior and I've already taken all the core CS classes except Algorithms , which I am currently taking now. In my DS class (which I did very well in) we learned sorting, runtime complexities, and other algorithm basics, but this Algorithms class is a junior/senior level class that is way more advanced. So I put in the comments box that I am currently taking Algorithms and that I will have finished it by the end of this semester. 

I sent the form in 2 days ago and still haven't heard back from them. Did I mess up by mentioning that I am currently taking algo and haven't already finished taking it? I mean my resume clearly lists all classes I've taken and Algo is not on it. I've also passed 3 coding exams and passed all test cases so I think I'm a competent coder (and hopefully they do too) even though I didn't take the advanced algorithms course. I'm worried that they don't want to interview me because I haven't completed algo yet. Just needed a sanity check, thank you!"

Background: I have a B.S. in CIS, I started my ""career"" as an intern with a Windows Server team and after a year I transitioned into a full-time position that I have been in for 3.5 years. I remember feeling very overwhelmed as an intern, like I was a giant idiot and all that I thought I knew about computers was laughable. (To be fair we have had some other interns that were worse, so I know I'm not a complete moron, but my first exposure to the actual world of IT outside of my own personal devices and ""desktop support"" for my parents was definitely eye-opening and completely overwhelming.) But that is why I got an internship, to figure out what I may want to do career wise, learn, etc. 

Fast forward to now. I have learned a lot but still feel like a glorified intern. I'm not sure if that is normal for the low man on the totem pole. I still sit in meetings where I have no idea wtf some things are or how they work. My lack of understanding of some technical knowledge is my biggest weakness/insecurity. I am sure that because of this, I am just kind of ""there"" from a director's standpoint, I get offered fewer projects, asked fewer questions, etc. Which is understandable - IT can be fragile so you don't want to depend on the guy that could possibly screw it up. But it's kind of a vicious cycle - because I lack I'm not given opportunities to grow, and because of that, I continue to lack. Also, if it matters - I am the youngest person on my team but there are others my age under my umbrella that I feel are a lot smarter than me (IT wise), maybe they are just freaks of nature? :(

Which brings me to my dilemma, I am not sure if this is just the wrong field for me so I am not applying myself and not working to my fullest potential so I would fare better somewhere else? Did I start out too high and now I am trying to catch up? Or do I just need to apply myself a little better, research areas I am not comfortable in outside of work, ask more questions. (I know I struggle with that because I HATE feeling like the village idiot all of the time, or that I should know X, Y, or Z otherwise what am I doing as a Systems Engineer.)

Just some thoughts I have been having lately, I'm not sure if this is typical for some and if I just need to stick it out and continue to grow, or if I am just in the wrong position. Any advice is appreciated.  "

If it's close to the max budget I expect more in terms of build quality, etc.



Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money?  Don't care about a 2 in 1, touch screen would actually be a minus because it would drain battery life.  Good battery life is a big consideration.



How important is weight to you? 
 Almost not at all, will be at a desk 90% of the time, and if not I'm not a small guy either.  I'd actually prefer it to be slightly bulkier if it means it will be a better build quality. 



Which OS do you require?  
Preferably Windows, just because I am more familiar with it and it's easier to load and use things like AutoCAD, Revvit, Solidworks, MATLAB, etc.



Do you have a preferred screen size? Ideally thinking 15.6"", 14"" inches can work as well but larger than 13.3"".



Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? 

Light CAD, mainly I'd like to be able to do 2D via AutoCAD and Revit.  Be able to model, view and edit at least single parts in Solidworks, not necessarily full assemblies because I have a PC if I need to do that.  Would be nice if I could do simple FEA on one component or simple CFD.

No video editing.

Light gaming if possible.  Gamecube, Wii, GBA emulators.  Maybe something like Civ, and older titles on medium or so settings, e.g 3-4+ year old titles like Fallout 3, Assassins Creed 1 and 2.  Not huge into gaming. 



If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? 

Like I said older titles; Civ 5, Fallout 3.  Not really into playing new AAA titles.



Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

Ideally has an SSD around 256 GB, I hate waiting for old spinnig HDDs to boot.  Good keyboard and trackpad, although it's hard to define good, backlit would be a plus but not necessary.  I carry a mouse right now but not having to keep one on me would be a plus.

Really want it to have good build quality, this is going to be used daily for atleast 3 - 4 years so I don't want the hinge to break or the screws holding the bottom plate to fall out.

Good battery life as well, my old laptop would only last 2 &amp; 1/2 hours near the end.  If I am doing more demanding tasks like CAD or gaming I'll accept I'll probably need to keep a charger nearby.



Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

Going to use this for school for the next year and a half, maybe at my internship inbetween,  and possibly more school after undergrad.  Will be my daily driver since I can't really carry my PC with me everywhere.  Things I've considered so far;

[Dell Inspiron 7000](http://www.dell.com/ca/p/inspiron-15-7567-laptop/pd?ref=PD_OC) Looks good to me, I just don't know about the build quality and battery life.  Watched the Linus Tech Tips video about the old one but nothing about the new one.

[Lenovo Ideapad 700](http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=1198&amp;item_id=099842) I've heard good things about the Thinkpads but they're out of my price range.  I don't know how well this will stack up in terms of battery, build quality and GPU (only has a 950M).

5spcuy,20,2017-02-07,"2 years ago, I went 0 for 40 on job applications. Today, I love my job, am on pace for 6 figures, and can land any interview I want. I wanted to share with you how.",ly93,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/5spcuy/2_years_ago_i_went_0_for_40_on_job_applications/,"Hey Reddit! A little background on me, I'm a 23 yr old working at a tech company in Toronto, on pace to make somewhere between high 5 to low 6 figures a year.

The reason I'm posting is that a lot of you are confused about how to make yourselves attractive on the job market to land the interviews and jobs you want.

I was in that EXACT same situation not long ago, so I'm hoping my story can help.

To set the stage, I came out of university a pretty average student. In my 3rd year, I applied to 40 internships and didn't get any interviews. I ended up working door to door selling alarm systems that year.

After graduating, I knew I couldn't keep doing door to door. I wanted a real job that paid well and could provide real growth opportunity. 

Thing was, my resume wasn't amazing. My parents didn't have influential friends. And I 100% did NOT want to bang my face against the wall getting rejected over and over again by a faceless recruiter on internet job boards.


**So here's the first thing I did.**

Before anything else, I decided on WHAT I wanted to be. I wanted to work at a tech startup in Toronto, in business development. I had taken business in school, liked it, and startups were fascinating.

Getting laser focused on what I wanted to pursue was key. Without a crystal clear goal, my mind was all over the place. 

Marketing, advertising, going back to school to learn how to code, being a real estate agent, all these things were a possibility, and therefore a distraction. I spent months applying to nowhere because I didn't know where to apply.

I zeroed in, and that was the start. I urge you to focus first on what you WANT to do, before worrying about how to get there.

**My second step was to reach out to people who were already doing what I wanted to do**

Here's what I figured. I want to work in bizdev, at a startup, but I don't know how. The easiest thing to do is to literally just ask someone who already is in that role, “how did you get this role?”

So I went on LinkedIn, found 20 companies that I thought were interesting, and found 1 relevant person from each of those companies.

Then, using tools like Rapportive and Hunter, I found their emails. 

One by one, I sent them emails. I explained to them who I was. I told them I loved their company's work, and that I was really interested in the space. I asked them if I could buy them coffee and ask them how they got to where they were in their careers, or if they had any advice for a recent grad like me.


**And to my surprise, over half said yes!** 

With just over 10 meetings set up with professionals around the city, I was pretty amped. 

First order of business here was to make sure I was prepared. Before every meeting, I spent at least half an hour researching the individual on LinkedIn and Twitter, looking through their work history, skills, hobbies etc.

I also familiarized myself with the companies, what they did, their goals, competitors etc.

By the time I got to the meeting, I was so prepared that the conversation usually went smoothly. The occasional hiccup here and there, but prepping for these conversations really added to my confidence.


**The key here was that I didn't treat these meetings like interviews.**

In truth, they weren't. There was no job on the line here. I genuinely wanted to understand what the role entailed (because who knows, maybe I wouldn't even enjoy it).

I also wanted to learn how THEY got to where they were in their career. I wanted to understand what I needed to do to emulate their success. And I also shared my own goals, to see if they had advice.

By the end of the conversation, not only did I know exactly the requirements of the job and the personality of the company, I also learned about how I could personally improve going forward.

And unbeknownst to me, I also created a relationship with someone who had INFLUENCE. Because I had a good conversation with them, they were now invested in me as a person.


**Then I did something I never accomplished applying online. I consistently started to land interviews.**

I had roughly 10 coffee meetups over the span of a few weeks. A few of them turned out to be duds because the conversation was stale. Some of them I learned were just poor fits for my personality after asking enough questions.

But, the 6 or 7 that went well, I just asked the question.

“I really like this role, and I've enjoyed chatting with you. Any way you could forward my resume to your manager and see if they could set up a time to chat with me?”

And shockingly, the answer was *yes, every time*. 

These were companies that I would have had a tough time hearing back from if I applied online. Now I had more interviews than I could handle.

**It doesn't stop there...**

This process landed me interviews at some of the top tech companies in Toronto. Reaching out to these professionals already paid out in spades. 

But it kept paying off, because once I connected with them, *we stayed connected*. If I was nervous about the upcoming interview and wanted to ask for help, I shot them a text asking for advice.

If I was confused about their company in my prep, I could email them and ask for clarification. Because I had an actual relationship, they wanted to support me in my quest to land the job.

**And that's how I got several job offers in just a few weeks.**

Networking worked for me. Although intimidating (and frankly, kinda weird) at first, I got a job out of it.

Flash forward to today, I'm 23, but I'm already making high five figures. I work relaxed hours in an enjoyable environment. There's potential for growth in not just compensation, but career progression. I'm happy.

And the reason why was because I met awesome people who got me access to the right opportunities. Meeting them gave me the flexibility and abundance to choose the job I liked best out of several options.

Thinking back, there's no comparison. Sucking it up and trying something uncomfortable was infinitely better than handing in a million resumes online, chewing my nails, and waiting with my fingers crossed.

[I have a personal blog] (http://www.themodernmillennial.net/) where I go deeper into the tactics I used to network, including [email scripts](http://www.themodernmillennial.net/perfect-networking-emails/), [what to talk about while in your meetings](http://www.themodernmillennial.net/three-laws-conversation/), etc. If this was helpful, check it out! I would 100% appreciate it :)

How can I prepare starting right now, and in the summer to catch up? Do I have any chance/hope of landing an internship in the summer?

Nearly all of them took the unusual step of requiring interns (even paid interns) to be degree-seeking students. I was hoping this was just individual preferences, but I've heard rumors that only degree-seeking students are legally allowed to have internship. That would make sense of the pattern I'm finding but would really set me back.

I've tried researching this independently but am having trouble learning much, at least as it pertains to paid internships. I know that having student status makes it much safer for non-profits to hire unpaid interns, but I'm looking for paid internships. Could you shed some light on this or point me to someone who can? I have some big life choices to make if internships here are out of the question for me. 

Thanks so much for any information you can provide."

Background: I'm a recent geology grad with a BS and MS focused in petroleum geology. I currently work for a data analytics company that provides geologic and other petroleum industry related data to operators (Exxon, Chevron, etc.) and service companies (Haliburton, SLB, etc.). On a day-to-day basis I work with a massive amount of data that include anything from monthly production data for an entire country to reservoir properties for  oil/gas fields. I mainly work in Excel, ArcGIS, and other industry related geoscience/engineering software packages. 

As a former intern for the company I focused on creating workflows for other geologists to become more efficient when collecting, formatting, and analyzing the data we receive for entry into our database and analysis. I also analyzed production data from an emerging basin. Now I'm looking to find ways to integrate more advanced statistics, machine learning, and other methods. Before I proceed in doing so, I feel a more formal education process may be more useful in learning the tools that data scientists use.

I'm starting to look into two options. 1) an MS in Data Analytics, 2) a Certificate in Data Analytics. Does the certificate hold any value for data scientists or is a degree a must?

Any other advice not related to the two options stated above would be greatly appreciated as well."

I would love to hear any advice of anyone that has some experience on moving into Canadian territory.
-----
Mexican with passport.
23 year old, Male.

Language Skills: Spanish- Native speaker, English- Advanced,  French - Beginner 

Background:

I recently earned my Computer system Engineering bachelor Degree (very similar to Computer Science's)  with a GPA of 3.5.
I have 1 year of experience (5 months of freelance, I don't know how does that hold up in Express entry, Skilled worker category), I am currently working at a multinational company as a Java/Angular.JS developer. I would say my programming skill-set is solid, mostly using Java, JavaScript and PHP in web applications.

As far as language proficiency goes, I got and overall band score of 7.5  in the IELTS test and I am currently taking French language classes.
Since 2010 onwards, I've been feeling uncomfortable about  Mexico's situation (regarding security and other aspects) and I always wanted to work/study in another country since I was a child.
There are many other little aspects that also influence my desire to get out of this country.

Why Canada over other countries? 

I picked Canada due to its multicultural nature, the cold weather(Even if it gets too cold) how its citizens seem to be really polite, and many other things that I read about the country's most notables cities .

So far, I know of three ways to immigrate to Canada available to someone with my background.

Getting sponsorship for a work permit via Job offer, Studying or through Express entry/Skilled worker/Quebec Skilled worker programs. 
I have been applying for entry-level developer jobs/internships for 4 months with no avail (got 4 interviews so far, 2 of them I got rejected due to lack of a work permit). I am aware that work experience is quite valuable for a foreign worker trying to get a job at Canada.

I am also thinking in applying for a  CS master's degree programs at some Universities (Concordia, Memorial, Bishop, Manitoba) but only if I obtain an scholarship since my current savings won't let me stay for more than 6 months paying tuition fees and living expenses. 

My questions regarding immigration to Canada are:


1)Do you know why the Canadian government has suspended the IEC program for Mexicans for the last 2 years?
I am constantly checking CIC to check if the program is still under revision.

2)is it worth to take a short-term course for a post graduate diploma related to my career to get a chance at getting a work permit/ enroll in an internship?
This might help me in the Express entry pool and the Quebec skilled worker program scores.
3)Any suggestions on where to find an scholarship to help me cover some of my expenses while studying a Master's degree course?. There is one scholarship being offered in my country (by conacyt) to study abroad but it requires the student to return to the country upon completion.
 I've read a bit about the ones offered by the province of Quebec but I don't know if they are too hard to get.

4)Does freelance work experience counts toward the score in any of these programs? (I got references for it).

5)Should I try to improve my score on the Quebec Skilled worker program before applying or should I apply with my current score of 51?

6)Which of these options do you think is the best one?

Sorry for the long post.
Thank you!

[update] I thank everyone of you for your input, it really helped me on what I should look for. Currently Im looking for jobs on website like indeed.com, USAJOBS and school's career site. Most of the job postings have ambiguous titles like ""Software engineer, software engineer intern, front/back end, Information technology/IT intern"". Sadly, just the internship positions tend to require 1+ year of experience, lol. I live in south cali and it is a competitive region. I'm definitely down to relocation like some of you suggested. I dont have ambitious goal, I think if i can make 40~50k out of college, 70~80k in 3~5 years and 6 figures in 10 years from now and I would be happy with my life. I'm willing to start from the ground up and climb my way up, challenge the big N companies one day when I have enough experience."

I've been asked by the high ups (who have no idea exactly how tough it is to do) to build a webscraper that can take company: names, numbers, websites and other info and fill in market segment. This needs to be done for 6000 companies, which i have figured would take me 8 weeks of constant updating... Or I could try and make it a lot easier on myself. 

So what am going to do? Look at building an intelligent webscraper.

**Steps(libraries):**

* Locate a website for each company in our crm. (Scrapy, mechanize, beautifulsoup)
* train a neural network using the 7000 companies that do have segments.(Tensorflow)
* Implement on the remaining 6000 companies 

To me this seems like an interesting and tough project, am i missing anything? Are the libraries similar to ones that I should be using? Any ideas on something that might work better?"

I've been enjoying it so far, gaining valuable experience and building a portfolio for myself.  I met the owner of the company for the first time yesterday and I was handed a contract, which I haven't signed yet, which included a confidentiality and non-compete agreement.  A few things make me weary of signing and sending the contract back:

1. The wording is very vague.  I love web &amp; graphic design, so much so that I have aspirations of starting my own business selling websites and apps to local businesses, eventually.  The first paragraph says that I am unable to directly or in-directly compete, period.  There's no specification of how long this lasts.  **Does that mean that I'm unable to start my own local Web Design firm in the future?**

2. I can't decipher the second paragraph,  it has to do with me stealing clients that they may already be working with.   This is in Mississippi, the local market for technology and web solutions is not very big.  So 2 more questions, **Is this only for clients that they work with?  Does this clause only last while I am with them?**

The rest of it is pretty clear to me.  I would ask him for more clarification but the contract is already drawn up and when it comes to law, it's all about what's on paper right?  I also don't want to discourage him from giving me future opportunities just because I have plans to branch out eventually. Could someone look over this for me?
Here's a link: http://imgur.com/a/Xhwrt

I have taken the spreadsheets course, and I knew just about everything we covered, but the professor kept insisting that ""once you are done with this class, you'll be a master of the universe of Excel"" and that's simply not true (we did almost no nesting of formulas, didn't touch SUMPRODUCT, INDIRECT, nothing about array formulas, etc) and now I am afraid everyone in the business school who has taken this class is going to describe themselves as a master of Excel on their resume, meanwhile I simply say ""proficient"" because unlike most of the other students, I understand how vast Excel is and how much there is that I don't know. I use array formulas, a shit ton of nesting formulas, multi-criteria VLOOKUP, I know how to use SUMPRODUCT in a bunch of crazy ways, I can do some very basic VBA / record and modify macros, etc (My dad is an accountant who loves Excel and taught me a bunch of this sort of stuff from an early age, enabling me to get a college job where I get to use and refine my knowledge of Excel.)

I've been at my current company for around 2 years, and prior to that I did an internship and co-op at another company that has recently made me another offer for full-time employment.


When they called saying that they wanted me for a specific role (no official offer), they asked what I got paid currently. I gave them a ballpark figure (rounding to the nearest $10,000) of $80,000. I received an offer today for exactly $80,000 (which is relatively fair for Madison, WI, about the median or a bit lower). I'd like to negotiate for a bit more, maybe up to $90,000. Does my previous employment there help me at all here? I'd probably be willing to accept as is, but given that this is their initial offer and I have a history with them along with the fact that I'm no longer entry-level and have a Master's degree, I feel like there should be some grounds for negotiation. What's the best way to proceed?

Up to $500-550, USA

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Specs and battery life. I would prefer for it to NOT be a 2-in-1 or have a touchscreen at all.

* **How important is weight to you?**
Slightly important. I'll be lugging the laptop around all day, but I'm used to a heavy backpack.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
I would prefer Windows, but Linux is fine too.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Anything up from 14"" is fine, so long as it goes up to 1920x1080 pixels.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
CAD. Photo editing with Adobe Lightroom. No video editing. Light to medium gaming.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
Mostly I'd like to be able to play a few Gamecube and Wii games using the Dolphin emulator. I have a pretty big backlog of less demanding PC games like This War Of Mine, Transistor and Shadowrun Returns, but I think Dolphin will be much more CPU-intensive than any of them.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I'd prefer a quality keyboard and a strong enough build to last me a few years without any problems. I have no need for a touchscreen, optical drive or fingerprint reader. I prefer to use a mouse, so the touchpad also isn't a priority.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I'm moving to the USA next week to spend 4 months on an internship in Chicago, after which I'll most probably return home to start college (again), so I need something for both work and study (and some light gaming/Netflix on the side). I think any ~$400 machine will handle web browsing, Office and programming more than well enough, so that leaves Dolphin, AutoCAD or something similar (for college) and Lightroom as the biggest loads for the machine to carry. Also, I have plenty of external storage available, so all else being equal, I'd prefer a smaller SSD over a larger but slower HDD."

At first glance, you might say ""Yes, you should. Not many people make it without college.""

However, I have a few notches in my belt:

First, I'm currently working in a ""unpaid"" (under the table) internship. I work for a small business security camera company, where I am the only person working on a project that, to my knowledge, will be the only currently updated of its type. I'm making a web interface that will control a drone. I'm using Express to make this server, as I've used it in the past. I'm about 75% until I've a completed project. 

Second, I had a great programming teacher. He was really a top of the line teacher, and I was one of his first students, so he may be inclined to help me find a job (I don't know yet). He taught me how to debug and troubleshoot properly, and also the importance of GitHub. Every project I created under him was put in github. Also, I learned a lot about Linux Server Administration. I have a strong understanding of server administration, and I believe I could successfully work as a server admin of a SMALL company. 

Third, I have a decently accomplished github. There's a few projects on there that are written in Java, but the majority are some combination of HTML, JS, and CSS. I did write a Go webserver or two, but those were VERY small and insignificant. Here's my GitHub, you can decide if it's good enough: https://github.com/tylrcarr

Lastly, I believe I have a few personality traits that set me apart from others. I have a lot of confidence in my interview skills, and I think I could really impress someone. Also, not that this is a good trait, I can't stand learning in school. I don't want to go to college to learn, mostly party and have fun. I know that sounds stupid, but I do think I won't really benefit career-wise from college anymore, as I've learned my fundamentals of programming and more. I have a very strong drive to leave the house ASAP, and if I could somehow just go into the real world without having to spend tons of money, I would much appreciate that. 

Well, tell me what you think. Should I go to college? Should I not? Should I test to see if I can get a job first? Let me know, thank y'all so much.

36/36 on her ACT her Sophomore year in HS. Got a 1590/1600 SAT. Got 5's on 10 separate AP tests. Graduated high school with a 4.7/4.0 GPA. Was accepted to Harvard and MIT but turned down both because of cost reasons. She runs a non-profit that tutors (50) people for free and has raised $15,000 for her students. Has prior internship experience in healthcare with the state. She's also a minority female majoring in computer science, which I know ""shouldn't"" mean anything but it really does when you are a female majoring in a STEM field. This list goes on and on. 

She's interested in Analytics and Healthcare and my mom told her that I manage a analytics team with a fortune 100 Healthcare company and that I could help her. So naturally I made some calls, told them how ""excellent"" of a candidate she was, even though I have never even met this girl. Long story short, she will now be joining our 2017 internship program. 

It is literally baffling to me that someone with that background cant even get a call back for a internship.

Are there any other companies that do this? Although I'm fortunate that I didn't have to do a phone interview (since obviously online challenges are much less stressful), the concept still feels pretty weird, and everyone who I discuss it with agrees. 

Edit: I guess the important question is what's used as a metric to determine who gets to skip the phone interview. There are definitely plenty of people who solve the problems entirely correctly, probably more than the total number of accepted applicants overall. "

I have a question about work load with school plus working. 

So the company I currently work for is being super flexible and cool with me going back to school. Im currently catching up on Math at a CC online so my work isn't affected. I'm taking Chem and Calc (Calc online) in the summer (yeah, gonna suck) and after that, I'm taking 9-10 credits per semester while working at least 30 hours/week. My job is super easy meaning I have the ability to work on homework while I'm at work, but in order to keep medical benefits for myself and my daughter, I have to work at least 30 hours per week. 

Am I overestimating this? Is it doable working and taking 9-10 credit hours? I'll be taking Data Structures next summer so I'll likely work internships after that working less hours for more money. Does anyone have experience working while going to school for CS? My work is M-F meaning I'd have weekends free, so hopefully that would keep my sanity in check. 

Thanks in advance! I enjoy reading this sub quite a bit. "

I've got my resume cleaned up pretty well thanks to advice from folks here and in-person. I'm going to career fairs, networking, etc., but I'm not finding many entry-level dev jobs. At this point, I don't care what kind of work I'm doing, so long as it's software development/engineering and it's in the Seattle area. I'm applying to every job I can find on Indeed.com. Where else should I be looking?

Also, how should I go about selling myself? I'm a career changer, but I've given up on talking about my previous degree and careers because employers don't seem to care. I had a decent GPA (3.6), and I published a research paper, but I didn't get much exposure to modern software development. I've used Git/Maven quite a bit, and I'm learning Spring Boot, JavaScript, and jQuery now in hopes of landing a job as a web dev, because frankly I'm not sure what else to do."

i studied information technology engineering in MX but i didn't graduated, i studied for almost all the major in the ""best"" private university in the country. 

I didn't actually had lots of coding related classes so i had to learn on my own, after a few years while i was studying i got better and better at it, i learned a lot of good stuff and after around 2000-3000 hours doing internships in different big companies on my city (doing software related stuff) i decided to go big and get a job in europe, i did, i got a job on a nice startup where i shaped all my skills and after a year i decided that europe was not for me.. i looked at other jobs everywhere before my visa expired and got actually nice offers but the best one i got was from MX in a nice nice city so i accepted... 

i gotta mention something: from all the tests and interviews i had to take and do, the weirdest one was the one from MX, they asked me to do something really unique which was something like doing a spec about a new feature but not exactly coding it.

when they offered me the job they mentioned that they were going to pay the relocation (which they didn't), they said they were going to help me to find a place to live and all bunch of stuff( and they didn't), they lent me some money to rent a place (because i spent most of my saved money coming back to MX) but i had to pay back from my paycheck all that money, every month.

when i started working i noticed that they had a completely different way of working, way way way different than they way i used to work before which is nice and i wanted to learn, the salary is nice and there are lots of smart and intelligent people here. so far around 6-7 months have passed and since the first month, i keep regretting coming here. 

The owner of the company frequently changes his mind on things, sometimes he asks to see my progress and then he complains it has lots of bugs, i had to change lots of things from the UI i'm doing many many times and frequently i was being told that it was my fault and my fault...

Why does the same bugs keep coming back?
Why are you working on that?
why haven't you updated the dashboard?
why haven't you tested this? 

etc...

basically i'm doing the complete front end for a new feature, the codebase on which i started working is completely a mess, its written completely in pure javascript which is not a problem at all but there is code everywhere and moving one thing breaks everything...

at some point i was told that my boss was very happy with the UI i'm doing but most of the time it doesn't look like this, i know he is not happy with my work but sometimes he is very happy and he cheers my up.

i think my manager likes me he is a super smart senior developer and i learn lots of stuff from him. he gives me advices, helps me figuring out stuff, helps me taking better decisions, etc...

but i feel completely burned out, i haven't being able to save any money even thought i earn a really nice salary, i'm in the office most of the day, i have to submit a note of what i'm doing that day and what i did yesterday, i feel observed all the time.

i'm really not happy here even thought i learned more here in 6 months than all my life. i don't have time to do anything, i keep smoking weed to calm down after every day because i come back to my place super stressed and i don't know what to do. My boss have fired many times since i arrived and i'm worried i'm the next one, i haven't looked at any new jobs to switch.

right now i feel that my boss thinks he is paying to much for my job and that he is not happy but at least he is happier with me than with the other devs in some way. 

i haven't got used to this way of working in 6-7 months and i think i'll break down at any point now

what should i do? 

pd: please excuse my english grammar, it is not my first language and i don't speak or write english that often to practice it.

Yes there are kids who start looking for internships their freshman year and work part-time internships while they attend school, and thus reach that 3-5 years of experience before they graduate but I can't imagine most kids being able to get 3-5 years of experience before they graduate.

Are these requirements bullshit to reduce applications or is the job market really this bad for engineers?

5t3vn1,0,2017-02-09,Is toxic prior employer legally allowed to badmouth me if a potential employer calls to check if I worked there?,practicumplz,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5t3vn1/is_toxic_prior_employer_legally_allowed_to/,"I am a graduate student in psychology, specializing in counseling. In order to graduate from my program, I need to fulfill a final practicum (mandatory internship) requirement. These practicums where I am often lead to jobs after graduation, so this could make my career. I need to know an answer for this in the immediate future because spots at different agencies are very competitive and I need to start applying before the deadline. We do not get assistance in our placement process at my school so figuring this out is crucial. I can't ask people that are already references because I don't want to look bad, so I'm asking all of you instead.

It's prestigious to get a direct counseling practicum where I am, and they generally require counseling experience beforehand. The only direct counseling experience which I've had was at this job I had from September until December. The only thing is, I quit the agency because it was toxic and was difficult to manage with school. The director of the agency shamed me when I quit, despite that I was on good terms before I quit and never had an infraction, warning or anything.

When I quit, I started off saying I love this job, but it's really hard to balance with school. Immediately my boss said directly, ""You're quitting."" And I said I feel like I have to and she immediately said, “Don’t bother ever asking for a reference from us because we think it's unprofessional to quit after spending so little time at a place.” My boss then switched me from salaried to hourly during the holidays season, so my final (monthly) paycheck was about half of what it should've been (when she knew well enough that clients cancel the most during the holidays or skip appointments to be with their families - it was an in home work agency). She played dirty like that.

A month later, when I texted my (very flighty) acquaintance who got me the job asking if she'd be a reference, she told me that the director of this agency forbids anyone from being a reference other than the boss. I do think this is likely a lie, and that perhaps she didn't want to get involved because her loyalty lies with the job, but regardless, I have no one at that agency to be a reference. I worked very independently as it was in home work so I don't have any other colleagues that I really saw other than this acquaintance and my former boss.

So here's my dilemma - by putting this agency on a resume am I giving a potential employer authorization to contact them and if so what can I do? Should I just not put the job on my resume? It was extremely valuable experience for my line of work, just the company culture was toxic. I have no other direct counseling experience. I'd like to be a competitive applicant for practicums, but I'm not sure if I can be without this on my resume.
It should be noted that I do have references (one from my advisor, one from my previous practicum boss, and one from a lady I TAed for in college). It's just that if a place asks for a reference from this job, they'd either call my former boss who shamed me or would have no one. I don't think that would look good for me but I'm not sure if my boss could legally badmouth me (I wasn't fired after all). Ultimately, my chances are much slimmer of getting a practicum  I'd like unless I have counseling experience on my resume so I don't know how much I can risk."

The new project I've been assigned is in frontend web development and I absolutely HATE it. I have some experience on my resume with web development (from more than a year ago) but that has been largely backend; more importantly, I stopped doing it because I really started disliking it.

I interviewed for a start up in San Francisco and at the time I did not know it was an unpaid internship. I did not discuss about the pay because I thought that it something people do at the end of the interview. I did the interview, coding challenge and on-site interview. The staffs were very pleased with my result and called me today and said I got the internship position. I thought there will be a chance to come in to their office or get a phone call to discuss my hourly wage. That never happened. Instead I got an offer letter right away and when I read it, I found out it was actually an unpaid internship. 

Although I am a self-taught developer, I had an internship before and it was paid. I asked if I will get a actual full-time paid position after my internship and the staff said they will have to see how well I do on my internship to be considered. The internship contract also says I may terminate the employment with 30 days written notice. But they are allow to fire me at any time if I do bad.

Should I take this position despite knowing I won't get paid and hope that I will get hired as a full-time employee after my internship is over? Or should I decline the offer? 

I was thinking maybe I can work for the company to gain more skill in software development while I try to do a random part time job that can earn me some money.

Edit: The internship contract says I may terminate the employment with 30 days written notice."

HELP!!",annawu9994,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5t4fct/about_to_graduate_with_business_marketing_degree/,"Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit so I'm pretty nervous but I need some help and advice!!! 

I'm 22 years old and I'm about to graduate next Fall 2017 semester with a Business Marketing degree. I have worked full time since I was 17 in the food industry (example: shift lead, server, etc.) but I have no actual experience in the business field. My reasoning behind this is because both my parents don't work, so I have to provide for my family. 

With graduation around the corner, I'm starting to panic and regret that I never joined any internships or sorority and frats for connections... I wish I could've squeezed in some time but I don't think I could've being a full time student and worker. 

Sorry for my whole life story... (I'm also venting here...) but graduation is coming up and I've seen my classmates and friends starting to get great job offers or internships and know which direction they're heading next in life...

I still have another semester left and I have enough money saved up on the side to work part time instead. I believe it's a great opportunity for me start looking for internships or entry level jobs. I don't have much time because most internships I've seen are available for students only. 

This is where my worry begins... The entry level jobs/ internships I've been seeing requires some sort of experience and I'm sad to say I don't have any... Not even experience with interviews... I'm afraid I won't know how or what to say if I do get a call back... I'm normally shy and tend to get nervous when put on the spot. I've also taken most of the required courses in my major but I don't think that's enough. I'm mostly interested in entry level jobs because I'm hoping to find a full time job out of this. However, at this point, I won't complain about an internship! 

I guess my questions are: 
•How do I look for a job without experience/connections? 
•What are some ways to get experience/connections?  •How do I make myself stand out against other applicants? 
•What are the most realistic jobs out there for someone in the marketing field without any experience? 
•What should I expect and do once I graduate and still in the same current situation?
•What should I start doing/improve on? 

Side note: In terms of marketing, I would like to mention that I'm interested in market research, advertising, creativity, etc. 

I know this is difficult to answer but I'm really stressed out... So any suggestions and advice would gladly be appreciated! 

Also thank you for taking your time out to read about my first post and current situation. I truly do appreciate it!!

A little background:

I'm from Northern Los Angeles. I currently work for my dad as an electrician and have been for about 4 years now. I started an accelerated Comp Sci Bachelors program at my local university 2 years ago and have some coding experience previous to this program. I will be graduating at the end of May 2017. I have had one short-lived internship (1 month) at a small company in my hometown doing customer support and other small tasks (server maintenance, answering emails, dealing with sub-contractors). 

My coding skills: 

I would consider myself a novice to mediocre programmer. I have a handful of projects on my GitHub and many other small programs (not on GitHub) that I've done over the years for practice and what not. I have a nasty habit of procrastinating but a knack for picking up new languages/concepts and being able to build something fairly quickly. Once I dedicate myself to learning something I am very persistent and determined to accomplish the goal and I enjoy a good challenge. That's why I got into coding.

My predicament:

I am planning on traveling to Europe for two months this July/August. With a boss (my dad) that is very flexible and understanding, being 22 years old, making a decent paycheck, being single, and not being committed to another company, I fear that I won't ever find a better time in my life to go make a trip like this happen. And I don't want to miss this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

But what does this mean for my career?

These are the questions I'm currently trying to find an answer for:
• Should I still look for an internship/job and see if once I get hired they would be willing to give me the time off?
             • Would it be worth giving up and canceling my trip if I get a good job that doesn't want to give me the time off? 
      
OR

• Should I not look for an internship until after my trip?
             • And just start contributing to open source and working on projects and get my GitHub sparkling by the time I do apply for a job?
             • When I get back from my trip do I even still look for internships or just look for full-time positions?
             • Would I be missing out on crucial post-grad job opportunities?
             • Will a gap between my graduation and applying for a job in the Comp Sci industry look bad on a resume?
             • What other ways can I build up my skills for returning from my trip and looking for a job?
             • Would working for a remote company (or in a remote position) help with this situation in any way?

I have heard of developers getting jobs purely off of the experience and side projects with no degree, so I feel like with a degree, I could leverage the same logic to go on a trip and still retain, if not improve my ability to land a job later down the line.

Any advice would be much appreciated! I love coding and there is nothing I would rather do with my life.




Edit: TL;DR

Taking a Eurotrip after graduating and don't know whether to wait until after the trip to look for a job or not.

I've been in an entry-level marketing position for about 9 months and my boss (the CEO) and I do not get along, I feel like he might be an abusive employer, and I think it is making me emotionally ill.

When I first started the job I was given a big project: Create animated videos that demonstrate the solutions we sell. My boss has no clue what video-making entails so that's just a disclaimer.

So I'm not an animator but I do have a film/video editing background, and I told my boss from the beginning that I'm not an animator. After his pressure to figure it out, I said I could try to make an animated video but it would take me 1 month's time because there was a huge learning curve and video editing is just a time-consuming task in general.

He was okay with my time frame quote and I began the project. After a week had passed my boss was pressuring me to get it done faster and my constant reply to his comments was, ""You know its only been 1 week.. I thought we had agreed upon a 1 month time frame?"" or ""It's been 2 weeks.. I'm still working on it with the agreed upon goal of 1 month in mind.""

In the end I did in fact create a pretty decent animated video that looks very professional, on a SUPER LOW (like $200) budget and within the 1 month time frame.

My boss was glad it was done but acted surprised that it took so long, which left me confused and feeling underappreciated...and this was my first task as a new employee.

I could go on and on with examples of this trend happening over the consecutive months leading up to now, with other projects and tasks, and now I'm in a place where I find it hard to have a conversation with him about anything - new tasks, tasks in the works, future tasks, time off, employee reviews, you name it.

I now feel very uncomfortable around him for these reasons:

- his constant pressure
- unreasonable time frames and expectations for tasks to be completed
- huge workload
- not enough staff to handle the workload (I have suggested hiring a paid intern and he is acting slow on this process, although agrees with the idea)

FASTFORWARD TO THIS WEEK:

He told my other supervisor that I am rude because I don't say hello to him in the morning. A big reason for this is because anytime I enter his office he makes me feel uncomfortable for the above reasons.

So as instructed by my other supervisor (who I get along with really well) I went to into my boss' office to clear the air on Monday. It didn't go well. My boss was upset that I brought it up, but I was instructed to do so.

In order to not address the greater issue of me being uncomfortable with him (because I'm not sure if it's appropriate to do so) I said, ""Hey I heard that you thought I was being rude but it was nothing personal at all, I was just trying to not interrupt your phone conversations that you are often on, if not always having, when I walk in at 8:30am"". Then he shook his head and said, ""I'm not always on the phone when you come in"" which I replied with, ""I apologize but today when I got in you were on the phone and I just didnt want to disturb you"". He said, ""I don't want to talk about this right now"" and I left his office...

So I'm just sitting here like WTF ?! I do so much for this guy and I feel like he hates me but he wont have any conversations about my performance when I ask to talk about it (for review purposes, etc). I think he has an ADD issue or is hyperactive and can't focus, therefore he gives all these crazy tasks and is always asking if something is finished.

I'm wondering if it is just me or is my boss abusive ?

I just don't know what to do. I want to find another job but this job has left me feeling like I suck and can't perform and also like I'm a bad employee, which I know I'm not. I work a lot of overtime and produce more than expected.

Anyone have any advice ?

Should I set up a meeting to really just talk everything out and clear the air or do you guys think that would be more destructive than anything? Other people in the office are telling me to clear the air but I'm nervous. Also, other people don't work directly under him like I do so I feel my co-workers are giving me bad advice because it's easy for them to avoid him."

I'm looking for an internship or entry level job that can give me more hands on experience and get me out of my service industry job. 

The toughest part is finding a job or internship that I think I qualify for, then reading the description and seeing things like ""Must be proficient with these 5 frameworks, 6 languages, 3 software suites, database administration, network administration, web security, forum moderation, etc..."" That's a bit of an exaggeration but I'm sure you know what I mean. There's just so much that I don't know and don't have experience with, and I don't know how anyone can be expected to have that much experience for an internship or entry level position out of school. It's just really discouraging as I feel like I'm never going to get to the point where I'll have the skills needed to land a job in industry. Add to that the fact that most internships I find seem to be along the lines of ""Build a website/app/program for this company without being paid for it."" and there just doesn't seem to be a good way for me to get out of this ditch.

I am talking about that kind of a small city. The kind of city which is a backwards type of place without a strong economy outside of some retail jobs and the obvious jobs at a hospital. 

After graduating college as a biology major, which I was pushed into by my parents and didn't have the guts to stand up to them until it was too late and I had already graduated, I moved back home with my parents. 

I never really liked the field at all but my parents were oppressing people who had a dictator mindset, so they pushed me into it and I went along. I mainly blame myself for being such a spineless person but it's the past, you can't change it.

So I have been trying to get the jobs that are outside this field and will take a person with a college degree in general. The issue I keep running into is that a lot of these jobs are in a big city which is about 80 miles away from where I live.

I have managed to get some interviews and some ask me saying ""how soon will you be willing to start?"". Think I messed up at first by telling them it will take me some time to start, like a week or two to get set up, but then I told them I have friends and family in the city so I will be able to move immediately.

Anyways, it is depressing the hell out of me being in this city in my 20s. I grew up here and always wanted to get out, it is the kind of city that feels like a small town.

I currently work for free pretty much at a chemical plant just as an intern trying to get some experience and avoid the resume gap. My issue is, I am having such a tough time finding any decent opportunities here. Just being here is wrecking my mind sometimes.

So many of the big jobs are in major cities or certain upcoming cities, not here.

How do I keep my head up in this job hunt and most importantly, any advice for landing a job in a local fun city?"

I'm 24, currently degreeless, but have a decent amount of work experience (for my age). My relevant experience is as follows

**Company 1** (250 - 350 Employee Finance Company)

* June 2012 - May 2013: Sys Admin
* May 2013 - July 2014: Software Engineer (Internal promotion)

**Company 2** (75 - 150 Employee Online Education Company)

* Sept 2014 - Jan 2015: Software Engineer Intern
* Jan 2015 - Present: Software Engineer

One of my major goals is to spend some time working for a Big N company. Regardless of this sub's opinion on the whole Big N thing, it's been a goal of mine since I was pretty young (Google specifically).

A couple of people I've talked to in the local tech community have mentioned that while not impossible, it's very rare for someone without at least a Bachelors to score a job at a Big N. These are folks who have worked for a number of Big N companies, so I'm inclined to give their opinion some weight.

So now I'm considering returning to school. I have about a year left to finish. However, this time rather than doing computer science I would be pursuing a degree in mathematics. In regards to the degree change, I enjoy math a lot more than CS, and I would have about the same amount of credits to finish for both degrees.

I guess this post boils down to a few questions.

1. With my current level of work experience, how big of a difference will a degree make for future employers? Specifically Big N type companies.
2. Will a math degree have more or less weight than a CS degree? Especially given that I already have relevant work experience.
3. If I go for the math degree, would Applied Mathematics be more beneficial than Pure Mathematics?

Those of you with internships, what do you do? I'm debating on Computer Science, or Computer Engineering really. I know CS isn't an engineering field by name, but I believe it is very close to it in relation at least. I enjoy working with computer software, but I also enjoy learning how the hardware works, and building things, taking things apart and such (amateur mind you, not nearly up to your level or anything)  is why I'm interested in CE.

For those of you in other engineering fields, do you think that your field might be a better fit for me? What is it and why? My only thing I think may be a detractor, is math takes me a bit to get it. Once I get it, I got it for sure ,but it takes me a while, but the university I'm looking at has study sessions, tutors, as well as I can study it myself.

A little background: I am currently working as an intern at a pretty big company in IT, let's call them Company A. I've enjoyed my work so far; my coworkers seem cool, I've begun to saddle more responsibilities since my internship was extended, and there is a possibility of a full-time offer when I graduate in May. However, to ""prepare for the worst"", my boss told me to look around at other positions, whether it be inside or outside the company, to make sure I can get *something* by the time I leave school. That something took shape yesterday in the form of an offer at an aerospace company, let's call them Company B, that could put my foot in the door at some of the larger firms in the future (I would like to end up in aviation). Their offer expires in 4 days. However, the pay is lower at Company B's location than what I could be paid in IT at my current position in Company A, however my boss hasn't given me a number yet (even though he's promised I'm a ""line item"" in the budget). Where I'm at now I could enjoy more benefits but I feel like the work could get boring after a few years. I am currently asking the following questions that I would like some answers to:

1. How do I tell my boss at Company A that I have an offer outside the company that expires in 4 days, and that I might need an answer sooner rather than later? 
2. How do I ask the Company B to extend the deadline to potentially give my current boss some time to come up with a number? 
3. How could I ask for a counter offer from Company B for higher pay? 
4. Is email or call the best way to get in touch with both these parties?

TLDR: Company A is cool but could get boring, but might offer higher pay. I might be taking a pay cut going to Company B, but I don't know that because Company A hasn't given me an offer yet. I might enjoy the work at Company B more because I'd like to be in that industry. See above questions I would like answered. Thanks for any help I can get! "

I've had multiple 2nd, 3rd round interviews for CS jobs, but they almost always end with something along the lines of ""While we think that culturally you would be a great fit, with you changing you career interests late and considering a masters degree we do not think an internship here would be beneficial to either parties"".

I'm worried that because I have no internship experience or on the job experience I'm not gonna get anything.

One of the companies said that I needed ""more experience"". Mind you, this was after a very lengthy interview process which included a take home coding project. The job was also described as being entry level, which is all I really apply for. I'd like to think I'm pretty good at selling myself and presenting myself well at these interviews.

Am I just worried for no reason? Should I just keep using the shotgun approach and applying anywhere hiring ""entry level"" until something sticks? I've asked around, and people say that it's too late for me to get an internship as I'm going to be graduating soon. Is that true? Or should I go for internships to get my foot in the door?

Thanks!

5tjpnq,2,2017-02-11,[Need Advice] I Work At A Burnout Company,hime-brigarron,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5tjpnq/need_advice_i_work_at_a_burnout_company/,"I have no idea what to do, but I desperately need help.

I am a student who was just fresh out of college and in the middle of an internship. Unfortunately, due to some circumstances and finances, they could not turn me full-time. So, my friend from college piped up and gave me the good word to do Quality Assurance. Everything seemed great. Good offer, lots of perks, cool start up company, known worldwide. Everything seemed okay. I hoped that eventually I could branch into another path within the company and eventually do UI Art/Interfaces.

My team was small. Only me and three other people. But it grew two more within the past couple months. However, within the second week of being there, something was wrong.

Our managers have the impression that we are able to build a fully working game within a month. At first, I raised my eyebrows at that, because I've seen many, many videos of SHITTY companies that ""built GAMES in a month"" that ended up being godawful messes. But I looked at our games, and they didn't look too bad.

Within the second week, I was already working completely through the weekends. Even with full staff and a full plan on how to attack things, we were camped in at 8-9 am until 8-10 pm at night. Sometimes even later. This actually impacted me trying to find an apartment in the area (I was couchsurfing with my friend/coworker) and eliminated the time to explore the area and relax. I was becoming exhausted, I used lunch breaks to check out apartments and management even raised their eyebrows at me taking lunch breaks.

Towards the end of our first project, we had a horrific crash that we had no idea how to fix. It was only isolated to one device and one browser, but it was very popular with our audience. That was the last bug. It was 8 pm on the day we were supposed to ship everything out, and our manager came in. He bitched at us for not finding it sooner (granted, it only appeared randomly a few builds prior to the newest version) and called us all ""fuckups"" and sent us home.

I remember feeling so hurt. Working endless hours to have a project sink in the water.

They then decided to have a period for us to restructure our resources (change documents, methods of testing, etc.) and things seemed somewhat calm. Although we had a fuckton of meetings and barely made progress the first few weeks, we still made progress towards the end to speed things up. (Which our CEO pretty much stated at the end of our progress reports ""Was a waste of time"")

Fast forward to now, I am now project lead for a title, even though I was only here for 4-5 months. Yet, I was being pulled onto the previous project because there were minor defects and changes the boss wanted. Even when my game was set to ship in a week (Which in total, only had 2-3 weeks to develop btw), my boss and their bosses were already critiquing a major asset with our game, which they have decided with the art team without any development or QA present. So, one of our biggest features, which was already thoroughly tested had to completely change AND FUNCTION PERFECTLY within 3-4 DAYS. This has been a common pattern whenever we are incredibly close to the deadline, my bosses talk these particular people on advice for changing the game, with full knowledge that it needs to be shipped within only a few days. All of QA and Developers worked their tails off, and today was yet the fourth-fifth weekend in a row that I was pulled in to work. It was still very much broken. Our boss pretty much said ""It's due on monday and if it's not perfect, it's your fault.""

While my coworkers are angels, and the boss underneath the asshole bosses sympathizes with me about the situation, I absolutely hate my job and upon much research, I have occupational burnout.  I've pushed off laundry, getting groceries, and the hobbies I love to relax and be refreshed for the next 12-14 hours of work. I've neglected calling my family and friends for weeks on end because of how drained I am. Whenever I spoke up about not wanting to be in for the 3-4th week in a row, our bosses inform us we're ""not working smarter"" or ""maybe you should have finished your shit during the week"", even though I'm doing my damnedest to get shit done so I don't have to come in the weekend. I've been meeting with the art director in secret to help transfer me over to art because of the calmer community and the structure of the group. 
 
I decided to give the company a year, and if it continues down the path, at least I would have a year of experience and GTFO of there. But I don't even know if I can stay sane enough for the whole year. I don't have time to see a doctor about my depression or talk to a therapist. There hasn't been a week where I had a day where I broke down and cried. A few days prior, I wished I got hit by a car on the way home or just never wake up. It sucks because I love all the outside influences outside of work, but I'm getting so stressed and burned out that I have no idea what to do...

TL;DR: Working at a company with bosses who change features around days before releasing products, then yells at me I'm not working hard enough. Been working several weeks straight with no break and need help on how not to jump off the nearest bridge."
5tjsrn,208,2017-02-12,The girl I will never forget (part 10),sippistar,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5tjsrn/the_girl_i_will_never_forget_part_10/,"The last time at the hospital (Part A)



I arrived at the hospital early the next morning. I needed to check on my husband and if they allowed it, bring him home. I had packed some of his belongings up for him before I left the house and I was excited to see him. To my surprise, he wasn’t as excited to see me. I placed the blame on his pain meds, but something still felt off. 


I spoke to his doctor, and they had determined that his back was fine, just sore and he should be good to go home since they casted his ankle. It would take about 4 months to heal. I was glad it wasn’t  completely broken, just fractured. 



His nurse helped us out to the car. She was an intern and had apparently been taking care of him all night. She was young and thin, with short black hair. I enjoyed testing her knowledge with questions about my husband's medical chart. She impressed me with how well she was doing and I believe she’ll make a fine nurse one day, yet I found myself feeling anxious around her.



By the time we arrived home and got him hobbled into the house, my husband’s demeanor still hadn’t changed. I again, placed its blame on the meds. I helped him in with the crutches, got him situated with the TV remote and his leg propped up, got him some snacks and made calls to ensure one of his friends could come check on him later in the afternoon. I gave him a quick kiss, though he didn’t react much, so I quickly left, as I had other things on my mind.



I was still early for my shift, but I did that on purpose. I had research to do. Research on Terry. I was sure he killed his parents, especially given that the situation was so similar to Heather’s. I had with me the box I found from the night before containing both the diary and the marbles.



 As I arrived back at the hospital, I grabbed the items, I  suddenly felt a piece of paper underneath the box, I looked, it was a yellow sticky note. I stared at it in confusion. Written in a ladylike slant on it was a number with the name Laurie, the name of the intern nurse. *Why did Laurie give my husband her number?* I tossed it back into the car and figured I would ask him about it later. I had work to do.



I went straight to the psych ward to the reception desk, I first wanted to see if I had my list of clients for the day, it wasn’t posted. Strange, I thought they wrote those out the night before, I guess I was wrong. As I turned around I found myself almost bumping into Heather’s temporary nurse. I jumped back and quickly apologized. 



“Oh, the apology is mine. I didn’t see you there.” Her nurse was quick to respond, so kind and genuine. 



“It’s ok, I didn’t realize you came here this early!”  I said.



“Oh, yes. What are you doing here so early?” She questioned.



“I came to look over a few things in my notes with some of the clients. I couldn’t concentrate at home.” I lied.



“I know what you mean. Do you got kids?” She was getting personal, something that I hadn’t really seen at this hospital with the staff.



“No, newly married.” I held up my hand with the big rock. I enjoyed showing it off. I smiled at her in pride; she smiled too.



“Well, congratulations. 



“Thank you.” I replied. I thought that was the end of the conversation, it wasn’t.


“I thought you were here early because of what happened---you know, the suicide?” She seemed eager to talk about it. I could tell right away that she needed to talk, it affected her. I wonder if she was the one that found him. My heart fell as I thought about the circumstances. I didn’t want to discuss it. 



“Yes, it was unfortunate. Are you going to be ok nurse?” She seemed surprised that I turned the tables back to her. She knew he was one of my clients, perhaps she wanted more information from me? She replied back in the typical response.

“It is just sad. I only saw him on my rounds once. I wish I could’ve done more.” Her words were soft and I felt like giving her a hug. Nurses like her don’t come around often, at least at this hospital. I suddenly found myself wanting to tell her all about Heather and Terry, and how I believe that Terry is responsible for the boy’s death, but I didn’t. I remained quiet about it.

 After much needed conversation about the suicide, I looked at the time and excused myself. I also needed as much time as I could to do research. As we said our goodbyes, she quickly added “I thought I would let you know, I will be here for the next few months. Heather’s original nurse still hasn’t shown up at work. No one has heard from her. They are going to do a welfare check today. I hope she is ok.” I had hoped so too, but I wasn’t surprised. However, that did get me thinking.



I rushed to the therapy room and sat at the desk in the corner, just like the one in Heather’s room, but bigger. I opened my laptop and logged into the hospital’s system. I brought up Heather’s full medical records instead of just the current ones.



 What I found, was more than I bargained for. As I opened up each document I put more and more together. Seven nurses in total in the last two years have come and gone as Heather’s nurses. Two of them never showed back up for their shift, only to call later and quit. Three of them transferred shortly after arriving, and one of them ended up being a patient here----car accident.


I selected that one’s medical records, seemed to be an ordinary case of someone getting hurt in an accident, except the log by the EMT on scene:



Case 293 
    Car rolled over in ditch, passenger found in car, was talking but appeared incoherent. No visible head wound, suggest likely hemorrhaging encephalo as eyes extremely bloodshot, more so than what one would expect in an accident with no apparent injury. Passenger kept repeating ""I have to get the marbles back”, and would not respond to assessment questions. Passenger in seatbelt. Driver, passenger husband, deceased before arrival, also no apparent physical injuries. Called hospital for bag and transport.



According to the nurse’s record, CT revealed that there was no damage or swelling of the brain. She ended up with a few broken bones and bruises, but survived. They found her deceased in her hospital bed the next morning. The death certificate read: Cardiac complications likely due to existing injury from recent automotive incident. Next of kin, undocumented.

Then of course, the 7th nurse---whom I saw choke on a marble---was now missing. It was strange that wasn’t in the system though. I worried about her and now the temporary nurse, which would be number 8. 



I looked up the notes from her therapist, surprisingly, there was no pattern. I wondered why she seemed to attach herself to these nurses, but not to the therapist. As I went through the names, that was when I noticed it -- the therapists were all male. *Perhaps that was the key?* 



I suddenly heard a small noise coming from somewhere in the room and glanced up, but couldn’t decipher where it had come from. I didn’t feel a temperature drop, so I continued on with my research. 



This time, I looked up Terry’s family information on the Internet. It didn’t take long to find the newspaper article about the death of his family in *The Old Tribune* archives. I poured over them until I found the time period that the previous record I had been given stated he was admitted here in and this is what I found.



[News paper article] (http://i.imgur.com/Hjz4Kfc.jpg)



I didn’t believe for a minute that Terry wasn’t the guilty party in his parents’ deaths, although I understood that back then it wasn’t the first thought that would come to someone’s mind when the child appeared to be as innocent as they described him to be. Had he been an adult they would have. 



I reached in the box that was now sitting on my desk, I grabbed the diary out of it, my curiosity digging hard. I was careful to open it up, no lock on it, just an old leather binding. Some of the pages weren’t readable due to age, but from what I gathered, this must’ve belonged to Terry’s mother. She seemed like a  very caring and vibrant woman of the 20’s.


 I flipped through several other entries until I got to the year Terry was born, What I came across was not at all what I expected. I was shocked, and I found myself shivering, was it cold in here? I thought. Or was I that afraid. In either case, as the pieces were falling into place, I didn’t feel safe.


Within the entries, I found that Terry’s mother seemed depressed as her and her husband were unable to have a child. This led her to a special doctor that was doing research on infertility. Some very unorthodox experiments were done. Here are a few pages I found that were readable that occurred the year she found out she was with child:



[Diary entry] (http://i.imgur.com/zHst2C5.jpg)



Once Terry was born, everything seemed normal. However, on Terry’s 6th birthday, something changed, or at least something that she noticed. I found these:



[Diary entry] (http://i.imgur.com/agmStt6.jpg)



I couldn't’ find any facts as to the fate of the Russian doctor or additional information in the accident of Doctor Daniels in my research, and the entries for those pages she wrote were torn out. I realized that with Terry’s mother working long hours now, and his dad out drinking most nights, Terry would have been left alone a lot. Many strange things began to happen, I was able to decipher these entries dating from when he would be 9 that year. 



[Diary entry] (http://i.imgur.com/cAP6C7X.jpg)



These were the last two entries that were readable that I found:

I decided to come back to school for a few reasons…


1. *NEEDED WORK*: I had just been laid off from my first job out of school, and within three days my old professor found out through Facebook and offered me a graduate student research position on a large grant if I entered a mining engineering master's program. They also allowed me to lecture and do research for a semester during the application process before I started the following semester.

2. *NO COST*: My tuition would be covered by research grants and scholarships. So far, for my first year I've even gotten money back on top of my monthly stipend.

3. *OTHER INCOME* I'd be able to work part time for a local engineering firm who I worked for during my undergrad. This has allowed me to make somewhat of a living.

4. *SOCIAL/SELFISH REASONS*: being around friends/family, living the college life again, and partying (all of which I missed)


Now, even with these reasons in mind I still had cold feet about going into the program. Partly because a masters in mining engineering wouldn't help me a whole lot as my credentials with my bachelor's allowed me to find a well paying job. A master's would only make me specialize and potentially earn more. Experience working in industry would benefit me more than a master’s. Not to mention the earning potential I was giving up by going back to school. At the same time, this also gave me a chance to consider a career in academia which has always interested me.


Now that I am in my second semester, a lot of issues have become painfully obvious...

1. *NO RESEARCH* I'm not being allocated research hours, I'm only TAing/lecturing. Though I enjoy it... a big reason why I came to grad school was to do research. Before I started my first semester I managed to do research and get a literature review done. But since then I haven’t done anything. Also, I'm supposed to do a thesis. How am I supposed to ever get a thesis done if I’m never tasked with any research? I’m not allowed to do a non-thesis option.

2. *NO IDEA WHEN I’M GRADUATING*: With point 1 in mind, it has become obvious that my professor really doesn’t care about how long it will take me to graduate. I wanted to stick around this summer to do research, but he pushed me towards finding another job for the summer (which I did). At this point, what I thought would be a 2 year program will likely take 3 years...

3. *PROFESSOR SUCKS*: He is a nice guy, but…. My professor has taken an extreme hands off approach as he is currently working to get tenure. He never knows what we are doing and often relies entirely on our PhD candidate for practically everything. We were just told our PhD candidate would be in charge of us (me and the other master’s student) pretty much for the rest of the year. One problem… our PhD is trying to graduate this semester or get a job allowing him to leave. Our professor’s nonexistent management and poor planning has driven me crazy and has resulted in some arguments…

4. *ISSUES WITH CLASSES*: Unfortunately, because I did my undergrad in the same department at the same university there are a lot of classes in my field I’m unable to take at the grad level as I already took them. Because of this… I’m forced to take classes in other departments. Though in some cases this has been awesome as it really has allowed me to broaden my knowledge, but at the same time it has left me scrambling to find classes to fill my schedule that are somewhat relevant. This is only going to get worse going further into the program.

5. **EDIT - CIRCUMSTANTIAL ISSUES**: I didn't put this down as its an ongoing issue. If you want to know more you can check out my [other reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/5srjkz/as_of_today_my_father_58_is_now_homeless_in_my/)... but currently there are some pretty major family issues that have been causing me some pretty extreme stress with that a lack of sleep and focus. On top of this, I'm currently pretty stressed out by one my classes which is outside of my field, but somewhat relevant. It has become apparent that I lack a lot of knowledge the professor expects us to have and his expectations for the class are extremely high. The big issue is the requirement to cover a paper every week and do a presentation. Though I think I could handle each of these stresses alone, together I feel completely overwhelmed. If I fail the class I'll lose my scholarship, and I definitely don't want to pay out of pocket or take loans for school...

So there you have it… **I came back to school on a whim because it was an easy option but found that the master’s program I was entering was more than I bargained for.** Right now I have an internship lined up for the summer, and as of now I’m hoping that will turn into a full time gig or I’ll find work somewhere else.


So Reddit, what is your advice? What would you do?"

We were just told our PhD candidate would be in charge of us (me and the other master’s student) pretty much for the rest of the year. One problem… our PhD is trying to graduate this semester or get a job allowing him to leave. Our professor’s nonexistent management and poor planning has driven me crazy and has resulted in some arguments…

4. *ISSUES WITH CLASSES*: Unfortunately, because I did my undergrad in the same department at the same university there are a lot of classes in my field I’m unable to take at the grad level as I already took them. Because of this… I’m forced to take classes in other departments. Though in some cases this has been awesome as it really has allowed me to broaden my knowledge, but at the same time it has left me scrambling to find classes to fill my schedule that are somewhat relevant. This is only going to get worse going further into the program.


So there you have it… **I came back to school on a whim because it was an easy option but found that the master’s program I was entering was more than I bargained for.** Right now I have an internship lined up for the summer, and as of now I’m hoping that will turn into a full time gig or I’ll find work somewhere else.


So Reddit, what is your advice? What would you do?"

They regularly cycle through interns, so being able to easily clean up a computer without my constant intervention would be a blessing - I'm just helping out friends, I don't work there.

However, before doing so I'm wondering whether or not I should update all their devices to the latest Mac OS for the sake of uniformity and security. I don't want to sacrifice usability, but I'm afraid of the performance of Sierra on their older systems - the oldest iirc is from 2011. In my personal anecdotal experience, older Macs don't run Sierra very well, and we don't have a budget to add RAM or SSDs.

A more drastic option would be to switch over to Cloudready, because they're already deeply tied into Google services and just leave 1 or 2 of the newer Macs on Mac OS for Adobe CC work.

Any advice would be appreciated."

5tng9j,46,2017-02-12,Can you help resolve a small disagreement with sysadmin?,dcnzq,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5tng9j/can_you_help_resolve_a_small_disagreement_with/,"I'm not a sysadmin, but as the ""techiest"" person in the office it typically falls to me to figure out the best solution for these things.

I work at a small business with about 10 people (+ freelancers who work remotely). We have a freelance IT consultant who charges us per hour who the company has used for years.

Basically, we've been having some problems with our existing setup and have a small (amicable!) disagreement with our freelancer on how to fix it.

We currently have an on-site Windows Server with NAS. If we need to access files outside the office, we use Remote Desktop to access our computers in the office. Emails etc. are handled using Office 365 for Business Essentials. We have &lt;500GB of files - since we primarily work with Word docs and images, we don't actually use that much space.

However, we've been having several problems:

* We've been experiencing a lot of intrusion attempts on our Remote Desktop ports for several months now, which leads to the server regularly locking us out or blocking our remote access. Only the freelancer has access to the server, so only he can unblock us when we get locked out.

* We're regularly on the move and find ourselves increasingly needing to access files on mobiles/iPads etc. We can't realistically do this with Remote Desktop.

* The building where we work has a habit of doing maintenance every few months or so, which involves cutting the power to the building. This means we have to regularly shut down our server, preventing access over the weekends (which we sometimes need).

* Any time we have a problem, we have to call up our freelance IT consultant. He often isn't available, often doesn't get back to us and his charges are quite expensive. This can lead to people being locked out of the system for a whole day, and problems can stick around for several months before being looked at.

* There are no user permissions or anything like that. Anyone, including interns, can access (and delete) any file on the shared drive. Hasn't really been a problem before (although files have been accidentally deleted), but it does make me nervous. Our password security policy isn't great either since they're all shared.

* Our server is pretty old, running out of space and we haven't tested our backup tapes to see if they work for several years.

My feeling (and most of the people I work with agree) is that we need to move our files to a cloud server and stop trying to host IT infrastructure on-site.

And a handful of people are advocating moving entirely over to Google Apps. My concern with this is that it will be confusing for some people, especially when we have to send files to clients who don't use it.

Our IT consultant is arguing quite strongly against moving towards the cloud, as he argues that there is no solution that people will find easy enough to use. E.g. Dropbox has file conflicts when multiple people edit a file, Google Apps doesn't use Microsoft Word. Though since he gets paid every time we have a problem, he has an obvious incentive to keep the existing setup.

Sadly it falls to me to judge what we should do, since I'm trusted on this stuff. 

Since I trust you guys more than I trust myself, what do you think would work best? I think the simpler the solution, the better since it's literally just a bunch of Word docs, pdfs and images we store and I really don't see why we should be making this way too complicated.

**TL;DR** Small business (10 people + remote workers) with &lt;500GB of files. Loads of IT problems. Stick with an on-site server or move to the cloud?

5ts6kc,1,2017-02-13,"I have the worst reputation on campus, I'm under investigation, and I've lost everything that brought me joy",raspberrysorbetto,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5ts6kc/i_have_the_worst_reputation_on_campus_im_under/,"Hello,

I wanted some advice on how to be happy and have a bright future given my situation.

Ever since I came to this school, I haven't fit in. The first semester was alright and I got decent grades, joined clubs, and partied quite a bit. But when I came back from winter break everyone had made closer friends and I felt extremely alone. My 19th birthday came and I spent it by myself because my parents started an argument. The day after, I wrote this long journal entry that sort of seemed like a suicide note and I left campus to take a long walk and get away from it all. Things escalated quickly. I was reported missing and dozens of news articles came out about what had happened. The administration tried to force me out of the school for drawing publicity but my parents and I fought it and I ended up coming back after having to be gone for 2 weeks. Hundreds of people sent me these messages of support, but when I came back, everyone kind of avoided me.

After that, it was hard to find motivation. I still went to class but had to drop some and I wasn't as active in clubs, because they involved a lot of work I didn't have the emotional energy to do. The social life here revolves around productivity and achievement, but I was still depressed and even more discouraged due to the scrutiny and trauma of the past, not to mention all the news articles on Google under my name. 

Fast forward to sophomore year. Things are alright but I still never really fit in. But my friend brings me to this event and I meet a guy who I immediately vibe with. We end up talking on a rooftop for hours, and for the first time in awhile I'm able to relax and live in the moment. Fast forward a few weeks, we're going on all kinds of dates and staying up all night running around town. I feel young and I remember myself. Fast forward a few more weeks, we spend the night cuddling together and we're vulnerable with each other. We end up talking so long that we watch the sunset, and it's the most romantic night I've ever had. I open up to him about everything, and he says things I never thought I'd hear from a guy in my life. I feel worthwhile and beautiful and whole and renewed, all because he dared to see past my baggage. For the first time in a year, I feel like I have hope. Shortly after we have an exquisite dinner date and officially become a couple. Throughout the next few months it's a dream come true. We have amazing and meaningful moments together in all kinds of ways, and no two encounters are ever the same. We explore every part of town, every part of our minds, and every part of each other. And most importantly, he's there for me as I process all of my pain, steady in his patient commitment, balking at nothing. I cherish him with all my heart, and I feel like for once, life has finally sent a gift my way instead of just shitting on me. And then, a week after winter break...he breaks up with me out of the blue. I get no real explanation, only a corny line (it's not you, it's me.) I'm shellshocked and devastated, and the breakup sends me spiraling into another deep depression. I end up losing my spring internship because of it and withdrawing from most activities because I'm unable to stay consistently productive. 

Fast forward a few weeks after that, and I'm taking a test. Nearing the end of it I go to the bathroom and end up having a conversation that veers towards a topic. As the other girl delves into unnecessary detail, a dean walks in and tells me I've violated the honor code. She files a report on me but only me, which makes me feel singled out. Now I'm waiting for the investigation and spiraling even further into a dark abyss. Word has gotten around a little bit and people whisper and look at me a few times a day. I was just starting to recover from all that bullshit last year and now there's something new for everyone to talk about. I feel like I can't escape and I'll always be known for being a trainwreck. Everyone knows my business and thinks I'm a joke. I lost my academic standing, I lost my reputation, I lost the guy I truly and deeply loved, I lost a lot of hope, I lost my internship, and I lost my joy. But worst of all, I lost myself. 

I used to have a bright persona, when I saw my future as bright. I was bubbly, confident, philosophically-minded, eccentric, spontaneous, and inquisitive. I had a presence and a drive, a propensity to lead, and a thirst for knowledge. Now, I am only demoralized. I feel like nothing but a laughingstock, a walking stigma, an object of blame and derision. I walk through the world filled with shame and embarrassment. I no longer wonder, I only apologize and attempt to justify myself. I am either ignored outright, or receive attention in the form of scrutiny. I see my future as dark, and sealed. If the Google results don't turn off employers and internship hirers, it will be the honor code problems, or the string of mediocre post-incident grades. I don't see a light at the end of this tunnel. I don't know how to feel adequate. I don't know how to recapture my light, my good reputation, or my prospects. Sorry this was long, but I wanted to share my story. Any advice is welcome, any at all. How do I share my talents with the world, when the stigma and disgrace I've acquired overshadow my offerings? Thank you, truly, to any brave souls who dare to wade into this question.

I am a second year Rotman student with plans to do a CS minor. Recently, I have gained some interest in Machine Learning (thinking of pursuing an MFE later on). The issue is that most of the Machine Learning courses require at least a MAT135/MAT136 prerequisite. Since I was a goof in first year and took MAT133, my  only hope is to basically take MAT137 over the summer. The thing is, I already need to take 2.0 credits this summer to not fuck over myself in third and fourth year (I want third year summer off to get an internship).

I am just curious if UofT lets you overload over the summer and let you take 3.0 credits. My cGPA right now is 3.86 and my past sessional GPA (with a 6.0 credit course load) was 3.94.

Another option would be to try and talk to the CS department and see if they will let me in without the prereqs. However, I know that machine learning is very math intensive and the odds that they let me in without having the prereqs of basic calculus is very little to me. What are the odds (if any) that they let me in given my high GPA (85 in MAT223 &amp; 90 in MAT133 lol).

The feedback I received was phenomenal and I am so thankful!! I took all of it into consideration and used all of the recommended edits.  Now I have what could be the final edition of my purpose statement and I'm wondering if you guys will work your magic again for me!

Here it is!

While my decision to apply to a Master of Public Administration program was made partially because it is the logical next step in my academic career, it is far more than just logic that drove my decision.  As a child, I was exposed to contaminants on a playground and the negative effects have continued to impact my life since.  Migraines were a daily occurrence, often preventing me from being able to go to school.  My school district was not equipped to handle educating someone with the health problems I was facing and I eventually withdrew from school and obtained a high school equivalency diploma.  Although I am fortunate enough now to say that my health problems are under control, that is not the end of this fight for me.  
The events of my childhood generated a drive inside of me to pursue a career in public administration.  My dream is to ensure that no child ever has to choose between their health and pursuing an education.  The current emphasis on testing in education diminishes the concern with the students with the strongest and weakest capabilities.  Schools are compelled to have strong median and mean scores, leading them to ignore other students.  I have decided to pursue an education in public administration rather than education administration because schools are often too vested in these practices and change would have to occur at an oversight level.   
In 2013, I took the first step towards making my dream a reality by enrolling in night classes at the local community college.  I spent two years studying to earn my associate’s degree, all the while working at a local bank to fund my education.  I exceeded countless expectations by not only graduating but by receiving high honors. As I walked across the stage, I vowed to continue my education and to fight to promote universal access to education.  In the Fall of 2015, I enrolled at -undergrad school- majoring in Political Science.  I am graduating this May with a dual major in Political Science and Public Administration along with a minor in Geography with a GPA of 3.72. 
-Undergrad School- has opened up numerous doors that have continued to reaffirm my career goals.  In the Spring of 2016, I served as an intern for a city planning office.  In this position, I provided research assistance to the office and attended city council meetings to report back to the principal planner. Additionally, I answered calls from residents and provided information on anything from zoning to natural disaster management.  I completed a project for the office that compared the historical sites in the city to their present day condition, finding that many of them had been poorly preserved over the years.
During the summer of 2016, I was one of eight students selected from my school to participate in an internship in Washington D.C. with one of our state’s Congress members.  I found myself immersed in public policy and I loved every minute of my experience.  During my internship at the D.C. office, I attended Senate sessions and Congressional hearings. Additionally, I completed policy memos for the Senator, ensuring he was well prepared for any meetings or events he attended.  
Upon my return home from Washington D.C., the local constituent office for the Senator contacted me to offer me an internship in their office.  At the constituent office, I was primarily responsible for organizing the Senator’s schedule and answering questions and concerns of the Senator’s constituents.  The Senator is highly involved in protecting the environment and hosts a conference for energy and environment leaders at the local convention center every year.  While working for the Senator, I was able to help organize and manage the conference to ensure all went as planned.  
I have recently started my final internship in my undergraduate career at an office as a policy intern.  In this internship, I will attend legislative sessions and provide research support for the department.  Additionally, I am assisting in the modification of a program that helps those receiving unemployment benefits regain employment.  These experiences that have made me an outstanding candidate for your public administration program.  Obtaining a Master of Public Administration is the final step in ensuring that I can accomplish my aspirations.

5tvdly,1,2017-02-13,Should I contact internship company about tattoo policy?,chevybow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5tvdly/should_i_contact_internship_company_about_tattoo/,"I tried looking online for their policy. Their general dress attire is in between business and casual (they allow jeans but still require semi-professional shirt like a polo). Their tattoo and piercing policy is very vague though and basically amounts to ""Make sure its appropriate for the environment you work in and it needs to be covered up if its distracting or inappropriate"". 


I know my tattoo isn't inappropriate but I feel like ""appropriate for the environment"" and ""distracting"" is pretty subjective. I mainly just would want to know what to pack- especially since if I have to bring long sleeve shirts I'd have to buy some in advance. They didn't see the tattoo (forearm) at the interview since I had it covered but the on site was in winter and the internship will be in 90+ degree weather during the summer. 



Mainly I'm just unsure if its an appropriate question to ask. Also I'm unsure when I would ask since the internship starts in late May and there hasn't been too much communication since I accepted the offer. When I visited the company I saw a couple people with very visible tattoos so I thought I would be okay with the culture there (and talking to some engineers there they said basically no one cares if you're a software engineer and have tattoos- the policy is mainly for the business roles in the company). Should I make sure anyways and try contacting them? Maybe they enforce their policy more for interns than full time engineers? 


Thanks- any advice would be appreciated. "

5tvodh,2,2017-02-13,Will you tear my statement of purpose to shreds (again)?,brittanyandrea,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5tvodh/will_you_tear_my_statement_of_purpose_to_shreds/,"I posted my statement of purpose previously to get some feedback.  The feedback I received was phenomenal and I am so thankful!! I took all of it into consideration and used all of the recommended edits.  Now I have what could be the final edition of my purpose statement and I'm wondering if you guys will work your magic again for me!

Here it is!

While my decision to apply to a Master of Public Administration program was made partially because it is the logical next step in my academic career, it is far more than just logic that drove my decision.  As a child, I was exposed to contaminants on a playground and the negative effects have continued to impact my life since.  Migraines were a daily occurrence, often preventing me from being able to go to school.  My school district was not equipped to handle educating someone with the health problems I was facing and I eventually withdrew from school and obtained a high school equivalency diploma.  Although I am fortunate enough now to say that my health problems are under control, that is not the end of this fight for me.  
The events of my childhood generated a drive inside of me to pursue a career in public administration.  My dream is to ensure that no child ever has to choose between their health and pursuing an education.  The current emphasis on testing in education diminishes the concern with the students with the strongest and weakest capabilities.  Schools are compelled to have strong median and mean scores, leading them to ignore other students.  I have decided to pursue an education in public administration rather than education administration because schools are often too vested in these practices and change would have to occur at an oversight level.   
In 2013, I took the first step towards making my dream a reality by enrolling in night classes at the local community college.  I spent two years studying to earn my associate’s degree, all the while working at a local bank to fund my education.  I exceeded countless expectations by not only graduating but by receiving high honors. As I walked across the stage, I vowed to continue my education and to fight to promote universal access to education.  In the Fall of 2015, I enrolled at -undergrad school- majoring in Political Science.  I am graduating this May with a dual major in Political Science and Public Administration along with a minor in Geography with a GPA of 3.72. 
-Undergrad School- has opened up numerous doors that have continued to reaffirm my career goals.  In the Spring of 2016, I served as an intern for a city planning office.  In this position, I provided research assistance to the office and attended city council meetings to report back to the principal planner. Additionally, I answered calls from residents and provided information on anything from zoning to natural disaster management.  I completed a project for the office that compared the historical sites in the city to their present day condition, finding that many of them had been poorly preserved over the years.
During the summer of 2016, I was one of eight students selected from my school to participate in an internship in Washington D.C. with one of our state’s Congress members.  I found myself immersed in public policy and I loved every minute of my experience.  During my internship at the D.C. office, I attended Senate sessions and Congressional hearings. Additionally, I completed policy memos for the Senator, ensuring he was well prepared for any meetings or events he attended.  
Upon my return home from Washington D.C., the local constituent office for the Senator contacted me to offer me an internship in their office.  At the constituent office, I was primarily responsible for organizing the Senator’s schedule and answering questions and concerns of the Senator’s constituents.  The Senator is highly involved in protecting the environment and hosts a conference for energy and environment leaders at the local convention center every year.  While working for the Senator, I was able to help organize and manage the conference to ensure all went as planned.  
I have recently started my final internship in my undergraduate career at an office as a policy intern.  In this internship, I will attend legislative sessions and provide research support for the department.  Additionally, I am assisting in the modification of a program that helps those receiving unemployment benefits regain employment.  These experiences that have made me an outstanding candidate for your public administration program.  Obtaining a Master of Public Administration is the final step in ensuring that I can accomplish my aspirations.

5twjui,2,2017-02-13,I need help deciding what to do with university,durantt0,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5twjui/i_need_help_deciding_what_to_do_with_university/,"Have any of you been ""stuck"" deciding what to do about college? I'm a sophomore at the University of Cincinnati majoring in Computer Science and about a year and a half ago I realized my passion is to run a tech company. I love programming and I love entrepreneurship, but I don't know what to do about college. My university requires all engineering majors to participate in 5 co-op semesters (full-time, paid internships) to a lot of people this sounds cool, but it's sucking the life out of me. I hate my co-op and it's absolutely destroying any chance of running a company I have, since I only have about 3-4 hours to work when I get home and I don't know what to do. I love my college and I love my major but running a successful business is more important to me than anything right now. Even if I were to grit my teeth and suffer through my job for the next 3 months, I've got 4 more co-ops I have to do. I've realized I'm only in college as a backup at this point, the degree won't help me do much but get a job, but I can't prove to myself I can survive off of my ventures right now. I'm currently putting together my first commercial product and I'll be releasing it on the app store in a week or two with some others who are working with me and I need some advice on what to do about this co-op and my university's program in general. Here are my options:

* Bite the bullet and be miserable for the next few months and try to release something with the limited time that I have and if it succeeds use that as leverage to either drop out comfortably or convince my school to let me drop the co-op program

* Go part-time and focus more on my ventures but risk graduating with more student debt than I would otherwise have. I believe this would allow me to circumvent co-op requirements

*  Transfer to a small community college or branch campus and again focus more on my ventures

*  Drop out and wing it and hope I succeed within a year and if I don't resign to going back to school

I know none of you really know my situation but I'm so lost and stressed out and I need help, if anyone wants to talk to me outside of this post, feel free to DM me. I appreciate all of you looking at this and helping!"

I have the opportunity to stay an extra semester (in addition to 2 summer courses) to obtain the BS in CSE if I so choose.

As I keep applying to jobs, I see that almost half of them seem to require a ""BS in Computer Science."" If I chose to graduate now with a BA, am I screwed?

* No internships

* No work experience in any tech-related field.

* Around a 3.0 GPA as long as I get mostly A's this semester.

* Average personal/ school projects.

So... The managers at my company are incompetent. I work at a Fortune 500 company's smaller division in the Caribbean, and frankly... I'm shocked they still have a job at this point. My boss and the HR manager in particular.

I've saved my boss's ass countless times. Remember how with Windows Server, if your license expires you have to re-arm it, right? 60 days? Three times? 

My boss forgot he did it three times already, the server was completely locked up and kept shutting down every few minutes, with our 50+ employees wondering why the fuck accessing our file server has become impossible.
This happened... in the first week of the job.

Or how water kept dripping from the server room AC, started leaking into the rug. He got scolded by the finances manager for not going through the proper maintenance. He then started to bitch with the procurement manager of how bitchy the finances manager is. Oh, by the way, I had to wait an hour and a half for my boss to get to the office and I had to call up the building's janitors so they would help dry the computer room and floor. Oh, and he called me a drama queen for being concerned about any equipment being possibly harmed due to this incident. 

Also, they're pretty gossipy. My own boss started talking about how the HR manager ended up overspending her company credit card just because she wanted the new iPhone. Yep.

Speaking of which... The HR manager! After ten whole months of radio silence, the manager just straight up tells me that if I don't work 20 hours (was working 16 as per the job offer I received) I'll be fired. Yes. Fired. Because I was working less than other interns (who have already graduated and can work full time anyway and also have a car to make it safely to their homes), and my boss has lately been soooo busy he can't handle all the work alone; which is bullshit, why didn't he ask for help? I always offered to help with something but then he would also refuse. I still do once in a while but not as fervently as before because I know he'll say no. I'm just coding some C# stuff and do some assignments to kill time because I feel painfully mediocre by being paid to do nothing. 

By the way.. During that reunion, my boss even started pushing that he thought I had to work 28 hours and not 20. Fucking... 28. When I have 4 classes in a row Mondays and Wednesdays and the office is closed for weekends. 28. Fucking. Hours.

I'm really fed up, but I'm being paid 10 bucks an hour, I haven't been able to get replies back from other companies, and the commute is convenient.  

Sorry again for the wall of text, but I'm just ranting here. Do you think I'm being whiny or something? These are practices I consider highly unethical and unprofessional, which is just flat out infuriating to me. Thanks for reading this far if you have."

Problem is all I have is business casual (Khaki pants, dress shirts) or t-shirt and jeans.  It's a free magazine and most people that work there will be college interns, so I want to fit in.  What should I wear to the interview?  I can wear my typical nerdy (think regular IT clothing) or could I wear a nice T shirt and  pair of jeans?  I had a previous interview for a creative director internship at a company and I wore the business causal stuff and felt over dressed, especially since everyone was wearing t-shirt and jeans. I didn't get the job despite being over qualified.  

Would a nice, plain t-shirt and jeans be too casual?   Or should I wear my khakis and dress shirt?"

However I am thinking of, and think I have a good chance at a Stanford MSCS. However with an internship only and an MS in data Science, I wonder if I am more interested in studying CS further or going the MBA route down the line. 

I think right now, I prefer a harder position coding, for at least 2 years, over something like a consulting gig, and I hate traveling. Goign to a top MSCS seems just as fiscally sound as an MBA for initial earning potential. However manyleadership positions seem to require an MBA (although I feel less so as the future goes on especially in the tech sector, which is where I want to be). Many recent product managers I've noticed have no MBA experience.

The minus of the MSCS is I'm 28 and am pretty tired of school to be frank. I rather be financially independent from my parents, sooner than later. I also have to prepare stringently for interviews at larger companies

For an MBA I feel like I would be a lot older by then. I also don't see how fiscally it makes a lot of sense in tech, your income isn't that much more as a Harvard MBA than it is as a Google swe"

I have 2 offers of year-long internships. I don't know which to take, there are pros and cons of both. It's not a bad decision to be making by any means but a tough one. I'm currently a second year student at a fairly prestigious UK university studying Computer Science. I've never had a proper software job before.

Internship 1

1. Massive company, not big 4 but not far off. Over 300k employees.
2. £16.5k for the year
3. About an hours commute from where I would live
4. Half an hours drive from a major city I have only visited, no contacts there
5. Higher living cost than where I attend university

Internship 2

1. Small - mid size Bespoke Software firm, 2 UK offices. About 100 employees.
2. £18k a year
3. Slightly shorter commute
4. In the city I am attending university at
5. One of my best friends also has an offer here, so I could live with him

I'd appreciate hearing what you think. I think 1 has better long term prospects but 2 might be better in the short run.

EDIT: Both internships sound really enjoyable. 1 sounds slightly more enjoyable than 2.

I'm currently a freshman in University and I have a 2 weeks-ish break coming up (reading week) and I was wondering if you guys have any advice on how I should utilise that time as to increase my chances at landing a solid internship and/or bettering my resume.

I'm currently fluent in HTML, CSS and JS. I also know some nodejs and python. Which direction do you think I should be moving right now?

Here's a bunch of options that come to mind,

1. Finish up a NodeJS dev course I'm doing (covers a lot of node, including mongo and some authentication/socket.io stuff -- is nodejs ""worth"" it anymore? afaik not a lot of companies even use node -- side question : what's a good backend/server language/framework to learn)

2. Start learning React (not sure if I want to stick with front-end stuff though -- might make me more employable as a full stack tho?)

3. Explore more python and learn some data science concepts (though I don't know much atm, It sounds really interesting!)

Whichever path I choose I want to end up building a small project to keep me motivated/showcase my learning. 

Do you have any suggestions on which path I should take or completely different paths I might have not thought about? 

P.S - My University also has a co-op program (waterloo) so increasing employability is a factor too -- along with learning ofc.


Thanks!"

I am currently living in NZ but I am very determined to do an Internship in the US I have finished my first year of software engineering and start my second in one week. I am wondering if I should start applying for internships already or wait till I finish my second year. My current skills are:

Python (From uni papers)
HTML (self-taught)
Java (self-taught)
Swift (self-taught)

I have also worked on a rather big project that I got paid for this summer. I built an app for an art trust in New Zealand and learnt Swift and Java from making these two apps. 

I am concerned I am not skilled enough for a internship as many of them ask for:

C/C++ Skills
SQL Database Skills
Ect

As part of my papers this year I will be learning Java &amp; C should I hold off applying until I have finished these papers?


What are your thoughts?

I've done a decent bit of computational physics research to the point where I've published work. In the process, I've discovered that I really enjoy the data analysis part of the work. Given that I have a relatively strong background in analytical work/mathematics/computation, I'm interested in getting started on the data science career path. 

From what I've learned, it seems that data scientists have a whole laundry list of skills/tools they are expected to know in order to be competitive in the job market. It seems that learning all of them would be impossible for all but the most dedicated autodidacts. In my mind, the best way to learn them would be to get exposed to them over time while working in the industry. 

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what would be the right path to take where the focus would be on future growth and development towards a career as a data scientist. Would it be best to try to get an entry level data analyst position? Or would something like a software engineering position be more applicable? Perhaps an internship that's more focused towards that kind of work? Would it be fruitful to instead go for a PhD in Physics before trying to get into the industry (something I've strongly considering in the past)? 

I worry that I could get stuck in a position where I'm just doing relatively straightforward plotting/analysis in Excel for a company that has no interest in more sophisticated techniques and it would be a dead end. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated."

I'm a junior in college, and I just decided half a year ago that I wanted to have a career in software development. My school's CS program takes a minimum of 3.5 years, so I decided to go with IT, which would let me graduate in a more reasonable amount of time. I'm not the greatest programmer by any means, but I don't think I'm bad. I basically taught myself everything I know, so I didn't have any formal education until this year. 

I'm just really stressed because I know that when I look for a job, I'll be competing with my peers who have tons of more experience and formal cs education than me :(. I can do easy/medium leetcode questions, and I have some ok-ish projects on my resume, but obviously no internships. I'm really burned out because I've been trying to catch up to cs people in my year who've taken classes like compilers, operating systems, and algorithms. Which were things I didn't really focus too much on when programming was just a hobby for me. I've been reading all the textbooks and doing the homework on top of my own homework and it's just been too much for me. It feels like I'm cramming 2+ years of stuff into 4 months.

What can I do? I was thinking about adding a double major so I could stay longer in school and prepare myself more before finding a job or at least getting an internship first. The thing is, even if I do miraculously land a job, I'll probably have no idea what I'm doing :(. Should I consider doing the cs program even thought I'll be in college for 7 years? :("

Of course, because the universe is cruel, I've come down with the flu a few weeks after starting my new job. I started feeling sick on Thursday, went to work on Friday and assumed I would just start feeling better over the weekend. Instead I got worse and I went to the doctor on Sunday, one rapid-flu test later and I've got a Influenza B diagnosis (and yes, I had the flu shot) and have been told to stay home until my symptoms are gone. The doctor gave me a note stating that I should be home until at least the 16th, but did tells me that there was a possibility that I could come back to work on the 15th.

Fast forward to the 15th, and while I am feeling better than I was I'm still coughing all over everything and running a light fever, so I made the call to stay home. I know logically that this was the right thing to do, especially since symptoms = contagious and my doctor said that I would most likely return on the 16th, but I am feeling so incredibly guilty about not going to work. Before going into teaching, I often worked jobs where bosses expected that you showed up to work no matter how sick you were and it's hard to step away from that mentality. I just feel like I'm letting the school/students down by being home for so long, even though it's the right medical decision. Today extra sucks because I feel well enough that I know that in previous jobs I would have been pressured to come in (despite the contagious factor).

No one from my administration has been pressuring me, and I'm lucky that it's early enough in the semester that I'm not doing any collaborative lessons with classroom teachers. I do have student interns, but I was able to get them instructions about what they should be doing while I'm out. I'll have to restore order to the library when I'm back (I don't want to even think about how many kids are eating in the space because I'm not there...), but my absence now is not super disruptive to lessons/teaching. I just hate that I've missed so much work, and I really feel guilty about being home sick. I'm going back tomorrow for sure, but I just feel horrible for taking this time off.

Any thoughts on dealing with sickness guilt, especially when it's related to the flu?   "

Here's my story. I just turned 24 a couple of months ago.

I graduated after spring semester of 2015 with a B.S. in Business with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in Sociology. It was either get the minor or have to do a thematic sequence. I chose the minor because I already had met many of the requirements through taking general education requirements so I went for it.

The summer after college I continued to run my small business I got into before my freshman year of college. It's under the table but it's basically farm work where I go and set up at my own location selling fresh crops. The farm is great I love doing every second of what I do. The money is great for basically 4 months out of the year. Because of this I was not able to intern in the summer but it was either do this or me parents pay for college. As a first one to attend college I wasn't about to foot them a huge bill and put them in debt when I got this opportunity to pay it myself. It basically fell in my lap had a family member who was well connected to this farm and got me a spot of my own. I feel like I learned more doing that then I actually did in college minus having to do team project work. If it was an all year round thing I would keep going with it. Using this money I made I did not owe one cent after college and had it all paid off. I was smart and had a cheap tuition for 3 years at a smaller campus and I transferred my last year to finish up a 4 year degree. Also lived at home still currently do.

So here is where things start to go bad. I started looking when it ended in September and while I was looking found a retail seasonal job that got me from November through the end of the year. After that finished up I have a family member that goes ill starting in January. This family members dad passed away from the exact same thing this family member was going through. Was completely crushed and I think that began my downward spiral I face currently. From about January to April I was there helping my family member get better job was not on my mind at this point I just wanted to be around to help in this recovery. Its resolved now and everything is fine.

So come May and I basically at this point am already a year set back. I decided to keep working the summer job again. I had the idea of passing it on to my younger sibling anyways and I had the opportunity to help them establish the connections and basically train them and watch over them so they could learn how to run it on their own. That ended up working out good and it was the best year of selling yet.

It ended in September and I still find myself with no job yet. Since September of this past year I have been searching and sending in so much. Have been rejected so many times I can't count it now. Was so close in an interview a few weeks ago and when they decided not to hire me and move with someone internally it was crushing even though they said they were very impressed with me.  I go through the main big ones Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn, SimplyHired, Craigslist.  Also applied through company websites I was interested in.  No luck still.  Have had a talk with an Alumni relations person that helped me fix my resume and cover letter and while I have had a little better luck after that still hasn't resulted in anything.  I'm a first ever in my family college student so I wish I also knew better and was able to get some better guidance when I graduated.

So in summary this is what I look like since college.

May 2015 graduation received diploma in June 2015

June 2015-September 2015 summer gig

November 2015-December 2015 seasonal job

January 2016-April 2016 sick family member

June 2016-September 2016 summer job 

September 2016-Present job searching

Everything I have said above is the truth and I would never lie about anything. I know employers are not supposed to feel pity for you and I don't expect pity but I'm kind of lost in a rut right now. Anxiety has plagued me for awhile in my life and I finally started getting treatment for it 3 years ago. Now with being in job search mode I have become extremely depressed the last 2 weeks since I got rejected from my last interview. At the point where I'm having trouble sleeping constantly waking up at night and this is all I think about everyday is finding and applying for openings. My appetite has also suffered recently as well. My graduation gap did not come up in any of my interviews and screenings thus far but I worry that I will have to face it in an interview eventually. What do I say about it? I can keep working at my summer job every year to help me cover gaps to say I have not been completely doing nothing but it's not something I can keep doing forever.

I also have a long weekend getaway I have booked at the end of March with my family for 5 days hoping that is going to reinvogorate me but in the mean time I keep looking everyday hoping I strike something. I have someone I know that I plan on reaching out to a few weeks before I go out of town and see if he could help me get on at his place. It would basically be a retail part time position but it's with a great company that has opportunities for advancement later on.  That's how he started. At this point I will take anything I can get. I'm not expecting the world with my first job I just want something to get me out of my current situation. I'm lucky to have the support of my family all around me the way I do right now while I'm trying to get on my feet. I don't have any plans to look out of town for jobs because I don't want to leave all of my family. I know that limits me but I'm just not that kind of person that can do that.

 Thanks for hearing me out on this I know it was really long. I just am hurting right now going through a tough time. Being winter also its made my anxiety worse. I also wonder if it would be beneficial for me to get an appointment with my Doctor and discuss what is currently going on with my depression I've been experiencing recently.  I'm not suicidal at all or anything that serious I'm just having trouble with appetite, sleep, and the cold weather.   Any advice would be welcome I know I might hear something rough.

Edit also will note financially my savings are ok right now I'm not struggling paying for stuff and my parents let me stay at home with no rent however when I get something I will absolutely start giving them some money. I have no debt from school I paid it all out of pocket working my good summer job and being frugal with my money. I still am don't overspend and I literally only shop at thrift stores most of the time. My parents own the home no mortgage it was the home my dad grew up in so they don't have any debt either.  I truly am lucky my grandparents are right across the street as well and my family all has strong love for each other.

Right now I basically just look for jobs do housework and do odd jobs usually once a week or so to help keep me busy but I just want something of my own. I thought I was so close with this interview a couple weeks ago and when it got yanked out it underneath me it was a gut punch."

5u9sb5,1,2017-02-15,Would you accept an internship that has you wearing many hats?,CSStudent5454,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5u9sb5/would_you_accept_an_internship_that_has_you/,"So I'm happy to say that I received an offer from a local company for an internship opportunity, but I'm still on the fence about what would be most beneficial for me. I have the opportunity to work during this semester part time with a flexible schedule that works with my school hours and this would carry on to full time work in the summer.

What I'm most concerned about is a lack of pure focus on software development a majority of the time as I would be tasked with multiple duties. My responsibilities would include, but not limited to:

* Software development
* Web Development (Front and back end AFAIK)
* Help desk-related work with users
* Programming with an Arduino

While I really like the diversity, I feel as though a primary focus on software development would be much more beneficial to me over the summer. My would-be mentor is a very busy person and may not be available to help a good amount of the time, which somewhat concerns me. Would it be okay to discuss this with them before accepting the role? Or could I possibly accept the part time work for now, but state that if I feel this isn't a good fit for me over time, I move onto something else?

I don't want to waste anybody's time by making them think that I'm guaranteed to be there past the semester if a more suitable opportunity comes up. Or am I really just overthinking this whole thing and accept the role?"

After fighting through such condition, I pushed myself to at least get a part time job on december 2016 as a part time sales associate at retail store after wasting time miserably for 6 month just to pay off my student loan while living with my parents (the depression is still lingering). I really don't know what I'm passionate about but I'm thinking about getting a full time office job of sort at least while learning online to work on my skills possibly.

1. Is there some sort of office job that don't really require much experience? I'm really getting tired of dealing with customers so I'd rather work on computers instead.

2. I did some senior design project before graduation but my team members ended up taking care of it mostly (I helped out with researching, managing..etc) and I don't think I even understand the project even though I was part of it. Should I still put it on my resume? I'm just scared of how I should show that I actually did make contribution.

3. The first month after training as part time sales associate, I was chosen as employee of the month for hard work, coming even on unscheduled days. Should I put this in my resume? Not sure if it'll look good."

I'm having trouble breaking through what seems like a glass ceiling in my programming skills. It seems as though I'm only able to do the easier things in python such as the beginner tutorials. I made it through the entire codeacademy course a few years back as well as an introductory python course in Udacity but I honestly don't think I've improved much since then. I currently work with a company(internship) that has me using python but I've mostly just been making small scripts here and there(&lt;100 lines) that the senior developer asked for. The senior developer has definitely been doing the heavy lifting on our project for the two years till about now. They recently hired on this new guy and he has easily gotten an understanding of all the stuff I did as well as the more advanced concepts and is pushing the project forward in a way that the senior developer did after only 2 months.This as you know makes me very nervous about my job security.

 I am working on a side project currently that involves a countdown clock from 20hrs (since it take 20 hrs to get good at anything according to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB6K60mkmho) but the program is in my opinion too simple. I simply want to become good enough to the point where I can be able to look at other places for employment when I graduate.

I'm interested in Data Science/Machine Learning, and though I don't have too much exposure with Machine Learning (yet), I'm hoping to gain more experience with it this summer.

I have internship offers from The New York Times, [iCIMS](https://www.icims.com), and Southwest Airlines.

**New York Times** 
Data Engineering internship, pretty great salary, puts me in New York City. 
Won't give me exact exposure to Machine Learning, but I'll definitely get more experience with Big Data, Python, Spark, and using/managing large data sets. I could also learn different Machine Learning techniques/algorithms in my free time, and possible try them out on NYT's data set (with my manager's approval). 
I loved living in NYC last summer at my old internship, and would love to live there again.

**iCIMS**
Data Science/Machine Learning internship (more of what I'm looking for) with decent salary and few expenses, as I'll be commuting from home in NJ, which I don't mind too much.
I'll gain much more experience with using R to analyze/find out trends in the job market, but iCIMS is also kind of a small company and doesn't have the name of NY Times.

**Southwest Airlines**
No idea what team I could be assigned to; I'll only find out once I've signed on for the summer. 
It'll be in Dallas with a salary that's decent for the city, but I'll have free flights that I can use on the weekend, which sounds awesome. It also has a relatively big name, and I wouldn't mind exploring Dallas.

Does anyone have advice on which internship I should choose? Or about the culture/life at any of those companies?

So I chose to go to Clarkson University for engineering. That didn't pan out after my first year and I switched to Computer Science, where I learned basic C++ programming but not much else. I've actually had to go to the Communications department for exposure to Javascript/HTML/CSS etc. meanwhile I'm required to take a bunch of theory classes to get a CS degree.

It turns out I've learned more through internships and reddit/stackoverflow that I've really learned in school, and I'm having trouble searching for jobs because most of the companies that come here aren't looking for software engineers/developers/CS majors.

I'm on my 4th year here, 3rd year in CS, so it's a bit late to change schools. I actually want to finish here to get the name recognition on the degree, but it's troubling when I attend the career fair and most of the recruiters say ""We didn't come here to recruit for that, but we can try to pass you on to our IT department"" and never hear anything or the software engineering positions that are available are oriented toward whatever products they're manufacturing.

Then the companies that do come here that are techy (IBM and GE) have rigorous hiring processes and strict GPA cutoffs.

**TL;DR:** I'm looking for software engineering internships that have are software engineering but with a web app/mobile app/development feel or that are companies that feel more like tech companies and I'm having a hard time finding that through my school, let alone getting that kind of experience out of my classes. What are some good places to hunt for these kinds of internships??? 

I feel like I'm looking for silicon valley-type companies that are just on a smaller scale. I know they exist but they seem so hard to find.

Edit: okay ""famous"" was an overstatement. I see that now. The people who work for my university are just really good at promoting themselves and I bought into it...."

My first semester, when I was rushing a fraternity, and while tailgating (read: drinking) before a football game I was encouraged (read: forced) to drink a solo cup full of vodka. Unsurprisingly, I blacked out; next thing I know, I had escorted out of the stadium and a campus police officer had my fake ID. I was put on disciplinary probation for that.

My second semester, I failed a writing class that was required to gain sophomore standing, so I was put on academic probation over the summer while I took a class to fulfill that requirement.

My third semester, a professor in my Intro French class accused me of plagiarizing part of a 300-word assignment. He thought that the writing quality was too high for someone just starting out learning French. The assignment was to write a short description of a celebrity, I chose someone and looked them up on Wikipedia (both in English and French). As it turns out, two simple sentences in the assignment ended up being the same as in the Wikipedia article—one said the person was a singer-songwriter and the other listed a few awards they had won—and the honor council found me guilty of plagiarism and failed me in the course. As a result, I didn't have enough credits for the semester (there is a requirement to complete 12 credits in a semester) so I was placed on academic probation again.

I am not sure how to explain this on applications for jobs or internships that ask about disciplinary and administrative action. How should I go about doing that?"

I wasn't able to get a good internship for the summer, so I'm going to be taking classes this summer.

Due to my situation with classes and credits, I have a few choices:


1. Graduate in a total of 3 years, do the ECE BS/MS and get out in 4 years. I like this option since I'll be spending the least amount of money (I am OOS) and effort.
2. Graduate in 4 years, by adding a CS Minor. Followed by grad school, potentially at GT or a school ""better"" than GT. I like this option too, but I'm not sure how likely I am to get in to a really good school. I do feel like I need 4 years at GT to have a competitive application.

So basically, it comes down to if doing the ECE BS/MS is worth it, how much better other schools are over GT (does it justify the extra cost?), and if it really makes a difference.

I'd really appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance."

I'm currently living at home rent free (agreement with my dad) and I'm moving out for the first time in a little bit because of an engineering internship! (16 months long) I will be able to move back in when the internship is over to finish off school. 

I have seen the general 50/30/20 rule for essentials, recreation and savings. My question for you guys is that how do you think it should change if the company running this internship is paying for all of my rent, utilities, cable and internet? I would only be responsible for my cell phone. ($70/month)

I would like to be saving at the very least, 10k if not more, for school the next year as I still have to go back for one last year.

Salary for 12 months: $40,000 ($19.23/hr) with chance of overtime.

Current finances: $500 cash, $6,750 in mutual funds (Will be going towards buying a car), no debt whatsoever.

I am a freshman electrical engineer/CS double major at a decent state university and have recently been notified that I am going to have an internship offer (letter of intent/pending offer) from a fairly well-known national company and I have a few questions.

I live on the east coast and the position I got is in Baltimore, which is quite a few hours away. The internship isn't for an extremely notable CS company, but definitely a name (or names of competitors) mentioned on this sub from time to time. I was wondering what the likelyhood of being sponsored for housing in the definite event I would be relocating. Also, how would I travel to and from the place of work?

Also, although the position was strictly for a location in Maryland, during my interview, the interviewers mentioned I'd be considered for other campuses, as well. As a result, I applied to similar intern positions in another location, but the way the company is structured, hiring is almost definitely separate, because my interviewers said that each division has primary HQ/focus on certain areas. As a freshman, the way I got the job (random email from a student networking site) makes me feel as if the realistic position was limited to Baltimore, but I am curious if anyone thinks I could try to see about leveraging for the different location (family in that area).

Other than that, I am curious about what I should know if drug tests and background checks are involved. Any advice/suggestions or related experience is definitely welcome.

Thank you for your time!"

I'll keep this pretty short because I tried to get advice last time and it didn't really pan out.

I'm a 20 year old female who goes to a high-tier university in the U.S. I'm in business school but my goal is to switch to econ and work in international development at an institution like World Bank.

Unfortunately, I've had some rough times and trauma and I'm worried that I'm screwed for life because of it.

1. Freshman year, I had trouble fitting in and became really depressed. I ended up writing a suicide note and leaving my dorm to end things. During this time I was reported missing and all the details were on the news, both on TV and in dozons of articles. However, I got lots of notifications and messages and saw the damage that going through with it would do, so I decided to come back. Unfortunately, although I got kind messages of encouragement of support on my phone, they weren't matched in real life. The administration tried to force me into a medical leave (which I refused after much struggle, including having to voluntarily stay in a mental hospital for a week to ease their concerns as well as write an apology essay.) I knew it was a subtle way to get rid of me, so I didn't take the bait, because I would've never been able to come back. I continued my studies and I'm glad I did, but most of the student body stopped talking to me, for reasons I don't understand. I don't think that my experience makes me a bad person or someone scummy, but that's how I've been made to feel. Perhaps they felt awkward, or perhaps it wasn't personal, just a matter of social liability. But either way, it's been a year and to this day, I have few friends and all this shit is still online, linked to my name. I had a really nice boyfriend this fall who accepted me and told me he was committed for the long haul, but then he abruptly dumped me a few weeks ago. This was not encouraging, and I feel like he's almost a metaphorical representation of society's reluctance to accept me for too long. 

2. I was taking a test a few weeks ago and went to the bathroom. In the bathroom, I ended up getting into a conversation that included one topic on the test. The dean walked in and gave me an honor code violation. I suspect this is connected to bitterness about the rejection of the medical leave proposal, but I have no proof of that so I can't raise the issue to them.

3. My grades suffered immensely during that time and afterwards. I have a 3.0 (low for me, considering I had straight A's before) but my transcript is a mess of selective withdrawals. My grades are falling again because I struggle with self esteem and hope. I feel like I could have straight A's and not get a respectable background-checked job because of what happened last year as well as the honor code violation, so it's hard to feel excited for my future. I feel like my identity and name are tarnished, so there's no way for me to really win in the industries I care about. It's hard for people to invest in you if you're linked to stigma. I'm crazy, I'm a risk, I'm a cheater...you name it, the associations are there, etched in writing. And I just don't know how to reclaim my identity and future. 

My teachers have called me intelligent, innovative, and articulate. In my classes, I'm always leading the discussions, and in the internship I had before this stuff happened, I initiated all kinds of research projects that unfortunately were credited to my superiors. But I feel like all the talents I have are a waste, because my identity and reputation were ruined. I want to contribute to positive change in the world and be a high-level professional with international influence, but I'm worried that a lot of avenues are closed to me now.

I absolutely love philosophy, social analysis, economics, and anything developmental. I'd love to be a project manager at a bank, lead an NGO, be a world leader/social analyst, or be a professor at a high-level university. But when I think of my future interviews and applications, all I see is unanswered calls or, if I'm lucky, scrutinizing questions. I don't want my life to be over because of things that happened when I was 19 years old. But I just don't know how to rise past all the red flags. What do I do to make sure my potential isn't wasted?"

Im a junior with prior internship experience at a small start up, competitive skills, and Im confident I have the qualifications etc... yet still so few companies have even responded to my applications. 

That being said, will it be different when I start applying for full-time jobs? Is it possible that the lack of responses are because there is  less urgency and incentive for a company to hire interns? When there is a job posting (full-time) , and I apply, is there more likely to be a quicker response because theres more necessity for the company to fill the open position?

5uhcif,1,2017-02-16,How can I move from IT support to web development or devops? (xpost from r/cscareerquestions),d0ntreadthis,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5uhcif/how_can_i_move_from_it_support_to_web_development/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I'm 20 and have been doing 1st/2nd line IT Support full time for almost 4 years.

I live in the UK and have 11 GCSEs A*-C. Apart from an A in maths the rest of my grades are very average. I started working straight after secondary school so I have no higher education. I just have a couple of IT certifications.

I never particularly wanted to do IT support, it just kind of happened. I've realised I want to become a developer. How can I go about getting my food in the door?

Here's an outline of my experience so far:

* I'm pretty confident with git commands and the workflow. I've contributed documentation and small fixes to open source projects on github.
* I'm currently building a React app with a few people, so I have a bit of experience developing within a team.
* I've created my own React app which is still in development (I can provide a link if anyone needs it) which is hosted on Heroku. I've also had to set up a web server on a digitalocean vps before.
* I've made a couple of chromium extensions
* I'm OK with Python. It was my first language and I have used it to get some very time consuming, repetitive tasks done at my current company. I've also got a bit of experience using C.
* I've made a python cookiecutter for using Django with React
* I think I'm decent at communicating ideas and concepts

I would ideally like to get a development job by the end of the year, and it seems like web development is the obvious route for me.

Do you think the above experience make up for my lack of education? How can I stand out among the people who have similar experience + a degree + a relevant internship? Should I quit my job and take a few months to learn additional skills (living at home right now, so I can take this risk)? Currently I can only program during quiet periods at work, on weekday evenings for an hour, and anytime on weekends.

I'm perfectly happy with taking a paycut to get my foot in the door, and I've been looking for jobs all over the country rather than restricting myself to my city (since I'm interested in relocating anyway).

TL;DR: I've been working IT support for 4 years. I want to switch to web dev but have no education past secondary school (high school equivalent I think). What can I do to start getting responses from recruiters and land an interview among people who have higher education and internships?"

I was planning on graduating next May, but I think if I overloaded my schedule I could finish in one more semester.

I reached out and explained my situation, and my recruiter said we can talk on Monday about my options, and that I could transition to an internship instead if that works better.

I'm sure my recruiter is familiar with these situations but I want to be prepared for the call, so what are some of my options? Is it better to take the internship and then just apply next year, or figure out how to make this work? For the record I'm not sure how my application got mixed up."

I joined the startup for a low salary (compared to other offers) b/c the company was co-founded by someone I respected and had worked with previously, and I figured it'd be good to get in on the ground floor with some stake and try to build it with this guy. I also hadn't enjoyed the corporate environment at my internships.

Fast forward to now, and I'm not very satisfied with my decision. The work's not particularly interesting, the guy who I originally joined for backed out of the company due to personal issues 6 months in, and growth prospects don't look as good as they did previously. I could almost certainly secure a new job in the area for ~105, a big starting bonus, and full benefits, and have been debating doing just that. But, I've come to learn over the past year that I really hate working *for* people. Not that I'm micromanaged or anything (in fact I'm probably managed too little), but I really want to be able to fully pick my projects and hours (preferably 8pm - 4am).

I've got a few ideas for startups I could venture out with myself, but that is of course very risky (especially considering I have a mortgage and only around year in livable savings). I've also been looking into freelancing/contracting, but I don't think I have enough connections to get far with that too soon. I'm really interested to get some advice or outside opinions on how I might proceed.

Should I stick with the startup for a while longer to save up more then start on my own? Plan to stay at the startup more permanently and work for it to grow (and maybe ask for a raise)? Jump to another company for more pay, but still likely be unsatisfied by the job? Quit now and pursue my ideas at high risk? Or something else?

I've been mulling it over in my head for a few weeks and there has to be some kind of change soon (either actual or just in my mental state). Would love to hear any and all thoughts."

I'm a soon-to-be new grad from a decently respected school, looking for dev jobs primarily in silicon valley or LA. I did an internship at a small startup in Mountain View last summer, and while I definitely enjoyed a lot of the perks, I was turned off by the very insular social scene and apparent need to ""drink the kool-aid"" and mold myself into the company's culture. 

To elaborate on the social scene, I had the distinct feeling that most of my full-time coworkers had very few friends outside of the company, and not much time to spend with them. Many of my coworkers shared apartments together, and it seemed that the majority of their social lives revolved around company events. In a word, it all seemed a bit lonely. Personally, I felt like a bit of an outsider because I was not enthusiastic about molding my whole life around my place of work.

I'm wondering if this is typical for start-ups/larger companies in SV. Do most of them expect/implicitly pressure their workers to have their lives revolve around the job? I understand that a job is a job, but it seems strange to me how these startups become integrated into every part of your life. If this isn't the case everywhere, how can I got about determining that before accepting a job offer? Obviously, any company will focus on its strong points while recruiting.

5un0ev,4,2017-02-17,Is this job salvageable?,dlzebub,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5un0ev/is_this_job_salvageable/,"I started working for my current employer three years ago as an intern (brand new to the industry). Just over a year ago I determined I was no longer doing intern level work and was expected to deliver, and was delivering, work similar to my non-intern co-workers. So I researched my skills and determined I was making far below the market (Internet and people I know in other companies, fellow co-workers). 

I compiled a document highlighting how I had advanced, the skills I had acquired and my achievements. I had also interviewed and while I didn't get those jobs, they somewhat confirmed my research. I schedule a meeting with our director and presented my findings and requested a raise. A _big_ one. Seventy-eight percent. 

He respectfully declined on the basis it was a) not the appropriate time b) too much and c) i needed to display better improvement. About that last item. There was a several month period where I was under very poor leadership and my name was unfortunately tarnished. Everyone, including the director, believed that leadership contributed to issues I was having. Said person was moved to another team, I under different leadership and explicitely told my internship was being extended due to no fault of my own, but as a result of a change in leadership. I was informed later I was almost let go during that time, but given a second opportunity in light of prior leadership.

Back to the present. Since then, I have been passed over for raises, cost of living increases and even a raise reflecting my current responsibilities _and_ the documented deliverables. I am going on three years and have had **zero** increase of any kind.

Having spoken with various friends in the same industry, they believe I suffered a damning blow to my reputation and I simply will be unable to shake it; that I would need to virtually be a rockstar to compensate for the past--whether it's a correct assessment of me or not. Of those I've spoken to, it seems split on the significant pay difference. Everyone agrees (they are all in the same industry) I am being paid far below what my skill set is, what I'm asked to do and what I'm delivering. Some say if the company wanted to increase my pay they could make it happen. Others say the director is correct in saying my initial low pay prevents the leap to where I might otherwise be (if hiring on now).

I'm inclined to believe any pay increase will require a lateral move elsewhere. So far I've been unsuccessful with other opportunities (interviews, but nothing beyond that).

I appreciate any other thoughts people have."
5unk75,12,2017-02-17,How do you find jobs you're qualified for in your field when they are so diluted on job boards?,returnthebomb1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5unk75/how_do_you_find_jobs_youre_qualified_for_in_your/,"I definitely feel like there are some nicely written articles out there I just couldn't find any. 

I've been working at a job for 5 years now doing high level software support. I'm the best at what I do out of my 20 co-works not only with quality of work but with quantity as well. I feel like I have reached a true ceiling for this position. Not a personal ceiling but an actual ceiling for the responsibilities we're assigned. I started as an intern and now I am a sr. meaning I cant climb any higher in the group I'm in without a team leader leaving the company. This really seems unlikely at this point unless I want to wait for 5+ years.

I decided with all that in mind I want to go look for jobs at other companies in my industry. I have an expertise with EMV(chip cards) which should in theory be a hot skill set right now given the financial institutions liability shift. When I go look at job boards for company I respect I can never find anything that even remotely sounds like something I would be qualified to do. I would love to be a product manager or manager of any support organization and I definitely think I have the experience and mind for it. 

So my question is: What is the best way to find jobs postings that would be considered an upgrade from the one you have? I feel like I am just stuck waiting for my current company to have an opening instead of proactively seizing opportunities across the entire industry. I'm also not willing to move so this really really limits my prospects. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"
5uno49,6,2017-02-17,Woman Computer Engineer Advice,[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/5uno49/woman_computer_engineer_advice/,"Hi everyone! I am currently working towards getting my Computer Engineering bachelors degree at the university I go to and as I run into fellow peers that are majoring in Engineering, their common question is, what do you want to do with your degree? 

That question always stumps me. I honestly have no idea and I'm scared to face the real world. 

This is what I do know: 

- My dad (and his brothers) graduated from Purdue Univ. with an Electrical Engineering degree and has worked on multiple space flights with NASA back in the 1980s. I have always been interested in what he has accomplished in his days of engineering, he knows how to fix practically anything and I've always admired that. Growing up, him and I have always had a special connection because I was the one that watched Sci-fi with him and actually liked them, and I knew how to use technology while my 2 older sisters don't even know what a WiFi router looks like. Based on that, I recently decided to follow the footsteps of my dad and get an Engineering degree. I picked Computer Eng. because the hardware aspect of computers interests me. 

- I just transferred from a community college and right now is the first semester at a university. 

- I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do the first couple years of college and after that 2 year point,  I still didn't completely know, but I needed to pick something or stop taking classes and wasting money. I believe that CE is right for me but I'm taking my CE course right now and I'm confused with what we are covering (Clocks, Flip-Flops, Counters Adders, Comparators). I do enjoy my Engineering Physics 2 class at the moment and were just took a quiz on Kirchhoff's Rules and equivalent resistance. So I'm kind of worried that I'm in the wrong field. 

So, with that being said, I am here to ask the subscribers of this subreddit for advice on ANYTHING, literally anything! Internships, studying tips, self-improvement tips, etc.. 

Thank you and I hope you all have a great day :)


Edit: I forgot to mention that at the university I go to, the difference between a bachelors in CE and Electrical Eng. is only a 4 class difference. I've been thinking about double majoring, and if I do end up doing that, should I take classes for both degrees right now? Or get my CE degree then go for EE? Thoughts? 

Edit: Edit: It came to my attention that I put ""woman"" in the title and didn't have anything talking about women. The reason why I put it in the title is because it has been a struggle being a girl in this field of studying, for example, currently in Physics 2 I am the only girl in my lab group, and there are only two other girls in the whole class. I honestly don't mind it, it's just that I've heard people talking about women in the engineering field and it never sounds nice. I'm not going to let that stop me, because honestly I love the reaction I get whenever I tell someone I'm majoring in CE, knowing that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, woman or not, keeps me motivated.

I am 25 and have been through college and came out with a 100K loan and a full-time job.  I don't want to get into why I chose the career I chose because I want to get to the point.

I'm wondering if there's any way I can get a career in working with computers/technology.
I have no baseline knowledge of this field but I am interested in learning, so I was thinking about doing an online degree in computer science.  However, I have a friend who has a computer engineering degree but could not find a job.  I don't want to end up like that.  I've read that experience is the key into finding a job in this field, so I would have to do an internship as well.

The thing is, I'm wondering how I can do all of this while trying to maintain a full-time job of 40 hours a week.  What's the best way to go around this?

Also, the degree I have is in an unrelated field.  I live in TX, if that's important in any way.

A lot of people tell me, it's not possible to do, so if that's the case then just tell me and I'll drop it and go back to my miserable life.  Also, I don't want to quit my current job to chase after this dream I have."

I would like to stay ahead of the curve for as long as I can so I'm at an advantage against my peers when we apply for internships in year 3 so I have been reading textbooks on various topics to have that extra bit of knowledge. 

But the one thing I see here again and again is the concept of ""personal projects"". What should these projects entail? Right now as a year 1 student I only know a bit of C, which I don't see being very useful outside of programming hardware (which seems overwhelming). The dreaded algorithms &amp; data structures module is also in year 2. Should I just wait until year 2, or look into learning other languages so that I can make useful programs by that time?

When you guys were in college doing projects outside of school, how complex were they? Can you post some examples of what a potential employer would like to see (as in the source code and everything)?

Also as a side question, can you recommend something to learn that will help me throughout my course?

Here are the points I have thought through so far:


* Pay-- both seem same-ish. Snapchat is 9000/month and Tableau is 38/hour, which I think ends up being around the same. Snapchat offers $1800/month in housing, and Tableau is $1000/month. Dunno what the cost of living difference is in Seattle vs LA.


* Prestige-- not sure about this, but I think Snapchat is more ""prestigious""-- though Tableau is growing a lot from what I hear. Also, I'm not sure how important prestige is at this point in my college career-- I got interviews from all the ""Big 4"" this past semester so I am somewhat confident that I could just reach out directly to those recruiters again to get interviews, and should prioritize other factors.

* Food-- Snap gives lunch and dinner


* Location-- Seattle seems great to me-- a lot of my college friends are going there this summer, and I have family there and Vancouver. One of my teammates will be at Tableau fulltime for this summer. I don't know anyone from my college that will be in LA this summer.


* Type of Work-- I am a math major also and really like solving mathematical related problems. Tableau seems to offer that-- a lot of their teams work directly with data and incorporate statistics. If I choose Snapchat, my worry is that I get stuck on a pure programming job like Android dev which I might not enjoy as much.

* Outside of work-- Last summer, I almost exclusively did the following 3 things outside of work/with coworkers: basketball, soccer, and Smash Bros. Does anyone know if either of these companies have groups that get together to do these things?

Any help would be very very much appreciated."

5url75,3,2017-02-18,Never satisfied with any job,breeyoncewerk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5url75/never_satisfied_with_any_job/,"Hi all,

I graduated in May of last year and have worked many different jobs in that time. So far, I've hated all of them, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm the problem.

Before I graduated college I had many part-time jobs that I enjoyed: front desk work, hosting kids parties, filing paperwork in an office. Now, I'm not sure what it is - maybe the long hours - but I will go into each hated job more thoroughly.

The last semester of my senior year, I was required to complete a full time 600 hour internship (40 hours a week for 15 weeks of the semester). I chose a health bureau as I majored in public health and the internship needed to be related to my field. I quickly realized after a few weeks of being there that they had nothing for me to do, and I was getting anxious because I needed to present a final project in order to graduate. I was constantly asking for work, and even begun creating minor tasks for myself, yet I found myself staring at my computer for 8 hours a day until I could go home. Eventually, they gave me something to do: drive to a nursing home 3x a day for an hour each time, park on the street, and count the number of cars that went by...this was supposed to be for ""traffic safety,"" but it only gave me vertigo from looking back and forth at the cars. Not to mention, my boss was condescending and a total bitch. I lasted 6 weeks before switching to Planned Parenthood (the ONLY job I LOVED throughout all of this, but it only lasted until graduation).

After this, I begun a brief internship with a volunteer center over the summer. It was a temporary position and I would receive a $1,500 stipend at the end of my 8 weeks. I was an ungrateful little bitch who wanted to get paid right away and was salty about zero income, so I left after about a month to take a paid job at a music school.

I worked front desk at the music school for pretty decent money, and although I didn't like this job, I did like the people and am grateful to have lived at home and saved every penny. I worked from 2:30-9:30pm every day and was very stressed at this job. We switched to a new system, and it was very disorganized, so I dealt with a lot of angry parents and tons of phone calls. This was much different than the kids party place because of the organization differences and less structure. Mostly I just didn't like the hours and the fact that I wasn't allowed to get up to use the bathroom or eat anything at ALL while I was there, causing me to be starving and eat a full dinner at 10 pm when I got home, which then caused lack of sleep.

After 3 months, I took a grant-funded position with my local hospital. I was SO excited to land this job because it was in my field and paid well. However, once again, I had no work to do (the nature of grant funding). I found myself wishing I was in bed rather than spending 40 hours a week pretending to do something. This was very unfulfilling.

I took a two week break and then moved an hour away to my college town to start a full-time job with a travel company. I thought I'd love it because I'm working with other girls my age, it's full time with benefits (finally - none of my other jobs offered these), and I could be independent. However, it doesn't pay so great considering I now have major expenses (rent, utilities, gas for a long commute, groceries, etc), and I'm now finding myself a month into the job and extremely dissatisfied. The work is hard, the pay is low, and despite my inquiry about being on the phone all day during my interview and them telling me no, I'm on the phone all day. I take about 60 back-to-back payment phone calls per day and then have to process them all, and it's mentally exhausting. My posture is suffering, but not as much as my already steadily declining mental health. I'm having a very hard time at this job and it's affecting my sleep, stress levels, happiness, and even relationships. My friend put it best: if the one thing that you do most in your life is the thing that causes you the most stress, what is your life even about? I want to leave this job, and I feel like I made a mistake by moving, but I'm stuck with the stigma of it being ""too soon.""

I was accepted to grad school for public health and have every intention to go come september. My question is, am I crazy for hating every post grad job I've held? Should I attempt to leave this one too, or does that make me weak? Should I look for another job in my new town despite little time to go on interviews or even job search (this could be difficult with making rent as well and I risk jumping into another full time position I may not like much). Should I move home, try to grab a part time job, and save for grad school? 

What is wrong with me? Is this normal?

5uspqy,3,2017-02-18,Informatics major really bad?,m_im,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/5uspqy/informatics_major_really_bad/,I would like to know if informatics is a bad major to switch into. I am unsure if I can change my major into computer science or software engineer. And i was also told that if i change into informatics i can graduate a lot faster. I am a second year student who want to graduate within the next 2-3 years after this quarter. But will having an informatics cs degree really HURT me THAT much when im doing job hunting after I graduate??? Can we please set aside the internship part and how much I know after I finish school. Will they always pick a student with Computer science over informatics degree???
5usqt5,2,2017-02-18,Options for a junior level developer that may have other responsibilities?,ScrimpyCat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5usqt5/options_for_a_junior_level_developer_that_may/,"It seems likely that my situation is going to change. That I'll be moving back to the country, where there's no local development jobs. While this wouldn't be a problem in itself (as when I previously lived this way I used to take the few hour trip into the city for work and school), the problem now is that I may have to stay back looking after family on certain days during the week.

This leads me to trying to workout what (if any) my options now may be for getting into the industry. To make matters worse, I'm only at most qualified for a junior position (as I've only had an internship previously), and even then have already found it extremely difficult to get anything (and that's whilst living in an area with thousands of opportunities). I had been applying for a little over a year and 3 months without much luck, whenever I did get interest it was always along the lines of they're actually looking for a senior at the moment but would be looking for a junior later after they've brought another senior on board. 

Currently I think possible options could be:

1. Part time positions at a local company (can take the trip down on days that I don't have to stay back). However I don't know if part time positions even exist (haven't seen them). Is there a way I could convince a full time position to accommodate/be offered as part time instead (I feel like that's unlikely though as they've identified a need for someone full time)?
2. Remote development. However I think it's very difficult to pull that off as a junior. I've tried previously for remote positions and would never even get an interview. Is there some way I could better present myself as an appropriate candidate?
3. Freelancing. Though I'm not sure if those gigs are friendlier when it comes to time? I'm also not sure if I even have the skills to pull that off. 

Not sure if there's other options or if there's actually no options given these circumstances. If there isn't anything, what can I do to make sure I have a good shot at getting something after this situation changes? At the moment I spend most of my free time (try to find a bit everyday) programming on various projects (some intended to be business related, some just for myself), but I've found none of it really matters anymore at this point, as I already have lots of project I've worked on and I don't think it's really increasing my chances anymore (as I already ticked the box of having worked on personal projects). 

Appreciate any advice people have regarding any of this. "
5usv01,3,2017-02-18,What are other positions a person with a software engineering degree can do?,pdpd9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5usv01/what_are_other_positions_a_person_with_a_software/,"I think this topic isn't talked about a lot because typically a software engineering or computer science grad go the SDE route. I was wondering, in your experience what other types of positions have you seen people with such a technical background also do? 

I'm actually a junior that will be graduating early since I overloaded on credits and now I'm second guessing everything.. I actually have a 3.86 and I have absolutely loved learning how to program, learning how to become a better programer, utilizing data structures and algorithms, and creating software. But this past year I have started to feel stressed out and I don't have that passion anymore.. you're probably thinking, ""wow, you are doing well in school.. how can you not like it anymore; that's impossible."" Well, my past internship was more project manager-y and I absolutely and irrevocably loved it. I guess you could say that I am more extraverted and I love planning and helping the team out more than anything else. So, then why not become a project manager? Well that usually is not a position for a new grad because he or she should probably work as an SDE and then work their way up. Therefore, I am trying to see what would be a great stepping stone to get to this or see what positions should I be applying for. Through research, I have seen positions like business analysts that could work, but I am not quite sure what that completely entails and I want to have a better knowledge of the possibilities out there. 



TL;DR: I am graduating with a SE degree in less than a year and I've begun to be feel unhappy with programming so I am looking for other paths I can take other than being a SDE. People change, passions change, and just because I'm good at it doesn't mean I need to be pigeon-holed. "

5utkg2,13,2017-02-18,I might be forced to drop out of university,[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/5utkg2/i_might_be_forced_to_drop_out_of_university/,"Sorry, but I feel like venting a little. This feels like a nightmare to me.

I am studying to be a social worker in Sweden. This is my fourth semester out of seven. Social work might seem like a strange choice for somebody with social phobia (not diagnosed yet), but I honestly thought that I had my social anxiety under control and that it was improving. Heck, I functioned relatively well until now. The extent of my mental health issues became clear in my current course, which includes a mandatory internship of five weeks at a welfare agency. My fourth week ended this week.

During the last four weeks, I have felt anxiety all the time. It is always related to the social aspect. I cannot concentrate as I feel like I will humiliate myself all the time. I am also very quiet; the only exception is if I feel safe with the person I am talking with. I shake, I sweat, I become dizzy and my mouth just dries up. That this is a problem eventually drew the attention of my mentor when I failed to lead and conduct a home visit. I asked one or two questions to the client, and then the ordinary case worker took charge instead. The next day (Wednesday) I had a new home visit which went better. But before that home visit, my mentor had said that she has contacted my university and will talk with the head of my department about my social fitness to become a social worker. I cried at the end of the day, right in front of my mentor. She felt so unsympathetic.

The next morning (Thursday), after having slept nothing, I told my mentor that I think that I have social phobia. She became much more supportive then. She called in her boss, who told me that he had himself had severe anxiety when he was younger, which eased my mind enormously. I called a health care centre and talked with a psychiatry nurse, who I will talk with again on Monday to get an appointment (unfortunately at the end of March.) She told me that the treatment would be cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) once I got the diagnosis.

What I fear so strongly now is that I have no idea how this will affect my education. I want to be able to move on to the next course, either by passing my current course or having it relocated to another time. What I do *not* want is to have to take a temporary leave until my social anxiety is better. I have made a few friends—*real* friends for what feels like the first time in my life—in my class who I really want to stay with. I have also postponed so much of my life already (I am 25)—including work and more intimate relationships—because of my social anxiety, insomuch I want to get done with my education and to genuinely start my life. But if I have to temporarily leave university, I would have to return for the internship in a year from now.

Everything feels like it is in shambles right now. But rationally, I understand that this is likely the beginning of something better. I can finally feel that this anxiety is not who I *really* am; it is a parasite that has latched itself onto my personality. If you have read this far, I greatly appreciate that you took your time. I feel very lonely right now and it does help to know that somebody might be listening. I also wish you all the best, especially if you also suffer from anxiety."

So I am a predicament. I recently got accepted into this 5-week VR boot camp that happens towards the end of summer. So now, I wanted to initially get something for 4 weeks before that. I applied to alot of companies for the full 12 weeks but in the end, I don't think I will get any cause I am still a freshman (lol). So one of my family members took my resume and said that they could get me a 4 week internship. Today, however, when I was talking to my mom, she said she knew a few companies that could also take me for 12 weeks full or 4 weeks. These companies are fairly well known.

I have two options:

- 5 week Internship at a company and then 5 weeks at a CS VR bootcamp
- 12 week internship at said company

Which would be more beneficial to me as a future computer scientist looking to graduate in 3 years? A new skill or more experience is what I have found this decision to be.

I am currently a 3rd year in the Statistics program at a well-know Canadian university who is really interested in a career in the computer science field. Here are a few caveats and nuances to my situation, however:

- My cumulative GPA is abysmal (~69%). Due to this, I was and am not able to internally transfer to the CS program within the university.

- I have taken the core courses required for the first 2 years of a CS major at my school and am intending to take a few more as part of electives in my current program.

- I don't have any related work experience. Currently, I am just TA'ing one CS course and have a few minor projects. 

As a junior, I will be graduating in the following year and I don't know what would be the best path I can take after that. For the past few weeks, I have been trying to apply to some CS internships to no current avail. 

My parents are keen on me pursuing some sort of a in CS (at least something with a 'CS' title), but given my grades I am not sure what school would accept me or whether or not it would be a good idea given the amount of CS courses I have already taken.

I think the only thing I am more-or-less certain about right now is that I will put my full effort into bringing up my grades as much as possible in my remaining 1.5 years, but after that, I am really not sure what options or opportunities will be available to me with regards to CS.

Any advice / recommendations / suggestions / comments are welcome! Thanks for taking the time to read this &gt;.&lt;

I had both a phone interview, and also visited their office to do a ""test"" (They gave me a sample video to put together). I worked a little too slow for their liking, so I never heard back from them...until now.

Yesterday, I got an email from the person in charge of the video production department asking how I was doing and if I'm still looking for work and wanted to verify that I had came in the office before to do their test.

Any advice on what would be the best way to word the response? Should I mention I've been working on advancing my editing skills on my own time, or should I save that for later? I don't know if they'll have me come in for another test or not.

I've been on a few more interviews since September, but haven't managed to snag any offers (Aside from an internship opportunity I was really excited about and accepted that offer, but haven't heard back from them either). I don't want to come off as desperate, even though I basically am at this point.

Its not that I don't understand it. 

It is just that I have a deep love for softwares, literally I spent countless hours everyday reading blogs on open-source technologies, browsing github for cool projects, and read on latest start-ups. 

I am a 3rd year CS undergrad at an average engineering college.
I spend almost 5-6 hours every day just reading engineering blogs, the posts on this sub-reddits, medium articles, programmers blog like codinghorror and tech news journals. Often I read about latest start-ups, then start researching about the facts and figures behind them, understanding what makes them tick and then cursing the VCs for valuing them so high :0

Though I want to start programming esp. competitive programming to strengthen my algorithms and data structure fundamentals but I just can't seem to start as my imagination betrays me and my head gets filled with product ideas and then researching  the idea on the web and exploring the competitions
then I start thinking of how my idea would address a problem that their product doesn't
then waking up to the reality of the marketing challenge I would face :/
but sometimes I get struck upon an idea and keep it filed in the back of my head and asking my close friends for their feedback.

I have been aimlessly exploring major cloud computing platforms for quite some time and have a decent exposure to AWS, DigitalOcean Droplets and Linode (I manage the college programming club website which I hosted on AWS)

Even though I tried to start learning Web Dev but I began using content management systems, tweaking them, and found myriads of scripts to do the things that I set out to do in the first place, for ex: validating forms, setting up a forum, building a subscribers list more specifically Wordpress and Moodle

I have an inherent love for setting up servers and configuring them and have spent several sleepless nights trying to make something work even though I hadn't any specific requirement for it, eg: setting up LAMP on my spare netbook even though I didn't need it for any work.
A month ago I started a computer club at my college since there wasn't any and with 3 of my friends we teach the basics of JAVA, C++ and WebDev to first year students and then direct them to online resources and motivate them to work on pet projects.
I have exactly 1 year from this day Feb 2017 to figure what to do after I finish college.

There is so much to learn- I have almost 800+ ebooks and 100+ hours video lectures from udemy, udacity, mit ocw saved on my disk and so much to read and so much to do that I just can't seem to begin!

Though I don't know if I should mention, everytime I open chrome, the Tab counts is bound to go out of bounds, I actually have 3 different chrome extensions just to manage my tabs &amp; sessions!

What career options do I have? I don't think anybody will hire me with these sort of varied interest? Should I go for masters in cs or MBA or build my own thing?

Some days, I just start reading about marketing, switching between one blog to another, I have one email account signed-up with marketing and sales newsletters. I become so engrossed in reading that, before I know it, I have another 50 tabs opened. Sometimes I just feel like maybe I should start writing about all these cool marketing tactics, ads optimization, traffic strategies, sales funnel, email automation, drip mails. There are so many marketers out there with their training programs and courses. I regularly check out the blogs by marketing gurus like Noah Kagan, Neil Patel, Seth Godin, Brian Harris, Tim Ferris and all other Digital Nomads blogs.

But I just had this epiphany, that I am consuming too much information without actually creating any value out of these mindless reading sessions. 

I developed 2 Android apps by scrapping together code snippets from multiple tutorials online and thats how I got an internship as well, but during the internship I moved into a PM role and spent 3 months, building an app with 2 other developers. 

But after I came back to college, I lost focus again and started exploring content and reading more and more. 

From last few weeks, I have been fascinated by Scalability and server load balancing and voraciously consuming blogs after blogs about how different companies like Netflix and Twitter design their infrastructures, what load balancers and reverse proxies and message queues like RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ does. I have been reading about concurrency control and fault tolerance and I keep on starring projects after projects on GitHub.

I am really losing focus in all these mindless pursuit, do you guys have any advice for me?"
5v09aq,1,2017-02-19,Should I consider transferring?,RichHomieLon,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5v09aq/should_i_consider_transferring/,"Trying to make this as short as possible...I have a lot of friends at school and I love pretty much everything about it. I am pretty involved (helped found a new athletics supporters' club last semester, and I get special dibs to conference tournament and March Madness games) and have enjoyed that. I love the chill/laid-back atmosphere, the student culture/body (62% female at a coastal university), the strength of the Cameron School of Business, most of the people I've met, the sports teams, virtually everything.

However, recently one of my big plans (pledging a fraternity) fell apart prematurely and it's caused me to reconsider my place here. Despite being an incredibly extroverted person, I've struggled with social anxiety since my early teens, and the anxiety especially flares up with women. As many friends and acquaintances as I have here, I also apparently have a bit of a ""reputation"". A rep that almost cost me my bid from the fraternity in the first place (though I was eventually dropped for a very different reason) because of what a few girls might've said about me. I can't stand when women think of me negatively and I normally try to do whatever I can to at least prevent disapproval/dislike. I also have just heard rumors that I was ""banned"" from two other fraternities and that some sorority girl had a restraining order against me (which is weird, because if those *were* true then I would've known first). I'm just really questioning a lot of things right now. I've taken the step of getting counseling/therapy for my issues, which I do think will help. I also feel that my parents dropping their silly GPA requirement would help me finally TRULY enjoy being a college student here as well (especially after the frat issue), though I'd still have to discuss that with them.

Definitely beginning to open up to the idea of transferring. I wouldn't go back to my home state (bc fuck New Jersey honestly), but I am interested in Temple and UBuffalo. Going to school in Philly would be an interesting adventure for sure and I know that Temple's Fox School of Business is better, or at least higher-ranked, than Cameron. Currently have a 3.15 GPA as a second semester sophomore (which is far better than my high school GPA) and am close to officially declaring my major. My family has had financial issues for a while that has made it harder to really pay for school, but federal loans (mixed in with a couple of school-specific loans) have helped a lot. A move back to NJ, in addition to seeing many old scars resurface from high school, also would not solve any affordability issues (most NJ publics are almost as expensive as my current school despite not being as good academically, therefore they have a poor ROI value). While it would definitely suck to leave my current university and all my friends/connections behind, I do want to at least float those couple of apps around just to see what would happen. I know that if I do end up leaving, I would much rather have it be on my own terms as opposed to because my parents didn't like that I got a 3.2 as opposed to a 3.5. In the meantime, I will focus on my current class schedule (16 hours of GenEds/electives), my on-campus job in the university library, applying for summer internships, reapplying to be a freshman peer mentor for next semester (had to drop it at the start of last semester), and most importantly using therapy to help solve my problems. I just completed and sent in my school scholarship application last night, hoping to get some money from the general university and/or Cameron.

TL;DR: I love my school, but recent events/rumors have caused self-doubt and social anxiety to set in within the last week and I now am actually considering transferring.

What do you think? Should I consider transferring and send those apps in, or stay put and stick it out through my last two years?"

What's worse, although my grades have been good so far (I even keep being sent invitations to join fraternities, but I refuse them because they want $80 for me to join, and there's other things I'd much rather spend $80 on), I know it's only going to get harder from here onward, and I'm already sick of doing the work. 


Furthermore, I don't even want to pursue computer science anymore. I originally chose that because I want to get a job in the video game industry, and I though it would be cool to work on console hardware, but I've come to realize that my mind is just not of the sort to be able to work in that field. I have a pretty crummy memory, and I struggle with numbers and serial codes (so things like comparing computer parts become difficult). I came to realize that what I really want to do is become a character designer and writer for games (and maybe do a bit of composition work), but in that case I should focus on improving my art and creativity, which - to my understanding - is more important for artists than a college degree. Employers of artists care more about what you can do than where you've been, right?


At the same time, I'm also interested in getting a part-time job because I'm sick of never having money to buy things with, and I don't want to juggle college and a job. College leaves me with little enough free time as it is and I simply *need* an adequate amount of free time to not go insane. 


Basically, my plan is to drop out of college, get a part-time job so I have a bit of spending money, and look for an internship with a game developer to help get me into the business. I know my parents aren't going to agree with this plan, but I sure as heck don't agree with theirs (that being finishing college). How can I convince them to let me go through with this, if anything for the sake of my own sanity?"

Microsoft is back for the Spring Career Fair! We will be at the CS Career Fair (It's Tuesday. 4pm to 8pm. You should go. Write it down. Now. I'll wait...) but before the fair, we're going to be hanging out in the CSIC lobby talking to you guys, collecting resumes, showing off cool Microsoft products (**ever played with a Surface Studio?**), and eating the massive amount of post-Valentine's day candy we bought. 

So come and hang out with us! We can tell you about Microsoft internships and full time jobs, how awesome Seattle summers are (and how it reacted to getting 6 inches of snow this winter), which 400-levels to take, whatever you'd like. You can even talk to me about why my top Reddit submission is just trying to get karma by reposting John Oliver (I'll be wearing a shirt that has a Ninja Cat holding a Microsoft flag while riding a T-Rex with grabber arms, you have to see it)

**What**: Microsoft Lobby Day

**When**: 11am to 2pm tomorrow!

**Where**: CSIC Lobby

(The last three times I was here, students requested that I post messages like this because they didn't know when Microsoft/other company events were)

**Pro Tip**: Bring a copy of your resume so you don't have to wait in line during the CS Career Fair. If you give us your resume during the Lobby day it counts as the same as giving it to us during the Career Fair (and trust me, you don't want to wait in that line)

I graduated from college with a ba in journalism, but have gone in the direction of professional communications. 

I've had internships and even served as acting comms officer for an international dev nonprofit. 

Right now I need some time (and funds) before I officially apply to law school but I believe that staying in my field and getting some more professional work experience will look better on my law school app. 

The only problem is that I can't seem to land a job offer yet. I've been applying to positions since November and have had a few interviews but nothing yet. 

I've tried Indeed, idealist, simplyhired, Glassdoor, and I've also been perusing company sites directly. I've tried to reach out to my local network most recently, so I'm waiting to see what will come of that. 

I'm also in the south (US), so I'm not too keen on the networking vibes. That is to say, I don't know if cold calling is appropriate or simply bringing my resume to the office would be a more effective strategy. 

If anyone has any advice or suggestions, I'm all ears!

I'm probably going to end up doing research or industry work in my own field as it's my primary plan, but I'm also considering eventually switching to the quant role at some point in my program, as so many people eventually do. It's not my plan, but I'd like to have the option. So what should I do to ensure that it's possible?

A decade ago it looked like anyone who was really sharp and had a hard science PhD could get a great offer on Wall St, but it seems to be more competitive now. There are specific skillsets that you need and you are competing with crack students coming out of MFE programs; I'm not sure exactly what I'll focus on in grad school but Black-Scholes models and trading algorithms aren't it. I'm sure if I research machine learning then I'll be in a good place to work in finance, but I'm not sure about some other areas of AI, like reasoning, knowledge representation, program analysis, evolutionary neural nets, and multiagent systems.

Anyway here are my basic questions about what I will have to do to keep open a good option for quantitative finance work as I focus on AI research in grad school:

1. Is going to a highly-ranked university important? I know that it is extremely important for those who are going to MFE programs, but what about me? And if I have a PhD, would my choice of Master's program matter?

2. Is studying in NYC important? So that you can take internships and meet people while you study?

3. Is it much of a hindrance if I study and research topics in computer science (listed above) that seem to be a bit removed from the skills that quants use?

4. Are quant firms going to know or care much about how impressive my research was in its own field if it's not directly applicable to finance?

Naturally my primary research goals are dominating my decision making but input on this side of the issue would be helpful. Thank you. "

Currently an intern at a company, and was given the task to analyse a set of data that i'll import weekly.

the data i import is arranged in this manner:
eg. product name, price, ........
and each product takes up one row/line.
Problem is, due to the nature of the business/data, the product name is filled in by customers and hence not fixed. for instance, i can have one line with the product name as ""new era black cap"", the next line with the name as ""new era cap black"" etc. (this is just a simple example).
I'm trying to create a pivot table from this data to analyse which products has the most count and contribute most to the business weekly. But with this problem of the same product having different 'name', i'm not able to get my desired result. For eg, I can have 17 counts of 'new era cap black' and 10 counts of 'new era black cap', rather than 27 counts together. (in reality i'm having 1 count of this, 1 count of that, 2 count of another even though they are all the same product really) and i end up having a long list since there are lots of variation in spelling/phrasing the product name.

However, at the end of last year they decided to renege on my choice of office; instead of the office &lt;1 hour away, they did a last-minute ""change to their grad program"" and tried to force me to go to their other Australian office, which would have required me to spend 5 hours a day on the road. So I said bye to them.

After a frantic job search (really didn't want to be unemployed for any length of time), I received a few offers and eventually decided to take my chances with the most mediocre of them all (in terms of salary, at least) - a very early-stage startup which, in my opinion, has great potential. I've worked here for nearly 2 months so far and am having an amazing time, knocking out software that clients are already using and feeling like I'm really able to make an impact here.

However... neither of the founders are technical people, and I'm the company's 5th employee and 1st software engineer. Most of my past experience has been on solo projects, and I've had only one internship to date (where I was used mostly as a code monkey, stayed for way too long and learnt far too little).

I'm wholly capable of doing the tasks laid out in front of me, but doing them *well* is what I'm worried about. I know the absolute basics: Git, issues tracking, Agile, unit/integration testing, proper logging, continuous integration, basic devops... all of which I have/will be using/implementing - but aside from that, I feel like I know nothing.

I know that as a startup grows larger, you need to scale horizontally, and clumping all the functionality of the system into one huge monolith is a terrible idea. But I don't know how to achieve that. I don't know how to build and architecture that won't cause a massive amount of headache later on down the road; I've never even seen the internals and structure of a large-scale production-level project.

I don't want to write a shitty system that future, seasoned engineers that join will hate me for. I don't want to have worked here for a number of years and then be written off later on as someone who didn't get proper training and can't do anything properly.

So where do I start? Books from Amazon? Engineering blogs? Please send help. Any advice would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

Edit: I know that it's in the startup's best interests to hire a senior dev, but like I said it's still at a pretty early stage and I think they just simply cannot afford to at this point in time. I get that it may be a bit of a warning sign, but it's a risk that I've chosen to take right now. So my main question is, what is the best thing I can possibly do to self-learn as much as possible, until we are able to hire more senior engineers, given my current (possibly questionable) choice and situation? Thanks!

5v3urk,3,2017-02-20,Emotionally abusive mother,paradiselost13,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5v3urk/emotionally_abusive_mother/,"I'm a 20 years old, and I have been dealing with a more than dysfunctional relationship with my mother for the most part of 8 years now. I used to think it was a teenage phase and my mother's controlling personality would wane when I moved away to university, but that didn't happen unfortunately. When I was 13 I got involved with 'emo' people and self-harm - I was a silly child, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with me, I was just immature and didn't fully understand what consequences it would have. When my family found out it was a tough year moving past it, my relationship with my mum drastically changed, and she became very controlling. I wasn't allowed to stay around friends' houses, and if they came over to stay we had to be downstairs in eyesight of my mum at all times, I had no mobile phone, all computers and other devices had passwords on which I was the only one in the family who was not allowed to know, when I used the computer it was strictly for school work and my mother had to sit in the room, if I was using the house phone to talk to a friend, my mother would often pick up the other receiver to listen in. I felt extremely isolated from everyone - my friends slowly stopped inviting me to things, or if they did I would tell them I wasn't allowed, I wouldn't even check. When I became 16, I was allowed a mobile phone, which I had to leave downstairs at night, and would be checked as when I woke up in the morning, texts which I had received overnight would be opened and read before I got my phone back. My mother did not like a particular circle of my friends, purely because of they were of a lower economic background to our family, and caused arguments and conflict with their parents on a number of occasions, leaving them in tears sometimes. We had a very up and down relationship - some weeks we were fine, then all of a sudden I would find out she had been going through my phone and seen me messaging a boy (that was usually her cause of argument) or something else she disagreed with, and would take away any liberties (seeing friends outside of school or my phone) as punishment, and constantly tell me I had broken her trust, even though I fully believed there was never any trust there in the first place.

I tried to get help from school. I had counselling during school twice. First time I didn't get anything from it because I wasn't willing to open up. Second time I had the most amazing counsellor, she really helped me understand my feelings and how to deal with them. Self harm became a real issue for me, but I managed to stop when I went to university. Once I went to the head of year, as my mum had started an argument with me over mock grades (practise exams) having been sent home which I got a B in (I was a straight A student in everything). I asked the teacher to call home and talk to my mum. He did that night, and I listened in to the conversation - he told my mum I was one of the brightest students and she had nothing to be concerned about as they at school certainly weren't. My mum came to me and told me she had gotten off the phone with the school and they had told her they were concerned about me and they would be calling me in for a chat. I was shocked. I knew then I was on my own.

University came, and I was filled with so much pent up anger and resentment of my relationship with my mum. First term was hard for me, I was still self harming and I had just started dating a guy I had met on a singing course who was going to Oxford who my mother adored, but I wasn't feeling it with him at all, and knew I had strong feelings for a guy I was in secondary school with, who was just starting university in London as well as me. I ended up breaking it off with the Oxford guy and started seeing this London guy, and my mum hated it. She hated him (she had a problem with how often I talked to him while I was at school, on one occasion printing off a copy of my mobile provider's call and text history to show me all the times she knew I was texting him), he wasn't going to as a good a university as my ex and she despised the idea of him. We have been together two and a half years now, he is doing excellently in his degree and in his internship he is doing this year, and him and I have proved to ourselves and to the people closest to us that we are very much happy and function well together. My mum has never met him and refuses to, refers to him as 'fuckface' and makes it clear at every possible opportunity to all of our family and her friends of her disagreement with our relationship. She has realised that I will not leave him to appease her, so she has taken to finding every other reason to find conflict with me now. From attacking me over my interests (I am a fan of wrestling and attend live music concerts regularly), my weight (I put on weight at university I admit, although am a size 12, eat as healthily as I can and am physical active), my grades (I am averaging a high 2:1 at university, I get a lot of first grades, but I study History at a very academically demanding university which is obviously very challenging. She has told me if I do not get a first she will not attend my graduation), among many many other things.

I don't go home very often as I can't stand being in her presence for long periods of time. Christmas, I had been home a day before she started making digs at me and causing arguments, I lost it at her and fought back (I try my best to avoid confrontation, which leads us to go for weeks on end not speaking). The day I left I vowed I was done and didn't want her in my life anymore, whether on good terms or otherwise. I was exhausted of it. She would send me links to random things on facebook and say things like, oh I thought you'd like this etc, and I would give a civil reply and nothing more, until a few weeks ago when I thought I'd give her another shot. But we are back to square one.

It is my 21st birthday next month and I was going to bring some friends home from London to celebrate with my family. Now I'm questioning whether I even want to be in the same room as her. I don't know what to do. My father, my sister and her sister have told her on many occasions that her behaviour is irrational and she needs to stop her behaviour, but she will listen to no one. I am beyond resolving a relationship with her. Frankly, I never had a mother in an emotional sense, I always felt like nothing more than a trophy to her - she continuously tells me, as if I should care, that she can't talk to her friends about me because she's embarrassed. I am not perfect, and I am more than happy to admit to any faults when they are justified and put to me rationally. But I am a hardworking, ambitious person, who is able to maintain my academic work, financial situation, and relationships all to what I believe to be a good standard at the very least.

Does anyone have any advice for me?"
5v41ay,1,2017-02-20,Family thinks I'm crazy for wanting to stay at a startup.,elbeesee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5v41ay/family_thinks_im_crazy_for_wanting_to_stay_at_a/,"Hey all,

I'm a new grad, and I recently got a job at a small startup. It has been around for 4+ years, and the people there are very bright. I feel like I will learn a lot, which is very important to me, since my one and only internship was not focused on development (leaned towards IT work). The big downside is I'll be being underpaid on a contract-to-hire ($25/hour), no benefits for a few months, independent contractor so a lot of taxes, but its assuring that all employees there started the same before getting full-time with benefits.


I have another job possibility, which is application programmer with the city of LA. The interview process was very long (months) and basically I had to wait for the position to open, got placed high on a list after a test, and went to an in person interview. I was an intern here before for two years, and I hated it because I was working with old technology (ColdFusion..wtf) and barely doing any programming. Also, driving 40+ minutes to work everyday was draining. I liked it because it was a low stress job and chill on a lot of days, and the people were cool, but most people were 10+ years older than me. As arrogant as it sounds, I definitely felt like the most competent programmer there, but I was working with a bunch of System Analysts. The full time position is in a different department, so it may be a bit different. The pay is $50-60k, with great benefits.


Most people think I'm crazy for wanting to avoid the government job. I feel like the startup will not only teach me a lot more, but I will enjoy my work more and I will be better prepared for a high paying job in a few years. If I stay at the city, I know that I will probably be a lifer and my skills will get stagnant. 


What do you guys think?"

However I wanted to go to a decent grad school or land a great job after graduation and I am a bit worried. This is especially because some of my friends from high school I know had much worse GPA and ACT scores compared to me and went to the state U whereas I went OOS to what is arguably a top CS program yet I've been busting my ass against the best in the world and getting a worse GPA and seemingly similar opportunities to my friends who also seem to have a lot more free time. I guess you could say i'm a bit bitter, and I honestly hate myself for being so bitter that my friends are succeeding. I was wondering what my chances for a top 40 CS grad school or a good job is at graduation? I don't think my GPA will really change at all and i've yet to take the GRE since I was considering work and I'm not certain about grad school yet.

5v4rwe,2,2017-02-20,Do I have any hope?,Indusco,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/5v4rwe/do_i_have_any_hope/,"Right now working in qfin is more of a pipe dream for me, but I've been putting in a ton of work to try to raise my gpa this semester.

5v4rxh,6,2017-02-20,And then I got fired from KPMG,shivakanou,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/5v4rxh/and_then_i_got_fired_from_kpmg/,"I worked at KPMG for 1.5 years and last week I got fired.

Before working at KPMG I was a process analysis intern at Merck, with no previous audit or project management experience whatsoever. I got a job as a Trainee at KPMG and always worked alone, I mean seriously, from my first client/engagement until my last one (18 clients total) I had no supervision, no instructions, no mentoring, nothing. I had to learn about project management and audit while doing my job, receiving negative feedback and whenever I complained, they would always tell me that: ""what was happening was wrong and I should formalize it in e-mails and send it to my performance manager and partners"" (which I did).

I lost count of how many overtimes I did during that time, how many times I felt chest pains, how many times I cried wondering how could I improve, because I would always think that everything was my fault. I lost many nights of sleep, compromised my relationship with my girlfriend and my family and the list goes on.

After my first year, my grade was 4, the lowest among the 4 other trainees that got in with me. One of them always worked with another senior in programming engagements, two other trainees worked together on one of our biggest clients, their team was composed of these two trainees, one senior, two managers and the lead partner. And the last one, the 4th trainee, always worked with the same manager. Needless to say, I got really depressed about my grade and was determined to change, so I worked harder. 

There was this one client that I would get up at 5am, arrive at the client at 7am, work until 8pm, go to college to take test/finals, go back to the client, leave at 2am, go home and repeat everything for three weeks. What did I get after finishing this client? A negative feedback from a partner saying that should've asked for help, what I did and only found out later that this partner knew it and ignored (the engagement manager showed me the email between them stating that I asked for help and was ignored).

One day I was assigned to live in another city for 3 months. I had just graduated from college and wanted to finally start the courses that I couldn't due to college and take care of my health (I gained 25kg in 1.2 years). I spoke with the partner about the possibility of not going, he said that I would have to, but he would try to help me. A couple of weeks later the senior manager called me saying that I was relocated, I would not have to go to another city, I would stay where I live but would have to travel to closer cities with a small team of 7 other consultants, I was going to be their leader. 

This got me really excited, but even though he told me that, the e-mails I was receiving about this project didn't say this. They would say that I was going to run test fields and was going alone. I started asking them to tell me exactly what I was going to do, if I was going to lead or run test fields, if I was going alone or with a team. After one week I got a call from this senior manager saying that I ""made a lot of noise"" and he unassigned me from the project. I didn't know what to do and I did what I was told to, I got all the evidences to prove my case and emailed them to my performance manager and partner. I received no answer.

After two weeks I'm invited to have lunch with one of the partners and, while he's eating, he fires me, saying that the partners and managers had a meeting and they decided that I wasn't keeping up with the company's rhythm, after that he finished his meal, gave me the resignation letter and got into a phone call.

Three days ago my performance manager called me, saying that he was sorry and telling me that there was no meeting at all, it was all because of the project that I had made too much ""noise"".

During the first day I got really pissed off, sad, cried and reviewed every single client and engagement that I had worked on to see what did I do wrong. But after talking to my performance manager, a couple of friends and taking a lot of time to think, I'm not sad.

I learned a LOT during this 1.5 years, more than I ever learned during my previous job experiences. I was able to talk to some great people, know different minds, businesses and push my limits even farther. I'm not sad that I got fired, I'm happy that I was able to have such an amazing experience and become a better professional.

A couple of friends offered me a job at PWC, where I could keep learning (Big4 payments are very poor at my country) or I could try getting into a common company, where I would spend a lot of years doing the same thing, but my paycheck would be considerably higher.

I still have no idea what to do, but today I woke up and felt like posting this here and sharing my experience. One thing is for sure, I still have a dream of moving abroad and I know one day I will find a job that make's me happy and recognizes what I do.

That's all :) thank you for reading through here."
5v4we1,1219,2017-02-20,TIFU by smoking a joint.,WeedEater-SA,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5v4we1/tifu_by_smoking_a_joint/,"Obligatory - this didn't happen today, but 2 weeks ago. 

So here it is. I moved to South Africa around 4.5 months ago for an internship, it is my intention to stay for 9 months all together. It is also incredibly easy to get drugs in South Africa as well as very very cheap. 
For the sake of clarity I should state that drug use in South Africa is very much illegal and police don't give a fuck - even though medical use of dagga/weed was recently legalised, the police don't tolerate any use of drugs. They will fuck your shit up. 

So there I was, I had just finished a hike/climb up Devil's Peak and as common practice I was ready to light a joint to conclude my hike. After finding a nice spot, concealed and off from a road rarely used, I sparked up. Whilst enjoying a smoke and trying to order an uber to get back home, a police car drove past, driven by one intimidating mother fucker. 
Our eyes locked as I took the final draw from the joint, the moment only shattered as I burnt my fingers on the stinging roger and realised, I was fucked. 

So In the brief few moments I had before to police were able to turn the car around, I had to make my decision, either wait where I was knowing I'd been caught, run, or pull a wild card.
Now, I was pretty high and had a reasonable amount on my person, so the latter option seemed the best. In those few seconds that felt like minutes, I'd made my decision. I ran up the steep slope at the bottom of which I was sitting and continued to do so until I was able to hide behind a tree. This small scramble had exhausted me, I knew I was trapped and wouldn't be able to evade the police, however, I was in 'The Cape of Good Dope'. I was pretty fucked up. In this scenario I did what any sensible individual would do, I proceeded to climb up the tree I was hiding behind and intended to wait it out until the police left. 
The issue with this however was the bright blue jacket I was wearing which in no way blended with my surroundings. The police were now standing where I had been smoking and I was carefully watching them from my vantage point of wood and leaves. I wasn't sure whether they could see me or not, nonetheless, I was now feeling confident after holding down my sanctuary for a few minutes. The officers started to shout up towards me. 
At this point I was still confident that they could not see or hear me and would leave in due time. This was until my brain made the decision to answer their question of ""where are you?"", to which I responded ""up here"".
I still have no idea why I answered them or why I then began to climb down the tree and further still why in all of this time I hadn't had the thought to get rid of the remaining weed I had on me. 

I was now walking towards to police officers and had no idea what I would do next. It was at this point I realised that if you are being arrested, police in South Africa can do pretty much whatever they wanted. They told me I was going to be searched, and immediately searched me and went through my bag, where they found ~20g of dagga and rolled joint. I was arrested immediately.

[For reference](http://imgur.com/qYPdj5R) 

Never really being involved with the police before I was a little worried, however, the events just passed happened in the space of about 5 minutes, and I was feeling it. So for the duration of my trip to the police station I was flying. Made for quite an interesting experience. Fast forward about 20 minutes, I arrived at the station, I'd done all the boring processing/finger-printing and whatnot. I was now being escorted to the cells.

So In my mind I thought that I would be taken care of somewhat; guest in the country, no previous charges and doing voluntary work. Maybe they would be kind, place me in my own cell - I was very naive. 
I was placed into a cell for 11 people and given a baloney sandwich whilst everyone around me asked me for the 10 rand I did not have in my pockets. From this point on I was nervous. I had been put into a holding area with 10 other men, mostly far larger than myself, all much more terrifying than myself. Nonetheless, I took it in my stride and sat outside with 2 other people, another white person and a young man who also had his first offence. Everything was going well and I was enjoying it all, relative to the circumstances, that was until I heard a seemingly impossibly deep voice that called out ""whitey, come here"".
I looked over to the other white guy in the cell, only in his late 20's, but the years of homelessness, drugs and prison had aged him to look as if he was in his mid to late 40's. It was clear that this call was for me. I anxiously got up and started walking toward the entrance of the inside holding area, just remembering to look un-phased and a little bit intimidating if I could manage it, before entering. The words ""whitey, you get a bed"" were announced and a finger pointed to the end of the short room where an empty bed lay. This was somewhat significant as there were 11 of us in the holding area and only 5 beds.

At this point I was feeling a little better about the situation, but I still had my guard up. The next few hours passed uneventfully, just talking with the other inmates about why we were there. They were all very interested and surprised to see a white person they didn't know in the cells and were all very eager to hear my story. This prompted many questions, comments and earned a few nicknames, of which 'Weed Eater' remains my favourite as given to me by the Rastafarian gentleman who had the bed opposite. 

After being called down to talk with someone I returned to the cells where I was once again interrogated by my fellow inmates as to what happened. I filled them in with the information I had and headed back to my bed, however I noticed something this time, which I hadn't done previously. There was a small metal tin in the corner of the bed. Now when you have been put in jail in a foreign country where you are unsure of what happens, and you see something that even slightly represent a tin of Vaseline, you start to panic. 
I spent the next hour terrified that at some point I was going to be raped by the other men in the cell. Despite the fact that they were in there for minor crimes such as shoplifting, when you see a tin of Vaseline, your mind instantly screams homosexual rapists. 
After some time and some had fallen asleep, I was able to turn the tin over and make out the writing in the limited light. The relief experienced when I read the words 'Vapour Rub' can only be compared to the fact I was bailed out 10 minutes later. 

From here on I waited with the people bailing me out while everything was being sorted. I was able to return home where I found a braai (BBQ) going on, where I had to explain to everyone what happened. The next day I had to attend court where I was told that my case was dismissed, but I had to do community service. I spent the day moving old furniture of the magistrates court around, all in all, it wasn't a terrible experience.

I had a nice hike, nice smoke and a baloney sandwich. I also got the bail money back. 

The reason I decided to write this is because I saw one of the other cell mates I was with this morning. As I was on my way to work this morning I saw the other white guy who was in the cell with me. He's a nice guy all in all, he doesn't seem too bothered about changing his predicament, but he also offered to sell me some weed. Nice guy. 

TL;DR Went for a hike, got high, got arrested. Thought I was going to be raped - wasn't. 6.5/10 Experience. "

5v6kz7,1,2017-02-20,Torn between two grad schools for Computer Science :(,Iamamarshian2,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/5v6kz7/torn_between_two_grad_schools_for_computer_science/,"Hi everyone, I am currently in a dilemma and would greatly appreciate your help. I have been accepted to three grad programs in Computer Science of which I'm torn between two. My ultimate aim is not to join academia but to obtain a research position in R&amp;D.

The **first** program is a Masters (MMath with Thesis) program at the University of Waterloo. Some of the details about my package and supervisor:

* Stipend is decent

* The research area is very exciting

* The reputation of Waterloo's CS program - even at the graduate level- is really, really good. Also, many huge tech companies visit the campus so industrial exposure would be brilliant

* The location is safe, and I'm fine with harsh winters in Canada

* My project is interdisciplinary in nature involving 2 different departments

* Professor was not mentioned in my SOP so seems he is very interested in recruiting me

However, while my potential supervisor seems really chill and great to work with, I contacted a former student from this lab who told me that the lab itself and the research project are both great and shouldn't disappoint me but also gave me a heads up about the professor not having much expertise in my intended research area. He had no complaints about his work there, though, and said that I shouldn't face any problems.

Now, the **second** program is a PhD from The University of Notre Dame. I've tried googling and can't really find anything major about their Computer Science and Engineering department. Nobody I've asked seems to know anything about them in the context of Computer Science. However, my potential supervisor seems absolutely amazing. He has been very helpful throughout and just seems like a genuinely kind person who takes a sincere interest in his students. The research fit is **not** as good as that at Waterloo - I like the area but it's just not as exciting. However, this professor's students have undertaken internships at major tech companies and the stipend that is being offered to me is very generous. His students also tell me that he is a great supervisor, among the best in the department, and is very knowledgeable and helpful and respects work/life balance.

Also, I have been accepted into a PhD program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I was accepted without any interview and have been assigned a temporary adviser. The research fit is the same as Notre Dame but I haven't really got to know my adviser on the same level as the professor at ND. The stipend is decent - around the same as Waterloo when you factor in cost of living. I think their CS program is stronger than the one at Notre Dame but I'm not too sure how the two programs compare against each other.

My major concern now is the apparent lack of expertise in my intended research area at Waterloo - I am absolutely fascinated by their program but I am worried that my supervisor there may not be able to guide me enough to advance my research career. I really, really want to go there but I'm not really sure whether that would be the wisest decision considering my desire to pursue a PhD afterwards.

If you could advise me in any way it would be extremely helpful. All perspectives are more than welcome! Thanks a lot in advance."

Have been studying programming on my own for a few months and I'm currently in a bootcamp set to graduate in mid June. 

I'm fully aware that one cannot be considered an experienced programmer after 3 months of coding and i'm being realistic here so I'm aiming for internships on top of Jr. Dev jobs. 

My question is, how difficult is it to get an internship when you're not in college and don't have a CS background? Do I even have a chance? Or is my only hope through networking?

I'm wondering if I have better chances shooting for a Jr Dev job instead, although I'd prefer an internship for other reasons (would be a more gradual way to develop my skills and there's no long term commitment). 

What are everyone's thoughts/experiences on this?"

For personal reasons I must stay in Vancouver BC for my first job out of school. My resume is ok, but my response rate is low - 10%ish call back rate. Graduated from top schools for ugrad &amp; grad in Canada; 1 internship, a few personal projects. Decent with Java &amp; C.

I started applying in the beginning of Jan. For the past 1.5 months I've applied to ~50 places and there aren't that many left in Vancouver for me to apply to. I have 5-10 rejection emails and the rest of my applications were simply unanswered. 
Most of my friends are working for small companies that don't have openings. I even applied to jobs requiring 3+ years of experience, these are usually called ""Software Engineers"", not senior or intermediate.

In Vancouver, 90% of the job openings are web related. I've never done web dev but I've built a few static websites using bootstrap html css &amp; some js... I believe I can learn the web stack (js, sql, etc) quickly if I must.

Question: what are some suggestions to my job hunting strategy?
If I were to pick up web dev (particularly back end), how proficient do I need to be with it to work at an avg company in Vancouver? How long would it take for me to be an employable web developer, assuming I have solid CS foundation?"

5v86f0,9,2017-02-20,"Going from an ""intern"" to full-time.",CynfulKnotty,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/5v86f0/going_from_an_intern_to_fulltime/,"This is gonna be lengthy, so here is a TL,DR version: I am a GIS Intern for a city that has been super out-of-date for GIS. I am essentially a one-person team doing all of the GIS (though I do now have a little help). The City is looking to make me full time in the summer, and I don’t know what to be looking for pay-wise. What should I be asking?

Long story: So, I am currently a ""GIS Intern"" for a city government (gonna be vague here on purpose). The city's (I'm gonna call it City 1 to help write this) GIS department has been in a weird position. They had one guy who started the department several decades ago, and with the exception of help that came and went over the years, he was the only guy doing GIS for the city all of this time. He did a lot of really good work, the city has a rather impressive set of GIS data, especially for it being a one-man team. He retired at the end of 2015, without a replacement.

Early 2016, City 1 hired a new CIO who was determined to reboot the GIS department (GIS falls fully under the IT department, with the various departments coming to IT for their GIS needs. The city has its own Fire, PD, DWP, etc). The new CIO starts a contract with another city (we'll call them City 2), 20 miles away, to help City 1’s GIS department modernize and get going again.

This is where I came in. One of my GIS instructors from my cert program (that I had just finished) works for the City 2. He knows I am looking for work, and gets me hired to work for City 1, as his point of contact, and to do most of the grunt work and day-to-day stuff. While City 1 has a ton of data, the guy that retired hadn't been keeping up with current tech. He would primarily work in ArcIMS and convert coverages to shapefiles and feature classes if the situation demanded it. 

So here I am, fresh out of school (GIS Cert + M.A. in Geography) doing a million things for the city, GIS-wise. I’ve been catching up with updating our data (there was a 9-month gap between my predecessor leaving and me starting), fulfilling map and application requests, and all kinds of other things. The new CIO wants me to push us and have me innovate with GIS. He wants me to do cool things! My really big project has been to make new versions of the city’s old ColdFusion apps (using ArcGIS Online developer tools). With this I have been making very good progress, and even recently received a commendation from PD!

So, FINALLY, here is my dilemma. They want to hire me, full-time (I currently work 3 days a week) come summer… and I have NO idea what to ask for, pay-wise. As an Intern I get 16.06 an hour. I’m not sure what title my duties fall under. One day I seem to be a GIS Technician, another day an analyst, another day an Admin. Also, I am located in Southern California. My classmate has suggested that I ask for at least 30/hour, considering my M.A. Does this sound about right? Sorry for rambling on. Most people I know in the GIS world right now are either way above me, or students.

My friend said she wondered how in the world she got hired and found out that the girl and her manager had gone to the same uni and had been in the same sorority, so she must have gotten an extra referral there. However, even that didn't help her case and my friend found out that she was asked to resign about a month into the internship.

I know the ground basics of C, C++, C# and Java but am yet to even touch things like delegates enums recursion structs etc.
I know html and css a fair bit, I'm thorough with most basics in js except ajax and a lot of small things (optimising cookies confuses me still) etc. and an okay amount of jquery.
I can either commit to web development and finish js and jquery thoroughly and then move onto php/sql/bootstrap or I can pay focus to traditional languages like c,c++,c# and java. I'm currently fifteen, and I've been casually learning all of them for three years now. I've used pretty much only online resources (w3schools for all the web dev, tutorialspoint, java t point, an ibm website, and other ones for the traditional languages), in school I'm only taught extreme basics of java. I've made a few very basic games with html/css/js/jquery with phonegap. I've played around with unity and andoid studio a bit too, but I've also been interested in online competitions in sites like hackerearth.

Now, I want to prioritize more and either commit to web dev or focus on mastering traditional languages, and I want the opinion of someone in the industry as to what I should choose. Also, I feel that an internship right now would really help me and give me some practical experience, but all openings I've found online around here for web dev expect at least college graduates, I'm still in high school, so that might be hard to do. I'm a little lost and want a second opinion from someone within the industry on my next step. Any advice is appreciated :)"

I had to work that night at my part-time job and was at my internship all the next day so I had to bang it out late at night when I got home. I did the first 2/3 problems perfectly as they were pretty easy, the last one though I had no clue on and was exhausted so I literally left it blank(not sure if that was the best idea).

They responded the next day and wanted to set up a phone interview ASAP. I scheduled it but am unsure of what to expect as far as technical questions go? I know I will get the usual phone interview questions(walking through resume, talking about qualifications for the position and how I fit them, etc) but should I prepare for heavy/hard technical questions over the phone? I feel like that is something that they probably wait for the on-site interview but not much experience with this so who knows.

Also, as a side note, how long should I wait before I send a followup email after a good(at least in my eyes) phone interview. I have a had a few a couple weeks ago, the people who interviewed me said they would be in touch with more details, but still nothing. When do/should I send them an email asking about the state of my application? I figured I would get a rejection email if they did not want to move forward.

I am currently finishing up my 3rd year in college (junior) and majoring in Computer Information Systems. I plan on on getting my Bachelors in CIS by the end of next year (only 2-4 semesters left). 

I currently have a great internship with a Financial company doing IT Support. I am the only person at the office, but the company is managed by a Managed Service Provider so I get to work alongside them most of the time - which teaches me a lot. For an intern I have good pay, my own office, friendly staff... I can't complain and plan on sticking with them till graduation.

This summer I am not going to be traveling home, so I planned on taking a class or two over the summer and working Mondays-Fridays at my office. Since I won't be AS busy, I wanted to use this time to set a goal and start to study/train for obtaining my first Certification.

Now this is where I am kind of in a pickle... Over the past year working in IT Support, I'm starting to realize that even though I enjoy it sometimes - I can't picture myself ""fixing stuff"" for the rest of my life. don't get me wrong, I love IT and am passionate about it in every way... It's just I don't see myself being a ""Mr. Fix-It"" guy in the future.

Doing more research, I have started to looking at Management Information Systems and am really interested in that. I like the idea of managing my own IT group/company and being in a so called ""higher up"" position then a Help Desk Technician...

So my question is, what would be the best certification to start training for regarding my situation? Awhile ago I was set on the A+, but I believe with my current studies and hands-on internship I learn most of that anyways (plus I don't want to be in PC support in the future).

How many of you guys offer internships? I run a small consulting firm but want to empower and teach new graduates the technical skills and attitude needed to succeed in today's IT world. Of course as a consulting firm the work we have are the ones from our client.  I am wondering how can I sell it to my clients so they will be okay with our interns working on their project? Of course everything will be supervised. We don't  want interns destroying anything. Then goal is so they can get some live real time experience something they often don't get in college or university. Any ideas or suggestions?

To start, I am a black guy in my late 20s that dealt with ALOT since childhood-grew up poor, rat infested house, single mom, etc. People like me are not supposed to be successful. Even in high school, when I wanted to work, I couldn't get hired anywhere and that led to college also.

I moved for college and graduated while living in my car for 4 years. I am a biology graduate and I have also won research awards, publications, a magazine cover, etc. Even with the crappy hand I was dealt in life, I took what little resources was around me and made the most of it. But it can only go so far.

Since graduating, I am still unemployed and had to move back to my grandmother's house, where I sleep on the floor. All thosr connections I made, the internships, the good grades, the hard work all seem for naught since I can't get hired. I even applied around the country. People say STEM fields are open for people but I feel like they only look for ""certain"" people.

This comes back to me hating God and the idea of religion that I made a permanent decision to not engage in it anymore. I resent the teachers at school that always told me, ""Work hard and you can be anything you want"" or ""You should pray to God"". Ever since childhood I prayed to be freed from poverty and unfortunately the cycle repeats itself another generation.

The worst part is that I felt like I did everything right, I don't drink, curse, I'm humble, went to the right school, interned, you name it. Whereas people around me opposite of that have a career, a family, a new house, etc and it hurts. 

I've been in and out of depression and suicidal thoughts for almost a year now and I don't know how much more I can take. It's even more painful that I cannot even get an explanation or ""why?"" answered. Why can't I find a job? Why did God never answer any of my prayers? Why must I live in poverty?

And know this, I'm not saying that I' feel entitled to anything because I know the world owes me nothing. All I ever wanted was an opportunity because I felt like I at least earned THAT. Sometimes I feel like the best way to win is not play anymore...

By Chipathing

A continuation of the Song of the Softwalkers Story.


It was my idea in the first place to hold a meeting of our empire’s members to standardize our equipment. Since our incorporation of the humans some hundred and thirty years ago our equipment has become less and less consistent even within the armies of the same races. This of course made logistics as easy as talking a black hole out of collapsing in on itself. To that end I assembled the representatives of our four great armies to discuss what was needed if we were to standardize our arsenal.

The Nekota representative was the first to speak. It was clear to all he’d had his chitin polished for the occasion. He stood up and adjusted his traditional attire before speaking.

“Grand Alpha of Armaments, Warbringer, and Mr. Summers, I, Tizikshik Tzarzat of the Nekota War Council present with great pride the tools of our army.” 

With a flourish the Nekota produced an elegantly long X-ray rifle and mat-black mesh armour. He laid them down carefully on the table.

“The YK-48 X-ray rifle is a staple of our people’s armed forces and has been for the better part of half a century... With some modifications I can assure you. The traditional weapon of assassins and rebels thanks to its unparalleled accuracy reliable killing blows. Of course to get around an x-ray beam’s habit of dissipating in atmosphere after a few feet we have designed a low velocity shield ‘jacket’ emitter around the x-ray beam to burn off atmosphere on the way to ensure beam is in vacuum and is effective for well over five kilometres. Paired with our adaptive camouflage mesh armour and we can destroy an enemy force larger than us by seven fold without sustaining casualties. I’m sure you’ll all see the value of shooting first and last”

The Nekota sat down, onlookers clapped and the representatives nodded in approval for the diplomat. I gave a polite clap as he sat down and looked at the Bergan Warbringer with dread as he set to present next. With any luck he wouldn’t kill anyone in his demonstration which I was confident would end in a live fire demonstration.

“Reprahsentatves of the umpire” he began as he hefted what looked like two hundred pounds of what would happen if industrial pipe work and a deranged android had violent sex in a garbage disposal unit. 

I massaged my forehead and clicked my mandibles in annoyance, he was going to fire that monstrosity wasn’t he?

“Fer your konsideration fer da war effat is dis” he motioned to the abomination of a weapon “This ‘er ain’t da prettiest girl at the dance bat she’ll put out te second you ask and she can hold ‘er own in a scarp as it were... this analogy ain’t goin as I intended... No matter! The Ogarak fifty is a man portable firing position consistisising of a eav’y plasma repeata mated to the chassis of a mag accelerated recoil-less rifle. Now eh...look’n at y’all I do suspect we mayy ave’ ta modifiz it a touch to let a nekota fire it without bustin ‘is arms off, inin’t that right buggy?” Said the Warbringer to the Nekota representative who was averting his twitching eye while he gripped his rifle and recited the second stanza of the Nekota death whisper.

I clapped and motioned to the others to begin to try and force the Warbringer from continuing.

“thank you... Warbringer. Your presentation was very... enlightening, now I think everyone here can agree the Ogarak fifty is a fine weapon and there’s no need to demonstra-”

On cue the bored Warbringer shrugged and fired into the wall. After security had confiscated the weapon and paramedics resuscitated the twelve interns that had been injured as the projectile destroyed twelve interior walls (I love the human concept of Interns, voluntary slaves. It’s brilliant!) we proceeded to the far superior Varlance equipment I had brought in. I instructed my underlings to fetch the equipment and in the corner of my eye I could see the Human and Bergan speaking to one another eagerly. It made sense that the two would converse given how much in common they both had but for some reason I held out hope that humans would be better than that.

“Now after that um... demonstration I’d like to put forward the Varlance army’s primary weapons as our standard weapon. Given that we are one of the three galactic powers I suggest you give this due thought. Especially given that we govern over you. The Swift Ice of Dawning peril is our armies primary weapon and one of the most feared in the galaxy and has brought several smaller empires to their knees” I said as I established eye contact with everyone in the room. Especially Mr. Summers and the Bergan.

The Bergan snorted loudly and made a back and fourth gesture miming having some form of cylinder in his hand. The Human and Bergan shared a chuckle over that.

“Ahem... The Swift Ice of Dawning Peril, or as our soldiers paraphrase it the Swift is a non typical weapon in the polarm configuration that fires a super condensed gas at relativistic speeds at the target. The gas at this velocity can bypass medium armour and reduce temperature inside the target to several degrees above absolute zero. At this temperature the target is either disabled regardless if they have armour has suffered fatal wounds. The weapon has no recoil and is pin point precise, It is a true weapon for the elite. Now I know where my vote is going but it would be rude of me to not allow our most recent member of our empire to show us what they have been up to” 

I smiled politely at Mr Summers as he clapped slowly while making unbroken eye contact with a smug grin on his face. Alright mister soft walker. Let’s see what the mud throwers have come up with.

“Gentlemen” Said Mr. Summers “Our esteemed host is very correct when he says that this” He lifted the swift up and twirled it in his hands “Is a weapon for an elite. But we don’t need a weapon for the elite. This right here, this is a weapon of intimidation. This is lazy, this isn’t designed to win wars. This is designed to terrorize and subdue those who cannot fight on equal footing.”

At first I was amused by Mr. Summer’s bravado but his mouth was making decrees his race couldn’t back.

“I know humans have gotten a bad reputation over the years, Our flawless military victory of Pescelian worlds shows that there is still much for us to learn from our Varlance overlords.”

Not going to lie, that hurt a little. It wouldn’t hurt as much if he wasn’t STARING RIGHT. AT. ME.

“That being said, this has just recently made its way into our frontline armies and I’d like to present it to our Host so that he can show us the proper way to make war winning equipment. This my fellow subjects, is the MkVI Universal Power Armour or UPA because humans like acronyms.”

Mr. Summers motioned for a hover trolley to come forward. On it was a seven foot tall amalgamation of ceramasteel plating and complete disregard for the sanctity of all living things.

“The UPA is a completely environmentally sealed unit effective against biological, radioactive, thermal, and chemical threats and can carry over one metric ton for short duration's if needed. As standard the UPA comes equipped with an automatic mag rifle firing two millimetre tungsten carbide pellets at ten times the speed of sound in standard oxygen atmosphere at a rate of three thousand rounds per minute or roughly fifty shots per second. Each suit contains four thousand rounds of ammunition and the operator can vary the cycle rate of the weapon to suit their tactical needs. In addition the suit comes equipped with a back mounted shoulder firing magnetically charged mortar that can fire any standard issue sixty millimetre grenade over two kilometres with an accuracy of ten meters. The standard grenade, also sixty millimetre for convenience, is a hydrogen based fusion grenade with an effective payload of twenty five tons of conventional TNT. Each suit of armour can carry eight of these. Again for tactical convenience the operator can dial back the force of the explosion for more precise use. Mounted into the helmet is a battlefield awareness computer system that can assist in targeting, provide information, and allow coordination with all units on the field and naval units in orbit. The entire system is powered by a fission reactor on the back and cooled by hyper compressed coolant stored around the reactor. If the need for mobility arises the operator can dump coolant into the reactor in controlled bursts to produce lift through the vents. We have yet to make a sustained flight model though my engineers tell me any week now we may hear from them.”

It took several moments to realize I had my mouth wide open and that my mandible was covered in a fine layer of dribble. I looked over and could tell immediately that the Bergan had some sort of swollen tissue in his pants.

“So the question of course is simple, do you want to defeat your opponent in style with the Varlance Swift...OR do you want to defeat an entire army in style with the human constructed UPA?”

I could only sit with a stupid look of shock on my face as the other two representatives literally came to blows attempting to make the first offer.

Anyways... Sir, that is why our client races have signed a century contract with the humans. However the good news is that we have our Swift supplies all to ourselves now. I’ll see myself out.

I come from what most would call a developing country and I study CS at a no name university. I religiously followed this subreddit's recommendations every day for almost 2 years: build a portfolio of personal projects, study your algorithms and data structures (shoutout to GeeksForGeeks and HackerRank, they are incredibly helpful) and, finally, read cover to cover the 3 best known books for technical interview preparation: Cracking the Coding Interview, Elements of Programming Interviews and Programming Interviews Exposed.


Last year I applied online to almost 50 companies looking for a summer internship. I got 6 positive replies and interviewed with all of them during the past 4 months (2 of them are what many call the ""Big 4""). After this long process, today I finally got an offer for an internship in one of the top 2 companies. My family and me are overcome with joy! 

I want to thank this community for all the invaluable advice and all the generous people that share their knowledge with us. Also, I want to deeply thank the people of the United States, for you are truly a nation with no boundaries: your great institutions and organizations bring hope and opportunity for many who want to make an impact in this world but lack the means to do it.

If you are willing to work hard and persevere no matter the circumstances, there are no obstacles you can't overcome!

Given my current position, I've been weighing the following pros and cons of reneging on my accepted offer:

Pros: 1) The B4 company will pay me ~10% more--this money would help me cover my rent and university tuition, since I am paying my way through college.
2*) The B4 company will be a great work experience, and will probably draw attention on a resume.

Cons: 1) Reneging on an accepted offer is unethical and could paint my university in a negative light.
2) Reneging could a) get me blacklisted at Workday and b) prompt them to contact career services at my university in response, which could result in me being stripped of access to career services (and potentially have other unforeseen consequences at school?).

*I'm sure Workday is also a great place to work, but I don't know how it might compare in the eyes of a future recruiter.

Has anyone here reneged before? If so, how did that go? Can anyone offer me advice/help me weigh in on this decision with relevant information?"

How poorly does reneging an offer harm my reputation?

I already accepted an internship to a local company. This internship offers some skills sorta related to my career goals. But ultimately is less attractive in pay, experience, and status. This will be good for me, but not great. A friend recommended me to this position and is working for the company full time.

I was offered another internship that is more related to my career goals. It offers more challenging projects that I will have to work very hard on (I feel lucky to be offered this job). If I am successful, it is likely that I will be hired on after graduation. This position has considerably more pay, status, and better experience.

However, I worry about the effects this will have on the reputation of my friend (he encouraged me to renege and thinks it will have no effect on him) 

I appreciate any advice on the harms of reneging an offer and how I ought to handle communication on the renege.

There have been so many applications sent and so many rejections that it stings every time. Here is a company with a new grad position and they just say ""we don't think your qualified"" even though I am exactly the kind of candidate that the position is for.


Now I know what you are thinking now. You are thinking this guy sounds so entitled to be thinking that he just automatically deserves a job. I know that I am entitled to nothing, but after so many rejections it really breaks down your spirit. I am not going to give up though.


I apply to jobs in the bigger cities such as LA, bay area, san diego, NY, Chicago, Seattle. I want to be in a big city and I do live near one of those just in case someone was wondering.


There is the new problem that I am competing with new 2017 grads now and even those new positions are getting filled already. I also have to explain this year long break to people which is them basically asking ""why has no one hired you yet."" The clock is ticking. The gap is widening.


The rejections I am getting are all mostly just that first round quick resume screen. I am hardly getting any actual interviews so the practice I get from leetcode, hackerrank, ctci, etc. all seem to be useless right now. So there is something wrong with my resume and I believe it is all stemming from the lack of experience/no relevant internship.


For the job search I use linkedin, glassdoor and indeed. I just apply to the positions I find on there. I have tried using that indeed prime and linkedin prime or whatever they are called, but the positions I get an email about from recruiters are all non programming positions that they basically want anyone with a bachelors degree to fill.


The last thing I want to mention is that I did not make this to vent/complain/bitch. I realize what I am doing just isn't working or isn't enough. I need to do something different since I need a job.


here is my most resume as well since someone will probably ask for it. I took my gpa off since it a just okay 3.08 and I don't think it was helping. I decided to keep my courses on there just because I would want the filters/search to get alerted with ""object oriented"" and whatever else is on there.

EDIT:



So there appears to be some questions about why my internship is not relevant to my degree/programming. Well the answer to that is I was not originally CS. I transferred into it my junior year 2nd semester and took the entire CS and STATS curriculum in that 2 years time. so while most people were only taking two or so classes in their major, I was doubling/trippling/etc up every time which is why my GPA got so low to a 3.08"

I've made a few simple iOS apps (10k+ downloads, won an award for one), blog themes/websites, AI Twitter bots, Arduino stuff, and I'm a volunteer back end coder at a popular website. I know HTML/CSS3, jQuery, Python, graphic design, and Swift/iOS. I've also attended a few collegiate hackathons. 

I want a paid summer internship and I'm considering taking a gap year next year to work. Would this be possible as a high school senior? I'm looking into programs geared towards underclassmen like Microsoft Explore. Any recommendations of other programs to apply to?

TL;DR: Would a high school senior with no CS coursework be able to land a paid internship?"

I was wondering what your thoughts were on this major. Is it too specific? Am I better off going with a traditional CS degree? I really want to work in networking and eventually work into security.

Also I had questions if a CS minor would help with getting internships and that first job once I graduate.

I hope you don't mind.

I'm a sophomore at a highly ranked college, but not necessarily for our CS program. My freshman-Sophomore summer I did a fairly light internship, where my title was fortunately software dev intern, but I feel like I didn't make huge contributions (and my pay reflected that so I guess that's okay?).


I haven't been sure what I want to do within CS, so this Fall I kinda applied to a ton of things and ended up landing an offer at a Fintech firm in Chicago... They offered me way more than I expected to get. Effectively, its housing+$8k/month.


I've already accepted the offer and am of course excited but can I expect this to last? Has anyone ever experienced a pay drop from internship to full time? I go to a good school so I see how they *might* consider me a valuable intern, but like, I'm probably in the lower 50% of CS students here. Nothing I've done is amazing. I'm not even happy with how much I contributed at my last internship for compensation less than half that.

i feel like i am at the lowest point in my life right now

i have graduated from college for over a year now... and still i have no luck in finding employment, aside from minimum wage labor.

the past year has felt like almost one eternity for me. i apply for any job that i have even a small interest in

i am also really bad at people skills, i believe i have aspergers or similar problem, and end up really nervous and anxious in interviews to the point where i cant think of anything meaningful to say 

unfortunately, even when i receive interviews for vacancy, i am often told that i am not a right match for the job, do not display enough enthuziasm etc...

for my entire life i have always been a painfully mediocre student. i barely made a pass in my college degree, and due to my poor second year grades, have been unable to successfully join any internship programs...

i feel more and more figurative claustrofobia, as my parents and everyone  around me judging me.. they keep scolding me with hindsight for not doing an internship program, as it seems the only way to successfully line up for a job when graduating, is to have that coveted one year of experience.. and they are probably correct

as i have really mediocre grades, and no experience to show, and was generaly unremarkable in school, i feel as if the references that i can ask of my college professors, will be really weak as well..

there are so many things to worry about... i dont think i want to live a life of worries anymore




the people who keep telling me i should have taken more initiative in school, are correct.. and the only person i can blame is myself really 


i am really not sure how i can fix all of my flaws in such short time period.. and i would like a job quick so i can move out from my parents homes

should i just take up a minimum wage job and then move out and kill myself someday? i dont know... never have i felt so uncertain before

i thank every one of you for listening to my story!!

  What I'd like to know is how to learn what the actual work environments for different sub-fields of computer science are, and how to tell which one I'm suited for. I'm talking about front-end, back-end, data analysis, database management, etc. I am highly interested in applications of computation to other branches of science, such as medicine or economics, so that would probably be a good place to start. I have no idea however if, data mining &amp; visualization for example, is what I'm looking for to get into this kind of work, and additionally whether I merely like the idea of it and would balk at the practice.
  
  Separately, I question whether I need the data structures and algorithms knowledge to begin developing projects, as in the case where my projects would be ridiculously trivial (in the eyes of recruiters of the top tier companies) prior to learning these fundamentals, or whether I can begin these things immediately.

5vmgpb,461,2017-02-22,Decorum,BlueCoatEngineer,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5vmgpb/decorum/,"[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5vh3wt/putting_the_ca_in_cant_part_2/)

**Background**

A major milestone for QA is “Reaching Qual.”  That’s when the QA lead reviews the outstanding bugs and trends and declares a general “Fuck It, We’re Good.”  Anything not put to bed by Qual is, in theory, something that we can DocFix instead of ActualFix.  The QA team winds down and start to realize how far they’ve been pushed to try to meet deadlines; you put an engineer in a pot of water, and gradually ramp up the “crunch time,” they’ll hit 80 hours a week without realizing it.  Take that pressure away and your dudes go into a pretty ugly withdrawal as they scramble to remember how they used to spend all day when the project was in full swing.  The corporate-sanctioned remedy to prevent the Engineerium Tremis is the ***Qual Party***, where the whole team goes on a pub crawl until they forget all the worst parts of the project, along with why they were swearing oaths about not having anything to do with the next project.  Unfortunately for this project, The Duke was the one scheduling the shindig.  While he picked a perfectly acceptable location (Food?  Beer?  Not a spiderbar?  Check!), he scheduled it for a Thursday.  

His reasoning was that **Rangledangle** had requested that our regularly scheduled group events not be on a Friday, ostensibly for religious reasons.  In actuality, Rangledangle was divorced and needed to be able to pick his kids up from school but wanted be able to attend our quarterly shindigs.  Normally this wouldn’t be a problem; our actual engineers had a good dynamic and supported his ruse since it meant he got to come out to play with us.  This Qual Party, however, was to take place in the evening at a Brazillian Grill and adjacent craft brewery tasting room.  RangleDangle, secular though he was, did adhere to various tenants of his religion out of habit, including no meat or alcohol.  By the time we realized this and RangleDangle went to The Duke to tell him not to worry about it, everything had been set up and deposits were paid, everyone would just have to take it easy and we’d make an early night of it.

**Blue**

The sun spitefully rose over the QA pens as did groans and shushes at any noises.  I drained the last drops of life from my styrofoam cup before discarding its corpse in the trash next to the others.  Three coffees, six advil, and my head still felt a little fuzzy.  The place we’d gone for drinks specialized in barleywines and strong ales.  My eyes dialed into focus on the receipt in front of me as I tried to figure out how to enter it into the expense report.  Four pints of whimsically named beer and a shot of something called “El Guapo” after neverending meat on swords and I’m feeling this awful?  Maybe this is just what getting old feels like.  Good times.

***`BEEP`-`BOP`-`SKEE``DLE`-`BOOP`-`BEEP`-`BOP`!***

Reflexively I grabbed my headset, put on my fake cheery voice, frobbed the answer button.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: Unprestigious University Helpdesk, this is BlueCoat, what seems to-

Blink.  Wait.  That’s not what we do anymore.  Not that it mattered, my timeslipped greeting was answered by dead air.

***`BEEP`-`BOP`-`SKEE``DLE`-`BOOP`-`BEEP`-`BOP`!***

It was coming from the next row over; Rangledangle's office.  The moans of the dying voiced their disapproval as the cheery synth continued its hail.  After a third serenade, it shunted to voice mail and we breathed a sigh of relief.  Little did we know how much our excess the previous night had angered the Gods of Engineering.

***`YO LISTEN UP HERE’S THE STORY ABOUT A LITTLE GUY THAT LIVES IN A BLUE WORLD`***

Sweet evil jesus, someone has taught him how to make custom ringtones for his mobile.

***`I’M BLUE DA BA DEE DA BA DAA DA BA DEE DA BA DAA`***

It too eventually went to voicemail, giving a respite from our torment.  An all-to-brief one, as it turned out the caller was not going to be ignored.

***`BEEP`-`BOP`-`SKEE``DLE`-`BOOP`-`BEEP`-`BOP`!***

Oh god.  They think it’s important enough to call back.

***`YO LISTEN UP HERE’S THE STORY ABOUT A LITTLE GUY THAT LIVES IN A BLUE WORLD`***

On both numbers.

***`BEEP`-`BOP`-`SKEE``DLE`-`BOOP`-`BEEP`-`BOP`!***

***`I’M BLUE DA BA DEE DA BA DAA DA BA DEE DA BA DAA`***

***Assessment***

The few engineers that had made it in so far, **Grumpler**, **Intern**, and myself gathered pitchforks and logic probes and walked down to very politely discuss with Rangledangle the necessity of setting him and everything he holds dear on just a smidgen of fire.  He was missing in action and I took the liberty of disabling the ringer on his desk phone.  The high-end mobile he’d left on his desk posed more of a challenge since it wasn’t a company phone.

&gt;**Intern**: Can’t we just turn it off?  Or put it someplace he can pick it up from?

&gt;**Grumpler**: Naw, best not.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: That there is a personal phone.  Can’t go messing with someone’s personal phone.

&gt;**Grumpler**: It’d be rude.

&gt;**Intern**: But it keeps ringing.  It doesn’t seem like they are going to stop.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: This is clearly an important call.  What if his ex-wife’s been in a terrible accident?

&gt;**The Australian**: He’d probably be more worried about them calling to say she survived.

The Australian had sauntered up wearing sunglasses and mock airs of disapproval.  He was carrying a large glass tumbler containing a beverage smelling of tomato juice, energy drink, and those little single-use alcohol wipes that he referred to as “antidote.”

&gt;**The Australian**: The goddamn hell, is that Eiffel 65?

&gt;**Bluecoat**: I think we're only up to 14 or 15.  Anyone able-bodied’s already workin’ on it.

He paused to give the lack of everyone a dramatic looking up and down.

&gt;**The Australian**:  What, are you kids all hungover from last night?  I’ve never seen such a bunch of whiners!  Well, it looks like you’ve got this well in hand and I’ve got uh, “Meetings-”

The finger quotes around the tumbler caused some of the contents to slosh over and fall to the carpet.  Whips of smoke began to rise, but he quickly rubbed it out with the toe of his shoe before it could spread.

&gt;**The Australian**: -to attend.  From my couch.  Probably until after noon.

He waited in the doorway to his office for a moment to make sure we were watching before snapping the lights off and quickly shutting the door.

&gt;**Grumpler**: I don't exactly want to take it without knowing when Rangledangle's getting back.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: Nope.  That'd mean tracking him down to get it back to him and he's hell of stealthy.  This seems like it could be a good learning experience for the Intern, so… Whiteboard?

***`YO LISTEN UP HERE’S THE STORY ABOUT A LITTLE GUY THAT LIVES IN A BLUE WORLD`***

&gt;**Grumpler**: Whiteboard.

**Problem Statement**

BugStomperJones had previously been seen at last call, when he had made an angry declaration that some unknown “that” was “it” and that if anyone needed him, he was undertaking a quest to eat “enough crêpes.”  Whether he’d succeeded in this and was sleeping it off or had been arrested breaking into the IHOP and committing a crêper was unclear, but his absence meant access to a quiet room with a huge whiteboard on the wall.  The Intern helpfully found a marker and tossed it to Grumpler.  Grumpler, in a fluid motion, caught it and whipped it back at him.

&gt;**Grumpler**: You’re here to learn, writing helps you retain!  Let’s start with a problem statement.  What’chu got, Intern?

&gt;**Intern**: Uh, a name for starters-

&gt;**Grumpler**: And I’m sure it’s a doozy, but we got a problem out there!  I’ll get’chu started, PROBLEM STATEMENT.  Phone ringing.  Displeasing to the ear.  Needs to stop.  Owner MIA, possibly in one of his all-day meetings.

The Intern copied down the words on board.  I jumped in.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: CONSTRAINTS.  Separate column.  Ok, big one.  Can’t touch the phone.  It’d be rude.  I think that’s about it.

&gt;**Grumpler**: Alright, Intern.  Ideas?

The Intern stared at the empty space, stalled out, and started to sweat.  I mean, more than usual.  You see, he was from Southern California where it’s warm all the time and you would have thought the move to a much cooler climate would have helped with the sweating, but it did not.  Even with the multiple types of prescription-strength underarm antiperspirants and some sort of sublingual tab from an endocrinologist, he could still burn through three layers of clothing just standing still.  By the way, how is the insurance at Corporate; would they cover this laser surgery where they deactivate some of your sweat glands?  All of this he tells us in the interview and we still hired him!  That’s how much he’d impressed us.  He gets confidence and a name later.  Right now, though, he’s still a little nervous and overwhelmed by Corporate; Needs an occasional nudge.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: How’s your guys’ cell coverage in the building?  Pretty bad?

&gt;**Intern**: I have to go over to the window to get any bars.

&gt;**Grumpler**: Plenty of unpredictable and shifting dead zones.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: So could you say there’s ""not any expectation for any guarantee that a cell phone works anywhere in the building at all times?""

&gt;**Intern**:  I’ve seen embossed signs here that say exactly that.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: Now, Grumpler, we don’t want to take the phone ‘cause that puts Rangledangle at risk of not knowing where his phone has gone.  Do you reckon he’d have much trouble finding his phone if it was in the same place but maybe covered? 

&gt;**Grumpler**: I bet he can figure it out; he’s a Doctor!

&gt;**Bluecoat**: What d’ye figure we could cover it up with make it stop ringing?  We could try with packing foam, but it’s one of those fancy BOSE bastards and it seems we just cover it and it keeps ringing, it’s going to kill the battery.

&gt;**Grumpler**: Can’t have that.  What if he forgot his charger?  Might miss that important call when he comes back.   Any other way we can block the signal?

Click

&gt;**Intern**: Faraday cage.

&gt;**Bluecoat**: Now you can add to the problem statement.  “Need a Faraday cage to block cellular signals.”

That was enough to get the Intern going.  He whipped out his laptop and started googling what cellular frequencies were in use for this part of the country.  Grumpler and I excused ourselves, officially to go check if anyone else had made it in or if Rangledangle had returned, but really we just wanted to go get more coffee while we let him work.  No one else had come in since The Australian, unless they’d heard the music and noped out to work from home.  One leisurely stroll and proving that it pays to always be friendly to your cafeteria staff later, we returned with a whole pot of freshly made good coffee.

***Let’s See How He Did***

The whiteboard had a lot more math and smudges on it than it did when we left, along with an “Opens” column under which he'd written “is pick up phone and put back ok?""  He explained how he’d looked up the frequencies used for cellular signals, determined an average wavelength and, using several other equations that he’d googled, calculated the ideal mesh pitch needed for attenuation.  We both agreed that it looked very reasonable and complemented The Intern on his work before breaking the bad news to him.

&gt;**Grumpler**: Hey Bluecoat, do you know where we have any of that size mesh?

&gt;**Bluecoat**: I don’t know that we have *any* sized mesh.  That seems like the sort of thing someone woulda seen fit to have taken away from us by now.  The wireless guys might, but that’d require The Australian calling in a favor.

&gt;**Grumpler**: And we don’t want to interrupt his “meeting.”

&gt;**Bluecoat**: What if I’d had you put one more column on the board?  ANTI-CONSTRAINTS: Things we are explicitly saying we aren't caring about.  “All Other Frequencies”

The Intern started to write it down, then realized what I was getting at.  He stared at his work and capped his marker and grinned sheepishly.  I tossed him a large roll of tinfoil that I’d borrowed from the nice cafeteria lady and gestured to the door.

***Sorted***

With the rest of the team slowly starting to trickle in and looking worse than we had, we decided that answer to the Intern’s Open was “Yes,” citing previous office practical jokes as precedent.  He delicately wrapped RangleDangles phone in foil before replacing it exactly where it was.  With that, Eiffel 65 lost out on another stream of recurring royalties, hopefully pushing them into bankruptcy.  Our colleagues were spared, although at this time none of them were particularly interested in hearing any story that required active listening or really any sounds at all.  RangleDangle eventually returned from “places” to reclaim his phone, which he swears he left on silent.  The mysteriously persistent caller was RangleDangle’s kid’s school district, which has a policy of wardialing if your kid cuts class or if your ex-wife forgets to disarm it before pulling them out for a doctor’s appointment.  Most importantly, The Intern had learned some valuable project planning lessons and we got some ideas for further problems to put him on based on how he solved this one.

BugStomperJones showed up after noon, pulling a cooler in a Radio Flier behind him.  Calling everyone over and flinging over the lid, he began handing out To-Go boxes of crêpes from what seemed like it could be every breakfast restaurant in a 3 mile radius.  Quest complete, he claimed 500XP, retired his office, and closed the door behind him.  Moments later, he flung it back open and bellowed at the QA pen.

&gt;**BugStomperJones**: Hey!  Which one of you crêpe-faced feckos Sharpied all over my whiteboard?!

1. How bad is the grade deflation/ does it affect getting into grad school?
2. How helpful are the professors generally (willing to answer questions, have accessible office hours, etc)
3. Do a good amount of profs let undergrads do research? 
4. How hard is it to have a social life?

5vnz2i,0,2017-02-22,I accepted a summer internship earlier this month with a company because I was afraid of having an internship. Now a company I actually want to work for wants to interview me. Help! :(,RarestCentipede,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5vnz2i/i_accepted_a_summer_internship_earlier_this_month/,"So I interviewed for this job a month or so ago and it was a pretty okay I.T. gig. I had been seeking a summer job since the fall so I could lock something in and be secure. It wasn't the most glamorous job in the world but the offer was good and I wasn't expecting to get any more interviews before the summer.

Fast forward to now, I spoke with a company visiting my college that I had applied to last semester and been rejected from the position I applied to. I stopped by looking for a fall gig, having already found a summer internship. Since they'd turned me down once when I applied I figured it wouldn't go anywhere this time.

But nope. They took my resume and they emailed me today... about a summer internship. Now the problem is, I've already signed and returned my job offer acceptance form to the first company. But that's an I.T. thing and this is an actual software engineering internship with a big name company where I could learn a lot and it would look really good on my resume.

Oh and for the icing on the cake, the company I agreed to work for is 3 hours from my home town... the other job is 1 hour away. I was going to have to live near the company and commute home on the weekends, but the other job is close enough to commute to from home and way more beneficial to my career to have on my resume.

**TL;DR:** accepted a decent job offer way too early out of FOMO, and now that I've put my signature on their paperwork a company I have been gunning for actually wants to interview me. Both jobs are summer internships, but the good one is a software engineering job 1 hour from home and the other is I.T. and I'd have to move for the summer. Am I screwed because I signed the paperwork or can I try to get out of it if I'm offered this new position after I interview?"

5vohjk,17,2017-02-23,Handling year end reviews: Salary negotiations,juicyfruit500mg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5vohjk/handling_year_end_reviews_salary_negotiations/,"Hello all,

Last year I accepted a position at 63k as a systems analyst out of college at a company I was an intern for for almost a year.  My two main roles included 1. A sales package automation with KPI's, reporting tools, etc. 2. Some application development. 
About halfway through the year the application development falls off and I wasn't really needed to fill that role.  

My sales package was a success and has fully automated functionality and impresses clients.  I was told that I can fully focus on just this (the package) and not worry about the application development.  I began to find that after I automated most of it and added features I had a decent amount of free time at work.  I figured that I should try and take on more responsibilities so I asked to help with data requests on another team.  The data requests begin to pile in and on that team I get put on a number of various software development projects and other projects.  The reason why I am doing work on 2 teams and various people is because it is all in the same department and I am not going to say ""no"" I won't do it.  Eventually I move onto the data request team for the data work and software development while I still perform the package work.

So my job has evolved into 1. Package maintenance, automation, and running package - 15-20%.  2. Data ad hoc requests 30-40%. 3. Various other development for clients/reporting purposes 30%.  On top of this I am doing maintenance of the department's internal sites (various amount of them) and making features/small programs on these sites. I am doing basically the job I signed up for and two more major functions my team provides all while doing these little ad hoc consulting projects and other work.  I am literally slammed and can easily work 50-60 hours a week with my load but I cram to do it in 40-45 and let it go to the next week. 

Because my role has grown tremendously and I have completely outdone my job requirement I thought I would be in the top 20% of performers and I was which I was happy about.  I thought a very reasonable salary hike would be from 63k to 70k considering all the work I've been doing and the fact that I live in a major east coast city etc.  (More than fair honestly considering the amount of work I have been doing).  I was going to ask for 75k but I decided that 70k would probably be much easier to get considering all the shit I've been doing.  A month or two before my boss tells me he agrees with those numbers and thinks they are reasonable.

I have my meeting and my salary goes from 63k to 65k.  They say that this 2k hike was almost double/triple some of the hikes other people/teams got.  This amount was determined before the meeting even happened with 0 room for negotiation.  They say that even though my position changed there is only a certain percentage it can go up (like 5%, mine was 4.5%) without getting a full out promotion.  I state that this is unfair because my roles have tremendously changed and I have so much more responsibility and a lot of work and great benefits to many teams to showcase that.    They then say the only way I can get to this 70k number is if I basically threaten to leave the company or get a promotion which they said would happen in two years.  

This demotivates the hell out of me.  I have done hundreds of requests, so much development, added many features, coded in around 5-7 data related languages to basically say I can't get 5 more grand and this is a company with 100 billion+ revenue.  I have friends working directly in the city nearby making 80k literally dragging boxes to create web applications and doing maybe a little SQL and I am in the suburbs making 20k less doing the work of 2 people.  

Anyway, now I can see why people jump ship so frequently in the tech world - Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this.  I guess the most obvious thing is to start applying to other jobs and use it as leverage if they won't budge on that small increase they gave me.  However I enjoy my company and my leadership but I just feel like I am doing wayyyy too much for the amount of money I am getting for it.  If I were doing maybe 1-2 of those areas and all of the related work that goes with them then I would be fine with a 2k jump but I am scrambling and in panic mode everyday.  They blame HR for only allowing such small jumps in pay. 

Sorry for the long post/braindump but any advice would be great.  It sucks that I took the risk by taking on way more responsibilities/stress and seem to barely have made a difference in where my salary ended year end and it is actually depressing to be honest.  I made a lot of sacrifices, worked some weekends/nights without being asked, did personal development pertaining to my job outside of work, and pushed the envelope every single day as a fully functional and engaged worker to basically recieve a cost of living increase - I hardly get emotional but I am very angry/upset with the treatment I have received.  The only real positives I have from this experience is the amount of stuff I have learned in my field in the past year by taking on so much work so while my pay has not gone up tremendously I feel like my value has and it will eventually be recognized(at this place or another).  I tried to pretend like it didn't matter/start applying place and I was okay with all of this but I couldn't help but voice how unfair I felt it was.

My family just says it seems like an unfair position to be in but didn't really provide me with any real advice or direction.  I am sure a lot of you have been in the same boat and I would love to hear your opinions on how to handle a situation like this

Tldr: young employee does way more than he needs to expecting a very reasonable 7k increase in pay living in major metro area and receives cost of living increase instead laced with excuses"

I am a 3rd year CS student with no internships but with a few side projects.

On both interviews, I didn't do so well on the coding portion on both. After the interviews ended I searched up the answers online and I should of known the process of solving all the questions, is this confirmation bias? Although I haven't received a decision yet, I just don't think I did good enough to land the internships or another interview with the companies.

Where do I go from here? I think I'm pretty confident in the basic algorithms and data structures but I can't seem to connect the dots when it comes to solving coding problems. What can I do to practice this? Just doing leetcode problems is not really helping.

I'm pretty anxious that out of around a 100 applications, I've received no responses or just rejections. After the 100 applications, I've realized I applied to large companies (Lockheed, GDEB, L3), but I thought I should apply to smaller companies. How do I come about finding them? 

My current strategy in head... Going on SBIR to find small firms and applying to internships. I have a linkedin profile and my university's career finder. I will try to reach out to people but it's very hard with my limited resources. 

I'm pretty anxious with the idea that I'm a junior in EE that might not get an internship. Kinda wanna cry too... Any help would be much appreciated. I will post my resume for criticism and an example cover letter for the same reason. Any resources would be much helpful. 

I do have a career fair next week with companies like NYPA, Moog, and a bit more. Any tips on what to say, what questions to ask would be really helpful. 

I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant, I really needed to express myself somehow. I've been feeling more down and down as the semester progresses with no luck in responses. I have a 3.12 gpa if that helps (which I believe hurts me when applying). I did have a 3.6gpa last semester (because I started to realize my gpa is the reason my mental happiness is suffering).

So I'm 22 years old nearing the end of my college career, and for some reason, I wait until now to wonder if I have ADD. My grades haven't always been the best and procrastination is normal for me.  I really started noticing it when living with my roommates, where they would talk to me and I would space out and no my head, but more frequently I cut them off and bring up a new topic altogether, to which my friend replies by saying ""you need to get yourself checked for ADD."" Even during interviews for internships and jobs (since it's my senior year, and it's more frequent now) I find myself asking the interviewer to repeat him/her self a lot. At the end of answering a question I'm always unsure if I answered the question, to which I say ""I hope I answered your question"" more often than I should probably have to. Another instance is trying to learn Calculus from last semester, where I literally went through a mental block, and everything I saw and heard went through my ear and out the other, because I couldn't comprehend the complexity of the material. I really want to get this issue addressed because if I really do have it like I think I do, I don't want it to be a liability when I enter my career.

My parents honestly think I just have to work harder, and that I'm just not putting forth my best work, even though I honestly try to. I'm also hesitant to even bring it up to them because I don't want them to assume that I'm trying to get my hands on any medication. 

TL;DR 

I've waited until I'm 22 to address if I may have ADD/ADHD. The signs point to it, but I'm unsure with how to communicate with my parents that I have it, without them overreacting and them not taking me seriously."

I'm a current student in Australia and looking to get into software engineering. 
I was previously studying IT and hating it, so I've changed course to CS. 

While doing my IT degree, I took on a paid placement (internship) at a company doing help desk &amp; basic windows server admin. I've finished that and go back to Uni for my first semester of CS on Monday. 

As the help desk placement ended, they offered me a role training staff to use software within the company, part-time during uni.

I've been doing this for about two weeks and:

* I have no idea what I'm doing (no qualification / training to train others) 
* Management seem to blunder everything
* Have suspicions that role was offered to me kind of as charity (management change  &amp; 3 month contract gives me this idea)

I not sure if I should continue this, as it ends up taking time out of my days when I'm sure I should be studying. 

I don't want to sound ungrateful, and I'm not one to drop a job because I don't enjoy it (washed dishes for 1.5 years before internship)

Do you think training experience will be looked upon favorably when I get out of Uni? 
Do you think that help desk experience will matter at all in software eng? 
Should I just tough it out and learn all I can from the experience? 
Have you had your responsibilities change wildly in a workplace, and how did you handle it? 

It seems very difficult to get a software job and I'm kind of having a panic attack, so let me know what you think."

Now, one of the items I am listing on my portfolio is an Android game I've written at the end of my first year. I feel like it should technically be a good thing to list since it's the only item on there in which I show my use of LibGDX.

I have talked to an American friend of mine who studies here in the Netherlands as well.

Since then nothing has gone right. I was so stressed at 3 months in that I started puking about 2 times a week before going to work. 

I went to see my doctor and got prescribed an antidepressant  to make me less stressed. It zapped my motivation for the most part but I stopped throwing up ever morning and my performance slightly improved. 

As time went on I was continuously told that I was performing adequately for my current level, but there was an expectation that I would be promoted within 2 years. Since I wasn't on the path for that to happen I was put on a plan to improve performance. I would frequently stay up late and stress out about spending too much time on small issues, or if I hadn't spoken up during a meeting. My old symptoms of nausea and diarreah got worse than ever. 

Then one day when I was at work and on the toilet for abouth the 3rd time that day, I felt an agonizing pain in my butthole. It felt like it was ripped open. The next two bowel movements were the same and each brought me to tears. I was biting down some rolled up toilet paper to prevent my self from screaming. I left work early because it got to the point I couldn't sit down after the bowel movements. 

At first doctors told me it would heal on its own, but couldn't provide an explanation for what would cause it. After a week of working from home it felt worse and I started seeing blood in my stool so I went back to see another doctor. It got to the point where after a bowel movement there would a stream of blood that would turn the water red. 3 months of medical leave, 4 doctors later, 2 MRIs, and 2 probes up the butt later I am diagnosed with Crohn's disease and told I would eventually need a colostomy bag if things didn't change. 

My doctor tried to prescribe my Remicade but my insurance denied it saying I had to try Humira for at least a few months. This got the symptoms back to just nausea every morning and the occasional vomiting when I don't get sleep or am stressed out at work. 

My blood work is coming back clean so far, but I still feel nauseous every morning before work and will throw up on occasion. My body can't sustain a job like this. Now I have been there 3+ years and I am worried I chose the wrong career. My team seems to consider me worthless; they no longer review my code unless I ask them.  According to my manager my peer reviews are coming back saying I provide no special use, and I find myself agreeing with them more and more each day. 

Financially this job is about 2/3rds of my income. I could stand to take a significant pay decrease and still live a comfortable life due to other resources. I still need income and health insurance though. 

I really want to find a job that is less stressful and gives me more free time to focus on being a healthy person. I feel like I need that at this point in my life, but I am worried what this will do for my long term career. Would a temporary step down in job responsibilities be a red flag to future employers? I also don't even know where to begin to look for a job that would require less hours a week and night time pages. I'm not sure if I should be bringing up these health issues when looking for a job."

""Made database calls with php and displayed expected output to the user""

It sounds pretty awkward to me and I am not sure how to rephrase it. Basically I would be making webpages for clients mostly search/filter pages where a user would search for items using key words and filters and I would return the expected results. But my way of phrasing it sounds a bit awkward I think, can anyone help me re-write it?  Also I need some help thinking of buzz verbs for the two lines above that as well.. thanks!

Is there an easier way to implement these changes rather than  remoting into each employee 's individual machine and changing it in their Outook client? The real sticking point is that 50 or so employees are working on remote sites, and they frequently either don't have their laptops on them, or don't have Internet access.

Bounced around working $15 hourly jobs until I fell into an IT position.  I was at my local City Council meeting and they were debating the cost of a particular computer issue that they obviously didn't understand and I simply offered to do it for them.  (It was something absurdly simple, on the order of setting up wireless printing)  Having no dedicated IT staff they offered me a job on the spot.  

I learned what I needed, and in many cases, far more than was needed, without any formal training.  And in doing so found how much I enjoyed programming.  I wrote a few small helper programs for work and finally clicked that I had found what I wanted to do.  Eventually decided to go back to college and obtain a degree was the next logical step and with my previous coursework I'll be finishing said degree in May after only 2 years.  

Herein lies the problem, during my one summer of this college stint I was not really ready for an internship, having only completed 3-4 CS classes, and to finish my degree I have been taking 18-21 credit hours of classes this year.  Between that and working my IT job, it's taken the option of an internship off the table for me before graduation.  

I do have a plethora of non-internship resume boosters; I was a member of a math focused research group where I was able to do some non coursework programming in, basically creating a program that would allow a user to examine multiple variable data sets (years worth of weather data from hundreds of sites) and examine them searching for user specified correlation points. I'm one of 10 of my school's research ambassadors to the state government, I chair several city boards, etc.  But what I'm lacking is that on the job flow of working with other programmers in an environment dedicated to it.

I'm getting closer and closer to graduation and I'm honestly not sure what positions I should be applying for.  Should I be applying for Junior programming positions, Internships with the hope that a full-time position would follow, standard Developer postings?  I know the obvious answer is all of these, but with a finite amount of time it would be nice to focus on the best choice.

* 16 years of experience as software engineer
* Last 10 years as web developer at small/medium website using .Net
* Promoted to Senior Developer, then Principal Developer, now Technical Lead
* US Permanent resident, soon to be US citizen
* 4 year degree from small, industry-oriented German university, found to be equivalent to BS in CS and media technology (double major)
* Self-converted GPA of 3.7 (weighting all classes equally) using WES
* Completed degree in 7 semesters instead of the normal 8, by doing the required internships between semesters
* Worked ~20 hours per week as web developer in addition to classes in final 2 years
* Thesis project in computer graphics/VR at EADS Airbus, awarded as best thesis of graduating class, published as research paper
* Started MS in CS at German distance learning university about 10 years ago, but stopped after moving to US (completed only one course, Formal Logic)
* Two half-hearted attempts to get into San Jose State MSCS program, didn't hear back from them


Goals:

* Learn new stuff, broaden horizons
* Dive deeper into CS fundamentals
* Get an edge in the job market
* Move from the repetitive field of web development into more exciting fields that require more engineering, less managing


Questions:

* Given my background, I think the program will be a challenge, but doable. What do you think?
* 16 years out of college, I won’t have access to any meaningful academic references. Also, I had the same boss in the last 7 years, and my previous manager is deceased. I could hit up some former co-workers with more or less impressive titles and ask them for a favor. Suggestions?
* Many of the subjects on my transcript sound very generic and basic. “Computer Programming”, or “Software Design and Engineering”. Should I include an explanation what each course entailed, if possible?
* Which of the bullet points above should I mention/elaborate on in my essays, which should I rather leave out?
* My experience with SJSU was a weird one: The first time I applied, I received a note saying that my application was incomplete (I thought I sent everything), and that my application was moved to the next available term. So I sent everything again, but didn’t hear back from them. When I tried to call a number of the international admissions office (I didn’t have my green card yet at the time), I got a recorded message that the number no longer is assigned to anyone. I admit I gave up easily at that point, having paid the application fee twice and everything, but the whole experience put me off.

1. Am I completely borked? I'm just going to throw out a bunch of application to anywhere that seems at least somewhat reasonable for me to apply to, but my low GPA and lack of projects is discouraging when looking at the various job requirements.
2. Even if certain companies in my area aren’t hiring, should I just send them a resume regardless? I’ve heard I could do that from a few friends, but just wanted to be sure before I went off and did that.
3. I mostly have been working general labor and clerical positions during the summer up until now, with no internship jobs just yet. Am I screwed for finding a developer job when I graduate considering I don’t have an employment history with tech jobs?
I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this post and offer some constructive advice. I am also willing to send someone a copy of my resume for review/critique.

Anyways, I'm now at a 4 year university I'm literally taking Data Structures along with my internship just to give you an idea of where I'm at. 


I'm working on the cloud team which does mainly AWS stuff but I expressed interest in becoming a dev so they gave me my own project to work on in Node.js and I'm working with one of the more experienced devs on our team (who actually does a lot of the interviews for hiring devs)The great thing is that I'm getting great feedback and advice on my code, and I get helping writing unit tests using mocha, Sinon etc. (learning test driven development) and the other great thing is it seems this app I'm working on will actually be used by the company!  


Also I still work part time at a retail store making $15 doing tech support basically (on the weekends) I'm planning on quitting this job soon though although it has decent perks unless you guys have advise not to


So the way I see it I have a few options:


If after my coop they offer me a full time position I can take that and continue to finish my degree one class at a time on the side


If after my coop they don't offer me something else, I can apply other places as an intern or full time and work there while completing my degree on the side


Go back to school full time take a loan/financial aid and finish ASAP then apply for real jobs (1.5-2 years) I'll probably end up with about $20-30k loans 


Go back to school full time and work a retail job I actually still work at right now, which I'm honestly starting to hate. ($15/hr) until I finish my degree. 


I live in the Midwest USA to give context.

Is it possible to get a FT job while finishing school on the side? Is it worth it? Is the degree worth finishing soon?

5vvmwm,1,2017-02-23,Why I feel the software industry will become insanely competitive going into the future...,codedinconfusion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5vvmwm/why_i_feel_the_software_industry_will_become/,"Think of it like this. Right now, as a developer in America, you're competing against, well, mostly other American and Western developers for the same positions. The only competition coming at you from outside the West are upper-middle class people from India/etc. that were fortunate enough to come here, get educated, and learn those skills. Only 26% of Indians even have internet access as of 2016. 

Fast-forward 10-20 years into the future. Education institutions in countries like India and China will improve their quality-control and will turn out a generation of intelligent people who grew up with computers(and reliable internet access), much like Millennials in the West today. Long-gone will be the days of the code-robots that people in the West complain about when they think of an Indian/foreign developer. 

The next generation of students graduating in America will have to compete not only with their Western counterparts for decent software engineering jobs, but also with hundreds of millions of equally capable students from India and China. In 2017, such competitors don't exist yet because the current generation there never had computers/internet access growing up, and thus those people will likely fall in line with the stereotypes surrounding foreign developers. 

But our children, they'll face an environment of incredible competitiveness. They'll have to have fleshed-out github/linkedin/etc. by the time they start middle school, or heck even before they finish elementary school if they want to have a chance of even working for what we consider mediocre companies today.  

And so ends my rant, this will impact other industries as well, but given the culture in countries like India and China(kids are pushed to do tech/engineering), it will impact the CS field. It'll mean unimaginable innovation/advancement in tech, but also will drive up competition into what we'd consider as excessive today.   

Any input is appreciated, please note I never worked in the software industry(although I'm looking for internships) and am still in college so I might be talking out of my ass here.

We've learned how to code in C, Python and Perl. In the past I have experience with ActionScript (an object oriented language very similar to JavaScript but exclusive to Adobe), I've done a course on Java from SoloLearn and I've been exposed to HTML here and there because I like to mess with my blog's structure lmao 

I've been applying to summer internships and this is what my resume consists of:

Skills
Programming (C, Perl, Python, ActionScript, limited knowledge of Java and HTML (based on highschool))

Operating Systems (MS, iOS, LINUX)

Projects (one individual project from HS which is a maze game coded in ActionScript, one group project that is basically a design document and prototype of an app and it's user interface (no coding) and a CSV parsing program in Perl)

As you can see, my projects are very limited and the other projects I've done are like really basic code stuff which I linked to my gist on github. I don't have any significant contributions on github which is why I put the link to my gist instead.

Anyway I've been applying to internships and have applied to at least 20+ in the past couple of weeks with absolutely no luck. A part of me is kind of nervous about even if I get an interview because I seriously don't think I am good enough programmer to be working at an internship. At the same time, I am not certain about what level I should be on to be considered ""good enough"" to be working at an internship.

A part of me wants to get an internship because I really want to learn about working in software, gain experience and $$$. At the same time I'm nervous about actually getting to the interview and not doing well because I feel like I don't know shit. And then if somehow a desperate company hires me I won't know how to do anything. 

I know this seems trivial but I really don't know what to expect in the software industry or what kind of experience/knowledge I need to have. 

I guess what I'm asking here is if I should bother putting in time and energy looking for an internship or if I should just spend my summer improving my coding and working on projects. I'm not exactly sure what would help me more in terms of my career goals.

I just can't tell what exactly it is that's causing nobody to even respond to my applications. I went to my university's career fair and got an interview (two places never contacted me after saying in person that they would interview me), but I won't hear back from that place for a few weeks, and I doubt I'll get it anyways. I've applied at every position on my university's internship website, and now I'm using Indeed and Glassdoor and I've run out of places to apply to. Is it my resume?

About three years ago I became obsessed with becoming a web developer. I've self-taught for 2 years (doing a small bit of App Dev at my job), and decided to go back to school for a Masters. I'm going to a school where my wife works as a professor because there's a discount, and the school only has an IT program for masters (I have a BA in Music and going back for another Bachelors degree seemed unreasonable). IT seems to be a good program for a web developer, because we're studying networking, databases, and web admin. 

So I want to start jumping into the industry, and I'm applying for summer internships. The companies in the area seem to divide up their internships by degree, and the IT internships are doing what you'd expect. The Software Development Internships seem to cater more to CS degree's (or Information Systems). 

Does anyone have experience with *transitioning* from pure IT to Software Dev? Do companies usually have hard-limits about who can be a Dev? Is it wrong to try and mess with the system? Am I crazy? "

Recently, I have been much more interested in becoming a Quant. I just had a few questions about it specifically about the path I should take, the job, and exit opps.

1. ~~From my understanding of the job, it is very math intensive and most require a Masters if not PhD in Mathematical Finance/Physics etc. I was planning on getting an MFE after I graduate. I was looking at stats and it seems that 12%~ of admitted students a Berkeley, as an example, have a degree in Finance/Business. I am just curious, without a minor in Mathematics (or major), how much does it limit my options (even with a minor in CS). If it matters, I have a 3.86 cGPA.~~

2. ~~What type of internships should I be looking for in third year summer that would make me look attractive to MFE graduate programs? Should I be looking for Capital Markets internships or more software/IT related internships at financial institutions?~~

3. What are the exit opportunities like? Considering the amount of education you need to become a Quant, it doesn't seem like there are a lot of related areas you would be able to exit to that would be able to use the the education (MFE) that you obtained. 

4. This is more of a bonus question for anyone who is a quant but would you say that the job/pay was worth the amount of education needed to land the job? I know this is completely subjective, but is becoming a quant what you expected it to be?


Hopefully this question hasn't been asked too many times, I have read a few from the search and they have been very useful! Would love to get a little bit more insight on how to become a quant and what it is like as a quant.

I am now extremely motivated and my goal is to get an entry level software engineering job at one of the Big 4 preferably Facebook. I have a loose plan on how to accomplish this goal but was looking for some feedback and other stuff.

1) Keep at least 3.5 GPA

2) Complete at least 1 side project preferably two during two semesters of classes

3) Have internships every summer

4) Be a Project Manager/Officer in my computer science club

5) Find a part time software dev job (If this happens side projects would be limited by a lot most likely)

So yeah I am only a freshman so these goals may be a little too ambitious/naive but a few questions to go with this plan?

Are these feasible?

How important is GPA?

For those in the college station area... Where can I find part time dev jobs? I googled and glass doored a bunch and only found two.

How likely is it for me to get an internship to Facebook? I'm not sure how much they recruit at TAMU. I do know that Microsoft recruits a bunch here tho. So maybe my path would be Intern at MSFT then FACEBOOK?

Other advice is always welcomed as well!

They use Fastrack (Mediware Company) primarily as their information tracking system (from patient/client information to equipment/inventory information). From what I have learned, Fastrack uses SQL server as a database system.


The warehouse workers are currently using a handheld Motorola MC5590 as a bardcode scanner/data collection device via WiFi but it's only able to receive and record new inventory and update the database. They want a newer handheld device that can also update the database when equipment/items are being sent out for delivery to clients.

I've done the ""actively helping"" role (proofing resumes as much as I'm able) and the ""just be a supportive SO"" and both have left me frustrated so I am seeking third party advice.


I'm going to the internet for advice because this problem has become as much of a financial issue as it is an emotional one. He has paid rent, but it's been a year and his E-fund is exhausted. He is in debt to his parents and has a maxed out CC (He's said it's $20k but idk if that includes family loans or not). I am very, very concerned by this.

Okay now on to him:

 * **Education:** BS in CSC
 * **Experience:** Software Engineer, multiple relevant internships, and one full-time engineer job straight out of college at a software consulting firm for 5 years
 * **Location:** SF Bay Area
 * **Prior Salary:** I think it started out ~60k, but grew rapidly at his firm and I think it ended around $90k
 * **Job Departure:** Not entirely sure, but it was related to quality/quantity of output (maybe trouble adapting to new project technologies)? Had some kind of ""provisionary warning"" a month or two out to improve and then was let go. I also know his supervisor mentioned that one (or some PMs) felt like they couldn't place him on projects.
 * **Types of work:** full stack but mostly back end, anywhere from apps to web dev. I think he did a lot of work on the company's website and internal server which may have contributed to the issue (not billable?). 
 * **Other prior job details:** He didn't have any timecard system that I'm aware of. He rarely had need to stay overtime. He didn't have regular performance reviews. He went years getting $10k pay hikes and then the last year seems to be when the bad ""reviews"" (not that there was an official one really) started. His complaint as a partner to me towards the end was that he was stuck on internal company projects and he felt ""useless"" or ""bored"" (I have heard from others on this sub/reddit that some companies use this method to give low performers a slow death to try and boot em). Some time ago (2 or 3 years before getting let go) he took one day of PTO to interview for a new job, and I think some of his coworkers (not manager level) may have caught him on public transit (he was in a suit on a weekday). I honestly don't know if anyone told his supervisor or not, but given the timeframe it doesn't seem likely to have caused retaliation. 
 

Okay so that's the background. Now here's the job hunt info up until now:

 * He didn't get serious about jobsearch until probably 4-6 months after job loss (yeah I know. I was vocal about this and I warned him about The Resume Gap).
 * He has not applied to temporary/retail work and this is probably a pride issue.
 * He stays up until past midnight and sleeps until noon unless there's an interview. 
 * His depression is real. He started going to a therapist but quit cause he can no longer afford it.
 * I think most of his searching has been somewhat ""shotgun""-style (low effort applications through LinkedIn)
 * for the past 3 or 4 months he's had regular phone interviews (maybe averaging 2 a week, both general and technical) and a handful of in-person (maybe half a dozen). He wears suits to interviews.
 * he's done probably a dozen or more ""code challenges"" (which seem to vary from 30 minutes to 2 day's worth of effort), some of which led to immediate rejections, others have lead to interviews.
 * when discussing salary he seems to be asking for $120-130k (using the ""from what I can see in the market"" line). This is kind of what shocked and hurt me the most as this seems like a pretty huge number for a long-term unemployed person to bank on.
 * I think he started looking at pet-friendly orgs (like his prior job) but I don't know if that's still happening, or if he's mentioning it in interviews (at this point in time I really hope not). I've told him that if it comes to it we can deal with that some other way (doggy daycare, dogwalker, etc.)


I am not privy to most of these conversations but I think it's clear there's something going on in these interviews. But I'm at a point now where anything critical I say he takes very personally (""I guess I'm just a fuckup"") and as such I've avoided helping him any further.


I am not asking for relationship advice but I have lost perspective on whether there is a serious problem or if this is just going to be how it is for a while. If there are technical/job search red flags that he needs to understand I am willing to bring them up even if it means hitting a brick wall again. I don't know if I can go another 6 months-year without seeing progress (I can afford my lifestyle/rent but he certainly cannot and watching him go into debt worries me).


Can I get a lifeline? If there are any other tidbits that would help I can try and elaborate. Thanks.

Disclaimer on our relationship: Together almost 10 years, have lived together for 4 years. I work full time in a different industry and we split bills equal.  He has not asked me for money and I have not given him anything substantial. However in a subtle way I've been paying more of the day-to-day bills (food/vet, etc). We live in a suburb, 30 mins to an hour drive to get to any friends or family. He has a car (I don’t and rely on crappy public transportation) but outright refuses to visit friends anymore (even if I insist on paying for gas and fun money).

I'm potentially an incoming grad student, and some of the posts about the difficulty of grad school here scare me:

https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/5vt7uv/its_too_hard_i_quit/

I'm not bad by any means, but I was never a god like programmer at my internships, and normally, I would slowly but surely get my work done whereas the interns from uwaterloo or stanford would kill me speed wise. If I were to go here, I'd probably end up approaching the work in the same way I approached my internships (work my ass off), but I'm worried that this wouldn't cut it, because of the IQ difference. I also really don't want to TA a class and hold someone back due to my own incompetence.

Obviously I know the TDP program in the US pays more and gives you corporate housing, but what about in terms of the learning experience and ""reputation""?

I'm hoping to get interviews at top tech companies in the US (Big N, etc) after I graduate, will this be any better or worse for doing that than the average software internship in Canada? "

I have already made a schedule of classes that will allow me to graduate in about 2 more years (So ~3 years in total). I'm finishing off my first year and have a internship for this summer (systems analyst at a big bank). After which I'll start second year and have two options:

1. Continue studying straight for the next 2 years and get my degree in CS done and look for jobs as a new grad with 1-2 internships. 

2. Take some time off and look for 4-5 more internships (that will make my time in University equal to 3 years + (number of additional internships * 4 months).

Basically, I've been hearing that Internships are easier to get than full time jobs but I've also been hearing that a full time job looks better than an internship on a resume. 



TLDR; Do internships on off terms and extend graduation or speed up graduation and look for a job as a new grad? "
5w2jgt,5,2017-02-25,Am I ready for an internship?,CptKirk18,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5w2jgt/am_i_ready_for_an_internship/,"I am really contemplating applying for an internship this summer. There is one local company that just reposted an ad for software/computer engineer interns less than a week ago and my gut is telling me to go ahead and try for it. I have some concerns tho....

I am almost done with my sophomore year of college studying computer engineering and I have only really taken the base engineering courses. This semester I have finally started some CS classes (Linux and C). The post says that a they want someone with C/C++/C#/ or Java experience. They also mention experience with data structures and or objected oriented design. The only language I am familiar with is C and that is from my coursework this semester (which I am doing very well in) and what I have done with my Arduino. I have not yet taken a class on data structures.

I know that applying for the internship is the first step and then getting an interview would then be the next step. I am just somewhat concerned though that let's say I somehow manage to land the internship what if get there and I find I am in way over my head. I just don't want to possibly ruin a good opportunity if I could just wait another year get some more experience and then apply. What do y'all think?

The company is a local Garmin btw."

I'm a freshman at a UC majoring in CS &amp; Math. I applied to close to 100+ internships for the summer of 2017, and did not get a single interview. Although I am a freshman, I mentioned on my resume that I'm a sophomore (since I'll graduate in 3 years). I have no idea what's wrong with my resume. I have more experience and projects than a lot of juniors I know who got internships at big companies.

Should I be worried about this? I have no idea what to do and I feel like I'm wasting my money and time by going to college."
5w2qfx,6,2017-02-25,What's the most important thing to know coming out of a questionable IT environment?,temporius,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5w2qfx/whats_the_most_important_thing_to_know_coming_out/,"Several years ago, I had an IT internship that was in an environment that was quite far from ideal. We had unsupported Windows versions, Windows systems with several months of uptime (and thus several months of updates not installed),  poorly synchronized time, which caused issues, ""clusters"" which had all but one host removed, and said host had one NIC, shared user accounts, frequent firefighting, and all kinds of mess.

Today, I have a rather high chance I'll be doing sysadmin work in the near future. While I believe I can handle it (it's Linux, which I understand unlike that Windows mess), I'm pretty certain my prior experience isn't going to be entirely helpful. I already know that setting things up to alert you before things become an emergency is invaluable, as is resolving things then rather than waiting for it to become an emergency (like not ignoring pings about a server's disk being 100% full until we get a user email about it). I know that the only time you should be in after hours or on weekends if there's something that you can't do during business hours, like take down your timesheet system for an update. However, I still feel a bit unprepared.

So I would like to ask what you think is the single most important thing to know that can't be learned in a bad IT environment, or what the most important to leave behind from that environment is?"

&amp;nbsp;

Sebastian floats in the middle aisle of the humvee.  “Okay, everyone.  Here’s the plan.  Aristespha, you got medical supplies, and digging for any kind of info about the ruins in the area.”

Aristespha flips through a menu on her tablet and taps in a few entries.  “Any problems with self-adhesive bandages or the quick patch spray I got last time?”

Dretphi shakes her head.  Sotalia points to Cideeda across from her the in driver’s seat and Cideeda also shakes her head.  Sotalia twists in her seat and leans out to look at Aristespha.  “We’re good here.”

Aristespha nods and writes down notes into the tablet with the pen stylus.  Sebastian turns to Dretphi sitting in her back seat.  “Dretphi, stock up on the food and expendable gear.  Since we’ll probably be back to ruin exploration, if you find a good deal on decent spotlights, grab a few please.”

Dretphi confirms silently as her eyes focus on her aetherphone and she enters some words on a list.  Cideeda gets Dretphi’s attention through the rearview mirror.  “Hey, if you find any more of that jerky in the yellow and green bag, get me a few packs.”

Dretphi gives a thumbs up back to Cideeda.  Sebastian shifts his attention to Sotalia.  “Sotalia, you know what magical stuff you need to get, but keep an eye out for any more of those disposal magic detector sticks.  Also, work with Aristespha with getting any local history, recent and ancient.”

Sotalia leans back into the aisle from the front passenger’s seat and glances at Aristespha.  “You hitting the pharmacy first?”

Aristespha shifts her gaze up to meet Sotalia.  “Yes.  I’ll message you my list of magical supplies I need, real quick.  There.”

Sotalia checks her aetherphone.  “Got it.  Message me when you get done and we’ll figure what places to check out.”

Aristespha confirms with a gloved hand, as she resumes making more notes into tablet.  Sebastian cranes his head over towards Cideeda.  “Cideeda.  Ammo, tech toys, selling of loot, and some updated reading material?  Anything I’m missing?”

Cideeda shakes her head, keeping her eyes on the road.  “Not that I can think of, I’ll message Aristespha if I think of anything, unless the sword has figured out how to use the AetherNet.”

Sebastian perks a brow and turns his head to glare at the sheathed sword in the aisle next to Aristespha.  “No, turns out a thousand year old relic isn’t keen on keeping with the times.  Not much of a conversationalist either, since I moved in.”

Sebastian finally turns to Bach.  “As for you Bach, I figured you could tag along with Cideeda and-”

He lunges his head forward to stare intensely at the old flip aetherphone Bach holds in his hands.  Sebastian reflexively laughs at seeing the old device.  “Holy shit!  And get you a new phone!  Speaking of a fuckin’ relic, is that the same one you had in school?!”

Bach defensively darts his head around and quickly realizes the attention towards his old phone.  “Y-Yes.  What about it?!  It still works just fine!”

Sebastian raises his hands up and attempts to calm Bach.  “Hey now!  No judging here.  I’m gonna hook you up, bro.  Cideeda, can you get this man a proper phone?”

Cideeda momentary flicks her eyes into the rear-view mirror, with her signature toothy grin.  “Will do!  I saw one or two places that should carry decent phones.”

Sotalia spins completely around in her seat and peers over the head rest at Bach.  Her eyes widen and she smirks.  Sotalia’s hand whips out and snatches the phone right out of Bach’s hand.  “Ooo, let me see!”

Bach blinks at the sudden loss of his phone, then tries to reach around the front seat after it.  Sotalia slaps a hand underneath her seat and pulls a bar up.  She slides her seat forward and mostly out of range of Bach’s effective arm range.  “I’ve haven’t seen one of these since graduate school!  Does it have any of the good games on it?”

Bach settles back down and crosses his arms, accepting defeat and remembering which way Sotalia’s horns point.  “A few.  I’d like my phone back, please.”

Sotalia playfully sighs and rolls her eyes.  “Okay.  Here you go.”

Sotalia holds the old phone over and back behind her seat.  Bach takes his phone back, flips it open, and checks it.  Sotalia pulls the bar underneath her seat again and attempts to slide the seat back, but only manages a few centimeters.  She struggles against a force acting upon the seat.  Dretphi gives a slight smile at the scene.  Sebastian looks down at Bach and Bach’s boot pushing against Sotalia’s struggling seat and shakes his head.  Bach holds a finger up and searches through his phone’s menus.  “Just making sure she didn’t do anything to it.”

Sotalia crooks her head around the seat and traces Bach’s leg to the back.  “I didn’t do anything to it!  Really!  Can I have some knee room now!?”

Bach flips the phone closed and removes his boot from the back of the seat.  Sotalia finally slides the seat back away from the dash.

Aristespha points to Bach with her eyes trained on the tablet.  Her arm goes through Sebastian, who cringes momentarily at the sudden intrusion.  “Sebastian.  We need to get Bach officially registered with our group.”

Sebastian side steps clear of Aristespha’s arm and thinks a moment.  “Let’s see…  Ah!  After we are all done, we’ll all meet at the local guild office.  Sounds good, everyone?”

The gathering agrees in their own ways, as the familiar sign to Amaranth Valley comes into view.

&amp;nbsp;

Cideeda pushes open the door of Aether Innovations and Retailers and holds the door for Bach.  Bach steps through with a plastic bag around his arm and pokes at a new aetherphone, completely perplexed at the device.  “Okay…  How do you make call with this thing?!”

Cideeda snorts and points to an icon on the screen.  “The phone icon.”

Bach grumbles and sighs.  “Thank you.”

Cideeda quirks a brow and eyes Bach with a grin, while the two walk on the sidewalk of the open-air mall.  “A man who can weave together technology and magic in ways that astound me and freak-out our mages, undone by a phone.”

Bach continues to navigate through the new menus, icons, and screens.  “It’s massive increase in complexity to a device that didn’t require much from me!  But, having the expanded band two-way radio is nice.”

Cideeda nods and she pushes her phone into a brand new case.  “It costs extra but a good feature for our line of work.  We’ll have to mod it up with the extended frequency chips I got from… the usual sources.”

Bach slips the phone into his side pocket and shrugs.  “Sounds good to me.  So, where to next?”

Cideeda directs Bach towards a game shop.  “There.  Need to pick up some reading material, and I might be able to sell one of the early era chests.”

Bach changes his route to match Cideeda’s as she walks to the doors of the game shop.  Bach opens the door for Cideeda and both enter the store floor.  The store contains a variety of vices for the Nexus nerd, geek, or dork.  Boxes of comic books fill a few aisles of tables.  Board games and books sit on shelves along the wall.  A display counter displays a variety of cards, miniatures, and dice.  A few locals sit in the chairs around open tables, playing games and/or just discussing the latest episodes of shows.  Some give a momentary peek at the door, then resume their activities.  Bach scans over the place and stops with a confused look to Cideeda.  “Why are we in a game shop?  Not that I wouldn’t mind grabbing out the latest issue of Tales of Orion, but...”

Cideeda smiles and gestures to Bach, as they continue navigating the store.  “Well, you have your brother to thank.  Sebastian recruited me right out of a comic book shop.  I was between groups and decided to catch up on the issues of Tinkering Tina I missed.”

Bach thinks a moment and his face grows unamused as memories of his brother’s normal tactics come to mind.  “He tried to flirt with you didn’t he?”

Cideeda rolls her eyes and smirks to Bach.  “Pitifully so.  But, I humored him, found out he needed a technical expert, and I got with the group.  So, I can’t complain about that.”

Bach lowers his head shaking and sighs.  He puzzles at Cideeda.  “What about the comic books?”

Cideeda flips through a few wrapped comics in a box, judging her position in the collection.  “Turns out two comic book geeks are enough for it to get contagious.  And comic books are perfect for down time when you are too far from the Aethernet relays and you have a few hours of night watch to kill.”

Bach tilts his head side to side to mull over the idea and eventually agrees on the concept.  “Makes enough sense to me.  I’m going to look at the miniatures they have.”

Cideeda pauses a moment and catches Bach’s attention before he wanders off too far.  “Wargaming or RPGs?”

Bach holds an indifferent gesture with his hand.  “A little bit of both, but really got interested in miniatures when I figured out how to morph the metal and plastic into custom poses for people.  People pay a lot for custom figures.”

Cideeda ponders the idea in her mind and a devious smirk forms at the opportunities to be had, before resuming her search through the comics.  Bach makes his way to the display and kneels down to examine the various miniatures through the glass.

“Dammit…  Still doesn’t work…  Why won’t it work?”

Bach peers over the counter and sees the shopkeeper attempt to stare a hole through a paperback book on the counter.  The large, round man keeps his fists on his sides and frowns, quietly muttering to himself.  Bach stands up and sneaks a peak at a page of the book, while casually drifting towards the register.  Various magical symbols adorn the page with some brief instructions.  Bach recognizes the book as one of the many from the “Teach yourself magic” genre of books.  He grits his teeth and curls his lip in disgust.  Most of the books in that genre typically have errors, mistakes, and just failures in quality.  The shopkeeper puts his hands on either side of the page and concentrates.  Bach actually senses a slight stir of energy, but something on that page hinders it.  Bach stands next to the register across from the shopkeeper.  A few moments later, the shopkeeper notices Bach, double-takes, and startles slightly.  “Oh!  Hello, welcome to Amaranth’s Wrath Game Emporium!  The name is Steve.  Umm… Can I help you?”

Bach makes eye contact with Steve and twirls his finger at the book.  “You have the ink bottle that came with this?”

Steve looks to either side of him and then spots a bottle sitting on the shelf underneath the counter.  He fetches the bottle and curiously eyes Bach.  “Here it is.  Um…  Are you magically inclined?”

Bach holds his hands up and shrugs.  “Somewhat.  I’m kinda getting back into it.”

Steve happily grins at Bach and respectfully pleads,  “Man, I don’t want to bother you, but if you can share any tips, I’d really appreciate it.  I’ve been trying every book around nothing seems to work.  I feel it, but nothing seems to happen.”

Bach holds his hand out for the bottle.  Steve passes it over and Bach twists the cap off.  He wafts the bottle underneath his nose, then seals the top with a finger and briefly turns the bottle upside down.  He lifts the finger and licks it.  Steve blinks stunned and confused.  Bach quirks his face and groans.  “Yep.  This mix is pretty watered down.  And if its the same stuff they use to print that page, unless you got a lot of magical energy to brute force the thing…  It’s not going to work.  You got any salt and…  A lime, maybe?”

Steve returns to his senses and pivots around searching.  He finds a salt packet in a fast food bag.  He then leans over to a small mini-fridge behind the counter and opens the door to show a bunch of canned drinks and a lone lime-shaped plastic bottle of juice.  “Will lime juice work?”

Bach nods, cracks open the paper salt packet, and dumps it all into the ink bottle.  Steve holds out the plastic lime juice bottle.  Bach picks it up, flips the cap, and squirts a healthy amount into the ink bottle.  “Okay.  Cap that bottle with your finger, shake it a few times, and hold you finger out.  We’ll test to see if the rest of the mix is still good.”

Steve follows Bach instructions and looks at him quizzically.  “So, what’s this suppose to do?”

Bach points at the bottle.  “Recharge the mix.  The watering down messes with the electrolyte mix and pH often gets screwed up during bottling.”

Steve stops shaking the bottle, places it down, and then holds out his ink spotted finger.  Bach stares at Steve.  “Okay.  Now I want you to concentrate and direct your flow to that point on your finger.  If the mix is good, it’ll glow.”

Steve nods, closes his eyes, and tries his best to focus.  Bach faintly feels a stir in magical energy and watches as the spot on Steve’s finger dimly glows orange.  “Steve…  You’re forcing it too much.  Don’t listen to what those guides on the Aethernet said.  Calmly guide it.”

The glow now shines bright enough to be seen from a distance and catches the attention of others in the store.  Bach smiles confidently.  “Steve, open your eyes.”

Steve cautiously opens his eyes and lowers the gaze to his finger.  His eyes widen as he processes what the glow on his finger means.  The awe overtakes him and an ear to ear smile grows.  Bach snaps his fingers and points at glow.  “Now that’s a good sign.  So you want fix this page right with your recharged ink?”

Steve slowly raises his head to Bach with sheer determination in his eyes.  “Fuck. Yes. I do.”

&amp;nbsp;

A small gathering of store regulars surround the counter and watch as Bach continues an impromptu lesson on arcane dynamics to Steve.  “Now…  Trace those last outlines and put some curve on those sharp angle corners.  They do that to save on ink, but with the poor print quality it really does a number to the energy flow.”

Steve hovers his head over the page with an attentive eye and carefully applies new ink to the page, applying many Bach suggested corrections.  He stands back up and looks to Bach expectantly.  Bach examines the page one last time and crosses his arms with smirk.  “Alright.  Give it a shot.”

Steve places his hands down on the sides of the page and takes a deep breath.  His eyes narrow and he focuses intensely.  In mere seconds, a flow of orange glow travels along the traces and paths on the page.  Upon reaching the center, the energy materializes and forms a simple rotating cube that floats up from the page to a fixed point.  Steve slowly removes his hands from the page and the cube remains for a number of seconds before dissipating away.  The awe-struck crowd remains in silence for a moment before cheering Steve.

“I got it on video, Steve!  Fucking awesome, dude!”

“Holy shit, you finally did it!”

“It looked better than how-to videos on the Aethernet!”

Steve reaches back and slides a stool behind him.  He drops himself on it and thinks with disbelief and wonder fighting for position on his face.  He places his hands to the sides of his head.  “Wow.  I… I… I don’t know what to say.  I’ve been trying all these months and all these guides and…  I did it.”

Steve’s drifting attention locks onto Bach.  “You…  Man.  Thank you.  I don’t know how to pay you back.”

Bach puts his hands in his pockets and acts nonchalant.  “Don’t worry about it.  I’ve kinda been there before.  Know how it feels.”

Steve pats his legs and stands up in triumph.  “I got it!  Your next few visits, including this one...  Twenty-five percent discount on purchases.”

The rest of the gathered crowd astound at the announcement and discuss between themselves at the sheer rarity of a discount, much less such a significant one.  Over in comic book aisles, a particular pair of furry ears flick to attention and home in.  Bach bashfully chuckles and scratches his head.  “That’s quite the honor.  I’ll have to find something to-”

“Sweetie, there were a lot of issues we didn’t have.  Would it be okay if we got them all?”

Bach’s expression remains unchanged, but elements of his psyche spit-take and scramble to understand the situation.  The voice is familiar.  The tone is strange.  Claw tipped hands place a stack of comic books, graphical novels, and other media onto the counter.  Someone wraps arms around Bach’s arm and playfully leans on him.  Bach calmly and purposefully aims his head down the length of his arm to see Cideeda acting affectionate.  Bach’s expression quirks, twists, and twitches as confusion, frustration, embarrassment, and indignation argue too much for any to take control.  Cideeda reveals the screen of her aetherphone discreetly and winks cutely to Bach.  Bach silently reads the note on the screen.  “25% discount!!!  Play along!  PLEASE!!!”

A part of Bach’s mind awakes from a long slumber and strides confidently into the mental control room.  It throws its hat perfectly onto the hat rack, adjusts its proper attire, and grins with sly determination.  It amusingly perks at seeing a new mission target, but considers someone other than Sebastian a fresh new challenge.  The other elements of the psyche await in wary anticipation as it takes control.

Bach assumes a suave but humble demeanor and calmly addresses Cideeda.  “Well, I don’t know, dear.  I wouldn’t want to impose too much upon Steve’s generosity.”

Steve bounces his head between Bach and Cideeda, and finally arrives at a conclusion.  “Oh!  No, man!  It’s completely cool!  It’s no problem at all!  I thought I wasted my money on those magic workbooks.  But with what you taught me, it’s going to be an absolute trip going back over those and practice inking all those tweaks in.”

Bach slyly shrugs and glances at Cideeda.  “Well, if he has no objections, I have none for you, dear.”

Cideeda smiles softly, reaches into a pouch on her side, and turns her attentions to Steve.  “Steve, question.  You know anyone who would be interested in one of these?”

Cideeda pulls out Bach’s holoplayer, presses an option on the holographic menu, and projects the hologram of an early era chest.  Steve and other store regulars affix their gazes upon it.  Eventually, Steve strokes his chin with great interest.  “That looks genuine early era.  Does it have a working lock and key?”

Cideeda tugs on Bach’s arm to get his attention and grins slyly.  “A working lock and maybe a key, if keys aren’t that much different than miniatures.  Are they, sweetie?”

Bach forces a smile to Cideeda with a brief twitch in the eye, as she skips off to get the chest from the humvee.  “We’ll find out, won’t we?”

&amp;nbsp;

Cideeda pats Bach hard on the back, as the two walk through the large automated doors of the large book store.  “Come on!  That was pretty good on the spot acting you did back there.”

Bach rolls his eyes and grumbles, with his hands in his pockets.  “I’ve had plenty of practice getting out of awkward situations thanks to Sebastian.  Didn’t think I’d need to use that to con someone to give you a discount.”

Cideeda twists her mouth and raises a brow at Bach.  “Con, nothing.  You just used your given discount to buy everyone their reading material.”

Bach remains silent and grumbles to himself.  Cideeda speaks in a contrasting genuine tone, “Bach, you shouldn’t feel bad.  You helped Steve significantly with his magic.  He got to repay you with a decent discount for you and assumed lady friend.  He also got a good deal on a genuine early era chest with working lock and a key custom formed on the spot with magic before everyone’s eyes.”

Bach stops walking and shifts full focus on Cideeda.  She continues.  “As someone who was a game shop regular and worked a lot behind the counter a decade ago…  That would have been a hard day to top for many, many years.”

Cideeda crosses her arms and resumes her normal tone of voice.  “Now, if you are a little angry at me putting you on the spot…  I’ll accept that and apologize.”

Bach eventually accepts and dismisses the charges.  “It’s okay.  Really.  It just brought back memories of some crazy moments with my brother that I’d conveniently forgotten.”

Cideeda nods and checks her aetherphone.  “I understand.  Do you see Sotalia anywhere?  She messaged me that she was in here.”

Bach looks above the tops of the display shelves and scans around for her red hair and swept back horns.  Near the history section, Bach spots Sotalia and points her out to Cideeda.  “There.  Way down this next aisle.”

Cideeda peers down the aisle and catches sight of Sotalia.  “I see her.”

Bach blinks as his vision notices something else and he snaps his focus to a new target.  His eyes widen and he bites his lip in punctuation.  “FUCK.”

Cideeda freezes and glances back at Bach.  “What?!”

Bach watches as a familiar Emin woman struts confidently toward the area near Sotalia and a small camera crew closely follows behind.  “We need to get over there and warn Sotalia quick!”

&amp;nbsp;

Sotalia lifts a book up from the shelf and flips it over to read the summary.  Her eyes trace the lines of text, but abruptly halt.  She rotates her head to follow her eyes and sees both Bach and Cideeda frantically signaling her over from around the shelf end.  She squints and tilts her head.  “What?”

Bach quickly points to something behind Sotalia.  She checks over her shoulder and immediately tenses.  “Oh shit.”

Sotalia spins her head back forward, replaces the book in her hand on the shelf, and power walks over around the shelf to the aisle behind it with Back and Cideeda.  “Thanks.  Did not want to get caught up in that bitch’s path.”

Bach raises his head just above the top of the shelf and surveys the events.  He ducks back down when the cameras shift and the Emin woman sets up to pose in front of the shelf.  A human woman in the mix of the camera crew reads notes a from tablet and prompts the Emin woman.  “Okay, Tassilda, talk about what books you’d recommend for people wanting to learn more about magic.”

Tassilda strikes a pose in front of the shelf next to the “Magical History” section.  She seductively draws a book from the shelf and holds it suggestively close to her chest.  “I will always recommend a favorite of mine, the Collected History of Nexus Magic series.  It always captivates my attention and the details are all so enthralling.”

Bach cringes at the suggestion.  Sotalia contorts her mouth in disgust and seeks a spot in the books to spy through the shelf.  “Really, woman?  Out of all the books on this shelf, you pick the one that’s a proven insomnia cure.”

Tassilda gradually places the book back into the shelf, adding a purposeful bounce in the process to highlight personal assets.  Sotalia eyes Tassilda and grumbles to herself, annoyed.  “Oh, and I bet you are the first to take offense at about people comparing you to a succubus.”

Tassilda plucks another book from the shelf and advertises her prominent aspects during the task.  “Another one I’d only suggest to the most dedicated is The Great Magical Handbook of Nexus.”

Bach slides his head right next to Sotalia’s and he peeks through the opening to see the back of the infamous volume.  “She’s got to be getting kickbacks from a publisher.  I remember spending way too money on that damn thing in school.  It was pretty shitty doorstop, too.”

Cideeda quizzes Bach and Sotalia smugly.  “Well, if you two are such experts, what book would you recommend?”

Sotalia holds her face and thinks to herself about the subject.  Bach steps back and examines the books on the shelf.  He walks down the aisle and searches the shelves, following the order.  He stops walking and puts a finger on the books, reading titles.  He tilts a paperback out from the shelf and hands it to Cideeda.  “The Illustrated Guide to Magical History.  Pretty much first semester magic history in illustrated novel style.”

Sotalia stands up straight and stares at Bach incredulously.  “Really?”

Cideeda opens the book to the table of contents.  Bach carefully points out the subjects in the listing.  “It covers the Three Cataclyms, the Three Periods, the Abstract Prism, Foundation Constructs, and even Magical Flow Dynamics.”

Sotalia perches over Cideeda’s shoulder and seems honestly surprised.  “Huh.  It goes into how ridiculously dangerous Elder Energy is and even how it caused the Third Cataclysm and prompted the creation of the Abstract Prism.”

Bach hears no activity on the other side of the shelf and checks over the shelf.  “See.  It’s not bad at all.  It has textbook parts after the story section, but it does a good job explaining it all.  Even has a decent high-school romance subplot.  I think we’re in the clear, they’ve moved on to coffee shop.”

Sotalia searches around the area and takes out her aetherphone.  “Good.  I messaged Aristespha to see how far along she was and-  Oh.  Oh my.”

Cideeda and Bach shift their attentions to Sotalia.  Cideeda scoots next to Sotalia, reads the screen, and covers her mouth in astonishment.  “She’s just MAD right now.”

Bach worriedly moves in view of of Sotalia’s screen.  “What’s going on?!”

Sotalia extends her phone away to give the other two a better view and emphasize the situation.  “Wow.  She’s gone full Low Evuukian in her rants back to me.  I can only make out half of this, but I think we’re not the only ones who ran into one of the show stars.”

Cideeda groans and hovers her claw tip over a few characters.  “It’s the Fvalian.  I recognize that term.  Looks like she’s stuck behind her in line.”

Bach squints and focuses on a new line of characters in a language he doesn’t full comprehend.  “Uhh, that’s something not good.  I’ve never seen half of these before.”

Sotalia draws her phone up close and carefully rereads the line a few times.  She grits her teeth and then snorts.  “She’s furious.  She’s dropping out parts of proper sentence structure.  What do you all think this direct translation means?  Brain devoid furred abomination destroy time.  Yank bell broomhandle feed, necklace reach rip start bell expedient ass exit.”

Bach stares nonplussed and scratches his head.  “Umm...  We should check to see how Dretphi is doing?”

Sotalia nods in agreement and cringes as another line pops on her screen.  Cideeda stows away her phone and points towards a general store through the store’s glass front.  “Dretphi says she is still waiting for the staff to get her order together over there.”

The three sneak out from the aisles to the front door.  Bach shakes his head as they pass through the front doors.  “Poor Sebastian.  Hiding in the sword strapped to Aristespha’s back right now.”

Sotalia draws breath through her teeth.  “Yes.  But, he’s the only one keeping her calm right now.”

Bach grimaces at the thought of Sebastian having no escape and defusing the rage of his significant other.  “I hope he’s gotten better at that.”

&amp;nbsp;

Dretphi stands at the Amaranth Valley General Store counter and sighs with annoyance.  The general store stocks a variety of goods for locals and adventuring parties.  Amaranth Valley advertises itself as the last big spec of civilization before the borderlands and other wild places.  So, the general store takes up the slack.  Given the range of goods and services, the store front is modest.  But, this is possible thanks to the massive warehouse attached.  Unfortunately, this delays larger orders and forces customers to wait.  A fact that Dretphi finds exceptionally bothersome given the large muscular Grath man that’s been trying non-stop to flaunt himself and acquire her attention.  He remains a few registers away, waiting for his order to be fulfilled.  Dretphi avoids all contact with him.  She also cares not for the bored cameraman nearby, watching.

The cameraman retrieves his aetherphone from his belt holster and talks into it.  “Yah, Samantha?  …  The Unit C is still here with Trakenthin.  He’s failing to flirt with some Grath woman.  …  Hmm?  Sure, I guess.”

The cameraman takes the phone off his ear, aims the camera on the device, and taps the screen with his thumb.  A few more taps and he places it back on his ear.  “Sent you a picture. …  You know, now that you mention it, she does look familiar. …  Unit A saw an Evuukian woman with a sword strapped to her back? …  Yah, I’ll definitely let you know if anything changes.”

Trakenthin struts confidently over towards Dretphi, his hand gliding over the counter rail.  Dretphi reads a new message on her aetherphone and searches with her head up.  She seeks past Trakenthin and waves past him.  He smiles smugly and picks up the pace.  Sotalia, Cideeda, and Back hurry by Trakenthin right to Dretphi.  Trakenthin smoothly changes direction and leads himself back to his original spot.  The cameraman chuckles and mutters to himself.  “Denied.”

Dretphi breathes a much needed sigh of relief and a quietly addresses everyone.  “I am glad you arrived.  I believe IT was going to talk to me.”

Sotalia crosses her arms and tips her head back towards Trakenthin.  “You mean the two meter and then some tall ego back there?”

Dretphi groans and draws back an upper lip.  “Yes.  Unfortunately.”

Sotalia grins with a tinge of evil and her voice radiates with sarcasm.  “Come on Dretphi, I’m sure he’s quite the accomplished man.  Probably has plenty of trophies he wants to show you in the bedroom.”

Bach looks at Dretphi with a bit of worry.  “Do you want us to do anything?  Is there something about him we should know?  Sorry to pry, but you seem pretty upset.”

Dretphi glances at Bach and smiles warmly.  “It is okay.  I thank you for your concern.  He is an unfortunate nuisance of the Grath culture.  One day he may achieve great things.”

She narrow eyes and views Trakenthin without moving her head in his direction.  “For his caliber, his deeds will receive a paragraph in the history of the Grath.  Men of the level of my fathers write the history that paragraph will go in.”

Sotalia laughs and puts her hands on Dretphi’s shoulder.  “You keep that bar high for the rest of us.”

Dretphi straightens up and crosses her arms, grumbling.  “It is my bar to set.”

Cideeda snickers and checks a new message on her phone.  “Well, Aristespha is going to met us at the guild office.  I don’t think she’s in the mood to do any researching today.”

Dretphi perks a brow.  Bach leans in.  “She got held up by one of the Next Adventurers of Nexus.”

Dretphi shakes her head, notices a clerk coming to the register, and turns around in anticipation.  “A sentiment I appreciate.”

The young clerk stands behind the register and he promptly types a few keys on the system.  “Sorry about the wait, but your order is ready!  We’ve processed payment to your company card and here is your claim ticket.  One of our warehouse assistants will cart it out to your vehicle.”

Dretphi takes hold of the claim ticket and her company credit card with a nod.  The clerk directs the group to a side door, and they move out.  The cameraman finishes taking one last photo and presses the send icon on the screen.  A few moments later, a message window pops up on the screen.  “This is getting WEIRD now.  Unit B is wrapping up with Tassilda.  Meet me in the parking lot when you get done.”

&amp;nbsp;

Aristespha marches with her fists clenched and back straight, maintaining a severe glower.  She stops in front of Bach, Sotalia, Cideeda, and Dretphi.  Aristespha opens her mouth and a resonating voice from behind her interrupts.  “Dear, take a deep, long breath first.”

Aristespha grimaces and winces, but closes her eyes and slowly draws in air to fill her lungs.  She exhales with a long growl hidden in the mix.  The same voice from before continues.  “You might need another breath.”

Aristespha grits her teeth and adjusts her attire to a more orderly fashion.  “I’ll be fine, Sebastian.”

She final calms herself down to a demeanor close to her normal and sighs.  “Well, it seems that some children’s cereal is giving away medical mage licenses as the prize in the box.  Despite the excessive delay, I was able to get the medical supplies we need.”

Sebastian’s voice echoes from the sword on Aristespha’s back.  “So, medical supplies, check.  Sotalia?”

Sotalia stops biting her tongue from Aristespha’s display and reports, “Magical supplies are good.  Nothing of value at the big book store.  No Local Lore section I found.”

Sebastian resumes his run down.  “Okay.  We’ll try the local library and see if the college has some adventurer access service.  Dretphi?”

Dretphi clears her smirk.  “Food and gear acquired.  I did find the jerky requested.”

Cideeda happily grins and reflexively licks her lips.  “Thank you!  Oh!  Bach has a new phone.  And we got the reading material at a really good price.  Also, got a good source to sell any ancient trinkets in the future.  Didn’t get to the ammo, today.”

Sebastian sighs but his tone sounds understanding and appreciative.  “We’ll see about tomorrow.  Right now, I think we should get Bach registered and get out of here before we run into anymore celebrities.  While Aristespha, Bach, and I handle the registration, rest of you check to see if there’s any missions, quests, and jobs you like out there.”

The group enters the guild offices.  Off in the distance a cameraman and woman casually hang out by a van with the Next Adventurers of Nexus show logo plastered on the side.  Despite the idle conversation, the two keep a very attentive eye on the guild office.

&amp;nbsp;

The doors of the guild office open.  The team walks out with Bach trailing behind, examining his registration card.  Sebastian floats in his ethereal form behind Bach and peeks over his shoulder with a proud smile.  “It’s pretty thing, bro.”

Bach feels the card’s facets, takes his wallet out, and carefully settles the card into the most prominent spot.  “Well, I’m only technically an intern.”

Sotalia glances over at the card in Bach’s wallet.  “Still pretty cool that they can work it as an internship and have it count for college credit.”

Aristespha takes a peek at the card, too.  “The paperwork is significantly easier now.  Now the paperwork for denoting an authoritative proxy due to your team’s leader being a soul stuck in a sword on the otherhand...”

Sebastian catches Aristespha glare and shrugs.  “Hey, if I could actually sign stuff, you know I would!”

Aristespha winks playfully, reaches behind her, and taps the handle of the sword.  “Before you scare the locals, Sebastian.”

Sebastian’s visage swirls into the sword.  His voice echoes a few moments later.  “I know.  Just wanted to see Bach’s registration card in the light.  Vision is so weird in the sword.  Anyone find anything good on the boards?”

The rest scroll through their aetherphones and take turns reading job descriptions.  Debates follow after each reading and the team discusses jobs on their way to the humvee.  Nearby a particular van, a cameraman tracks the group and a woman stares with her jaw nearly on the floor.  She checks the cameraman.  “By the gods, I hope you recorded all that.”

The cameraman grins widely.  “Oh, yes.  There’s a reason I get to be on my own unit.”

The woman flips open the cover on her tablet and tap-types furiously into it.  “I can’t believe it.  It’s them and they are here.”

&amp;nbsp;

Evening falls at the house.  Most retire to recreational activities after the unexpected stresses of today.  Aristespha closes the door to her room, removes the sheathed sword from her back, and places it on the bed.  She slides the sword to a corner and sits down on top.  She removes her boots and other attire until she achieves comfort.  She lays down the rest of the way on the bed and exhales.  Sebastian’s visage reforms and floats above her.  “You okay, dear?”

Aristespha rubs her eyes and keeps them closed as she stretches out on the bed.  “Yes.  Just the state of things bothers me.  I was accepting certain elements, now new ones got thrown in.”

Sebastian hovers down next to Aristespha on the bed.  “I know.  But, we are making good progress.  Bach is going on his first quest soon!”

Aristespha twists her mouth and thinks.  “Sebastian, your brother is still an unknown factor.  Not a bad one.  But, still unknown.”

Sebastian frowns lightly and turns his head to Aristespha.  “I know.  I wish I knew more to tell you.  He did mention the Nightmare Geist incident to me.  And... how it left him a lame mage.”

Aristespha eyes snap open and she twists her head to lock a glare on Sebastian.  “Anything else?!”

Sebastian blinks blankly from her sudden change of expression.  “No.  I didn’t want to push the issue.  I was amazed he mentioned it without me pestering him.  I’m hoping he’ll open up more once he gets some confidence back.”

Aristespha closes her eyes and rubs her forehead in thought.  Sebastian quickly lifts up and looks over and down at Aristespha.   “What’s wrong?  Is there something wrong with Bach?!”

Aristespha opens her eyes with a faint glow, reaches her hands up, and places them around Sebastian’s face gently.  “Your brother is just fine.  It’s just…  He has his abilities, but I don’t know how or even why he arrived at them.”

Sebastian places a hand on one of Aristespha’s hands and smiles.  “I’m sure you’ll figure it out soon enough or he’ll eventually tell us.  I’m just happy to have him along, just like we promised each other when we were kids.”

Aristespha lovingly returns the smile as she feels Sebastian’s face.  “We shall see.  But, I want some answers eventually.”

&amp;nbsp;

Bach examines his new aetherphone while he lays on his bed.  He flips through menus, settings pages, and lists of icons and eventually settles back on the home screen.  He mumbles to himself,  “Well...  It’s about time...”

Bach presses the phone icon and taps a series of numbers on the shown numeric pad.  He holds the phone next to ear and waits.  After a few moments, Bach hears a familiar voice.  “Hey, mom.  It’s me.  Got a new phone and everything.  Thanks to Sebastian.”

Bach listens to his mother talk.  “He’s doing well enough, all things considered.  …  Yah, still getting used it myself.  So, he’s been keeping you update to date with-  Well, I guess Aristespha has, since he hasn’t figured out a way yet.”

He quirks his head to side and ponders a moment on something said.  “I guess his voice would sound weird over the speakerphone.  When did you last talk to him?  ...  Good.  Give me second, I think I got this figured out on the phone.”

Bach takes the phone and aims it at his registration card, presses a few buttons, and then returns the it to his ear.  “Did you get tha-”

He stops and gently smiles, with a tear welling in his eye.  His mothers voice, happy and excited, calls out to someone in the background and announces what she sees.  The voice calls out loud enough to even be audible to anyone nearby Bach.  “Well, it’s about fucking time!”

Bach rolls his eyes with a snort and shakes his head.  “Thanks, dad!”

Bach’s mother continues, asking questions in excited rapid succession.  Bach interupts, “Hey, mom, I’ll answer all those.  But, there’s something I’ve been working on that I want you to see first.  Let’s see if if I can figure out this feature.”

Bach holds his hand out and palm up, keeping the phone trained with his other hand.  Bach presses an icon on the screen and a video stream of his mother face appears in a smaller window on top of the video of the palm of his hand.  Bach concentrates and faint, flickering outlines appear.  The framework fills in with a transparent form, details and color materialize.  In a few seconds, the vague outline of flowers morphs into a bundle of violet-like objects crafted of stabilized magical energy.  He witnesses his mother’s face flood with awe and pride.  He presses the icon again and puts the phone back to his ear.  “I kind of wanted to show you in person, but I figured with everything going on I’d show you now.  I’ll get it in the mail to you soon.”"

I'm 16 and in my sophomore year of high school and I was wondering if anyone could recommend a good jumping off point for me. I have taken Biology and AP Computer Science (Java) and am currently enrolled in a Biotech course at my school. I am self taught in a few other languages (python, C#, and basic C++). I really have no idea where to get started, any help would be appreciated. 

I hope to expand this into something to maybe drive a science fair project or help get an internship. Any advice in either would be much appreciated!

Panicked and just completely shutting down.",takeoutthecity,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5w4omq/backed_in_a_corner_very_incoherent_post_panicked/,"90 grand in debt. 90-fucking-grand in debt for a college degree I wasn't even prepared for, that has granted me no job opportunities. I started school much later than most because of my life long depression, and depression lead me into a major I clung onto because I ""just had to get a degree"". I had family members telling me ""just graduate, you'll get a job no matter what if you get a bachelors! A bachelors degree means the world!""

Nope. You need EXPERIENCE in everything, not some ridiculous piece of paper. I graduated with no job prospects, and eventually DID get an internship that ended up being the worst move of my life. My mentor quit ONE WEEK into my program, and the company didn't replace him. They dropped ALL OF HIS WORK on ME and expected ME to live up to his standards; he had been there 8 years and I was just a graduate. No matter how often I reminded them that I was trying, they were mad that I couldn't learn a new set of programming skills on my own in under a weeks time. Lasted nine months and finally left when my contact expired. They weren't going to hire me in full-time, and my boss even said he felt bad for initially ""setting me up for failure"" by not getting in someone new...

I can't get a job ANYWHERE. I had to move from a more prosperous state to a place where my degree means toilet paper. I've applied for over 100 jobs in the last three months only to get two interviews that landed me nothing. I have a small part time retail job that barely affords anything, my debt from school has raised to 90k, my entire family thinks I'm being lazy and blames me for my lack of job. There's just nothing out there.

I can't force employers to hire me. I can't go in and say ""Hey I know that last guy you saw was cool and all but, I'm starving, I'm unable to survive, I can do almost everything you want in this position--and everything else I can learn how to do. Take a chance on me and you'll not only save me, but you'll save my family as well.""

I want to change my career path but there's no money for me to work with. My first degree was so expensive, I can't go back with any loans. I feel like a life time of depression and 0 confidence has lead me to this crippling nothingness. Guys, I'm scared to death. I want to kill myself. I'm so suicidal, I see nowhere else to go. It's trite as all Hell but I just feel like it's inevitable now. I'll never see the success my family members have, I have no one to turn to even. Friends? Haven't had any for close to six years now--no exaggeration. I'm a true and utter failure, depression has won. It always wins. Always and always wins.

I don't know what to do anymore. I want to be brave and live, but I'm going through life as a bitter ghost who can't move on. I am sick of being a burden and I'm sick of my family kindly telling me all the things I'm doing to ""hurt them"", yet when I mention suicide as a relief they screech at me and make me feel worse. damned if I do, damned if I don't."

Where is this major going to lead? I'm going to graduate with a degree and then what? Where do I apply for jobs? Will I even be good enough to have a job?

Another reason I can't learn anything on my own is because I can't find the motivation to do so. I'll spend two hours on CodeAcademy and then realize I learned absolutely nothing from doing so. There's too much to learn, too much to absorb. All I can do is get good grades at my classes because I don't want to fail.


Perhaps I should just drop out? There doesn't seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel. I'm just going to end up serving in a restaurant for the next 40 years until I retire and live off of Social Security. "

First time poster here, thanks in advance for any help/advice you can provide. I will be graduating from university soon and am getting a bit stressed from the job searching process. Here is a bit of information about me (trying to keep it sort of vague):

- I am graduating from an Ivy League institution with decent extracurricular activities (two research positions - one which I had for basically my whole time in college - that involved statistical analysis, but had nothing to do with finance/economics + a lot of demonstrated/competitive success in public speaking through my involvement with various college organizations)
- My GPA is pretty terrible, around a 3.15, and I have absolutely NO internship experience. Not even talking about just finance internships... also it will be taking me 9 semesters rather than the normal 8 to graduate, and I don't know how that looks to recruiters?

The second bullet point is obviously a real stressor as I apply to different financial/banking institutions, and compared to my peers I feel like there's little hope for me. I am hoping to secure an analyst position in NYC but am perfectly willing to expand my search.

Here's the thing: I know some people who work at the places I'm applying to, and they seem to be willing to help me out. Their positions vary, but they are in their mid-30s and seem to be well into their professional careers (ex. Senior VP at JPMorgan, similar at Goldman, etc.). They say they can get my resume to the right people, but my connection with them is also pretty tenuous in that I've never actually worked alongside them, so I don't know how valued their recommendation of me would be for HR/recruiting.

How useful are these connections really? Can they possibly get my foot in the door and offset such a low GPA and absence of professional experience? Or is it more likely that they will pass my resume/name off to a recruiter, who will then look over my credentials and wave me away?

Any insight would be welcome and appreciated!"

How did it happen?,ChupGandu,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5wac7p/do_you_know_somebody_who_changed_completely/,"Today I met this friend, we lost contact when I finished 9th grade (he finished his 10th and went to another city).

Dude used to be a total dumbo. He failed once in 4th and then again in 7th (idk how he managed to do it, he must have been a special kind of dumbass).

I met him during my half yearly in 6th grade (it was his second time in 7th grade then), he sat next to me in that exam, helped him in maths and computer, we became friends. I came to know his house was near mine; we started hanging out daily and became best friends. 

He was really good at heart, but extremely naive and sucked at academics. Used to daydream all day and butcher time mercilessly.

He got about 50% in 10th. That was probably the first time he *studied* for a month before the exams. 

Our principal was a kind of dick, he took pleasure in insulting kids and their parents. Told his parents that nothing would happen of him ever. Oh, he was from a lower middle class family, had a sister who was approaching marriageable age and his dad had drinking problems.

To make things worse, his father had a sudden stroke a few days later and was bedridden. The entire burden fell on his poor mother; she was a teacher in a primary school.

Needless to say, he needed a job asap, they sent him to do a diploma in IT. He was kind of depressed with how the things turned out to be, cut off all contacts with his friends. Saw him a year later during winters, he kind of avoided us. Didn't see him again.

Today, I was boarding a train, met him there unexpectedly. He had the adjacent seat.

I couldn't actually believe my eyes, he had changed *totally*. All that awkwardness, stupidity, dumbness: all vanished! As if, magic. He is a total *gentleman* now. His expressions, behaviors, everything changed; I had never heard him speak so articulately.

He told me that he passed with the highest marks in his batch. Got into an internship, then another and now is working as the assistant manager in a startup. He doesn't make much (told me he makes like 5Lpa now, I’ll pass out from my shit college and get a job in TCS or something for 3/4Lpa dafuq he did diploma and he will earn more), but he seems to be full of energy and it really seems like he is a man with a mission.  

We spoke a lot; he asked lots of questions about me, told me about his career and dreams. Came to know his father passed away and they are negotiating dowry for his sister and stuff like that. We exchanged numbers and promised to stay in touch. It was a nice afternoon.

Have you ever seen someone going through a 180 degree change like this? I really wonder how they do it."

I interned at both NASA and Google while doing my undergrad and now I'm fortunate enough to have full-time offers at both. I loved working at both but they were very different experiences. The google internship was definitely more fun and exciting (tons of company sponsored events, freebies, etc), but the work at NASA was more interesting for sure. 


As far as I can see, here are the pros/cons of each.


Google

Pros

 * Very high compensation (~200k / year (salary, stock, bonus))
 * I like the location (sf bay area, CA)
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Amazing perks (Free breakfast/lunch/dinner, free shuttle to work, gym, misc benefits)
 * High prestige if I want to move
 * Good work-life balance (at least for my team)
 * Better Software engineering practices


Cons

 * Very expensive location (I would pay ~2.5k/month rent for a studio)
 * Specific project isn't very exciting to me
 * Not advancing humanity
 * All software (no hardware which I'm interested in)
 * Most people leave after a few years


NASA

Pros:

 * Very cool project/team (Robotics/Avionics)
 * Good Benefits
 * Cheap Location for living (~800-1k for a studio)
 * Mixture of hardware and software
 * Very smart coworkers
 * Very good work-life balance
 * High Prestige
 * Advancing Humanity
 * Many people stay for life


Cons

 * Not a location I want to live in (very hot + humid)
 * Low compensation (starting around ~45k but likely to increase in the future. Will never match Google though)
 * Poorer software engineering practices
 * No real perks besides benefits
 * Government bureaucracy
 * Unsure what will happen under current administration / future administrations


So what do you guys think? I understand this is a very good problem to have, but I am having a really hard time deciding. I know money shouldn't be the biggest factor in my decision but after receiving the Google offer it is hard to imagine accepting ~4-5x less. "

Let me set the scene: Reagan was president, the Soviet Union still existed, and the Berlin Wall had not yet come down. I was a twenty-six year old graduate student at Columbia and a real sight; shaggy hair, huge goddamn glasses that covered half my face, ripped jeans, and band shirts. I chuckle now and then when I see the youth dressed up like what was cool so long ago. History repeats itself, eh?



As part of my program that summer, I arranged an internship with the Custer Institute and Observatory in Southold, often working closely with the Astronomical Society of Long Island. From May until July I would become nocturnal, staying up long past night and into dawn collecting data. I watched the stars, or at least, that’s what I told people. It sounded cooler. Made it seem like I actually got to use the telescope, direct it into the void in the search for something out there, something greater than us. 



In reality, I just hand wrote the data the operators gathered as they dictated it to me. Sure, it wasn’t the most glamorous job and people often wondered why I would want to live in Long Island at all, but it was better than being under the suffocating lights of the city. Out here I could breathe deeply and look up after the sun went down into a bruised sky spangled by stars. It was glorious… and yet in a way, horrifying. 



I’ll never forget that summer. I’ll never forget what I saw, heard, felt; what I’ve kept secret. No—what I was asked to keep secret. 



That summer changed everything. 



I remember it clearly: May 25th, opening night of *Return of the Jedi*, the last *Star Wars* movie or so I thought at time. The atmosphere around the observatory was charged; everyone was going to see it, everyone but me. Wasn’t a huge fan, still not. They teased me then, and still do now, but *Star Wars* holds a deeper, much more sinister connotation to me. 



But I did have another reason to stay in: this would likely be the only time I would have free reign of the telescope and would be able to fiddle with it as I saw fit. I didn’t want to miss this opportunity. The night was perfect; clear, calm, and slightly cool. 



Of course, my friends and fellows lamented me not joining them and told me of a local ghost said to haunt these parts warning that it would turn me to “the Dark Side”, but I laughed and assured them that I would be fine and that I didn’t believe in ghosts and they were clearly just bullshitting me so I would get scared and go. So at half-past nine, I watched as they piled up into two cars and waved as they drove off down the road screaming the theme song out the window. 



I sighed, looked up into the inviting mystery of space, and stepped back inside. 



It was quiet…*too* quiet. No, I’m kidding. It was just the way I wanted it: empty, peaceful, filled by the buzzing of the lone computer in the corner. It was supposed to collect and sort radio signals, a precursor of the radio astronomy program that they have at Custer nowadays. It was enormous, had no screen, and barely any disk space. I was specifically told not to touch it by the director of the observatory and I didn’t plan to. 



I walked to my desk and pulled out an old cassette player and a brand new copy of *Power, Corruption &amp; Lies* from my backpack. I had waited eagerly until now to listen to the entire album even though I had heard most of the songs before. I unwrapped the cellophane, slid it into the deck, and readied a pencil since my rewind function was broken. The first guitar riff of *Age of Consent* echoed around the room and I sat down next to the view finder, elated.



This is where things began to get weird. 



I began calibrating the scope, noting with satisfaction the brilliance of the stars before me. I directed it to the moon and beyond until I landed on a particularly bright point towards the southeast. I had never seen anything like it before; it looked like a star, but much, much brighter. While I watched it collapsed into an odd super-blackness that started twirling faster and faster creating a spiral in the sky.



It shifted from black to purple to blue to red in a few seconds, spinning, spinning. 



Thousands of feelings flooded through me, mainly shock, excitement, dread, and I watched as it grew increasingly larger or closer or both, taking entire view of the telescope. I sat, mesmerized, until I heard my cassette player skip to harsh static, startling me into action. 



I ripped my eye away from the scope, snatched my flashlight, coat, and binoculars from my desk, and ran outside for a better look. From this vantage point, I could see just how big the spiral had grown. It looked like it was over the tip of the far side of Long Island, above the lighthouse. It stopped spinning and opened like a mouth, a womb, a flower. 



And from that twisted gash in the sky some thing materialized; a mass of what looked like tar and coagulated blood with long, undulating arms. It was huge and long. It fell or jumped or both, landing far, far away, near or in what could only be the Montauk Point State Park.



Suddenly, a noise split the air, making me jump. It sounded like it was coming from all around me, like it was amplified by the atmosphere, or the instruments inside Custer, or the metal that made up its structure, or everything: the trees, the water, everything. I heard what sounded like one little girl and twelve of them screaming all at the same time. It was haunting, sickening, sad. 



I distinctly remember the air around me being electrified, like I was inside a Van de Graaff generator; the hair on my arms stood straight and chills ran down my spine like vibrato across a violin string. 
		


Not even three minutes passed before I heard the familiar chopping noise of a helicopter closely followed by three fighter jets saturating out the sounds of the screaming. They were all heading in the direction of Gardiners Bay. From the helicopter a single beam of light cut through the darkness below. I closed my eyes and covered my ears, standing frozen as they passed above me. 



After a few seconds, I opened my eyes and lowered my hands expecting to see the worst; instead I saw and heard nothing. The spiral in the sky had completely disappeared, and the sound from the screaming girl or girls had vanished. Even the sound from the jets and helicopter had mysteriously dissipated.  



I heard a woman’s voice speaking softly and realized it was coming from inside the observatory. I approached the door in a daze and looked inside and saw two things; the first was how bright my cassette player’s on-light was; the second was the computer in the corner…it was going wild. It was printing an uncountable number of words and numbers on thin paper with more and more appearing every minute. And from its miniature speaker a woman’s voice was being transmitted. At first I was confused, disoriented, trying to understand what she was saying, then I realized she was speaking in rapid Russian. 



Panicked, I ran to the computer and pulled the plug, not caring what the director might think or what the repercussions would be. You have to understand, this happened in the midst of the Cold War and Americans were rightly fearful of any sabotage. As soon as I pulled the plug, my cassette player switched off and the on-light broke with a small pop making me jump. I swiftly snatched up all the paper and shoved it into my backpack before taking a deep breath and sliding down against the wall.



“Hello?”



I shot up.



“Hello, - my name redacted -, I know you’re in there, I just want to talk to you. C’mon out.” The voice was male, coarse, reluctant. 



I slowly approached the door which I had left open in my rush to get inside, expecting to see a cop and a cruiser. Instead I saw a matte black vehicle with deeply tinted windows. It was half-way between a sedan and a SUV and there was no discernable make or model on it. No license plate either. A man in a black suit was standing with his back to me looking up at the night sky. He turned when he heard me approach. 



He was middle aged, Caucasian, with wood colored hair, and a beaten, exhausted look about him. He looked me up and down, his eyes lingering on my *Clash* shirt for a moment, before speaking again.



“Hey, thanks for cooperating. This is going to sound crazy, but did you just see something just now?”



I blinked, unsure of what to say and still in shock from what I had seen. And I was confused…who was this man, why he was asking me about what I saw, and how did he know my name?



“Um…um, yeah, I saw something really weird, man. Up there.” I gestured towards the Point. 


The man nodded solemnly. “Can you describe it for me?”



I swallowed. “Um, I’m sorry, but who are you?”



The man grimaced a bit. “Sorry,” he flashed something quickly, it looked like a badge or a piece of paper—I didn’t get a good look. “My partner and I were just in the area, and saw some bright light, we were wondering if you saw it as well…”



“Oh…um, okay, well yeah, I mean I saw the light, but I saw something else. It was like this…um, well you know the show The Twilight Zone?” The man nodded and a corner of his mouth twitched. “Well, it was like that, a weird, black spiral, but it wasn’t black, it was all sorts of colors, and then…then something…” My voice trailed off and I looked back over my shoulder towards the direction of Montauk. 



“And then…” The man prompted. 



I looked back at him, noticing concern in his face. “Something…fell from the spiral, something big, something black and long and…it was *so weird*, man.”



The man took this all in stride, never once showing any reaction at all. He glanced over at the vehicle, and I saw a lone figure sitting inside watching us. 



“Anything else?” He was still looking over his shoulder at the figure.



“Um, yeah, actually.” He looked back at me. “Well, two things, I thought I heard a little girl, or girls screaming from somewhere.”



“A little girl…or girls?”



I nodded, realizing how crazy I sounded.



“How many did it sound like?”



I was slightly taken back by the question and cocked my head. “I dunno, twelve, one?”



The man raised his eyebrows ever so slightly.



“Look I know how it sounds, but you said you saw the same thing I did, right?”
	


The man nodded, then sighed. “And you said there was something else?”



My reason finally caught up with me and I hesitated; what was I doing telling this random guy about everything I saw? “Um, sorry no, that was it.”



“Nothing else? No radio interference, no lights bursting, nothing?” 



How did this man know about…I shook my head, “No, nothing else.”



“Okay, wait right here a moment, I need to speak with my partner.”



“Sure thing.” 



The man walked towards the car and entered the passenger seat. I looked around me, then up at the stars. The night was calm and cool and clear and perfect again. After a few moments, the man came back out and approached me. 



“Now, I want you to listen to me, and listen to me closely, you didn’t see or hear anything, okay?”



“Um…what’s going on?”



“Look, kid, I’m getting tired of this business, and I worked it out for you.”



“Worked—”



“Just listen to me, kid. Don’t ever, ever, ever tell anyone what you saw or heard here. Never, you understand? There are things—people—out there who would hurt you if they found out. I don’t want that to happen. I’ve seen...” His voice trailed off and he sighed again, as if the entire weight of the world was on his shoulders. He rubbed his face once. 



“You’ve seen?”



“Look, I’ve seen stranger things, kid, and I know what can happen if you don’t keep those things quiet. Just promise me that you won’t tell anyone what you’ve seen or heard and we won’t have a problem here.”



I tried to swallow, but my throat was dry. Clearly one of us—or maybe both of us—was insane. But when I looked into his eyes, I felt unshakable trust and I nodded, slowly. 



“Okay, sure, man. I won’t ever tell anyone what I saw.”



“Do I have your word?”	



“Yes.”



“Good. And if you see anyone else like me, or if any other person asks you what you might’ve seen, tell them you have no clue what they’re talking about. That you fell asleep, got high, went to see *Star Wars*. Anything. Just don’t tell them about this.”



“Okay, sure, yeah, I won’t. I promise.”



The man nodded and turned to leave.



“Wait,” I called after him, “What’s your name?”



“Spooky,” he yelled back as he got back into the car. The engine growled on, making me jump, and I watched as it sped away. 



As soon as the car turned right and disappeared into darkness, I heard a tinny sound coming from the door. It was my cassette player; the static had finally stopped and it was playing *Leave Me Alone*. Apt, I thought to myself as I retreated back inside. 



The rest of the night passed without incident and I waited in the Custer library until my fellows and friends returned from the movie. They instantly noticed the computer and began to berate me for failing a simple direction, then they saw how upset and offbeat I was and pestered me until I finally caved and told them that the ghost had spooked me. They had a real laugh about that before launching into endless diatribes and debates about that crazy twist and how Vader wasn’t really that bad at all, just fearful and angry and suffering. 



Three days after this happened, the ninth G7 Summit was held in Williamsburg, Virginia. The participants were the prime minister of Japan, Yasuhiro Nakasone; the prime minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau; the chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Kohl; the prime minister of Italy, Amintore Fanfani; the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher; the president of France, Francois Mitterrand; the president of the European Commission, Gaston Thorn; and the president of the United States, Ronald Reagan. A lot of things were said to have been discussed here, but the main topic was how the Soviet Union should be handled. The Strategic Defense Initiative was surely discussed as well, and I’m sure we all know what the nickname of this program was.



Maybe the timing of this Summit was mere coincidence, or maybe it wasn’t, maybe it’s indicative of shadows and lies and conspiracy…



One thing is for certain, that summer changed everything. It broke my mind, left me a confused mess of a person, paranoid and fearful of black, the color and the classification. And it left me obsessed, consumed with the still unfulfilled desire to find out what really happened, how, why I was asked to keep silent and who the man was who asked me to. 



But, I’m tired now. Exhausted to the marrow.  I’m done with being afraid, with looking over my shoulder and wondering what they might do or if they’re still watching, if they ever were. It’s time I told the world what happened in May of 1983. And maybe someone who reads this can help me piece together this puzzle. 



That’s all for now, I’ll update later as needed, especially if anyone has information for me. Good night.

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5ukx5n/the_immortal_roman_empress_chapter_37_war_and/)

Chapter 38: Aftermath

“So Mrs. Henrietta Palaiologos,” Athena asked. “What is it like being the regent for the newly-freed Imperium Romanum?”
 
The two were in the Imperial News Network office in the Imperial Palace, Constantinople. Bright white lights and cameras illuminated the two women. Athena was trying her best not to squirm in her tight white dress, but she couldn’t stop her feet under the desk from shaking. Henrietta, meanwhile, looked like she was made for the camera. Her sparkling purple strapless dress had no wrinkles, and a permanent smile was etched on her face. Both of the Greek women were considered quite beautiful with their light olive skin and their high cheekbones. Henrietta, while older, was serene and graceful while Athena was young and pretty.
 
The young woman’s voice was unsteady. Athena couldn’t believe it. She must be the unluckiest person in the galaxy. She thought she would be free after the war. But noo. Her parents were too worried about silly nonsense like death and civilian casualties. So they “recalled” her all the way back to Anatolia. They tried to nab her twin, Sophia, but she managed to escape the, erm, “bounty hunters.” Athena always figured she was the unlucky sibling.
 
And now her father’s connections landed her a job with the INN. Right smack in the middle of Constantinople. In the Imperial Palace, of all places. Athena visited the city before, but the amount of bureaucrats and ass kissers made her wish to never see the capital again. Just her luck that she was pretty and Greek enough to be a reporter for the INN.
 
She hated her boss. He was an idiot. He practically worshipped the Imperator just because he saw her for the grand total of five seconds during the declaration of war. He was one of the interns that fetched the Basilissa a cup of water when she declared war on the beans. Now he kept going on and on about how everybody including the “filthy xeno scum” should worship the beautiful Augustus. Ugh. There were dumbasses, dumbasses everywhere. But she could deal with that. She dealt with dumbasses until she and Sophia boarded the colony ship out of Terra. Actually, scratch that. There were also dumbasses on Alpha Centauri, too. Even the beans were dumbasses. They did lose a war to a nation of dumbasses after all.
 
And so by some sheer dumb luck, Athena was interviewing Henrietta Palaiologos in the INN studio. It was stupid. The main reporter, a big-bosomed woman, called out sick today. Athena knew that was a lie. She was probably in the bed of some noble. Probably a Doukas. But because of that, she was now forced to interview Henrietta Palaiologos. Sweet Jesus. She just got this job a few months ago and only talked about the weather. But now she was expected to interview the heir to the Imperial Throne, the regent of the Roman Empire? Ridiculous. Completely and utterly ridiculous.
 
“Well, Miss Komnenos,” Henrietta said. She smiled those perfect glossy-white teeth. Her makeup hid every wrinkle and blemish, and it was good enough that it looked natural. “I underestimated the position. It leaves me exhausted at the end of each day. The Imperator has many stresses on her plate. However, I’ve grown more and more accustomed every day.”
 
“Shut up old hag,” Athena said. Or, she wished to say. Athena wasn’t too familiar with the Palace’s political environment, but she figured it was the same as the intrigue that went on in the Komnenos household when she was younger. Instead, she smiled and beamed.
 
“So can you tell us more about the Imperator’s vacation?” she said. “It has been rather hush-hush. I’m sure our citizens wish to know if they could get a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see the Basilissa.”
 
“Unfortunately, details about the Basilissa’s vacation are highly classified,” Henrietta said. And then she smiled even more widely. Athena was certain it was fake or forced. “However, I do know she considers it her honeymoon with Basileus John Smith, and she’s not on Holy Terra. I urge citizens that if they do see through her disguise that they do not bother her. She deserves this vacation. It would be her first break in a long time.”
 
Athena almost gagged. Wow, the garbage she spewed. Did anybody actually believe her when she said she renounced all relations with her son, Constantine the Pretender? Ugh. Unbelievable. “Thank you for your concern, Imperator-Regent. I’m sure the Basilissa appreciates it. Now, can you tell us about your work? What have you done in your first few weeks?”
 
“Well, my primary concern has been improving relations with our alien neighbors. We do not want to enter another war so soon, and we need to be strong enough to fight against the Tezekian birds. I have secured a non-aggression pact with the Najklax Serene State.”

http://imgur.com/a/uIG5v

Athena shuddered, but it was an exaggerated movement for the unthinking consumers of the Imperial News Network. “Ew, those spiders? Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
 
“Yes. We need all allies we can get. In the meantime, I have also improved relations with other nations by giving them research agreements, star charts, and other various gifts of goodwill. The Finu Kingdom and Jogollwa Confederacy are quite pleased with our gifts.”

http://imgur.com/a/BJDOh

http://imgur.com/a/804mD

“Are there any concerns that we are giving aliens all of this free research?” Athena asked. She was actually interested in the answer. She recalled where the alien empires were located. The Finu Kingdom was located directly south and the Jogollwa Confederacy were located to the east across a Milky Way  arm. The Imperium didn’t have powerful enough warp drives strong enough to jump over, but the Jogollwa Confederacy definitely did.

“I have full confidence in building goodwill with these aliens,” Henrietta said. “We have not done much of these negotiations before. That may be why we have terrible relations with most aliens. In this violent galaxy, I am confident this diplomacy will bring peace to the Imperium. I have results that shows this is a good strategy. See, the Najklax Serene State is providing us with their own research and even some minerals after we built up relations with them.”

http://imgur.com/a/y00Im

“Ouch, low blow to Imperator Allysse,” Athena thought, and then she smiled again. “Interesting tactics you have there, Imperator-Regent. Well, let’s hope they work in the future.”
 
“Yes, yes,” Henrietta said. “But while we do want to increase our relations with these powerful xenoi empires, we still have to keep in mind our own personal powerbase. So with that I took the initiative to incorporate another primitive system in the Thuban system.”

http://imgur.com/a/CS0sp

Athena thought she was well-versed in the many facets of politicking. She always knew how to wear a porcelain smile and knew how everybody lied. But this caught off her guard. She choked on some air, her eyes widening at Henrietta’s words.
 
“Excuse me, Imperator-Regent,” Athena said. While she recovered, her mind raced through her knowledge of the universe. Where was the Thuban system? Some primitives owned a planet called Veorix there, right? “I think I misheard you. Did you just say you’ve invaded the Thuban system?”
 
“Oh, no, invasion is such a strong word,” Henrietta said, still smiling. “You see, the Veorix system was already well within our declared borders. I’m simply integrating them into the Imperium.”
 
Athena wished the primary interviewer was here. She really wasn’t suited for this job. “I’m sorry Imperator-Regent, my ears are acting up. Let me put it this way. Did you land troops on the planet of Veorix?”
 
“A policing force led by General Long Wang,” Henrietta said. “As with any rebellious population, the aliens on Veorix don’t accept our rightful rule yet. But in due time they will understand their benevolent rulers.”

http://imgur.com/a/sirwa

Athena could see her boss jumping up and down behind the cameras. She wasn’t sure what he was telling her to do. She used to have an earpiece to talk to the producer, but she had broken it a long time ago to stop listening to his annoying voice. Maybe she shouldn’t have done that.
 
“Um, who is this Long Wang fellow?” Athena said. She could see her boss smack his face with his palm. Whoops.
 
“Excellent question. He’s an extremely talented general that I discovered during the War of Independence. I’m astonished the Basilissa hasn’t discovered a man of his talents yet.”
 
Athena was tempted. She really was. But unfortunately, she was a professional airing a live interview in front of a billion Roman citizens which included children and the highly religious. She couldn’t do it. She wondered if everybody watching or reading the news would make the connection between Long Wang and the Basilissa’s lack of “experience.”
 
Ugh, she should stop thinking about that. There were more pressing questions to ask at the moment. Like how Henrietta secretly invaded some aliens out of nowhere. She paused, remembering her lessons from her various Komnenoi family members. To calm down and take a deep breathe. That is how you deal with dumbasses. Out of the corner of her eye she could see her boss flapping his hands around, silently shouting at her.
 
“This is an interesting decision you made,” Athena said. “Wouldn’t the aliens, not just the primitives, but the galaxy at large be angry at our sudden invasion? How does our population feel about this? How does the Imperator feel about this? And why did we invade this sovereign nation?”
 
Athena couldn’t tell what Henrietta was feeling. The heir to the Imperial Throne was even more experienced at public speaking than she was. However, the Komnenoi girl could just feel that Henrietta was nervous. Maybe only a little bit. Maybe she was annoyed that the supposedly loyal Imperial News Network was questioning her. Whatever it was, Athena wanted answers. Not because it was her job, but because she didn’t want some dumbass to run the Imperium into the ground right after another the Imperium was freed from the beans.
 
“That is a lot of insightful questions,” Henrietta said calmly. “But with my improvement of our foreign relations, I doubt the galaxy will care about our renewed enforcement of our interior borders. And Imperator Allysse surely can’t criticize me; she already invaded and annexed two whole xenoi planets during her reign. What’s an additional xenoi planet?  Lastly, we can’t always rely on diplomacy to solve our problems. Just like we need strong allies, we also need a strong base. Securing another alien planet which is clearly in our borders is within our God-given rights. I am doing nothing wrong, but preparing ourselves for a potential war with the Thembolans or the Tezekians.”
 
Damn. She answered those questions as smoothly as, well, Athena was bad at analogies. But Athena just felt scummy, just like all of those dumbasses she avoided when she ran away from home. The Regent purposefully avoided using the words “invaded” or “attacked,” and generally seemed apathetic to the fact she conquered a home world when the Imperium was supposed to be recovering. Regardless of how she justified it, it just felt bad.
 
“Oh, I forgot to mention,” Henrietta said, going on as if invading aliens was as common as morning breakfast. “To round out my first week, Dr. Pitt finished researching mountain clearing. I don’t know why the Imperator ordered him to research something as simple as mountain removal. He’s a brilliant man. The Imperator says he’s eccentric and, in her words, ‘weird,’ but I find him a model citizen of the Imperium. Every child should strive to be like him. Anyways, he’s now researching how to create more efficient quarters in our ships and spaceports. Battles last forever so it’s important their living bedrooms are clean.”

http://imgur.com/a/TvIHN

Then a lightbulb went off in Athena’s head. She thought something was strange. No, not just Henrietta’s deceptive conversations nor her calm and confident demeanor. Something was just plain weird when the Regent talked about the alien invasion.
 
“I have one final question, Imperator-Regent,” Athena Komnenos asked. “Forgive me for asking, I haven’t done proper research. What’s the name of the alien species that lives on Veorix?”
 
Henrietta looked puzzled. “Oh, I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. All xenoi are the same anyways.”

5wfzgs,135,2017-02-27,"""Where are the backup tapes?""",toast888,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5wfzgs/where_are_the_backup_tapes/,"Hello TFTS I am toast, first time caller, long time listener. 

Background:

Just started a helpdesk internship while I'm studying, and I'm pretty new at this stage. 

The characters of the story are:

* $me = Have a guess
* $DS = Desktop Support (mainly works with setting up PCs and hardware)
* $NA = Network admin (also does some PC support)
* $PC = PC support (pretty much teir 2 helpdesk)
* $SA = Sysadmin (does emails and servers and works the tape backup)
* $XHD = They guy I replaced (he's a ""junior programmer"" now)
* $R = Receptionist

Story:

So I'm just doing my thing, fixing outlooks and resetting passwords when $R visits me.

&gt;$R: Hey $me, where are the tapes?

The backup tapes are supposed to be taken from the tape server and left at reception for the guy to come and collect it. But on this day, $SA was away and nobody had taken the tapes to reception and the guy was here to collect the tapes. 

Now I'd been working there for about 4 weeks, but I knew that if $SA was away $PC was supposed to take care of the tapes, I looked over at his vacant desk with anxious eyes. Something needed to be done because the tape guy was waiting.

 I knew $XHD knew how to do it, buuuut lucky for me he's gone too...

I had to act fast, something needed to be done. 

So I turned to $DS

&gt; $me: $DS the backup tapes aren't at reception, could you get them?""

&gt; $DS: Uhh...

&gt;$DS: Hey $NA, do you know how to get the backup tapes?

&gt;$NA: They're not at reception?

&gt;$NA: That's right, $SA's away. $PC hasn't got them out? Hmm...

At this point they're kinda just standing around not actually working on getting the tapes to the guy.

Welp, guess I'll have to do it. 

I speed-walked my way to the tape server, straining my brain trying to remember what $XHD told me on day one about how to get the tapes out. He told me in passing, but then followed up with, ""Don't worry too much, $SA has it covered"". After navigating the menu on the 3"" lcd screen, I managed to open the I/O slot and grabbed the tapes, and handed them over to $R.

&gt; $R: Have you got a case for the tapes?

&gt;$me: Uhh... $NA have you seen a case for the tapes?

&gt;$NA No, I'm not sure. 

&gt;$me: $R says she needs a case for the tapes.

&gt;$NA: Uhh...

&gt;$R: It's a white case.

&gt;$me: It's a white case.

&gt;$NA: Oh! A case for the tapes!

*face--&gt;palm*

Hands me the cases, I put the tapes in them and give them to $R and she walks off.

&gt;$NA: Does $R need one of those tags?

&gt;$me: Tags?

&gt;$NA: Yeah, usually we send the taps off with a tag.

&gt;$me: I'm not sure.

$NA heads to $SA's desk, grabs an anti-tamper tag.

&gt;$NA: One of these. Maybe go check...

So I grab it and run to reception, where the tape guy has the tapes and is about to leave.

&gt;$me: Hey did you need one of these?

&gt;$tapeGuy: Yeah. Thanks.

He puts the tag on the carry case and leaves, but he would have happily left without the tag. 

Later that day $XHD walks past my desk.

&gt;$me: Hey $XHD, Lucky you told me how to get the tapes from the backup server, I had to do it today when $PC was away.

&gt;$XHD: Cool, have you checked the new ones in?

&gt;$me: Wha...?

&gt;$XHD: Don't worry, I'll show you.

So, when checking a tape into the server, you need to run a command, put the tape in, then tell the process to continue when the tape is in, by replying with the appropriate process number. $XHD explains it all to me as he does it. 

&gt;$XHD: Okay, I've replied to this process, when it disappears from the process list, you can check in the next tape. It should take 5-10 minutes.

After 20 minutes, it's still not gone. So I take lunch, and it's gone when I come back. Perfect. I put the other tape into the server and start trying to check it in, but it throws an error, something along the lines of ""Error multiple tapes in I/O slot, please use [command] for bulk check-in"" (I don't remember the exact message).

&gt;$me: Hey $XHD, I can't check in the tape

&gt;$XHD: Huh, that's weird. Wait, when you put the tape in, was the other tape still in the I/O slot?

&gt;$me: Yeah... why?

&gt;$XHD: That's not right, it should disappear from the I/O slot when it's checked in.

He checks the tapes currently in the server and sees the first tape hasn't checked in properly which is why it's still in the slot. We go to the server and remove the 2nd tape, and try to check in the first tape again. While we wait he goes over the commands he entered to figure out what happened.

&gt;$XHD: Oh. $me, make sure that when you're replying to the checkin process that you use the correct process number, or the process will time out and it won't check in. 

&gt;$me: I'll keep that in mind.

At least now I know how to do the backup tapes..."

5wh4sk,2,2017-02-27,How to make friends during the summer as an adult? (Between college semesters),thelittlepowered13,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5wh4sk/how_to_make_friends_during_the_summer_as_an_adult/,"I have a very weird situation on my hands. It's kind of long, so bear with me:
So I am originally from a small town not too far from NYC (an hour and about twenty minutes by train). I grew up in small towns most of my life. When I was a kid and yes even in high school, I was very shy and very sensitive.  I went through  bouts of anxiety and depression that kept me shut down and away from others.  I didn't know who I was in high school, I was hard on myself. I was bullied a lot in middle school and that made it hard for me to open up to friends. And then in high school I made some friends but once we all graduated, none of us stayed really in touch. I stopped being friends with my closest friend after my first year at college (I asked her why she didn't want to see me on winter break and she said her acting was more important than our friendship basically). And a lot of my other friends I'm having trouble staying in contact or getting them to make plans. I feel like I should just move on from my high school group. I have only one very good friend who consistently wants to see me every break and they work a lot, which I understand. 
NOW, when I'm at college two hours away from where I live upstate, it's completely different! When I was in high school, because my graduating class was under about 90 kids, I was so worried about how I was perceived every day. Now at school, I have so many more friends, am way more confident and social, and have joined clubs and activities! I let go of some of my shyness.  I work up here. I even moved up here last summer and lived at a friend's house.Because of this reason too I also lost touch with so many people back home, because during that summer people moved out and such.  
However, this upcoming summer I don't think I can afford to live at an apartment, which I'm okay with. I'd rather save up for next semester. I have also met my boyfriend who lives down near me, about twenty minutes away, and I already know I want him to be a big part of my life. We have something very special and I feel safe and secure and loved with him. However, I don't think he realizes how introverted, practically lonely I am back home. I am afraid if he finds out he and one other friend are the only non-family people I see regularly back home, he'll be concerned. When he visited me at school recently, he said ""Wow! You're a social butterfly!"" I just don't want to be lonely when I move back home this summer. I don't get along with my family very well, as most of them can be shut-ins and don't leave the house much. It can be a bit frustrating because I don't want to be like that either.
And I want to be productive this summer too! Right now, I am doing all this planning. I am applying for internships near the city left and right and hope to get a waitressing job as well part time to keep me busy during the summer (or really, almost any part time job). I am also planning to work for both my friend Alyssa's small buisness (she is from upstate near school) and possibly my brother's small buisness. 
I have almost like a ""game plan"" in my head for the summer so I don't lose my momentum- hopefully get an internship, get a job, work on these small businesses,  maybe take some college courses at a community college, sign up for workout classes at the gym and some 5k races. I just fear downtime and being lonely. I can plan an entire summer ahead, yes even now in March, but I am afraid of going home friendless. That's why even spring break I'm not coming home for too long. 
I feel like when I was in high school I don't know what I did wrong as to why I couldn't hang on to friends, friends I could have now. I also don't want to be stuck in the past. I was considering going to a Meetup group this summer for hiking or something. I've been looking up online classes to take, just avenues to try new things and meet new people, even if its not guaranteed. But if anybody has any suggestions for me to find new friends in my area this summer, I would greatly appreciate it! I want to chase passions, not people. And I just want to widen my friend group circle and be the ""real me"" the bubbly, optimistic person I grew to be in college, not who I was in high school. 
Any suggestions? "

I'm a sophomore in CS right now, and I can't find an internship. I can't even get an interview. I didn't have any experience coding before college, so classes are harder for me than a lot of my peers. My GPA isn't bad (mid 3s), and I have a few projects and have done some work in ACM SIGs, but I still can't find ANYTHING, even though I've been to every career fair. 

I'm kind of awkward, which makes it hard to make a good impression. I don't know what else I could do in terms of academics to increase my chances aside from raise my GPA, but classes are getting harder. 241 and physics 212 are killing me. I'm at office hours whenever I can, but it doesn't help too much. I'm still super behind all the time and don't really have a good understanding of the content.

 I'm always sick from not getting enough sleep and general stress. I've been to the counseling center, and they give good advice, but I still can't help but get stressed out, and they don't offer any long-term therapy. The time there takes away from my studying too. 

It's not that I care too much about grades for no reason, because I know it doesn't matter that much. It's that I want an internship, and this seems like the only way I can boost my chances. 

Please give me advice. "

So after all that work I was informed by my dad (who talks with the intern director because he's my legal guardian) that she expressed concern that I can't do a job at all. She told my dad to try to convince me to drop out so I wouldn't waste anymore money (I'm almost graduated the only thing holding gem up is these internships) or at least switch to computer technology from computer engineering because that doesn't require a co-op. 

She said that there's no way I'm getting hired and even if I do there's no way I can keep it. Normally I'd tell her to fuck off but she's been a hiring manager for multiple big N companies and apparently has been doing this for a very very very long time.

The product was written over 10 years ago in C and there are no modern technologies being used here.  Nobody on my team writes code - they just play with configurations and run tests.  I don't have any mentorship, and communication with anyone who isn't a manager is incredibly difficult.  For a variety of other reasons, I'm miserable at my job and I want out.  Combined with some personal issues, there are days when I just want to give up on life.

I've been looking for other jobs in the area (LA/Irvine) and aside from defense contractors and big N companies, there is no generic ""just know x languages and apply.""  Every job posting requires that you are familiar with a certain domain, and have used xyz technologies/frameworks.  I understand the technologies/frameworks can typically be picked up on the job as long as you're familiar with the domain - but the problem is that as a recent grad without any focus, I don't hold valuable experience in any domain.  Outside of my general coding experience in school, I've worked on ""embedded"" software (in quotes because Arduino), and taught myself about web dev at an internship (RoR, JS, perl, SQL, bash).  But that was just getting my feet wet with web dev and I wouldn't be able to land a job with what I currently know (I was just trying to get things working - didn't focus on learning about proper web dev).

I've been trying to learn new skills and search for jobs after work, but it's incredibly difficult to do so.  I'm exhausted and feeling depressed every day when I get home, making learning difficult.  Searching for jobs is a bit easier, but it looks like 90% of entry level software positions are for web devs/test engineers/QA... and I'm just not qualified for those positions.

I have enough money to last me til the end of the year, so I've been seriously thinking about quitting my job to learn web dev full time.  If I do quit that would also give me the time to take a break from things and sort out personal issues (maybe not ""fix"" them completely, but at least find a way to deal with them...)  I know it would be ideal to find a new job while I have this one... but I feel like I'm going to break if I stay much longer.  Is this at all reasonable?"

This is an especially bad GPA because i go to a very mediocre school. My chances for a summer 2017 internship are bleak as well because my projects suck and i dont have any prior CS related work experience. 

I have dealt with some health issues + i dont really have any friends to collaborate with which is why i have struggled. Not trying to make excuses for my poor performance though.

I am really starting to worry about my chances of getting a job after graduation. Graduating from a terrible school w/o an internship and a low GPA seems like a death sentence. Yes the bay area is the hottest CS job market but that also means incredible competition. What chance do i even have competing against all these top students who are all trying to make it to the bay area?

Is my only hope at this point to do as many impressive projects as possible? The more complex the better? Like 3 or 4 really solid ones? I am obviously not even aiming for big N at this point, i just want to be able to find SOME job in the bay area that hopefully pays over $60K. I know this is below market rate for a new grad in the bay area but i myself am below average so i can not complain about this.

Does anyone have any advice? Bad school + bad GPA + likely no internship sounds like a recipe for absolute disaster and it is keeping me awake at night."

In my masters program, I spent a lot of time concentrating on algorithms and distributed / parallel algorithms. My dream job would be to become a Site reliability or infrastructure engineer but my low level school name would not even pass the computer filtering process at some companies because I didn't go to Harvard.

What companies can I apply to that will appreciate my heavy concentration in Algorithms and Java programming ?

I'm just really looking for any hope at all in my situation. The only real experience I have is as an adjunct professor for 1.5 years teaching Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming.

I plan to apply to full time jobs this summer while contributing heavily to open source projects. The problem is that so many companies have strict requirements where you have to apply with X programming language with knowledge of some specific frameworks.

My current position barely has me scraping by. 

I assume the position would be a standard 9-5 workweek. For this semester (which is halfway through) my classes would conflict with this. I could withdraw from my courses and get a 'W' before the beginning of April, so that's an option but probably not ideal. For upcoming semesters, I could arrange my schedule accordingly and I wouldn't mind taking longer to graduate and going to school only part-time if it means that I'm working in my field. Currently, I'm set to graduate this December.

Also, average salary for the position according to Glassdoor is about 45k a year. Less than I expected, I'm in the greater Atlanta area and was hoping to find a job for 60k. Is that unreasonable?

I'm a junior CS student who hasn't done an internship or research before (because I switched my major kind of late) and I will probably be looking for a job next year. So my questions are:

1.) For folks who have done both, which experience did you learn more from? Which was more fulfilling?

2.) Which looks more impressive on a resume and says more about your abilities? Which will stand out more to recruiters?

EDIT: thanks so much for the responses so far! As some folks pointed out, I should have established that I plan to go into industry for a few years after graduating but I really want to go to grad school at some point."

If I delay my graduation until Summer 2018 or Dec 2018, I will have the opportunity to do 1-2 more internships.  I want to do this because I want more coding experience and/or a PM internship under my belt (career goal) before going for full-time.

5wkicd,15,2017-02-27,"""It's only a symbol"" (Part 1)",chrisraydj,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5wkicd/its_only_a_symbol_part_1/,"For some background, It was about a year ago when all of this happened and I will try my best to go into as much detail as I can. Somethings I can’t mention due to the ongoing case to this day but I think it is time to let go of some of it.

I walk into the forest and see the same stone with the same symbol scratched in.

This time felt different, though. I could feel eyes on me, looking through me. I look up only to see a shadow of a man across the low canopy, in which stood tall grass and a cabin. The cabin was new this time. I didn’t see it before in my other versions of the dream.

The shadow only stood about 6 feet next to the side of the cabin in the woods. Just standing there eerily and seemingly looking at me.

I awoke from my dream and pondered as to why I have been seeing this symbol in my dreams for the past few nights.

I have had this dream before although it seems each time it is different. This symbol I see is always in each one. It tends to be cut in stone but always in a different spot.

I got dressed and got ready for work. Ran outside to start my old Honda civic. For a 20-year-old car that has over 100,000 miles on it still seemed to scrape by. Being an intern fresh in my freshman year of college meant that I would only get credit for my classes rather than any sort of income from them.

Luckily I had a job at a local movie theater and was able to get to see the latest in films for free. Minimum wage sucked but I love movies so I guess it worked out.

My girlfriend worked at a small town pizza place a few blocks down. We had met at a movie club where we talked about films. Yes, we were kind of movie nerds but I guess it only takes one common interest to spark something.

Sarah (The GF) and I never went on many dates. With trying to afford college it meant constantly trying to find ways to work extra shifts and pay off student loans. We always talked on facetime and the continuous text was always happening.

Tonight was special, though. We made it to our one-year anniversary.

There was a restaurant that she loved to go to in a few towns over so I picked her up with a cheesy red rose and the old busted civic. It was a great time, for once we didn’t have to worry about work or school and we could enjoy each other’s company.

I mentioned how we are movie geeks so without a doubt we went to the cinema to see “The Revenant”. Grabbed our usual popcorn and looked for every little detail in terms of story and well you get the gist of it.

As I was watching I noticed something strange in one of the scenes.

I looked at the small boat they had used and noticed the camera cut to the symbol that I saw in my dreams.

I had watched this trailer multiple time before seeing the movie and never noticed anything strange before. I should also mention that this symbol I had been seeing only came about within my dreams. I had never seen it before then.

I brushed it off and didn’t even mention it to Sarah assuming it was my brain placing it in there for whatever reason.

We went to the car after watching the movie and talked about what we enjoyed about it and at the time we discussed how that is the movie Leo deserves an Oscar for.

Dropped her off and she invited back to her place because her parents were not home. I went upstairs and we did our thing.

I went out to the car around 11 at night. It was frigid out but that is the way New England is. Her neighborhood was always very quiet around that time. “Shit” I forgot my keys upstairs. I ran upstairs to find Sarah, asleep and tiptoed back down to my car.

Across the street were trees standing by the sidewalk. I looked over close to her neighbor’s house which was a very small house almost cabin like, and I saw a tall shadow close to the porch light.

Sarah’s neighbor who lived there was a smoker so I brushed it off thinking they were out smoking a lung dart.

It wasn’t until I got in the car and started driving that I noticed the note in my passenger seat.

It was a small red piece of paper which felt like really old papyrus paper. It was folded and I opened it at the next stop light.

The symbol was on the note in dark black ink that looked like it was written with a feather pen.

Top 25% of the class in a catholic college prep school. Second generation college student (parents went to community college)


Intended Major: Mechanical/Electrical Engineering


Intended Minor: Computer Science


Test Scores: (pretty low sadly)
-SAT:1280 (670 CR / 610 Math)
-SAT Subject Tests: Like the SAT, I didn't perform well on my Subject Tests either. 550 on Math 2 and 510 on Physics. 


Academics:
-GPA: Cumulative GPA:4.01 weighted   S1 Senior Year: 4.08 
-Coursework: 5 total APS; currently taking AP Physics, AP Calculus AB, and AP Statistics. I took AP Euro Sophomore Year and AP US Junior Year. I also took numerous honors and advanced honors classes in mathematics, english, and science.


Extracurriculars: Comic Book Club participant, Social Justice Committee Member, Summer Job at Summer Youth Employment Program, Theatre/Drama Society, Pitcher and Second Baseman for local baseball team, Ping Pong Club, Science Club, numerous hours of service at a local soup kitchen and legal office (P.O.T.S.), Anime Club Vice President, Senior Internship building a Rube Goldberg Machine, self taught coding, Retreat Leader in school
Comments: A circumstance that can explain my lack of extracurriculars is that my mother made me pick my sister up from school every day at 4:30, therefore limiting my time that I can dedicate to extracurriculars.


Essays: 
-Common App: 8-9/10. Pretty good, I spent a lot of time and effort on the essay and had it proofread by many people
- Supplements: 7-10/10 (depending on which schools). Most of my essays were heart-felt and well-written, especially for my reaches, and others were decent and satisfactory.


Recommendations: No idea how to rank the recommendations as our school prevents us from seeing them and my guidance counselor doesn't really talk to her students about the recs. I'd say 9/10 for my first one (English teacher) as we grew pretty close and I've had her for two years and 7-8/10 for my second one (math teacher) as he admired my hard work in the class and always told me I was one of his best students.

Due to illness, I had a bad first year so I had to catch up on some prerequisites. Ended up spending my first summer taking summer classes (summer 2015). Couldn't get any internships on my second summer (summer 2016), so I ended up teaching myself R and Python. I have a fairly good grasp on both of them, plus some machine learning experience through Kaggle. I'm applying to internships right now (summer 2017) and I all I get is non-responses. If I hear back, it's a polite rejection letter. Not a single interview. 

""Whatever, it's normal for econ BAs not to have internships because they aren't very qualified to do anything meaningful"", I thought to myself. ""Just keep studying"".

I opened a LinkedIn account the past month. I've come to realize that I am one of the few in my cohort that doesn't have any work experience whatsoever. I start talking about my peers about it. They're getting interviews left and right. And here I am, fucking doing nothing.

I don't want to toot my own horn. But I am going through blood, sweat and tears with my degree. I went out of my way to take fucking 3 graduate level econometrics classes and 1 mathematical economics class. And I performed on par with grad students. I taught myself R and Python and I am very good at them compared to other econ undergrads. Meanwhile, there are undergraduate students that are taking easy elective classes that have no apparent value outside of academia. And they're getting internships and interviews willy-nilly.

So what is the end result of all of this? I am doing all-nighters quite regularly (I've had maybe 12 hours of sleep in the past three days), studying mathematics, econometrics and doing empirical projects, and I get no interviews. Meanwhile, there are fellow undergraduate students that take easy classes, drink themselves to death every weekend, and they end up with interviews and internships. I mean, I'm not expecting a perfect meritocracy but I'm at my wits' end. Getting rejected time after time like this without any feedback on what went wrong with my application or any sort of indication why I was rejected is really starting to play with my sanity. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I went to the career counseling service at my university. I received nothing but good feedback on my CV and my resume. So I doubt it's down to that. 

Maybe it's cause I am a first generation immigrant and I have no connections. Fuck at this point I'm trying to find any logical explanation for me not getting anything, not even interviews. I understand if I was socially awkard and I bombed during the interview process, but no one even calls me for an interview. I ended up applying to graduate school. At this point I'm so used to rejection that I won't be surprised if I got rejected from there as well.

Just the other day, my math econ teacher returned the assignment to our class. I had 37/50. Not great, but whatever. But then I realized there are people *that I tutor*, who end up with 46/50 and up. I asked them how -- they just copied the answers from the smart kid in the class. It's starting to appear to me as if I should be lieing and behind dishonest as much as I can get away with. There are people who cheat on their midterms by stuffing papers with all the formulas in their pants, and then ask teachers to go to the bathroom mid-exam. I've been an honest person, but maybe there is truth to Machiavelli's Prince archetype.

Re-reading my post, I sound fucking nuts. If this was someone else's post I would read it and laugh at the level of crazy. I think I need therapy."

This company has gotten great reviews all around and I'm really excited to have gotten an offer from them. The best part is that they are specifically looking for interns that will join them after their last year of college, so I'm trying to research as much as I can so that I don't fuck up this opportunity. 

Since this is my first software engineering internship, I don't know a lot about what to expect, so I've been scouring this subreddit for any advice that I can stumble upon, but most posts on here seem to focus on acquiring an internship.

I have several main questions I wanted to ask:

1) I've heard a lot of conflicting information regarding asking questions. I've heard some say that you should ask a lot of questions, and I've heard others say you should try not to ask any questions. I see the validity in both points - I obviously shouldn't be asking stupid questions without doing any research if I'm having trouble, but wouldn't it be equally as bad to keep to myself? 

2) If I do have a question, should I go to the lead engineer that I've been assigned to? Or should I ask one of the software engineers in my team first? Is there a hierarchy of sorts I should go through before going to the top guy?

(clarifying question)
3) If a company invites an intern to come back after the internship to work full time, do they place the intern with the same team they worked with during the internship, or is there typically a degree of choice? This question really has to do with the fact that I have no idea what team I am going to be placed with (I don't even know if I have a say in the matter). So if they place me with a mobile app team, would it be hard for me to switch to, for example, a front-end web dev team after getting the full time offer? 

These were just some specific questions I was hoping someone could answer, but if you have any advice that could help a first time intern, please let me know! I greatly appreciate it. "

I've found my passions to be both cyber security and data analysis for sure and this semester proves it as I've been exposed to data modeling and analysis and have enjoyed it more than anything I've done in college. 

I am concerned because my current internship/job is not the place for me. People operate in a silo mentality and it is I before us environment. I've always worked in teams and with teams but unfortunately at this job it isn't possible. Also when I ask a question rather then being helped I am usually shunned for it by pessimistic comments from the head engineer. It's super frustrating because all I want to do is succeed and help grow myself and the company. One thing is for certain I do not want to start my career here.

Unfortunately I don't have the tools in my arsenal to go out and get a full fledge career in data analysis. Times running out as well as I graduate in summer and don't want to be unemployed in graduation.

I've been considering to try to obtain a masters to buy some time or outright trying to find jobs. I am graduating with management info. systems degree and it was more tailored towards business/consulting and as a utility major to other business majors and isn't taken seriously by anyone.

Chapter 41:  Alternative News

An Aldari, Jhoolian, and human were sitting at the airport. The security guards would’ve thought this was the start of a lame bar joke if it wasn’t for all of the serious-faced lawyers, witnesses, and judges who didn’t look like they had a sense of humor.
 
“So, let me get this straight,” a lawyer said, tapping his electronic pen against his tablet. “At sixteen-hundred local time you, Private Maria Longshanks, claim that you met and interacted with Sophia Komnenos, twin sister of the famed Athena Komnenos in the Imperial Bazaar.”
 
“I told you. No, I don’t just claim,” Maria said impatiently. “I know. She told me herself. And she would have told you too if she was here.”
 
“But you had no proof she was Sophia Komnenos?” the lawyer continued. “You only had her word and, ahem, the hearing abilities of this alien?”
 
“She’s not just an alien. She has a name. Alice,” Maria said.
 
“Why are we talking about this?” another lawyer said. “It’s beside the point. Who cares if it was really Athena Komnenos? The allegations are whether or not a xenoi attacked the famed Russian scientist Boris Federov.”
 
Maria wanted to scream. The three of them were in a rather informal court gathering.  They were in an airport instead of an actual court room because apparently there were some orders from Constantinople for the Imperial navy to mobilize. The engineer was dying to know what the hell was going on in space, and not deal with this ridiculous hearing.
 
Sophia Komnenos disappeared soon after that incident. That was fine. The woman told her that she should probably escape, lest she meet the clutches of the media and subsequently the wrath of the Komnenos family.
 
What was not fine was that everybody thought that OoO attacked an apparently famous Russian scientist. On purpose. As in, people believed that OoO maliciously assaulted the unprovoked man who was doing research on Alpha Centauri. Which was completely idiotic. She had no idea how that happened. There were hundreds of people in the bazaar, all of which saw the bounty hunter run off with the screaming woman. But for some reason the media ran with the story “innocent man mauled by space slug.” Nor did it help that apparently there were a lot of alien racists (specists? Xenoists?) in the bazaar that day.
 
Boris Federov, the name of the bounty hunter, was lapping up all the attention.
 
“It was as if I hit a brick wall,” he said reporters thrusting their microphones near his mouth. He had a hint of a French accent, and Maria felt glad he still had two black eyes. She felt disgusted that she felt that the Russian/French man was at least remotely attractive. “I’m a large man. It takes a lot to bring moi down. I tried to calm the slug, but alas, nothing could stop his rage. Now, I don’t blame him for my injuries. Maybe he didn’t mean it. But Jhoolians are dangerous to be around, because at the flick of a switch they can beat le feces out of you.”
 
“You liar!” Maria yelled. Some guards had to restrain her. “You were the one that tried punching him first! OoO barely did anything! You were the one that got knocked back!”
 
“See what the unintelligible petite girl says?” Boris said. “The slugs hardly need to raise a finger to harm us. Look at me. I have two black eyes, three fractured ribs, and I’ll need to enter rehab for the next six months to fully recover. I salute our soldiers for being able to subjugate them with such a minute army. Those are brave warriors who could fight the monstrous xenoi like that.”
 
Maria was trembling, her fists balled up. Why the hell wasn’t anybody else speaking up? They were all there. They all saw Boris Federov making his way through the bazaar, pushing aside women and children. This was completely, incredibly unfathomable.
 
Nova Alexandria’s airport was only one of the five places on Alpha Centauri Prime where one could take a shuttle up to the space station. It was dominated by glass ceilings and walls, perhaps inspired by Jhoolian architecture. It gave the illusion that every room was much larger than it actually was. Trying to calm herself by gripping her bag, she forced herself to reassess. No, there were people that argued. Perhaps not as loudly, and perhaps not as argumentatively. But they were there. Individual citizens calmly and quietly described their viewing of events to the various judges and priests.
 
The judicial branch of the Imperium Romanum was headed entirely by the clergy, led by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople and the Pope in Rome. Upon conquering the first capital of the Romans soon after the execution of Charlemagne, the Immortal Imperator was at an impasse. While she could just force the Pope to bow to her, the Latin westerners and barbarians would not agree to that. They would have probably set up a new head of Christendom. The thought of their religious head, God’s regent on Earth, subservient to a human, a female human no less, would’ve triggered revolts in the already rebellious territories of Gaul, Germania, and other recently conquered parts of the Holy Roman Empire. So Bella Palaiologos had to find a different solution. And so, she established the third arm of the Imperium.
 
In addition to the Senate and Imperator branches, she gave power to the church to preside over court trials. Cases could be escalated from the lowest levels of priest and bishops all the way to the highest level of the five religious heads of the Pentarchy which both the Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch supervised. And in this last, highest level, if the five seats unanimously agreed, a law drafted by the Senate and even the Imperator could be stricken down.
 
This gave the Immortal Imperator much respect and veneration. As the clergy was already the moral leader in medieval times, adapting the Christian bodies into a legal framework was easy. While there were still rebellions, none of them had any legitimacy in the eyes of the general public as any peasant leader would be revolting not only against the Roman Imperator but also the Pope.
 
Mind, the Pope nor clergy never actually did end up revoking any of Imperator Bella’s laws. While many local and provincial laws were deemed illegal and/or heretical, no Imperial-wide rule was repealed. Over the centuries the Imperator regained her power over the judicial branch, especially with the act that established the Imperial Executive Order. But by that time, well after the Immortal Imperator subdued Christendom, there was no one that doubted Imperator Bella was the second coming of Jesus, or the Messiah, or God’s true regent on earth.
 
Which is why half the lawyers and judges were wearing white clothes and funny hats. Honestly, they would’ve preferred for the “hearing” to be at the local church or court, but one man prevented this incident from even being a “trial” in the first place.
 
Grand Admiral S’bu Chukwumereije was at the center of attention. He was bound to a wheelchair. Apparently he spent most of his time in zero gravity even if there wasn’t a battle; the white-bearded commander said that it helped him think. Even the mandatory muscle-empowering drugs couldn’t reverse years and years of muscle atrophy. He was already old, but now he basically looked like a corpse. His eyelids couldn’t even stay open, and a nurse hurried around, shooing around bothersome reporters and readjusting IV needles.
 
“I’ve told you,” he said again. S’bu just sounded tired. Tired of the media, tired of the clergy, tired of the law, and tired of life. “These soldiers are under my command and authority. If anything, Maria Longshanks and yes, the two xenoi should go through a military tribunal, not this excuse you call a hearing. And I have orders from Constantinople to leave within the hour. Either this gets resolved now or you can interrogate my subordinates when they get back.”
 
“But Grand Admiral,” said a priest/lawyer, so young that he probably just graduated out of college. “We also have orders from Holy Terra that this must happen immediately. The Ecumenical Patriarch is a Komnenos too, after all. We’re already making concessions that this trial is taking place in an airport of all places.”
 
“This is not a trial and you know it,” S’bu Chukwemereije said. He took a moment to cough, and the nurse wiped the spittle from his mouth with a handkerchief. “This is an interrogation by the media and interns like you who want an extra line on their resume. Now if you don’t release my soldiers within the hour, I’ll personally ask the Imperator to detain all of you.”
 
“But Grand Admiral,” a reporter said, jabbing her microphone. The nurse snapped at her, but she didn’t relent. “You haven’t personally talked to the Imperator in years. Does she hold your opinion in high regard? When was the last time you’ve been to the Imperial Palace?”
 
An IV popped out of one of his veins, spewing saline all over the place. The nurse chided him and placed it back. S’bu didn’t flinch at the re-insertion. “I’ll be on my ship,” he said. “I don’t need to answer any of you. Private Longshanks. And Ooo. And Allysse or Alice or whatever your name is. If no one comes within an hour, we’ll be leaving without you.”
 
“Wait! One last question Grand Admiral!” a reporter said. Her microphone had an Imperial News Network icon. “What are your thoughts on your current mission? We’re not in a war, and it seems rather soon, doesn’t it? Do you trust the Imperator-Regent?”
 
The nurse started pushing S’bu’s wheelchair into the nearby terminal, not caring if she ran over people’s feet, which finally prompted people to back off. It was only halfway through the walkway that he replied.
 
“I trust the Imperator who trusts the Imperator-Regent. That is enough for me.”
 
“But I want to leave toooo,” OoO said, his arms pathetically reaching towards the Admiral, but that only prodded more reporters to pester him with a million more questions.
 
“Jhoolian! How do you feel about the Imperator-Regent’s remarks about not knowing the name of a xenoi we conquered?” one said.
 
“Mr. OoO, do you feel any repentance for injuring Mr. Boris Federov?” a priest said. OoO, meanwhile, looked overwhelmed by all the questions.
 
Throughout all the questioning, Maria was trying to think. It was hard with all of the noise, even harder than it was trying to concentrate while running in the bazaar. But something was off. Just why the hell were they being interviewed like this? Were these people actually part of the media and clergy? They did have official badges, but were they faked? No, no, that was nonsense. No way they’d dare fake being part of the news or clergy right in front of the Grand Admiral himself. So they were genuine. But did genuine members of these highly-recognized organizations act so, well, unprofessionally? Anyways, Maria couldn’t think about it any further. Her head was hurting too much. There was also another voice at the back of her head, one that she couldn’t ascertain was imaginary or not. “Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!”
 
The group of onlookers was getting bigger. There were only humans in the crowd. Maria noticed that over time, whenever Alice or OoO talked, they would start jeering or yelling. She tried peeling herself away on more than one occasion, but she wasn’t given the luxury. The crowd would just push her back.
 
The questions were getting harder, and the airport clock couldn’t tick by any slower. Twenty minutes, thirty, forty…really, has only forty-five minutes passed? People were holding up signs. “EXTERMINATE ALL XENOS,” “SUFFER NOT THE XENOS. THE IMPERIUM TRIUMPHS,” and “YOU WOULDN’T LET SPIES JOIN THE NAVY. WHY ALIENS?” were some of the hastily written signs. A chant was even growing. “XENOI DELENDA EST. XENOI DELENDA EST.”
 
OoO and Alice weren’t faring well. The lawyers asked them questions that made them stutter and squirm. “How do you feel knowing that Mr. Boris Federov has a wife and two kids? Did you know the Grand Admiral is a very untrusting man and hates aliens with every fiber of his being? Did you think that you had his trust? Do you know it’s a sign of disrespect to name yourself Alice after the Imperator?”
 
OoO’s skin was getting very dry. From over the months she worked with him, Maria knew it was a sign of nervousness. The normally cool Alice wasn’t much better. While she had initially deflected the first questions, her answers grew more and more flustered.
 
But then, finally, an hour passed.
 
“Excuse me!” Maria gasped, trying to clear some space. “I have to get up now! It’s been an hour! The Grand Admiral is waiting for us!”
 
“Ah, but yes Miss Longshanks,” a lawyer said, scrolling through his tablet. “But we need you to clarify your answer to this situation. You see, you assumed that Mr. Boris Federov was a bounty hunter solely on the word of Alice the Alari? I’m your friend. I can help you out. If you can deny these allegations, then you’re free to go.”
 
“Well, yes, that’s true,” Maria said. “But she’s telling the truth. Alice would never lie. And besides, I confirmed it later with Sophia Komnenos herself and…”
 
But her voice faltered at the sad expression on the lawyer’s face.
 
“I tried my best,” he said. “But you messed up. Come with me, Miss Longshanks and her two alien friends. You won’t be going on your mission after all.”
 
“What is the meaning of this?” a voice said, storming into the area. Maria saw it was the woman who raged into her computer at the bazaar. Her hopes lit up. There she was, a member of the tour group! She had no idea where they all disappeared to. The cyborg and the short man weren’t there, but the husband and wife and the four clearly ex-military soldiers was clearly enough proof.
 
“See! I was telling the truth!” Maria said, pointing a finger at them. “These are members of the tour guide that Sophia Komnenos was leading.”
 
The reporters and lawyers and priests swarmed around them, but the woman scoffed. “Get away from me. What the hell is going on? Why the hell are these people not on their ship? Why are you detaining them against their will? Why does the media get to question the defendants? This is not a proper court hearing.”
 
“Miss?” a priest said, as if expecting a name, but the woman just glared at him. “Sorry. Under Article XVII of the Declaration of Judicial Rights line 381b, it states that—”
 
“That document doesn’t exist,” the woman said. She only seemed to be getting madder and madder. “Off! All of you! Do none of you have better things to do? This is horseshit!”
 
Boris Federov spoke up. “Ma’am, how do you know this article doesn’t exist? It’s on all our data pads right now. And what gives you the authority to just dismiss everyone?”
 
“I should hope I know every single law in the Empire,” the petite woman said. There was venom, pure venom, in every syllable of her voice. “It’s part of my job.”
 
“Oh? And who are you?” Boris asked, pumping his chest up. “We have important priests and bishops from all corners of this planet. Employees of the Imperial News Network and other trusted sources are also present. Myself, I am the top researcher scientist serving under Aoi Goto herself, the Chief of Engineering. Not a bounty hunter as these people claim. Who do you think you are just strolling into here and interrupting this conversation?”
 
The woman’s eyes got even narrower. And then, she itched her cheek. No, not just a scratch. She tore into her face and ripped off her skin.
 
“My name is Allysse Palaiologos,” she said, strands of the face mask still clinging to her hair. “Queen of the Greeks, Basilissa of the Byzantine Empire, Imperator of the Roman Empire, Augustus of the Imperium Romanum. And I’m not in a good mood today.”
 
Several of the people in the room bowed down immediately. Others begged for forgiveness. Some, trying to argue that the claim was absurd, couldn’t speak more than gibberish and collapsed to the floor after a few seconds. Her presence was intensifying. Alice had to force the awestruck OoO and Maria down.
 
“What are you fools doing? There were hundreds of witnesses in the Imperial Bazaar, myself included, who all saw this man drag Sophia Komnenos away. Do any of you idiots dispute that claim? Why are you hounding these soldiers who should be heroes? Kill the xenos? What nonsense is that? True, we’ve invaded their planets and killed millions of lives. But these two souls chose to join the Imperium despite that. OoO and Alice chose to fight for our side despite us murdering their kin and friends.”
 
“But they’re spies!” said a rogue voice. “That’s the only reason to explain it! Think about if you were in their shoes!”
 
“Do you dare insult the Imperial vetting process?” the Imperator raged. Her true face was red, and her hair not in its usual tidy braid only made her look madder. She was waving her hands around, and Maria noticed one of them was still black with ink. “Just because you have the heart of a cricket doesn’t mean these three can’t see the bigger picture! Now scram, and let these three board their ships so they can risk their lives for the Imperium instead of sit their asses at a computer all day like you worthless no-lives!”
 
Silence. Maria looked at the Imperator. She couldn’t believe it. There she was, in all of her glory, defending a mere common peasant like her. That was the sort of story that one would pass through a family for generations. But then her heart felt cold.
 
“Greetings, Private Maria Longshanks,” Decurion John Smith said, also having ripped off his face mask. No wonder why he seemed so familiar. “I heard the Regent wants us to investigate the hostiles near the black hole. We shouldn’t keep the Grand Admiral waiting. You too, Privates OoO and Alice Alari. Come along now.”
 
IMAGE_3165505
 
He grabbed her by the forearm. As she walked down the terminal, she constantly shot back glances at the Imperator. Her head was still swimming with emotions. And there was still that aggravating, male voice screaming “Idiot! Idiot!” What the hell was that about? Was there something she missed?
 
“Imperator, a quick question,” a reporter said. In fact, it was the same reporter that asked Admiral S’bu his last question.
 
“No.”
 
“Was it you who cut the Faster-Than-Light Interstellar Communications Device off so we couldn’t transmit this to our stations on Terra?”
 
The woman’s eyes went wide as she pulled out a worn computer, eyes scanning through the text.
 
“…no.”

I had a job during the latter half of 2016, which consisted of doing basically everything tech related in a small web dev shop, including front and backend development, software architecture/design, tech support, whatever.

Actually what I enjoyed the most was incident response and system administration. We had to manage some 5 LAMP websites belonging to our clients, and I was on call to fix bugs, outages, and perform sysadmin tasks. These sites were originally in shared hosting accounts, but I moved them to our own VPS. I have a little bit of experience with Ansible as I wrote a small playbook meant to deploy a NodeJS webapp to the VPS.

I've been experimenting with Linux since I was about 12, but I'm not a wizard whatsoever. I know more than most of my college peers, though. I want to know if there's a way I can show these things as relevant experience for DevOps job applications.

All job offers I've been getting simply ask for fullstack PHP and JS developers and that's just not what I want to do. I seriously want to work on SRE/DevOps. I've considered applying for internships, but this has its difficulties as 1. I'm in Latin America and would need Visa Sponsorship, 2. I'm just about to graduate and 3. I don't seem to find any remote internship options whatsoever.

Any tips or help? I would be deeply grateful.

5wmq3l,1,2017-02-28,Second Tier of Massage School Teacher Training Program on hold for 9+ months and school offered its students a 1/4 tuition refund &amp; absolved themselves from delivering the rest of the program.,calimyrna,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5wmq3l/second_tier_of_massage_school_teacher_training/,"Names have been changed for confidentiality. Thank you for reading any part of this and sorry that it’s long.

Traditionally my massage school’s teachers training program (TTP) is a 2 to 3-year-long unpaid teacher assisting (TA-ing) apprenticeship However, my massage school in the summer of 2015 replaced the old apprenticeship with a new and accelerated TTP in which the bulk of the training would be crammed into nine months as “Tier I”. Then selected students would be invited to Tier II &amp; III and “simultaneously” begin earning back their tuition at $10 an hour, teaching classes supervised. Once teacher trainees could teach solo he/she would begin earning $15/hour as an instructor. However, Tier I cost $1,350 and required nine months of weekly Tier I classes (~150 hours) and weekly (TA-ing) (~150 hours). The head instructor/TTP manager, Nathan explicitly told us that the newly implemented TTP tuition was “kitty money” for the paid supervised teaching position since previously the old TTP apprenticeship didn’t cost money, nor did it pay.

I did not like the high cost of money and time for little financial return and the unknown costs of Tier II and III, but I loved the school and wanted to teach there. So in 10/2015 I along with three fellow massage school alumni enrolled in Tier I of our massage school’s brand new TTP and we all graduated in 7/2016. However, also in 7/2016 our massage school was sold and our head instructor Nathan suddenly left in 10/2017. Moreover, TTP’s Tier II and the paid supervised teaching positions never started! Soon after Tier I ended the other three students stopped TA-ing, but I still continue to this day to TA in class almost every week.

Once Nathan left another massage instructor, Ellen took over the TTP. Ellen told my classmate around 10/2017 that the school decided not to select any of us for the paid teaching training positions, but only selected us to continue onto Tier II. All four of us were frustrated so in 12/2016 we wrote an email to the new owners of the school, asking for help in getting a full refund, and two of us even met with one of the owners in person. The new owners seemed sympathetic, but a few weeks later in 1/2017 we received an email stating there were some “slight discrepancies” in our version of the story vs Nathan’s and the previous school’s owner. Next in 2/2017 the old school owner offered to give us each ¼ of our TTP tuition back because “the program was delivered as intended but the path forward towards employment has changed due to the sale of the school.”  

None of us are happy with this offer. In 1/2017 I asked Ellen about starting Tier II, and she said that our email to the new school owners was an “inappropriate,” “entitled” “ultimatum” that falsely claimed that we were promised paid supervised teach positions in Tier II. Ellen does not feel we’re ready to teach supervised whereas we do. So now we’re working on a response email while Ellen may be trying to replace us by reaching out to at least one other alumnus (who told me about it) to sign up for another new costly TTP. Ellen may have been offended by email and may now want all four of us out of the TTP.

Since I first enrolled in 2008 at this massage school I have probably taken more than 700 hours of classes and TA-ed over a thousand hours at this school. In 1/2017 I asked the school about my continuing teacher training, and the school replied in 2/2017 that they are coming up with a new teacher training process going forward and will let me know more as it becomes clearer.  I’m in limbo. I am also tired and bored of TA-ing because as a TA I mostly just observe class and during classroom massage-table practice time, I walk around and massage students and answer student questions, and clean up afterwards. I know my massage school is probably broke, but I’m surprised how they aren’t interested in resolving these discrepancies, but am instead appear to be dissolving this TTP program entirely with a dismissive ¼ tuition refund offer. I want all of us (the students and the school) to talk together under the city’s free mediation services to resolve our differences and come to a more fair solution, but mediation may offend them more and I don’t want to ruin my chances of one day teaching at this school. What can I do to help the school agree to take more financial responsibility for the delay and possible end of our TTP program? After all, this school’s massage modality is proprietary and we can’t really use our training to teach it elsewhere. 


TL;DR I am one of four students who paid $1,350 tuition to do Tier I, the beginning of my massage school’s teacher training program (TTP). Then after Tier I, school was sold and the program director left so the TTP has been delaying the last two tiers of TTP and is withholding paid TTP internship positions. 6 months later after Tier I ended, the students complained to the school and 3 months after complaint, the new owners dissolved the entire TTP and only offer an unsatisfying ¼ tuition refund to each student."

The compensation is more-or-less the same(Twitter slightly less than Box).

From the description, the metadata team sounds more interesting, but only slightly. I haven't specialized yet, but my intended track is AI. 

In terms of housing and logistics, Box's HQ is close to school, so I'd be able to live here over the summer . For Twitter, I'd have to relocate to SF.

Twitter has a higher 'cool' factor than Box, but I'm not sure how the quality of the engineering teams compares, and I don't want to base my choice solely on which name is more 'known'. Also, I got into the Twitter Academy Sophomore Internship program, but I got the general Software Engineering internship role at Box (dunno if this is relevant to the discussion).

I was wondering how much companies really care about grades and your GPA. I'm normally a pretty average student (C's and B's) however I failed calc 2 and discrete math last year causing my GPA to fall to a 2.2. Relative to other students I am actually much better at programming and am constantly helping others however always manage to mess up on a test or some simple assignment that causes me to fall short of getting a good grade even in my computer classes(Hence why my highest grade is always a B). I want to apply for an internship or a summer research program however am unable to because most of what I see requires a GPA higher than a 3.0. This leads me to question whether or not in the future companies will continue to look down on me because of poor grades. My father who is PhD in CS claims this isn't a real issue but everyone else says otherwise. Like I said I really am a good programmer but my grades show otherwise. Even though I manage to get 100% on all programming projects and homework's I perform poorly on tests and normally end up with a B at the end of the semester.    
5wqy2r,1,2017-02-28,Is my plan of action to transition into cs viable?,ryebeard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5wqy2r/is_my_plan_of_action_to_transition_into_cs_viable/,"Hi everyone,

so for a while I've been trying to forge my path into computer science. I know a lot of people recommend getting a second degree in CS, but getting another degree is not really an option for me at this point. Since my first degree was obtained abroad, I'd have to take all the gen-ed courses for the second degree and it'd just take too long. Also I don't want to waste time studying for...what, US history 1 and 2?! I'm not paying hundreds of $$$ for those credits. 

I applied to the OSU post-bacc program and unfortunately was denied, which was disappointing because I have been taking math and cs courses to prepare for the program and my undergraduate GPA isn't that bad. I feel that the program is getting really competitive!

After being sad for a bit:(, I've managed to come up with an alternative course of action after days of research and pretty much reading every relevant thread on this subreddit:)

1. Build a foundation in CS by taking undergrad courses (the basics - discrete mathematics, algorithm, operating systems, etc.) as a non-degree seeking student at either UMUC or Thomas Edison State University. My family is military and moves a lot (will be in Germany for the rest of the year!) so they have to be online. I am giving myself a year to complete the courses. I picked these schools because they are affordable for military dependents ($250 per credit), and have accelerated schedules meaning shorter semesters like 8 weeks or 12 weeks. I can study full-time.

2. In 2018, Get an internship if I can, and apply to a master's program in cs, possibly Georgia Tech and others. For many masters programs an undergraduate degree in cs is not a must, but you do have to show that you are ready for the master-level courses. 

I am eager to get this going and done as soon as possible, but at the same time I want to do it right even if it takes some time. One thing that worries me though, is how the courses taken at UMUC or TESU are perceived. I've read conflicting reviews on these schools, but when I checked out the syllabi for some of the courses, they seem to be as rigorous and covers just as much material as the courses I took at a local brick and mortar university. 

What do you think??? 
I'd appreciate any advice or feedback on my plan. Also if you have any suggestions on schools that offer online cs courses, I'm all ears!

Thank you so much for reading:)



**TD;LR: Career change to CS. A 2nd degree isn't an option for now. Thinking of taking cs courses through online colleges like University of Maryland University College or Thomas Edison State University to prepare for graduate school. Worried about the course quality at these schools &amp; perception. Is this a good plan?**
