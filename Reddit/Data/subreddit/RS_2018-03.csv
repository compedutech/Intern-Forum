However, I really hope you are able to help me in this endeavor as many of you already have previously.  I was selected to interview for the 2018 Summer Internship Program in the Engineering department at the Port Authority of NJ &amp; NY.  My responsibilities during my internship are as follows.

-Assist with the Engineering Department’s Intranet (EOL) enhancement and maintenance efforts (new Intranet go-live in July)

-Produce  or update our video based application training material and other documentation (including Engineering Manuals)

-Assist with development of our SharePoint Team Sites and workflow based applications

-Assist Web Design with web applications development and integration efforts

-Assist software engineers with application maintenance and support – take part in our application support hotline

-Research and evaluate the latest Office 365 and SharePoint applications, tools and feature sets

I feel nervous although I already have previous internship and co-op experience with UPS where I worked for them for about a year and a half.  I also have technical skills already being in my final year in Information Systems &amp; Computer Science.

What tips and advice would you give someone for a company like this one?  I would greatly appreciate your help again my friends.  
Thank you."
811dej,1,2018-02-28,Deciding between internships: NASA and Fidelity Investments,cjcorb2010,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/811dej/deciding_between_internships_nasa_and_fidelity/,"I now have two separate offers for internships going into my college senior year as a comp sci major: one from Fidelity Investments in Durham, NC as a software engineering intern and one at Langley Research Center through NASA's OSSI program doing a project using big data techniques having to do with Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC). My main concerns about my decision, in order, are:

1. Quality of experience gained: which is better for my resume/help me get a job after I graduate or potentially a job through the company itself?

2. What I would be doing: Which falls in line with my career goals the most?

3. Pay

4. Location

The last two are not super important to me but are being taken into consideration. The details about each position that I'm weighing are the following:

Fidelity: Good pay (double what NASA is offering which is a bit surprising) and in a great location that is somewhat near my school and family and in an interesting area. However, I don't think I will be surrounded by the brightest people like I would be at Langley and I'm not super interested in application development (which is what I would probably be doing). This offer could be a good doorway to getting a good paying job with Fidelity or a just as good or a little bit less good position at some other company using my experience from Fidelity. Really though, the work I would be doing and putting Fidelity on my resume isn't super exciting, but still good nonetheless.

NASA (Langley): Not great pay at NASA but I'm still funded by my parents while I'm in school and the money right now is not super important to me. I've never been to Norfolk, but I know some people in Norfolk and Virginia beach that I could see while I'm there. At NASA, I know there would be so much to learn and experience and I would be surrounded by some of the smartest people in the world. I am also a comp sci major with a concentration in data science (so naturally, this position seems to be right down my alley even though I'm not doing anything with aerospace engineering, astronomy, etc.) However, I'm a bit wary of this position because I really don't know how competitive OSSI is and if its a very prestigious thing to put on your resume (I know NASA is a good thing to see on a resume but is the OSSI program itself something to fuss over?) I've also read that the only way to get a job at the end of the OSSI internship is through one of the contractors that an intern might work with. Otherwise, NASA cannot offer you a position from the OSSI internship. While this may be true, simply having ""NASA"" on my resume might open many doors even if I don't get a job at the end of the internship.

Right now, I'm leaning towards NASA because, well, its NASA...

Any thoughts?

The way the program works is that my school has made partnerships with tech companies where the school first picks who’s accepted into the program and the next step is a speed interview session with all the partner companies. After the speed interview, companies pick who they want and arrange everything with the school to get the student started. Essentially, the school acts as the middleman here. 

It would be really and appreciated if any folks can tell me their experience with speed interviews, what are some talking points to focus on, what are details to avoid discussing. I have a tendency to talk a lot (I just really enjoy having conversations lol) so I want to be mindful and prepared beforehand that way I can make the best of this and hopefully land an internship this summer.

812o6a,0,2018-02-28,Changing majors and havent been going to class,Lowkey_HatingThis,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/812o6a/changing_majors_and_havent_been_going_to_class/,"Okay so this might be a long one, so let me start.

Im currently a student at RIT, in the physics major curriculum. I chose physics as far back as 8th grade, through a combination of reading ""a brief history of space and time"" and religiously watching ""through the worm hole "" I really really was interested in astrophysics. This interest wained over time, and eventually when my high school counselors said ""so are you still interested in astrophysics"" I'd just say yes to get done with the meeting. When I got to high school physics, I hated it. It was boring, uninteresting, and all around just awful. This should have been a warning, but I just thought ""oh this is basic stuff I'll get done with in a year and go to what I really want to do"".

Fast forward to this semester and I'm failing UP 1. I don't go to the class, I hate everything about it. I hate the topics, I hate the people, I hate the atmosphere of the classroom, I hate physics. The other math and science classes (such as chem and calc) I deal with and get and can enjoy sometimes, but physics I just can't stand. I haven't gone to a class in 3 weeks. My academic advisor told me to give career services a call, which I will tomorrow. I'm seriously considering changing majors.

The problem? There are three

1.) I have no idea what I want to do in life. I want to enjoy my career to the point where I never want to retire, but I also want to make decent money (nothing extravagant like a million dollars or something, I don't want to be wickedly rich, if I can get 6 figures, I'd be happy). I cannot think of anything, I've never really had a passion for anything. I was fairly smart in school and really had a passion for learning new things. I was good at the sciences and maths, but I really think I excelled I'm history, it was very enjoyable to me and I was able to pass the APUSH test with a 5 without really studying (I'm not bragging, I did awful on the Calc and Chem AP test, and got a 4 on the English).

2. I don't want to leave my school. I love the area, I'm starting to make friends, I have really nice scholarships and grants, and I am considering rushing a fraternity next year. I commute so the price also reduces from their, and this leads me into my third point

3. Emotionally abusive father. My father, to anyone looking at what he's done for me, would call him a saint. He's paid for my two semesters of college (about $18k so far) and is letting me live with him rent free. He's a very seasoned project manager so he makes about $110k a year, so it's not crippling him financially, but I was raised by my mom and we were dirt poor my early life so that amount of money boggles me and I appreciate it dearly. The downside? He treats me like he's a loan shark rather than a father, and he is an extreme alcoholic of 30 years, destroying his mental state. A typical day, hes drunk by 4 pm to the point where he can barely stand and he shouts everything he says. If I forgot to do something (put dishes in dishwasher, put clothes away, etc) he shouts at me, saying I'm a fuck up or even calling me the n- word (I am 100% white). Whenever i say something to him while he's drunk, he immeadiatly forgets, and when he has to tell me something, he forgets he told me and tells me again 10 minutes later, by 8 pm he's asked me the same question about 6 times, getting angrier each time he ask. He accuses me of lying and being lazy, he accused me of taking his pain meds one time, and I thought he was going to hit me because I swore I didn't take them (I literally said ""I've never taken your pills, why would I take your fucking pain meds""). He's 50 and I honestly think he's showing signs of early dimentia I'm 18 close to 19, an adult who works and goes to college, and it's all very demeaning. If I bring up anything about college (say he asks me about a class, and I say ""it's difficult, I think I'm having problems with it"") he will over exageratingly slam his head into his hands, shake his head back and forth, and Huff very loudly, like I'm 5 years old. He will them ask ""you have any idea how much fucking money I'm spending on this? You better"" and then brings up how I better have a paid internship by my third year because he isn't helping past that point. His attitude and abuse stresses me out to the point where I lie about how I'm doing, and will stay on campus or in my room to avoid him. I can't live on campus (don't have the money, especially if he doesn't pay). I came close to vomiting the other day when I saw my failing grade because I worried what he would say (got all A's last semester except for one D in another physics class and he was very mad, saying I was wasting money). If I change majors, especially to something he might not like, not only would I possibly lose his financial support, but a place to live, a mode of transportation (he let's me drive his car, but I pay for the gas and upkeep) and I might be forced to go to a smaller college back home, which would honestly make me just not want to go to college. 

Adding to this, when I was 10 my mom met my future step dad. He and my father are alike in many ways, he would provide me with cash and things like a good parent would if I earned it or was good. However, he was very emotionally abusive, leading to a weird relationship between us 8 years later. A day would not go by where we wouldn't argue, he would always been my ass about something, and never would geniuenly just talk to me. It got better as I got older, but it's really left me with no real male figure I've been able to look up to in my life. Everyone we've ever been around would say ""he treats that kid like shit"" and even my mother acknowledge that she feels sick to her stomach for letting him treat me the way he did. This leads me to believe I'm not being over dramatic about my biological father 


This whole thing is stressing me out, I hate my major and feel trapped. I don't know what I want to do, and I feel like the only person who would really support me is my mother, but she's not financially well off right now and can only provide moral support. Please help

I'm still a new CS major, who has no experience outside of coursework. Of course, I plan on learning more languages and practicing the ones I already know, but I am approaching my third year undergrad and I have only been learning/coding for about year (just finished up data structures and algorithms). How much are you expected to know? I know they won't hold your hand, but do they expect me to be a programming prodigy?"
8138ac,66,2018-03-01,What am I doing wrong?,100891090187473819,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8138ac/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,"Don't worry, there's going to be a resume attached to this post.

I've been a follower of this sub for a couple of years now because I found it rather early on in my academic career and I'm thankful for it. It gave me the opportunity to take a peek into what companies look for, review my resume, and overall improve as a student and a future developer.

I've seen many posts on this sub regarding students/devs not being able to land interview, jobs, internships, etc. Usually it's a resume issue, interview skills, no projects, etc.

I've done my best to learn from these people's mistakes and work towards being successful. I set various goals along the way. I thought I could use the advice given to these people ahead of time so I can avoid that issue altogether.

I wanted to land at least one internship before I graduate (May 2019, currently a junior) but it seems like that's not going to happen, agajn. (I've tried every year I've been in school as well).

I've networked, done projects, career fairs, thrown my resume into the weekly threads quite a few times in the past year, and more . I've tried to make connections in LinkedIn, talked to professors for opportunities and any family/friends I have. It all seems pointless.

I applied everywhere. I've applied at least 250+ places since August. I had only one interview with a local insurance company that I thought the interview went well with. They said they really liked me, gave me a tour of the place and even introduced me to the main people there including the ceo. Maybe I misread the situation but I genuinely thought I'd land that internship but they went ahead with someone else.

A little discouraging because it was my first interview but shit happens right? It's all part of the grind, so I applied on.

I've gone to the career center at my school several times to have my resume reviewed and they've marked it perfect. (I thank this sub for that).

I've used the connections that the school has for employers but it always ends up with a immediate rejection or ghosting. 

It's been several months like this. In that time, I've improved my skills, added new ones, and even had a significant large group project that I am group manager of. If that even means shit to companies. 

I've grinded leetcode, firecode, etc, picked up CTCI as well. I'm doing all these things, yet it just doesn't seem to matter. I've even worked very hard to keep a high GPA, 3.7.

What am I doing wrong? I've made such an effort to stand out compared to my peers. 90% of them didn't even know what github is and only had Java as a skill slapped on their resume. I've spent so many countless hours picking up extra skills that my school doesn't teach so I could be a better developer and stand out. People say do projects regarding your interests so I did. Is that the problem? Maybe companies don't like my projects since it's not aligned to their interests? Can someone just tell me what to make then? So at least i know I'm not screwing that part up.


A friend and I applied to a place. Her resume did not have anything tangible on it. Just fast food experience, work study at school and a skills section with Java and couple of other languages. She slapped it together in 20 minutes.
I had a lot more compared to hers. Yet, I couldn't even get a rejection of any sort. She gets an interview the very next day and then is offered a 6 month coop. I'm so proud and happy for her but what the fuck.

I'm at my limit. I feel I've wasted my time. I could've just gone out and got wasted with friends this whole time and be in the same situation, at least I would've had fun. I feel like giving up.

This turned out longer than I planned, sorry. Here's my [resume](redacted). I thought I had refined it really well and thought it was good but it's probably shit and I just can't see it.

Anyways, I'm just going to keep applying and grinding it out. Feel free to roast me or give advice. Thank you."

I received (and signed) two summer offers from two major companies; a tech consulting internship with one of the big 4 and a information security analyst internship with a major credit card company(I.e MasterCard, American Express, etc.) 

Initially I signed the credit card company offer as I wasn’t given much time to decide and hadn’t heard back in time from the big 4 firm, even though I was positive I would get the job. Ended up getting the offer from the big 4 company. I was very set on tech consulting as my dream career was to travel, help clients/businesses with technology, and learn as much as I can within a short amount of time.

I was going to renege my offer with the credit card company but I am slowly realizing that their offer is significantly better and longer. The credit card company’s offer is 12 weeks, furnished apartment, and more benefits, but with a few dollars less an hour. 
The big 4 firm on the other hand, is a very short internship, think &gt;8 weeks, but slightly more pay. What is stressing me out the most is housing for the big 4 internship. The period of time is so short and the home office I am assigned is in an extremely expensive area. I am stressing out over finding a suitable place without shelling out thousands. I would be losing thousands and thousands of dollars in earnings compared to the credit card company.  I also feel like the time period is not sufficient to integrate and learn from the company and my team. This is my fourth internship and I’ve never done one shorter than 3 months. 

I have about a year before I graduate so this summer is my last to really intern. Both companies offer high full time offer rates. I’m not very excited about the credit card company but I’m so frustrated with the big 4 firm’s handling of housing and “leaving interns in the dust” that it seems less and less desirable for me to work for them. I realize I shouldn’t have signed two offers... but I need to renege one and I keep going back and forth. Should I suck up losing thousands in earnings, one month less of experience, being in uncomfortable/difficult housing, and having an okay intern program in order to greatly increase, almost guarantee, my chances at my dream job? Or burn bridges, earn more money, gain more experience, have secure housing at a job that I’m intrigued by but not as excited about compared to consulting? I’m thinking long term and I really want to travel a lot in my career... 

Thanks in advance! 

PS: both companies look about the same on my resume and offer the same rates of full time offers given to interns. 

TLDR; signed two offers, one for tech consulting at big four, other for InfoSec analyst at credit card company, Having issued with big 4 internship so need to decide which one to choose for best career choice. "

I am planning to move to Canada or Germany in further my studies in Master degree in chemical engineering. I heard the European countries have good master programs for internationals and hope I have family there someday. I am hoping that completing my masters degree will guaranty a job for me in Canda or Germany. I am willing to do whatever it takes for me to land a job there (such as learning the language). I am learning some programming skills at the moment and I am also willing to learn the language of the country that I will be settling in.


Info about me:

* Age: I am a 22 year old

* Citizenships/Status:I am from Nigeria but I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I didn't get the privilege to obtain a Saudi nationality nor permanent residency. So I pretty much had to leave the country since I was not welcomed in a place I was born in.

* Education: I just got my degree in chemical engineering just last year at a private university in Asia. I was not able to find any jobs there since I was foreigner. The companies there prefer recruiting the locals instead of internationals. In addition, once you graduate for the university, you are required to leave the country within two weeks which leaves no time search for all jobs there.

* Language Skills: Native in English and Intermediate in Arabic. 

* Work experience: 8 mouths of internship in a job unrelated to my degree.

* Criminal History: None

* Temporary or Permanent: Permanent. I would like to have a second home in Canada or Germany to provide opportunities for my family or friends.

* Spouses/Dependants: None

* Financial Situation: Good for the tuition. I plan on getting a part time job during my study.

I'm mostly interested in studying in Germany as heard that the country have very good standards. However I am very open to any other countries and universities in countries such as Denmark or the Netherlands to pursue a Masters.

I have some few questions:

1) Are there any great scholarship resources that may be useful for an international student?

2) Are foreigners able to land a job in EU with masters degree easily? 

3) Will I be treated differently since I am black?

Thank you so much for reading. Suggestions and recommendations are greatly appreciated!"
815wbo,1,2018-03-01,Advice for landing the entry level position?,whooshpotatoes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/815wbo/advice_for_landing_the_entry_level_position/,"I graduated six months ago with a bachelor’s in computer science, and have been applying for my first career opportunity ever since then, but so far I’ve had no luck with the job search. The major obstacle I’ve encountered is that every company I’ve applied to has advertised that they are looking for at least 2-3 years of professional experience up front - for an entry level role! I worked full time to support myself all through my undergrad, and never had the luxury to leave my position to pursue internship opportunities without risking losing my job and settling for something that paid significantly less than I was already making after the internship is over. Even the most promising job opportunity I had with a software company ended with me being told that I just didn’t have enough experience to be an entry level developer with their company, but they told me they would place me back in a selection pool to be considered for what amounts to a relatively well-paid internship. 

As far as job search strategies, I’ve been applying for job postings on all the usual job boards (Monster, CareerBuilder, ZipRecruiter, Dice, etc.). Many of these job postings are for third party recruiters, and I’ve been in touch with them as well. I’ve been applying directly to some of the major companies with large software engineering departments in the area, as well as with a few tech startups, and I do apply to those jobs advertising 2-3 years of experience in the hopes that they’re just trying to filter out completely unqualified applicants. I include cover letters and my resume with applications as well. I’ve had plenty of phone interviews, but rarely ever hear back, even after following up with the interviewer, and when I do, it’s to be informed that they decided to pursue other candidates. 

I’ve started attending software developer meet ups as well. They usually have a part where you can speak up if you’re currently looking for opportunities, and I only ever get approached by third party recruiters and staffing agencies afterwaed, which as usual does not result in an actual opportunity. 

EDIT: I do see networking as one of my major shortcomings, and I feel like that’s due to some social anxiety issues I have. I don’t see that magically getting better overnight, but I have been trying to put myself out there by going to tech meet ups and stuff. I have only one real connection within the software industry, and for various reasons I don’t see this person as a viable means to connect me to an interview, but I do plan on asking this person some of the same questions I’m asking on here. (End edit)

I live in a decent sized city with a strong tech community, but I don’t understand why I seem to have hit a wall when it comes to the job search. So, my questions to you guys are:

1. Interviews have been few and far between. What specific steps can I take to step up my game and improve my chances of landing an interview beyond continuing to work on projects on my Github page?

2. Recruiters always seem to quote $55,000 as a reasonable starting salary. If I had an offer for a contract through a recruiter, would this be a lowball offer? Or is this standard for an entry level developer? I’ve found conflicting information on this. 

3. Are there any specific risks or complications associated with going through a staffing agency or consulting firm, or contract to hire positions in general? That is, beyond the possibility of not being hired on full time after a contract ends?

4. Some sources recommend filing as a “Doing Business As” entity, basically becoming your own employer as a software developer. Has anyone had success with this? Is this a viable option for a newly minted developer with no professional background? How would I go about finding work with this approach?

5. Other stuff - if you have any other general advice or feedback, I would greatly appreciate it!

I decided to apply for internships that barely asked for more than what I knew, and I got rejected from all of em.

Personally, I'm keen on doing my own projects, aka I'd like to get started on building my own apps. Should I do that (if it would help my prospects of landing just about ANY internship) and if I should, how do I go about with that? Because I have absolutely no idea on how to even get started.

Bottom line, while no one who rejected me told me what was missing from my resume, it was pretty clear that it was my severe lack of experience. Apart from the app thing, what else can I do about that? (For what it's worth, I'm also interested in cybersecurity and I plan to take more online courses on it this summer but have no idea what else to do apart from that as well)."

This is just a friendly reminder that as a freshman engineering student, the most important thing you can do for your career is get intimately involved with as many professional chapters as possible. Your college probably has an Engineers Without Borders chapter, an Amercian Society of Civil/Mechanical/Electrical Engineers chapter (or your national equivalent, whatever that may be), Society of Women Engineers, National Society of Black Engineers... the list goes on and on. If you haven't joined them yet, drop everything you're doing and join them all.

You know how you get a good internship early in your degree? You stockpile professional organization experiences: volunteer opportunities, seminars, training events... get used to the idea of putting aside some gaming/partying/hang-out time every week to mark some events on your calendar *and go.* Save their web pages to the front page of your phone. Check them once a day.

It's the gift that keeps giving and giving and giving. You'll form study groups and business connections. You'll learn about what you love and what you hate about your field. You will make friends with the people you go to class with and will never be left not knowing who to ask for help with homework.

If you're a shy person, I get it. The mere prospect of sitting in a group of strangers can be suffocating. But guess what, this is what getting a job in your field looks like: networking events and networking events and networking events. Take the opportunity to practice now when the stakes are low.

Brought to you by: a senior student who wasted my freshman and sophomore years. Don't be stuck as a Junior with your first internship organizing files for a public school district. Don't be stuck heading into senior design with no idea what you're passionate about. Your professional life starts now."

I will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's Degree in Computers and Information Technology. Now, here's what I'm needing help with to negotiate pay for possibly transitioning into a full time employee/contractor. Now take note, my company rarely hires IT staff as full time employees. 90% are contractors. I am okay with this for a little bit granted I am compensated well.

-I'm not your typical intern. I am heavily relied on for our home office working 45-50 hour weeks. I am currently responsible for over 800 employees by myself very rarely getting help. That's an 800 to 1 ratio when the normal is 75 to 1 from what I've researched. I am constantly swamped. There are two other guys in here, but they are mainly responsible for our remote office tickets.

-Current market value for a Tier 2 Desktop Support Technician is $49,000 according to glassdoor.com. I am making $14 an hour and made $31,000 last year (started at $12 sophomore year going up a $1 every year).

-I took a sick day two weeks ago for an interview and was offered a $50,000 salary based job with unlimited time off (as long as it's not abused) and an excellent benefits package.

I do enjoy this job a lot and I love the people I work with as well as the work environment, but if I'm taking on this big of a role, I want to be compensated fairly. What should I expect to be making hourly or salary wise when I go to talk to my manager here in the next week? Any tips for negotiating higher wages are appreciated as well."

However, nothing has worked out so far and I'm left with options that are no better than what I had last year. I'm really confused about what to do next. Is it too late to get a research intern or a lab position somewhere for this summer now? Especially international ones? What would you recommend, seeing that grad school and not a CS job right out of college is my main goal. I feel like all the effort I've put into my grades and projects mean nothing, at this point of time.

I've been really interested in getting into the cyber security industry and have taken steps to start towards getting into the field. Currently getting my AA (Cybersecurity) at a local technical school and my BBA (Finance) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (getting both at the same time). Hopefully if everything goes right I should be done by the first quarter of 2020.

Though cybersecurity field has a multitude of unfilled positions available I am still concerned with not being able to find a job upon completion of my degree. I think my biggest challenge is having real experience. Hopefully I'll be able to land an internship soon but in the meantime, are there any companies/positions that I should look into to work in while I am in school to get relevant industry experience?

This is only my first semester taking cybersecurity courses and I really like it and based on my professors' feedback it seems that I am fairly good at it. Are there any programming languages that I should learn by myself in my free time (I basically have little to no IT knowledge besides the basic workings of using an everyday computer).

Also forgot to mention, I currently work full time as a ""Computer Repair Technician"" but realistically I'm a glorified label maker and mouse clicker. Only get paid minimum wage so if I can find a position even remotely relevant to cyber security that I can work at while completing my degree that would be great."

We can only log our gym activity once per day, and we will get a point for each member who goes for 30mins on a day. 

This is completely voluntary, so the people on my team signed up to be on a team for this and I guess in a way be encouraged.

Tomorrow i was going to make a post in our chat channel and put up a poll. The score restarts every Friday and my team is the worst, but I was thinking about trying to encourage people to go.

There are 4 teams and the team that gets the most points for that week get a winning point for that week.

I would like to say this:

""Hey guys! Lets make a team goal of having everyone go at least once next week. Lets start thinking about when the best time for us to go will be this week!""

Then I will insert a poll that will have the days of the week listed where everyone can vote anonymously when they will go.

I asked my bf his and he said it was intrusive. What are your thoughts? How can I make this better?

The goal of this is to do two things. I believe getting people to plan at least one day of the week to go to them gym will encourage them to go. Additionally, people will know they will be counted on so it does add a little bit of pressure (but thats the point the main goal is to get them to start planning).

However they don't even know me because I show up once a week because I am an intern, but they all signed up for this work competition, so I don't feel so bad or intrusive but I don't want to take it to far either.

What are you suggestions?

I'm a 2nd year student at a top 30 university (most prestigious in my country if that matters) who had very little luck this year looking for internships.

I study economics and marketing, so I mostly applied to various business/finance/HR/marketing/analytics positions. I have a 3.65/4.0 CGPA, &amp; previous entrepreneurship experience running a small business. I have a few extra-curriculars at school here but nothing with a lot of responsibility. I worked pretty average jobs in high school so I don't have much relevant experience, but that's what an internship is for, right?

I applied to a lot of different companies through my university career website. Mostly, I haven't heard back from them. A few rejected me. I advanced with a few of them as well. The furthest I got was for a business analyst role. I travelled to do 2 case interviews and a behavioural, only to be rejected because I made one math mistake on one of the cases due to poor understanding of what I was being asked. Apparently I did extremely well on the other two interviews, but it wasn't sufficient.

After this rejection, I felt pretty inadequate. I felt pretty frustrated because I felt I spent so long applying to these places and positioning myself to get an internship but nobody would take a chance on me.

I understand it's more uncommon to acquire an internship in your 2nd year of study, so I want to really try and make a change in myself to get a good chance at getting one next year.

My plans for next year include:

— Increasing my GPA to 3.7

— Learning Python (I already know the basics of Java)

— Writing for a publication about economics articles (just starting this now)

— Running for a position on the economics students association

Other than these things, what else could I work on to try and get an internship? I know I can always improve but I felt I had a good shot this year at acquiring an internship, but ended up coming up short.

Thanks for any replies in advance."

I was in the interview process at a division of a large company for the last month or so. In the middle of the interview process (2 weeks ago), I told them that I had a deadline (this friday, March 2nd), and that I would need a decision by then. The recruiter called me this Monday Feb 26 to give me the verbal offer, as well as offer details, and told me I would have the offer letter in my inbox by Tuesday noon. I did not accept on the spot even though it was my top choice as they wanted the internship to start a whole month after I finish school, and I wanted to see if I could move that start date, which I didn't think was going to be a big deal. I turned down my other offers the same day (big mistake). For the next few days, the recruiter kept in touch and told me the offer letter is being finalized and just to stay put and be patient as they get everything together and look into moving the start date early. I didn't think anything of it.

At the end of the day today (Thursday night, March 1st), the recruiter called me and told me my graduating year is a problem, and they might have to rescind the offer as they wanted the intern program to be for people who graduate in 2019, whereas I'm graduating 2020 and they hadn't realized this. My graduating year is clearly stated on my resume, though I go to Waterloo, so I'm in 3rd year right now even though I graduate 2020 because of the co-op program, which may be where the confusion lies.

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. I still want to work at the company and I don't know if it's too late to contact the companies I turned down or if I should since I'm now in such an awkward position. The recruiter says my situation is going to leadership review and he doesn't know when they will come to a decision, it can be tomorrow or a week from now. Though, from what I can gather, he seems to think that it's likely that my offer will be rescinded.

I'm incredibly frustrated right now and some advice would be great."

I've been a clinical research coordinator for about 3.5 years now, creating and running various studies at a research hospital.  I'm considering working toward a switch to CS, possibly in a way that can also leverage my current work experience (though not sure how that might work).  I have a bit of a background in programming from an internship I did, so I know I enjoy it.

In brief, since I'm working full-time, I'm looking at part-time online acquisition of a second degree in CS (first was a BS in Psychology), currently at University of Maryland University College, which should take around 2-3 years.  

I'm hoping to get a lot more career, time, and location flexibility out of the switch, as well as a bigger paycheck, two things I'm not so sure I can get trying to move up where I am now.  I'm not looking to get rich, but I'd like to be able to live comfortably solo and travel.

So, I suppose my initial questions boil down to:
1. Does my choice of either the specific school above, or that I'm getting the degree online part-time going to affect my job prospects?
2. What else will I need to do to make myself a viable candidate for an entry-level position upon getting my CS degree?  I've heard from people that the degree is enough, and from others that extracurricular projects are necessary (curious about this especially for time management, since I'll be continuing to work full time).
3. Anything else I might not have considered?

Really, I just want to make sure this could be as good a time and money investment as it appears it could be for a long-term career.

Now I'm trying to stay down to earth, I've read that it is very difficult to be accepted for Australia, especially Sydney and Melbourne because everyone wants to go there. I would like to have some feedback from people who went, what minimum GPA would be required (approximately, I know it might change every year depending on how popular the destinations are), do they ask more than a good GPA like a letter of intent, and how much weight does that have in their decision making? Do you know approximately how many people are accepted every year/term?

Also, has anyone been to Australia for an internship with Co-op? I figured maybe it could be another option if I don't get the whole study-abroad-for-a-year experience?

I would also ask how hard it is to maintain an awesome GPA in Computer Science but I know its a silly question (depends a lot on your motivation, the professors and also just your learning capabilities), but maybe you could still give me some good insights? :)

81ei7s,14,2018-03-02,How to keep your positivity during a long job search?,cuddlepot,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/81ei7s/how_to_keep_your_positivity_during_a_long_job/,"In the near 6 months since myself, and other colleagues, were let go I have not been able to land a new position. I've had 23 interviews since October, and 2 instances where I had 4 rounds of interviews for a job - only to not get any offer.

I've been told that i'm ""too qualified"", after being told that I was a perfect fit; that my experience didn't align (and later found out a former intern and recent college grad was hired) and ghosted by many. My salary ask isnt unreasonable for my skills/experience/city - it's just that my industry is oversaturated with less experienced candidates who will work for significantly less.

I'm struggling to stay positive and am determined to find a job. Had a second interview this week (they want me to come in for a third) and another second round next week. I've restructured my resume, played the linkedin game, and have applied for any and everything I am capable of doing. I am putting myself out there - there's just a small pool of available positions that will pay a decent salary.

How do you keep your momentum and stay positive during a grueling job hunt?"

I have applied to countless companies, gotten a few hirevues and on-campus interviews, but non of them have moved on. I was just emailed today that I am still being considered for an internship for the summer at Under Armour where the process is on a rolling basis. They are asking me to update my information and let them know if I have a deadline. However, I might be offered a co-op position at a well known defense contractor for Quality Analyst near my University and requires me to work the summer if I do begin during the Spring semester (I would not want to renege since I would like to continue or re-join the co-op in the future). The co-op job pays well but I don't think I would enjoy the position. I also don't want to be left with no cs-related employment for the summer. I still am actively applying for other summer internships and I'm open to taking a fall or spring semester off of school to pursue an internship.

I would appreciate and thoughts and opinions on the situation!

EDIT:I'm sorry, I'm essentially describing a hypothetical situation where if I do get offered a QA position, should I take it?"

Now, I have another completely different project. I am hiring 1 or 2 full-time student interns in computer science to implement this project, who unfortunately don't have any experience in web development. I will supervise and help them.

The project is to implement a website from scratch. The requirements are

* The website will be first heavily used in **desktop**, and it contains mainly a **dashboard** for users, who are organisation administrators.

* The website needs to be able to be viewed and used in **mobile browsers**. So more it is responsive, better it is.

* One day it is possible that we want to turn the website into **mobile apps** (ie, iOS and Android), I want this conversion to not be very hard. The performance for mobile apps will be not very important (the tasks are not heavy), while I mainly care about the existing and UI/UX of mobile apps: more quickly we could publish the mobile apps, better it is; more beautiful the mobile apps are, better it is. In the worst case, later, we will still have time to develop ""native"" mobile apps.

So, I am thinking about which ready-to-use software/framework/solution to use to build this website from front-end to backend. In any case, the student interns need to learn everything from scratch; I am ready to learn too as long as we choose the right technologies and direction.

In this context, to achieve what I want, could anyone recommend any ready-to-use software/framework/solution among for example Bootstrap, Materialize, AngularJS 1.x, Angular 5, React, Ionic, GoNative, etc.?"

I absolutely cannot fathom the idea of reading tax legislation or thinking about tax ever again. I don't want to invest myself into an accounting career because I will always feel pressure to get a CPA license especially if I want to see more than 60k in this lifetime. I could apply for other non accounting positions but feel I am not a fit for business roles. My accounting degree is really only marketable for business type jobs.

I was thinking after graduating to get an A.A.S degree in Computer Information Systems from Middlesex County College. I feel like more of a fit in a purely technical position. The A.A.S degree is apparently designed to put you in the workforce fast and train you in real skills.

Advice is much appreciated. Thanks"

It's almost laughable to me when companies put word as a requirement because 99.99% of millennials have been using word since middle school and most other word processors' UIs use the same layout and icons as Word.

I currently have two offers for the summer. One is from a Fortune 40 company in their office in research park in Champaign. The other is from a non-Fortune 500 company in Chicago, but still a big and well-known company up there. The Chicago internship pays 1.5x the amount that the Champaign one pays.

Summer of 2019, I no doubt want to spend my summer in Chicago (that's where I want to have a career after school), but this summer I am biased towards staying in Champaign due to friends, girlfriend, not living with my parents, etc.

What I want to know is, is turning down the Chicago internship going to be something I regret a lot? Will it hinder my ability to find an internship in Chicago next summer? Or are both internships going to sorta give me the same kind of opportunities for the future?

""...one that will assess your ability to manage numerical data and another one that will require you to make decisions on a wide variety of simulated scenarios""

The latter portion is what scares me. I have given 5 such online tests during my Bachelors and I failed miserably because I did badly in the online section where you are supposed to give appropriate answers to a variety of simulated scenarios. The questions have a format like this ""Your colleague wants you to take the lead on this and this project but your specialty is in something else. So, what do you do in this situation."" and other questions like this. Is there any online platform where I can practice questions like this because almost everytime answering them feels like a hit and miss and I get disqualified even before getting a chance for an interview.

Also, my background is engineering. So, such situational awareness questions seem almost alien to me. However, I am willing to improve and learn myself if anybody here can point me in the right direction."

I struggled - admin work makes a large part of what I do and I didn’t realize until now how much I hate it and how bad I am at it. Nevertheless, I struggled but I managed to do a good job, take on additional projects which I was actually interested in. I was challenged. 

Then people quit. The systems changed. The work doubled somehow. Suddenly, the overtime I happily volunteered wasn’t enough. Yes this was brought up in meetings.  Not much was done about it. I was given more work and I didn’t even have the time to finish the work I had but there simply was no one else to do it. I went home crying every night, stressed, unable to sleep. I couldn’t stop complaining about a job I used to enjoy. 

 A few months ago, something inside me snapped and I just couldn’t do it anymore. Literally couldn’t. Before I could easily focus for hours, now a task that would take me half an hour takes me sometimes the whole day. I can’t, I get distracted, lose focus, sometimes catch myself just staring at the screen... everything is overwhelming and my work performance has slipped so much, I realized I made a major mistake recently which would be fireable I’m sure except I quit recently with a long notice period

My god though. Every day is torture. I hope to find another job soon but I fear I’ve ruined things for myself, that I’m a failure and I’ll alwaus fail and that I’m just too lazy to work, other people seem to manage it... I physically cannot and I feel so tired and exhausted and don’t know who to talk to about this since most of my friends are recent grads who aren’t employed yet... 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Does your career ever recover? I will do something totally different after this I’m sure but this is still work experience and I still failed at the end, not sure if the good things I did at the beginning will count for much... I hate it and I’m so disappointed in myself and my inability to get on with it "

I'd like to believe that I'm a good student, but everyone around me in CS just seems to be so much more on top of being a good student. I dreamed of going to UofT about 2-3 years ago, and after consistent hard work for these past years, now that I've finally made it, I can't help but feel that it was a fluke.

Does anyone else feel the same way?

I've made a couple games on Unity, and want to get into the game industry, so I was looking for a few game programming related internships, but, around me, they are seemingly non-existent. I also know a bit of Java from my classes, but when I search for regular programming internships, I find either front end, which, I think is only web development languages, and back end which need a lot of data structures knowledge from what I've read, and I won't be taking my data structures class for another semester or two. What kind of internship should I be looking for that has a focus on Java? I know each company will be looking for something different, but does Java fall under a kind of category, or should I focus on also picking up HTML/CSS/JavaScript?"

Little bit about me; i'm 20, a junior CS major at a small liberal arts school. 

I was diagnosed with cancer (stage 2 grey zone lymphoma) back in October 9 2017. Had to drop some classes (balanced finishing 3 chemo cycles/ going to class), but finished the fall semester (had a semester GPA of a 4.0, current cumulative is 3.67) with 3 As in my Computer Science classes (9 hours)/Pass in PE (1 hour). 

I took this semester off to finish off chemo (finished my last cycle last week and I have been in the hospital for the past 6 days with a nasty infection since chemo left my immune system in piss poor shape). BUT I GET OUT TOMORROW AND IM FINALLY FUCKING FREE AND READY TO START BEING NORMAL. During these past two months, I strengthened my Linkedin hella hard, started a youtube channel/writing articles to help myself/others study for tech interviews, started freelancing on upwork, reading books, basically anything to keep my mind busy. Call me weird, but I love doing work when I am sick, it makes the time go by so much faster (its insane to think its been almost five months). 

I already have a internship this summer in Boston (secured it before I got diagnosed/during my first cycle), but if employers ever ask me why it took me an extra semester to finish my schooling (i'm applying to Fall- Co-ops right now, but when I graduate in 2020), what would you say? I have never used my illness as a excuse for anything (I mean why would you want to), maybe a couple of free discounts but who wouldn't  I'm a broke college kid :) .

--

Anyways, so I'm a junior right now, half way through my spring semester and I haven't had any internships yet. I'm on track credit-wise to graduate next spring, but I ***need*** an internship in order actually graduate.

--

My school isn't really known for its CS/SE department. I feel like most of the things I've learned in college so far, I've learned on my own on time outside of class (aside from data structures and algorithms) and this makes me extremely nervous now that I'm looking for internships because I feel like I'm completely unqualified for anything. I have a 3.1 GPA and I've done some basic personal projects but nothing remotely close to anything I'd want to show to a potential employer.

--

To give you a better idea of my school's curriculum and some of what I know/learned, some of my coursework so far includes:

--

Course | Description
---|---
Intro to CS I &amp; II | Entry level courses, Taught basic java and OOP principles. I knew pretty much everything these courses taught from my high school AP class.
Discrete Math | Pretty much a standard discrete math course
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms | Learned about various data structures, how to implement them in java, and also some basic sorting algorithms among others
Advanced Obj Oriented Programming |  Used C++ to build a weather station app that was expanded throughout the semester. By the end, the app supported multiple weather stations, each having independent data storage, and internationalization. (I considered putting this project on my resumé)
Scripting Languages | This was an elective but we learned how to use Python, Ruby, and Perl to do various tasks like web scraping and things like that.
System Administration | This is another elective that I really only took it because I needed a course and the original one I wanted to take was full. But I learned how to create and manage a linux system using virtual machines. We used some bash scripting for things like user account creation and I also learned more about how UNIX systems are set up.

--

So those are some of the classes I've taken at this point. 

--

I think what I'm worried about is that my coursework hasn't actually prepared me for any internships that I can find and I have no real projects to show any potential internships. And now I have the stress of running out of time to find an internship that I need to have done in order to graduate. Which I guess is actually my own fault for not being proactive and getting an internship sooner.

--

I guess ultimately my question is: Am I crazy for feeling unprepared for internships or is it normal to feel this way? Because the stress of needing an internship to graduate has really been adding up recently, and then combined with the fact that I feel completely unqualified whenever I read an ad for an internship. I feel like I'm completely losing my mind over this.

--

Thanks for any help and advice. And again sorry for adding yet another internship question and a huge wall of text. 

--

TL;DR:  Am I crazy for feeling unprepared for internships as a Junior or is it normal to feel this way?

81ovlw,2177,2018-03-03,My friends and I tried shooting a found-footage horror movie,Mr_Outlaw_,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/81ovlw/my_friends_and_i_tried_shooting_a_foundfootage/,"When I say that my roommate Jack is an amateur at directing, I’m making an understatement. I mean, going into this little project of his, he literally had no experience. I don’t know why he thought that this would be a good idea. I couldn’t tell you how his brain works, to be honest. 

It all began one boring night in my college dorm. It was a weeknight, and we couldn’t be fucked to get started on our assignments, so we decided to watch the Blair witch project instead. I swear, he must have been one of the last people on earth who hadn’t seen it at that point. I guess he loved it, because he wouldn’t stop talking about it afterwards. Specifically about how he could probably make something similar to it and blow up.

“Fuck studying man…” I remember him saying to me. “I could do it. How hard could it be?”

I tried to get him come back down to reality, but he wasn’t having it at the time. Thankfully, he ended up dropping the topic a few days later. Or at least… that’s what I thought at first. As soon as we’d finished our final exams and the year ended, he came up and asked if I wanted to be in the new film that he was directing Obviously, I said no. 

“Do you even have a decent camera? Or a script?” I asked him.

“Dude relax, I have everything.” He said to me, seemingly trying to hold back a grin. I guess he really thought that this was a get-rich-quick scheme or something. “Look, can you just do it? I don’t want to pay an actor. I’ve literally asked everybody I know, but I’m still missing one character.” 

I don’t know whether I should’ve been more insulted that he expected me to do this for free or that I was one of the last people he’d asked. However… I’d just gotten some incredibly shitty news a few days prior. I didn’t get the summer internship I’d been hoping for. With melancholy plaguing my thoughts, I decided to take him up on his offer. Might as well, you know? 

As it turns out, Jack wasn’t lying when he said he’d figured everything out. He’d borrowed a fairly decent camera from his uncle and had actually secured a shooting location. It was a small, abandoned town off the coast of Italy. This was getting quite interesting, to say the least. There were two other guys who were supposed to part of this whole thing – Wayland and Mick. I already knew them both, but Jack knew them better. He’d managed to secure obtain plane tickets for us through his Girlfriend – who worked at an airport. On top of all this, he’d also set up free accommodations for us at a motel located in a town about a 90 minute drive from the abandoned one. Apparently the owner of the chain was a good friend of his dad’s. Surprisingly, everything seemed good to go. 

We made the trip out there and checked into the motel about a week later. At this point, I was still incredibly skeptical about the how this “film” was going to turn out. In all honesty, I was expecting it to crash and burn in a week. These thoughts were only bolstered when Jack admitted that he hadn’t written a script.

“What the hell?” Wayland asked. “Well what are we supposed to do in front of the camera, then?” 

“Just act natural” Jack responded. “You think the Blair witch project had a script?” 

“I mean, it probably did.” Mick chimed in. 

Jack just continued. “Whatever. Look, if we read off of a script, then it runs the risk of sounding unnatural. This town’s apparently creepy as fuck, just go along with the vibe.” 

“Do you at least have some kind of story in mind?” I asked him. 

“Yeah, of course. Four friends are documenting their vacation in Italy. One day, while at a bar in a small town, they’re told about an abandoned place near the coast where some weird shit always goes down. Being extremely skeptical, they all go and check it out. And then they get fucked. We don’t even need any creature prosthetics or anything. It’ll be psychological horror, where something’s clearly wrong, but nobody can figure out what exactly. Just act scared, for fucks sakes.”

This seemed to satisfy Mick and Wayland, but I could tell that they also thought that deep down… this sounded like shit. *Whatever,* I thought. At least I could go on vacation for a while. 

For the first week, we just went and dicked around Sicily, getting shitfaced at bars and being a general nuisance to the locals. This was supposed to be the first act of the movie. However… we kind of winged the filming part. In other words, the footage looked like ass. 

“It’s good enough. These are the unimportant parts anyways, who cares?” was all that Jack said when we watched it back. 

I mean… he was the director. After that, we decided to finally get to work. Jack had the idea of incorporating some locals into the film, with their consent of course. We entered a bar in the small town we were staying at and tried to set up the scene. Jack spotted a middle-aged guy near the back and approached him, trying to explain to him what we were trying to do.

Halfway through Jack’s painful interpretation of the Italian language, the guy interrupted him. “Alright kid, I can speak English. What the hell is it that you want?” 

Jack breathed a sigh of relief. “So, we’re shooting a horror film. Four guys on vacation in Italy. In this one scene, we’re sitting a table in a bar and discussing where we’re going next. One of us brings up the abandoned coastal town near here and we decide that would be a fun place to go. That’s when you chime in and say some bullshit about how we shouldn’t go because there’s a black-eyed demon who lives there or something. Now… you’ll be doing this for free, but if this thing becomes big, I’ll wire you some money. Just give us your contact information.” 

After Jack’s spiel, the man just looked at him for a while, mouth agape. And then he chuckled. 

“You kids are ballsy, I’ll tell you that.” 

Wayland raise his eyebrow. “What’d you mean?”

The man then looked at us as if we’d just said the most ridiculous thing in the world. “So you’re telling me… you guys didn’t do any research before coming here?” 

We all just collectively shrugged. The man seemed to contemplate something for a second before replying. “Well… I guess it is more of a local issue. Not too many people around here even know about it. The news wouldn’t report what really happened.” 

*Wait.* What did he just say? “What… what’d you mean?” I asked him. 

He glanced over at us with somewhat of a morbid expression. “There’s a reason that place is abandoned, you know? The mainstream story was that a fire caused the evacuation. However… only two houses actually burned down. No… it’s what caused the fire that made everybody leave. But it wasn’t a stove… or an arsonist… it was something that you guys aren’t ready to understand. And I’d advise that you stay the hell away from there.”

The man turned back towards the bar and just started sipping on his beer again. We just stood there in collective shock. After a few moments, Jack spoke back up again:

“Dude… that was amazing. Could you do it again, please? On film this time?”

The guy turned around: “Kid, are you stupid or something?” He threw some bills onto the counter and got up. “This younger generation... you guys don’t listen, do you? That’s why the news is filled with stories of people like you fucking up somewhere. Just take my advice.” 

And just like that, he was gone. Now, none of us wanted to admit it, but that whole conversation did get us a bit spooked. Jack just wrote it off as some guy just trying to scare us. And again… we just agreed. In retrospect, listening to Jack’s mental gymnastics, attempting to justify why this was still a good idea was probably our biggest mistake. 

Anyways… we managed to shoot the scene with the help from some other tourists. They didn’t seem to know anything about the town, so they made up a story about how an insane religious zealot performed some ritual and now the place made anybody who went there lose their minds. Things seemed to be coming together quite nice. However… the whole time we were shooting, I couldn’t help but notice that the bartender was sneaking glances over at us. As we left, I could have sworn seeing him shaking his head somewhat solemnly. That should’ve been another sign for us to leave. But alas… we continued. 

We headed back to the motel and planned the trip out the next day. The story that we created was extremely generic. The guys go there and mess around for a few hours with nothing extraordinary happening. As they’re about to leave, they spot some weird symbols that had been spray-painted on the walls and floor of one of the buildings. They keep coming back, and things just keep escalating until they start going insane. The film was supposed to end with one of us standing in the water at night, walking backwards in a jerking motion towards the camera. Sounds more corny than scary right? Well at this point, we were too deep in to back out. 

We made the drive out there in our rented car the next morning. We’d gotten directions off of google maps, but the main road to the location was blocked for whatever reason. Because of that, we had to find a detour. Eventually we did manage to get there, but it took around two hours. That was kind of annoying. What was even more annoying were the wooden barriers around the place. It really looked like they were trying to keep people out. That’s when I started questioning the legality of this. However, Jack quelled these concerns by telling us about a film shot entirely in Disneyworld without the parks consent, so we just kept on. Besides… this was such a small, insignificant place. Who would care? 

We walked around for a while, trying to map out where everything was. That was an easy task as the place was quite small. You could walk end to end through the town in about ten minutes. the man at the bar was also right. Two houses seemed to have burnt down. The rest of the buildings – while empty and having moderate signs of environmental damage, looked to be perfectly fine. In fact, the place didn’t give off much of a creepy vibe at all. At first.  

We filmed for a few hours before we called it a day. I have to say, it was honestly coming together better than I thought it could've. As it turns out, Wayland was quite the actor. Mick and I also managed to hold our own. In addition to that, Jack’s camera work wasn’t terrible. Now, it wasn’t good by any means, but it looked quite authentic and on par with modern day found footage films. He must have taken a few classes. As the sun began to set, we decided to wrap it up for the day and head back. As we were about to leave, I decided to take a look in one of the burnt houses, just out of pure curiosity. As I walked around the blackened, dilapidated structure, nothing really seemed to pop out at first. That was until I looked at the floor. There were… *footprints?* At first, I thought they must have been due to the dust, which worried me. I mean, there couldn’t have been anybody else here. 

However, when I examined them closer, I realized something much stranger. The footsteps seemed to be sunken in, as if somebody took a heavy weight shaped like the bottom of a shoe and pressed into the floorboards. This was weird… to say the least. But not that weird. Not enough for me to think about it too long, anyways. I jogged back to the car, where everybody was waiting and told them all about it. As expected, they just told me it was nothing. And that’s also what I told myself. 

Nothing extremely out of the ordinary occurred the following few days either. At that point, we’d even gotten around 45 minutes of decent footage. It was only until a week into shooting where I realized that something just wasn’t right about this place. The feeling of wrongness had been subtly building ever since we’d gotten there, but either nobody else noticed or nobody else wanted to admit it. I was watching over some footage that we’d shot a few days ago. In it, the sun was just starting to set. The thing is… I’d noticed something in the distance off the shore, in the water. At first, it just appeared to be a splash. But… it was large. What the hell could’ve caused it? Curious, I replayed the footage and watched even closer. Now, the background was pretty blurry and the splash was only in the shot for a few seconds, but I could’ve swore that there was something behind it. Almost like a dark figure. A… person?*No way*, I thought. That made no fucking sense, you know? 

Even though I tried rationalizing this by telling myself it was a trick of the light, or my overactive imagination… or *something*, I still couldn’t stop thinking about it. I thought about telling the others, but I knew that they wouldn’t think anything of it. Especially Jack. He seemed to have gotten a lot more serious about this whole thing. My suspicions were confirmed when night came. We were getting ready to head out of there when he stopped us. 

“Look… I have an idea.” He said. “Let’s stay here for the night. I packed sleeping bags and some food. 

“Fuck that!” Mick replied. “Why would I want to spend the night in this dusty-ass place?” 

After seeing that footage, I also shared his sentiments. I did not want to do this. 

Jack kept going: “Look, what makes a movie suspenseful? Conflict, right? So far, there’s been none of that. We’ve found some spooky symbols, heard some noises, but that’s it! Imagine this… our car’s broken down in this scene. We tried to start it, but it just wouldn’t go. So we start arguing with each other. “Oh, it’s your fault, it’s his fault!” that kind of shit, right? As it ends up , we’re forced to sleep here, in one of the houses. And then sometime during the night, we wake up to some strange noises outside, so we look out the windows, and see a figure crouching behind the bushes or something. Tell me that doesn’t sound fucking amazing.” 

While it didn't sound like anything original, this is what the movie needed. The others protested a bit more before eventually coming to a consensus. I also reluctantly agreed. However, I sure as hell wasn’t excited about the night. We moved into one of the houses and set up our sleeping bags there. Jack wanted us to only get a few hours of sleep before we started filming the night scene. 

“Authenticity.” He explained. “The more tired you are, the more real it’ll seem.” I had to hand it to him at that point. The guy was dedicated.

At about 1:00 AM, he woke us up. He was already filming. The plan was to have Mick go out beforehand and start making deep, groaning noises. He’d also be the figure crouching behind the bush. We were planning to shoot and edit in a scene with all four of us watching from inside the house later. Groggily, I got up and played along. 

“What’s going on?” I mumbled.

Jack put on his scared voice. “You guys didn’t hear that shit? Listen.” As Wayland and I strained our ears, he filmed us. As expected, we heard Mick’s groaning from outside. 

“What the hell is that?” Wayland responded, deliberately making his voice go shaky at the end of the sentence. 

“Fuck if I know.” Jack responded. “Sounds like it’s coming from somewhere near the shore.” He took the camera and started filming through the window. 

“Shit… I think I see something in the bushes.” He paused for a second. “Wait… the hell?” His tone changed drastically. He put the camera down and turned back to us. 

“Guys, what the fuck is that in the water?” His voice was completely sober at that point. It didn’t sound like acting at all. In addition to that, his face had gone completely pale. Confused, I just kept up the act. 

“What’d you mean? What was in the bushes-“

“I’m being fucking serious.” He cut me off. “Look out at the sea.” With a sense of dread creeping into my psyche, Mick and I did what he said. However… I couldn’t see anything. 

“Uh… have you gone mental, Jack? There’s nothing.” I heard Mick blurt out.

“Are you kidding me?” Jack pushed him out of the way and started scanning for himself.

“What the fuck is going on?” I heard him mutter.

However, as I kept observing the water, I noticed something rather peculiar. And frighteningly familiar. The waves were incredibly light that night, so I was able to make it out in the distance. *Splashes.* Large ones. And they seemed to be getting closer. Suddenly, I remembered the splash from the film footage that I had been looking at earlier. 

“Give me the camera.” I told Jack. 

Although he had a muddled look on his face, he didn’t protest and just handed it over. I turned it back on and started filming the splashes. And oh god… *what the fuck did I see?*

There was a figure wading through the water, coming towards us. It also seemed to have some kind of deep red glow emitting off of it. When I zoomed in, it was apparent that it was wearing some old-looking deep sea diving gear, but without a helmet. The weirdest part was that when I tried focusing in on the details of its face, I couldn’t. It’s not that the camera didn't have the capability… my eyes just couldn’t take it. They’d start stinging and watering and I’d have to turn away. But from the split seconds that I managed to sneak a look in, the face appeared to be… *distorted*, in a sense. Almost like it was that of a typical man, but was passed through multiple filters of some sort. Safe to say, this was beyond fucked up. 

I put the camera down. “Jesus Christ!” I reeled back in shock. I decided to test my suspicions and looked back at the water. The figure was now gone. At least from my vision. I could still see the splashes. And they were getting dangerously close now. 

“What the hell is it?” Jack and Wayland asked me in near unison. I gave them the camera and they took turns witnessing what I'd just seen in abject horror. 

“We need to leave.” Jack uttered, in the most drastic tone I’d ever heard come from him. 

“What in the hell are you guys doing?” We heard Mick call from the bushes. He was looking up at us, holding his arms up. I watched in horror as large footsteps started appearing on the beach behind him. 

“RUN TO THE FUCKING CAR!” Was all that I managed to get out. He flinched for a second, before turning around to witness the sand being manipulated by an invisible force. He bolted right after that. We didn’t even bother rolling up our sleeping bags, we just ran like hell out of there. Being the slowest of the bunch, I was the last one to leave the house we were in. However, in my mad dash towards the vehicle, I slipped on some pebbles and crashed to the ground, scraping my wrists. As I reeled from the pain, I swore that I was able to somehow sense a presence coming towards me. It’s hard to explain. It was like the air around me began to feel hostile. In addition to that, I could hear multiple voices coming towards me. But none of them were distinguishable. They all seemed to be blending together, forming a disturbing cacophony of noise. And the worst part of all…

*I couldn’t move.*

I remember just sitting there, trying to prop myself up, but my arms were moving about an inch a minute. It also felt like I was being dragged down *into* the earth. A few seconds later, I heard the sound of pavement being crunched behind me. The closer and closer it got, the more and more it felt like I was sinking into hell. 

My vision started blacking out before I was snapped out of whatever trance I had been in. I watched as a bright light flew past and hit something behind me. The suffocating disharmony of voices suddenly stopped and was replaced by a loud, guttural grunt. I looked up to see Jack standing about thirty meters away, holding a flare gun in one hand and the camera in the other. I took the chance and scrambled up, dashing towards the car. I got in and we sped the hell out of there. 

We’re sitting back in the motel room now. None of us have said a word to each other. I mean… what the hell are we supposed to say? 

**UPDATE:**

We’ve decided to end the trip early. As soon morning comes, we’re taking the next flight out of here. The rest of the guys have finally drifted off to sleep, but… I just can’t. That… feeling of sinking terror as that thing approached me… I can’t stop thinking about it. I can almost feel it still. 

I picked up the camera again and skimmed through the footage. There was no way in hell that we weren’t showing this to somebody. Maybe there were answers out there. However, when I played the footage back… that thing was gone. I could see the water splashing, the concrete crumbling under its force, me paralyzed on the ground… **but that goddamn thing was just not there.**

*What?*

I already have a decent amount of experience, but this is my most relevant job yet. My new job title is data analyst. In a lot of ways, this is great for me, especially since I haven't graduated yet. 

I took this job for two reasons. One, it paid more than my last job. And two, it is definitely teaching me more relevant skills than my last job. 

The downside is that I work for a very small company. Therefore, I know my salary is low compared to other entry-level jobs. I know I've even gotten callbacks for jobs that pay more than this. (As a matter of fact, I've interviewed for internships that pay more.)  

That said, this just happened to be the first job opportunity that came through for me. 

I'm afraid I'm currently in a sticky situation. My issue isn't that I would feel guilty about quitting my new job so soon. Yes, I would feel a little guilty, but I'd get over it, and so would they. 

My sticky situation is twofold:

* How long before I can apply to new jobs? How long before a hiring manager no longer sees it as a red flag that I'm already looking for a new job? 

* This is my first full-time job. How do I possibly interview for new jobs when I'm busy Monday to Friday from 8AM-5PM?

I posted a few months ago concerned with my chances of landing a summer finance internship as a rising senior in college and received some great advice... Most users suggested attending a mock interview from my campus career center -- and I did just that. After the mock interview, my interviewer explained my interview was pretty good overall, essentially a 4/5. She ranked my performance on areas such as eye contact, professionalism, preparedness, etc. and most areas received a 4 or 5 out of 5.

I have been told via mock interview and from many people that I make great first impressions. It bothers me that I haven't received an offer because I am confident, not arrogant and really feel like I am a great communicator. I always ask insightful questions and follow up after interviews. 

Since the mock, I have had 6 interviews -- in person, on the phone and one via Skype. I have received 3 rejections and have 3 more responses coming soon. 

My question is this: How the f*** do I figure out what I am doing wrong now? 

My resume is strong. It is 100% something during my interview that is turning interviewers off.

Could it be that I am not standing out? (I try pushing my experience working as a graphic design freelancer from a service I started myself, to stand out as a finance major -- good idea?)
Is it really just a numbers game and one is bound to work out?


Sorry for the long post, but it's really crunch time and I will do whatever it takes to land a position. 

Thank You!

I don't know whether to do an ROP or just work a service/retail job while doing side projects. The money from the job would really be nice but if an ROP will benefit me in the future when looking for summer internships I would rather go that route.

2. Then for us Tacoma CS students (or Bothell campus), are we allowed into CSE career fair?

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.


**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target school, join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

I don't really know why I'm writing this or if this is even the right place but at 18 years-old my life just took a complete 180 and I have no idea what to do. No idea if its just a temporary down that I cannot control but I'm just hoping to get some advice. Or maybe even writing this down will clear my mind, who knows.

Basically this week I lost my best friend and probably the last friend that I talk with on a regular basis, I lost all my motivation for college, the girl I was dating left me for no clear reason, I lost my motivation to work on my future and even though I got accepted into one of the best internships within the Dutch Music Industry I'm starting to doubt if its really what I want.

I've never felt this depressed in my entire life and even though I have no suicidal thoughts, I fail to see what to do with my life and how to eventually become a happy person. Its impossible to describe how much I feel alone and lost.

Everything that provoked my interest before like music, art and that stuff just doesn't seem to reach me at all anymore. I'm trying to work on school but I simply cannot bring myself to do it. Its different than just the usual ''not feeling like'' but actually being scared of going back to school all of the sudden.

Writing this down really makes me feel even worse because I have all this stuff that I should be grateful for like a caring family, the fact that I'm even in college and I feel like an ungrateful d*ckhead for complaining. 

I simply just don't know whats going on and I'm actually quite scared. Hopefully someone has gone through something similar here."

Where have alumni found employment with that degree?
Are there internship opportunities in the area?
Is it a reasonable path to go from quant econ undergrad to a finance grad program?
Do you enjoy being at UCI in general?

Any relevant advice would be helpful. 

Also, my plan if I go to UCSB instead would be financial math/stats or econ undergrad, then finance grad school.

81tc25,2,2018-03-03,Advice for a 3rd year ME student- bio and business,sirbrachthepale,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/81tc25/advice_for_a_3rd_year_me_student_bio_and_business/,"I'm a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at UTC. I'm coming to the point where I have to consider steps post-graduation. I have to consider three main factors.



One: Minors and other areas of study I'm passionate about---
I've recently been considering picking up a minor or two. After taking some required Eng Management courses, I've noticed I've got an aptitude for business. Comparing myself to a lot of engineering students I've worked around, I'm pretty well versed when it comes to social skills, which I've been told ties into the business side of things. I'd love to be able to use knowledge in business combined with engineering to start companies/develop better ways to do things/make lots of money (because no one's ever wanted to do that before, right?).
I also have a love for the other sciences, and think I would really enjoy branching into the Bio side of things. I know Biomechanics is a pretty rare major, and I've read that a lot of BME's have a hard time finding work, and so the best thing for getting into that industry is to get an ME with a Biology minor.




Two: Advice I've received from practicing engineers---
I have a few older friends (twenty+ years my senior) in the industry, and they've mentioned that within the next decade, many ME jobs will be replaced as the industry shifts toward tech and business. I've also been told by some that minors in other fields have insignificant influence on chances of being hired (especially compared to experience like internships). Others have told me a minor in other diverse fields I'm interested in would make me a valuable asset.



Three: Grad school- Masters
 Should I look into grad school? I definitely want to be on the industry side of things as opposed to doing research. I'm not opposed to getting a masters if that would help- I've heard of places like Belmont offering a 1 year Masters degree in Business, and that sounded attractive to me. My primary concern here is GPA. My first two years were rough, and my GPA is currently standing at about a 2.7, though I'm fighting my way back up despite my upper level ME courses being much more difficult. 



So my questions for you all are:
*Would it be wise to pursue a/both minor/s (bio/business)?
*Would being versed in both Bio/Mech Eng AND Business be as beneficial as I'm thinking it would? (knowing how to do science and also market that science looks like a pretty lethal combo but I could be overestimating the advantage I'd have) 
*Should I consider grad school?
*Regardless of grad school, should I be putting more emphasis on recovering GPA vs getting real experience?
*For experience- should I focus on having a diverse background, or should I pick a narrower path I'd like to pursue and try to get as much experience in that area as possible?
*Am I trying to bite off more than I can chew? 



Thanks so much, I'm grateful for any experience or input you all can share with me.

81tkyu,4,2018-03-03,Computer Science Career Advice,OhOkayThanks,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/81tkyu/computer_science_career_advice/,"Greetings,

I wanted to reach out to my fellow U of M redditors and ask a few questions regarding career advice and academic coursework.

To give a bit of background: I transferred to LSA this fall from an in-state community college with around 55-60 accepted transfer credits. After finishing last semester, I now have around 72 credits under my belt. I'm yet to fulfill my language requirement, so I plan on either doing some self-study to place out of the first couple semesters or just biting the bullet and starting from the very beginning. Upon entering in the fall, my initial plan was to transfer over to engineering, so last semester I took EECS 183, PHYS 140, and CALC III. I ended up finishing with a B average and realized that it might be better for me to pursue a Computer Science degree through LSA. This semester I'm taking EECS 280, EECS 203, and ANTHRO 101. My plan is to take 281 in the spring semester and perhaps another course during the summer semester. My thinking is that by getting 281 out of the way, I will be in a much better position for obtaining an internship next summer when fall rolls around. I ultimately foresee myself graduating in ~2 years from now. A little later than I had expected, but oh well.

Anyways, I'm hoping to gain some advice from upperclass CS majors or CS alumni about what steps I should be taking during these next few months in order to improve my chances of landing an internship next summer. The dilemma that comes along with any first internship search seems to be similar to the chicken before the egg scenario, where without any experience, one is considered less competitive among other potential applicants and thus struggles to find that initial stepping stone that they may then utilize in future career pursuits.

Basically my question is: what actions should one take in order to overcome this obstacle? What initiatives should I be taking over the summer to improve my abilities in this field?

Currently my plan is to visit the career center and see what advice they might be able to offer. I'm also planning on building a website during the next fews months to showcase any personal projects I've worked on. I'm very curious to see what ideas or resources you may suggest in order to help me gain more experience with CS.

Thanks in advance!"
81u4l1,2,2018-03-03,What kind of tech opportunities would a JD/MBA open up?,FunkDrSmooth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/81u4l1/what_kind_of_tech_opportunities_would_a_jdmba/,"Just as the question states, I’m considering the path of pursuing an MBA and law degree. I’ve done some research and poking around on this sub in regards to an MBA degree but haven’t been able to find much about law. I’m hoping other people can benefit from this question as well. 

As for my specific situation, I’m a student at a university currently finishing up a BA in CIS, accounting, and business administration. A few of my professors recently confronted me about working towards an MBA at my university that would only require me to stay one extra semester (I would be taking duel credit classes to fasten the process). Afterwards, they are encouraging me to go get a degree in law. 

I ultimately see myself as a CIS student with a background in business. Software development is very interesting to me and I’m starting to get pretty good at programming with a few different languages. For the summer, I have an internship lined up with a large investing firm. When applying, I  was originally shooting for an internship position in the information systems department, but was given a spot in the operations department with a technical emphasis due to their lack of spots left in IS. The firm is offering to cater to me by giving me experience in all three of my areas of study so I thought the opportunity was too good to pass up. There is also a very good chance I can receive a full time offer after graduation if I do well over the summer. 

In the end, I think my dream job would be to manage a tech company or IS Department. From what I’ve read, an MBA would aid me in that path. However, I’m not sure exactly what a law degree would bring to the table. I’m intrigued with the idea, as our technology is advancing so fast that the law has trouble keeping up. I’d like to be as informed as possible though before I make any big life decisions. With the likeliness of attaining a full time position at the firm, I question whether I should go straight to grad school or get a few years of experience/money first. 

I appreciate whoever reads this long post! I hope I can help any others answer some questions as well as my own.

While I’ve had a good exposure to a lot of elements of programming, I am still in this weird rut where I know for certain I could not work on a project for a team. I think this has to do with the fact that my programs courses tend to cater to extremely hypothetical use cases (use X language to make a magic matrix with specifiable size) and not so much on actually getting us dev ready for the real world.

This has me extremely nervous because I’ve already begun to notice the effects, applying to multiple internships over the summer has landed me nothing and the feedback I get from all interviewers is that I brute force my solutions which leads to lots of circumstances where they wouldn’t work. 

My plan thus far is to get extremely cozy and no life my way through C++ Primer, but I’m lost about what to do after there. Would picking a project to work on be the best course of action? I figure having a GitHub with self made projects to link on a resume would be great.

I love to code, but thought it was a hobby. Turns out this is what I wanna do with my life, and I have plans of starting a tech company in University or after which will be software related. Thing is, I realized this a bit late, because I've already applied to Mehcanical and Civil engineering programs at Universities. I've been accepted to the University of Waterloo (aka engineer's wet dream) but for Civil eng. Also got into Queen's University for general eng. The thing with Queen's: you get to choose what you want to go into 2nd year and you're guaranteed a spot as long as you pass first year.

So, probably gonna have to deny Waterloo (much to everyone telling me not to), and go to Queen's. Nothing final yet, but since I got into ENGINEERING, its not like I can go to Queens for CS. So I'm thinking I'd choose Comp Eng 2nd year. 

NOW MY QUESTION: if I take CE in Queen's U, and the electives I'm allowed to take I take all software related courses (aka programming I guess), will I have any disadvantage to CS or SE students in terms of my PROGRAMMING knowledge and ability? I want to be a good programmer, and I'm guessing going into CE isnt gonna hinder me TOO much? 

For the paid internship at Queen's uni, if I'm in CE, will I even get hired for a software development position? This is considering I've taken all my electives as programming courses.

ALSO, would you suggest not going to uWaterloo and instead going to Queen's? Kind of risky I think. Guaranteed job if I go to Waterloo, but I wont be doing programming, which is what I like, and I want to start that company....

I did an internship last summer in a mid-size company in another state and I did well. I worked close to other engineers and I was mentored closely by a engineer who became a good friend. I have a good relationship with the head manager (even tho he is pretty busy, so we didn't talk as much) and I got to meet the owner of the company. Anyway, I contacted the head manager asking o apply for a full-time position there. He sent me a email back asking when I could come to visit them to talk. I have a meeting with him in two weeks. Right now this is my only solid lead to a full-time job...

My concern: When I came to school after the summer, my supervisor wrote me a senior project proposal (which he invested some time doing), however due to the division of senior projects at school and the fact I didn't want to do a project by myself (I was kind of scared...) I was not able to do their senior project proposed. I did another one, which was proposed by my professor. I sent a text to my supervisor and explained. Before I left, some engineers at the company were kind of excited with what I would come up with the project. So now, I am kind of going back there empty handed... I sent a text to my supervisor and he told me to take time and come up with at least a some solid ideas about their project so I can impress the head manager, which I am trying to find time to do it among school and my other senior project(I will do it in these next two weeks)

Also, my GPA is not great. 2.7. I tried to improve in this last year but it didn't work out well... but my head manager already knew that even tho I think he expected I would raise it to a 3.0 or so

I would like some advice in how to approach this meeting with my head manager. How to reassure him, I would be the best fit for the company. I did work really hard over the summer, sometimes 50 hours a week (I was getting paid for that extra effort tho).

The question is what to put on it. I'm not allowed to put up class assignments, which have been the bulk of my programming so far, so I'm at a bit of a loss. So far I have up a group project, a coding assignment from another class (doesn't really look like a class assignment), and some coding I've done on the side. 

The work I've done on the side is good and interesting, but it is simpler / shorter than the most complex programming I can do. Some of it is also a work in progress. Should I still keep those up? 

I know it would be good to do some hackathons etc, just haven't had time yet. "

I say ""legally ambiguous"" because I don't think the project itself is illegal, but movie companies spent a lot of money in the past trying to shut it down.

I am not one of the main developers or anything, but I made a few contributions. I am interested in video/audio encoding, streaming, subtitles, etc. so this was a very useful playground for me to play around with and test implementations.

I never really used the software itself because I don't watch a lot of movies or tv shows, but I like the technology behind it and I think it could have many useful applications. For example, you can simply fork the main repo and point to a repository that contains torrent links for free educational videos, and suddenly the app can be used by students in a perfectly legit and productive way.

Anyway, I'm not here to defend the project, but I was wondering if my contributions to the project could blacklist me from some software companies in the future, especially big ones. I had an internship at a B1g 4, but I'm not sure they really checked my Github. Should I just delete the fork?"

I am looking for a little guidance as to what to do next to boost my career early on. I am currently a student at a Tech, where I am majoring in Software Development with the plan to double major with a Network Specialist degree. I have a year of experience doing Help Desk work at University that I transferred from, and currently have an internship doing level 1 tech support for contracted business clients. I have already learned a lot about the technologies of the IT world, experience that is much more practical than any studies could prepare me for.

I've been looking into the basic certs, and feel that it would be beneficial to start working towards obtaining a few. Now, the question is, which certs should I take. My thinking is, from what I've been reading on here and elsewhere, that the A+ is good to learn the basics, basics that I very likely have, and or are getting from my current internship. So with that in mind I am looking at the next reasonable cert to chase, which I believe would be the much more in-depth CCNA (vs N+). Another thing is that I would like to potentially go the InfoSec route, meaning I would like to get the Sec+ cert at some point. 

Some advice as to the order I should get the certs and which certs to get would be great! My current thinking is: continue working and learning for a while -&gt; CCNA -&gt; Sec+ -&gt; future cert.

My current career goal is really just to break out of the help desk/tech support position as quickly as possible. Whether it be a sysadmin, network engineer, analyst, or security related etc.. 

I realize that it wouldn't hurt to get as many certs as possible, that's ideal, but for the sake of time and expenses I do not plan on pursuing more than 2 or 3 in the next few years.

I am happy to clarify or expand on anything that I left vague, and I want to thank you in advance for the help!"

This happened about 3 and a half years ago while I was still an intern and was probably the single worst … best … most interesting day I ever had working with my employer at the time.

&amp;nbsp;

The players in this story are Me – Self explanatory, Boss – My manager at the time, VP – The VP of sales for the company

&amp;nbsp;

The day started with me laying in my bed awoken by the loud repeated chirping of my cell phone ringer.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Me: This is $Me

&gt;Boss: Hi $Me, I just wanted to check in and make sure that you were ok because we haven’t seen you at the office yet this morning

&amp;nbsp;

I rolled over and looked at my clock, it’s flashing 9:05 … I’m over an hour late for work and I live a half hour away.
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;Me: Aww crap, I overslept.  I’ll be there in about an hour

&gt;Boss: Alright, get here when you can.

&amp;nbsp;

I hang up the phone take a quick shower and get dressed.  I grab a muffin on my way out the door and I get to work at about 10.
Before I have even made it to my desk I get stopped by $VP.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;VP: Hey, $Me.  My tablet isn’t connecting to my keyboard or my dock.  Can you take a look at that for me?

&amp;nbsp;

I nod my head

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Me: Bring the tablet, dock, and keyboard over to my desk and I’ll take a look.

&amp;nbsp;

A few minutes later $VP arrives with the requested items and at a quick glance I see what his problem likely is, the tablet and dock are filthy.  Ports are full of gunk and the tablet screen is so smudged that you can barely see anything on it.  I let VP know that I will take a look and let him know when I am finished, probably about 45 minutes to an hour.

&amp;nbsp;

I take the next half hour to carefully clean the gunk out of all of the ports using a plastic pick tool that I had handy and compressed air from a little compressor that I had at the work bench.  Having gotten as much out as it seemed possible I tried to connect the keyboard and it of course worked.  After that I thought it would be a good idea to confirm that the dock worked as well but I had no doubts that it would.  I hooked up the dock and that was when the day got worse.

&amp;nbsp;

A 4 inch jet of flame came shooting out of the joint where the dock and the tablet connected, the tablet flickered off and the dock started to melt.  I quickly grabbed the power cord for the dock and yanked it from the wall with an explicative shout

&amp;nbsp;

Hearing me swear, Boss comes running over to see what is going on.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Boss: $Me, what’s going on, are you alright?

&gt;Me: I’m fine $Boss.  I was cleaning up $VP’s tablet and when I put it back on the dock it started on fire

&amp;nbsp;

$Boss looks at the charred and slightly melted dock with a silent look of awe.  I wander over to $VP’s office to let him know what happened.  Surprisingly he just laughs and says that he will take a replacement when we can get one but not to worry about rushing it.

&amp;nbsp;

Having informed $VP of the fate of his tablet I then get on the phone with the vendor to try making a warranty claim – After sending a number of pictures of the tablet and dock they accept it but it takes me 3 hours of being on the phone with them, mostly to fill out what seemed to be insurance paperwork.

&amp;nbsp;

After hanging up the phone $Boss walks over and says we need to have a chat and heads off to the server room; we usually had short private conversations in there because it was easier than trying to get one of the conference rooms for a 10 minute talk.  I figured that this was where I was going to get let go or at the very least raked over the coals for the way that the day had gone so far.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Boss: $Me, you know that we really like having you working here and you have been a great help.
&gt;Me: Thanks $Boss, it’s been a pleasure working here so far. (Internally I’m just thinking that I’m about to be let go)
&gt;Boss: I know that today has not been a typical day for you and has gone a bit off the rails …
&gt;Me: I know and I’m sor-
Boss cuts me off before I can say any more
&gt;Boss: But we aren’t here to talk about that

&amp;nbsp;

I’m slightly confused at this point, unsure of what is going on.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Boss: We talked previously about you wanting more hours and we would like to give them to you as well as a raise because you have been doing excellent work

&amp;nbsp;

$Boss and I talked for another 15 minutes while I was told what was given the offer and accepted.  All told I ended up getting the hours I wanted and a 50% raise.  Despite the way the day started, I have to say that it ended on a high note."

820okr,116,2018-03-04,The gap between grads getting a job with a dozen applications vs 300+?,MarkArrows,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/820okr/the_gap_between_grads_getting_a_job_with_a_dozen/,"I keep seeing a few patterns on this sub when it comes to new grads looking for work. 

1. Desperate new grad applies to 300+ job listings without any luck. Finally breaks down and comes here for advice, looking to get the answer for their daily question: ""What the hell is so wrong with me that nobody is even calling me back??"" 

2. First batch of advice range from: Your resume must be bad. You need more side projects. Study and grind white boarding daily. Learn more and more until you're competitive. Interviewing is a skill that needs to be drilled. Apply like applying to jobs is your 9-5 job. Stop applying only to big N companies. Ect ect. 

3. Second batch comes in to refute first batch: They got a job without any of the above. Only had to apply a dozen times before they got a job offer, with many of their applications getting to the interview stage. Mentions of impostor syndrome. Someone says they got their job with a terrible GPA, no side projects and no internships. You don't need to be that passionate about CS - just have common sense. People who do side projects as their social life are very rare; you're not really fighting vs those people when you apply to smaller places.  Someone points out that only a small percentage of students stay unemployed for months after graduating - most average programmers find a home in some small company, and for all the other grads reading not to worry - OP is an edge case.  

... So why **is** there that gap? 

I'm starting to think it's all about location. My theory is that the 300+ applying new grads are probably applying in the bay area or other popular tech hubs. The 10 application new grad is probably applying in another region of the world. 

If you charted the full population of new grads on a graph - X being location and Y being number of applications - would there be a normal distribution, or would tech hub locations have a spike completely out of proportion to the surrounding locations? 

As for the ""OP is an edge case"" I think there's a much higher amount of new grads still unemployed vs the thought that those people are only an exception. Specifically **because** of that thought. If everyone assumes the 300+ applicant is a deviant, all the people that are in that situation will feel too shamed to post till the point they break down - the opposite of a vocal minority. 

Assuming I'm on the right path (I got no proof on any of this, ergo it's all circumstantial) I think this sub should change it's advice on what a CS career **is**.  That times have changed and this career shouldn't **start** in the tech hubs for the normal graduate like they used to in the earlier days. Maybe the new graduates entering the workforce should automatically assume they will move to somewhere else to gain experience and move into a tech hub only after they've got a few years. 

Or perhaps the sub should explore and advise about more modern ways to connect to companies. I see a lot of discussion on shotgunning applications is a waste of time. Anything on indeed, monster, ect are just giant black holes that companies look at as a last ditch option. Instead people find jobs by networking, meetups, hackathons, showing great interest in a company, calling up recruiting firms directly, or cold contacting recruiters through LinkedIn. Those sorts of methodologies might be worth more.

820vql,0,2018-03-04,"Still feel like an intern, even after being an “employee” for more than half a year",nogoodiegoodlol,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/820vql/still_feel_like_an_intern_even_after_being_an/,"Sorry this is a bit of a rant.

Last summer I picked up an internship as an “IT Intern”, most of my time really was spent imaging computers, shipping and deploying those computers. I learned some things though, AD/SCCM/WSUS etc, and also got to lead a few small projects. 

After the internship ended. They invited me to work part time while I was in school, they said that I’d be a real employee, and I wouldn’t be doing the same stuff as I did in the summer (big lie). Still was imaging computers, deploying 
them, learned a few cool things here and there. 


Most interesting thing I’ve done so far was sort of manage our O365 Exchange. I wrote documentation’s on how to remediate accounts that have been compromised, automated them with powershell too. Then also I was tasked with creating POCs with a few email filtering vendors. And help decide which one we will go with. 

They’ve told me that eventually, I’d be working on the security/infrastructure team (supposed to be soon). But my old manager is clinging on to me, and having me do all of the things that I did as an intern. And my new manager, is telling me that things from my old manager come first. 

What really pisses me off, is that months ago my old manager said that everybody across the team would take on the responsibility of imaging/deploying computers. Nope, it’s all been assigned to me, with strict instructions to not work on things for my new manager until my old manager’s stuff is done. 
They usually have me taking 100lb+ of boxes to Drop of at FedEx, nobody else helps. I hate it, it feels so demeaning and that I’m not respected. 


The internship pay was $15, then I went up to $17 after it ended. Located in Atlanta. 


I’m 19, graduating next year with a bachelors in IT. Working on getting my AWS Developer and maybe SysOps cert to try and get a job in a devops environment. I’d also like my OSCP eventually but that’ll probably have to wait till I’m out of school.

So I've started an internship in a museum last month that will last until July. The terms of the internship was that it wasn't paid, I'm kind of ok with this, well I thought I was. I only realize now that my contribution is more than what I expected it'd be. Anyway, I'm still giving 100% of myself into this, even though it's not paid, I love what I do. I've worked my ass of the first month, had very good feedbacks on it.

There's another intern which I know, we've already talked about this, and how unfair it was not to pay interns (it's not even a lack of money from the museum). We already wanted to have a talk with our director at the end of our internship to state our view on this. 

FYI, I live in Switzerland, so laws may be a bit different, and before starting this I honestly thought that all internships were paid. Turns out it's a common thing here. 

Hopefully my parents can still support me, and I wouldn't be able to do this internship if they weren't there.

I had in mind that it would be interesting to see how to make a law to force companies to pay their interns (we can try to pass laws as citizen in Switzerland, you ""just"" need to collect a certain amount of signatures that depends on the scale, if it's regional, national, etc. Here we're talking about 5'000 signatures, then the project is voted by the people). I wondered what law said already about internships, and I quickly found out that in october 2017, the law had changed ; for the kind of internship I do, the company has to pay me something, a compensation of 850CHF per month (~850$), which is ridiculous anyway compared to the cost of living (I could not even pay the rent for a room/apartment with this). 

I'm now in a dilemma ; I'd like to talk about this to my direct superior (who has nothing to do with this, and already told how sorry he was he couldn't pay me), but I don't know if it's really a good idea. I don't want to ""threaten"" them or anything, even though it seems that they aren't in their rights, because I don't want them to let go of me, in fear that I'd do anything further. I'm a bit paranoid by this, I don't want to loose the internship for that, I'm ok with unpaid work, it's a really good job to put on my CV, really, but shouldn't I tell them if law says otherwise ? 

I don't really have access to HR, so I'm asking here. The other intern wants to talk directly to the director (I think he's cool, but I've never really talked to him

Can you help me ? What should I do ?

Thanks

I'm a graduating senior this year meaning I will be attending college in the fall. I already have my college picked out in state. This college is one of the top engineering schools out of the United States, not 1-5 but definitely in the top ten. Currently I am admitted under Computer Engineering since I believed my passion lied in systems and designing hardware; however, having taken some Computer Science courses at my local community college (Dual-Enrollment) I think I enjoy the prospects of Software Engineering a bit more since it has tons of possibilities.

I have some main questions I would like to ask everyone on this sub-reddit in hopes that I can figure out my future without going into more debt than necessary!


1. Which is better, Computer Engineering or Computer Science? Which one has a better job outlook in your opinion?


2. Is the only engineering title for CSC a Software Engineer? Is there something more to strive for? Different types of disciplines?


3. Which do you think would pay more? (I know money isn't everything but I enjoy hardware and software so money could be a deciding factor)


4. When should I start working on my own side projects? (There is a very good internship program at the school I am planning to participate in)


5. I understand there is a ""big 4"", what exactly are the prospects of working or interning at these companies other than the large salary?


6. What languages do you recommend learning? (I know python but I don't know how to apply it into a project)


7. What kind of projects would make me the most competitive in this day? What language do they require?


8. I more than likely will be doing a minor with my degree what would you recommend? 


9. Also I would love any advice anyone can give me on scholarships or opportunities that could potentially help pay for college! (something like SMART)


I know this sub is an ""outlier"" in the sense of people that post here so I will be taking everything with a grain of salt, but I really do want to make a difference in whatever field I choose to study in.

I could theoretically do an internship this summer and defer graduation to Spring, but there is NO guarantee I'll get anything as I have no projects and its late in the cycle.

But I mean if it takes 6 months+ after graduation to get a job without an internship, getting a Bachelor's instead of a MS wouldn't have been worth it. Because by the time I'm working, I would have been just 1 year away from an MS if I had gone that route; in my school you CAN'T rush through the MS, giving you plenty of time to intern. 

So the opportunity cost which normally makes a MS pointless may be much less for me... but I mean I *really* don't care about computer science enough to get an MS; if I get a graduate degree, I would rather get an MBA. Not to mention my school is literally the bottom of the barrel, I would want my highest education attained be from... anywhere else."

I'm not really enjoying my job (just under a year in), and I'm looking to make a change.  I'm an ""Application Analyst"" at a medical school currently.  It pays pretty well (~60k in a low-to-medium COL area) and has some killer benefits, but I kind of dread going in everyday.  

The first and largest issue is that I do basically next to no actual programming at this job, and I think that's going to hold me back a lot in the future if I don't make a change.  Fortunately the job has given me some pretty good experience working in T-SQL, so hopefully that can give me some kind of a leg up.  Beyond this, I just don't really enjoy my coworkers for the most part, and I feel like as a department we're very unorganized.  As such, very little really gets done, and it lends itself to me feeling pretty unfulfilled most days.

Anyway, I'm coming to you all to get a feel for what I might be qualified for, and what I might do to become better qualified.  My ideal situation would be landing an entry-level job as a back-end web dev guy, sooner rather than later, in a warmer state than I currently live in (I'm pretty open on location though).  Obviously I'd love to make about what I make now, or even slightly more if possible.  A little background:  I got a 2.9ish GPA at a nice, but no-name liberal arts school in the midwest about 3 years ago, had a decent summer internship working in PHP, and have held my current position for about a year (I bartended for about 1.5 years after I graduated for various reasons).  I like tinkering with programming in my free time, but most of my hobbies are time-consuming physical activities, so I'm not consistent with it and I don't have any great side projects to show off or anything.  

Am I in an OK spot to make a move into a more programming-heavy role?  If not, what would your advice be to get there? "

I want to get help--I really want to kill myself, but I don't want to hurt my friends and family, so I thought I'd try to get help first and see how it goes. I know it can take time and I'm willing to give it that. Anyways I really can't do it this month; my sister's birthday is the 30th and I've got things to do this week. (tl;dr at the bottom)

(too much) Background info:
I think I might have some kind of minor form of depression, and have for like the last three or four years. First time I seriously thought about suicide was three years ago... back then I didn't want to go through with it, it was more like a solution to a specific problem than anything else--I realized I was losing my religion and that I wasn't going to be able to stop it, but still fully believed in it and heaven/hell. Thought if I died then, I would still make it to heaven. Not catholic, suicide isn't an unforgivable sin. Seemed like a good solution at the time but I didn't actually want to die. Had no idea how to do it or what methods were most effective.

That may have been the start of my ""depression"" (I'm not a terribly big believer in self-diagnosis). At least, that was the worst of it--for a few months I cut off contact with all my online friends and just laid in bed for hours, feeling like shit every day. Didn't get much sleep. Still didn't want to die back then. I got to feeling a bit better--still had mild symptoms of depression, but I regained capability to have a social life and function as a human being after I finally accepted that I was an atheist. I haven't really lost it since then. I still feel sort of empty. Not sure if it's depression or because of the fundamentalist way I was raised, where we were taught that good abstract things (morality, meaning, etc.) could not be had without religion. 

First time I actually wanted to die--there's sort of a difference between thinking about killing yourself and preferring death over life, even if you were guaranteed that you would get better--was like a year and a half ago, and about a year ago I did a ton of research and settled on a method. Gun, easy, my father has one. I'd drive like an hour or two north and find some quiet spot in the woods and get drunk and do it. Started writing sort of an elaborate suicide note/dumb manifesto (I'm a sort-of nihilist now, in terms of my belief about the nature of the universe, but let myself care about things/people anyways bc why not?) but gave up after a while and thought I'm just going to do it. Wrote briefer notes to various people. Got to the note for my best friend and realized how much it would hurt him (he has anxiety). Ended up freaking out about it and couldn't go through with it. That was last summer. A week later I told him, which was stupid, because he has anxiety. But anyways, it helped me realize that the people I love wouldn't be better off without me. The unfortunate thing is that it doesn't make me want to die any less, but I've held out, and every time since that I've gotten serious about doing it in an immediate sense thinking about him stopped me.

Still in a lot of distress. Feel sort of empty most of the time, but varying from daily to weekly I have these moments where I sort of panic/feel paralyzed because of how much I'd really, really like to kill myself &amp; feeling trapped because I can't. Every time I have an even minor problem the thought pops into my head that if I'd just done myself in the first time three years ago, I wouldn't be having this problem. 

Anyways it's not like I feel like shit all the time. Also I'm not sure if I have actual depression--I mean I could; there's a family history--or if this is just sort of an extended existential crisis. But I have an internship I really enjoy and I'm going to prom with the girl I like this Saturday. I still want to die but I don't intend to do so in the near future. I've been thinking about seeing a psychologist for months but I haven't because I was too afraid of hospitalization. Also because I'm really terrified of making phone calls, for some stupid reason, but I got over myself last week and sort of out of the blue decided to call the therapist I've been looking at (I gave my parents a list in like November and she was the one they approved of). My first appointment is Tuesday and I really think I'm not ready. It's very important that I don't get hospitalized--one because I'm not sure what I'd tell my internship, and I really, really don't want to lose it, because the head of the lab I'm working in is collaborating with a lab at the university I want to attend, and I'm hoping it will lead to undergraduate research. Also I don't want to miss prom with the girl. Also because (and this is the biggest reason) absolutely NO ONE in my life knows I'm suicidal except my best friend, and I really, really want to keep it that way. I'm not sure how much I can tell my therapist in terms of my plan/means, etc. To be clear, not getting hospitalized is a higher priority for me than getting better. Also I'm definitely not willing to give up the damn gun. I'm giving this a chance but if things don't get better I don't want to lose my way out.

tl;dr: Seeing a psychologist soon. Have desire, plan, means, but not intent. Have important things this week, and no one knows I'm suicidal--I'm quite high-functioning--so not getting hospitalized is really important to me. How much can I safely tell the psychologist? Is it enough that I'm not intending to do it (at least this month) or should I leave out the means, plan, etc.? Not willing to give up the means but I can pretend I am I suppose."
823b7k,2,2018-03-04,Recently accepted to Cal Poly SLO (CompE) and UCI (CompE),CaliCSEngineer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/823b7k/recently_accepted_to_cal_poly_slo_compe_and_uci/,"Hello, I'm currently a high school senior that has to make a big decision on which college to attend (UCI or Cal Poly SLO). I'm not sure what I am interested in currently, however, I know that I want to do something related to programming or maybe hardware. I was recently given the option to attend Cal Poly SLO or UCI for CompE, and I'm not sure which college is the best to attend for CS or CpE, and I might major change to CS. How is the reputation for UCI or Cal Poly SLO in the job market? How hard is it to obtain internships in my 3rd-4th year? 

Pros of Cal Poly SLO:

-I can easily switch into CS, because I was admitted as a CPE major (same department)

-CpE degree would provide me with experience with half programming and half hardware

-a little bit cheaper by 1k

-learn by doing

-I heard that their CS department is on par with UCSD and UCSB

-4+1 masters degree

Cons of Cal Poly SLO

-200 miles from my house

-not as prestigious as the UCs

-overcrowded classes

-i'm a minority there (asian)

-cost of living? not sure tbh

-middle of nowhere? 

Pros of UCI:

-40 miles away from my house

-CS is respected here

-CS has an entire department dedicated to itself

-more research opportunities available (I'm not sure how important this is for a CS major. Can someone please comment if it is? Thanks) 

-more asians? haha

-better chance of getting into graduate school (uh, do I need to as a CS/CpE major?)

Cons of UCI:

-CS and CpE are in two different schools, so it would be difficult (but not impossible) for me to transfer from CpE&gt;CS. Also, the courses that I'm required to take is highly impacted (filled within minutes, but I only need two courses ICS 31 &amp; 32)

-CpE will barely provide me with coding experience (only 6 classes on programming for my major)

-Classes are crowded

8240xt,90,2018-03-05,My phone interview method,Zetice,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/8240xt/my_phone_interview_method/,"This is my phone interview prep and procedure method.

I’ve been using this method for last 4 phone interviews I’ve had, and I’ve been called in for an in-person interviews for each of those positions (these positions aren’t even local). So I believe my method works to some degree and would like to share it with you guys. 

You might think it’s a lot of work, but they wont just give that job you applied for to anybody, just like they wont just give an engineering degree to anyone, your hard work isn’t finished until you secure a position. 


I will use my resume’s layout as a reference:
2 previous internships, 
1 student research position, 
3 projects 



---------------------------------------------Phone Interview-------------------------------------------------



You need to prepare for this, especially if you get nervous easily. Schedule it for a time when you will be alone and have access to your laptop/desktop/tablet…etc


Before the interview starts, I usually have 3 documents in front of me.
1)	My resume printed (it will be easier to talk about your resume if you have it in front of you. I use a paper version)
2)	A pdf version of the job description.
3)	An interview prep document (This document has questions I expect them to ask me, along with how I would answer them, as if I were having a conversation. The document is formatted in the way that interview usually always go)



When you start the interview, you will either be asked to say a bit about yourself or they will ask you about a specific thing on your resume.
If they ask you to tell them a bit about yourself, I usually with my professional areas of interests as it relates to the job, I then give a brief overview of what I did at my two previews internships and research position. I just reiterate what is already on the resume, but in a conversational manner. Do NOT go into fine details. Your reply should be short and sweet. If they want to know more, THEY will ask you specific questions.  When you are replying, make sure you mention responsibilities from your previous job that make you qualified for this current job you are interviewing for. 

If they start by asking you questions about a specific item on your resume, simply answer the question thoroughly. Don’t lie, or make up anything.

Make sure you are respectful and don’t talk over the interviewer. 

At some point in the interview, they will ask you if you have any question for them..YES, YOU DO.. Saying no is one of the dumbest thing you can do. If you are like me and can’t think of questions on the spot, I usually write questions in my interview prep document before the interview.. You can usually recycle these questions for multiple positions if they are similar.


After the interview, I usually send a thank you email, thanking them for their time in interviewing me, and why I am thankful (how did the interview benefit you?). I also let them know that I am very interested in the position. 


I do not know how effective thank you email are, the one time I forgot to send one, I still got the offer for an in-person interview, the times I’ve wrote them, I got back positive replies, so you interpret it how you want to, I will always send them….


I should elaborate on the interview prep document. All it is, is a document that helps me organize parts of the interview.  It is broken down like so:


1.	Questions usually asked at the beginning of interviews and how I should answer them.
        Ex: what made you interested in company X?, 
        Ex2: Tell me about you…., 
        Ex3: Do you anything about company X?, 
        Etc…
2.	[This is the part where you talk about the resume…Practice this part. ]
3.	Question I have for the interviewer.


As you can see, some of these require you to do research about the company and the position, so do it. 


I create these documents for each unique position, if the companies are different. But again, the questions can often be recycled between documents..


Hopefully this method helps others, It has been working well for me. I never deviate from it.

So I've been looking into becoming a programmer  but don't really have a guide to what careers or field I want to focus on. I crave the systematic, logical approach of IT but also want to be creative. If someone could please offer me some suggestions of what fields I should focus on/get into.

So I have a couple of pathways: I'm attending an two day intro class via a boot camp where they teach you the basics of HTML, CSS and Java. 

Then I have a choice of either:
1) I've been accepted into a graduate diploma of IT in the second half of 2018. I will try to change this application into a CS grad diploma instead. If I am unable to change it,c an I move into a CS masters with a IT grad diploma? (Mainly to get a better GPA, cancer didn't help my undergrad and no one gives a shit).

2) Apply for a 25 week boot camp program that includes a internship and a Diploma of IT qualification (if my academic performance is strong).

While I am interested in programming, I am worried that about my severely restricted motor functions of my left hand/wrist. Even if I was to finish a higher qualification, I doubt anyone would even employee me?

Any advice would be appreciated.

8257fg,1,2018-03-05,Is it worth it for me to switch into being a CS major from a minor?,anothercsthrowaway26,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8257fg/is_it_worth_it_for_me_to_switch_into_being_a_cs/,"So, I'm currently a university student graduating in Fall 2019 with a major in CIT and a minor in CS. Both programs are ranked quite highly at my university. I ended up choosing to major in CIT due to the diversity of topics I would/am learning (I'm really interested in my Systems Design + cybersecurity courses for example), the more practical nature of the courses vs. CS's more theoretical side, and I'm interested in being a project manager one day and I believe the skills from the curriculum will help me achieve that.
That being said, I've always been very interested in programming and have always done so as a hobby. I have taken/will be taking a good amount of programming classes in my major and am taking the CS minor for this very reason (even though I enjoy the practical approach of my major, I do see the immense benefit of CS's conceptual view). I've done really well in my programming-related courses for my major + my CS courses and have thoroughly enjoyed them (just finished my DS&amp;A course for CS).  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
  

One thing that kind of made me question my decision was one of my friends, a CS student, told me I should just switch into CS. He says that it will be better for getting a career in software development than what I am currently doing, I can learn everything I would learn/do from my major as a CS major, and doing a minor in CS isn’t going to be sufficient for when I graduate and look for a job.  
&amp;nbsp;




I do see his side of things, however I believe moving into CS will push my graduation back a semester or possibly more, which would mean more money spent (I’m already paying a lot to go here). I have lots of mildly to very interesting side projects and two software engineering internships with two well known companies (not primarily software/tech based ones though) and hopefully will have a third next summer.  
&amp;nbsp;




Would it be worth to spend the extra money and time to be a CS major in my position or will I be fine in my internship/job hunt with my current situation?

Everyone I ask for advice tells me: ""just go with what your heart tells you!"" or ""just do what you want!"" but neither is helping so some guidance/stories are much appreciated.

So, I've been coding since high school and have loved it from day 1. I am completely obsessed with computers, the hardware, the software, the theory, the application: pretty much everything. Last semester I started doing research in the business department of my school as a part time job to pay for groceries. My capacity is essentially getting data and processing it (through web APIs and of course statistical analysis). Also I sit in on meetings and give my 2  cents about the course of the research, so I'm more than just a technician.

My research professor mentioned he has connections in higher education (obviously) and would write me a glowing letter of rec since he thinks I have an aptitude for research. So I've been doing some soul searching for the past month or so, trying to decide whether it'd be good for me. I love learning about new things, but the research I'm doing now isn't particularly thrilling to me BUT thats because it's business oriented. Who knows if I'd like CS research.

I have a very good internship lined up for this summer at a company that pays well and seems to have a great atmosphere, and it seems they hire most interns after college.

So, I'm not sure whether to go for a PhD. and see if I like it, go straight into industry, or maybe go into industry for a year and then go back? I'm just very torn between the two and it has been stressing me out big time. If any PhD. students or grads can give their 2 cents on the experience and what they would consider being in my shoes I'd very much appreciate any feedback!

EDIT: Reworded ""could write my ticket to any PhD. program"" to ""would write a glowing letter of rec"", definitely worded too strong originally lol. Also thanks for all the helpful feedback everyone, definitely some good advice/anecdotes to brood on."

Lord Kli/ Ik read the daily newspaper, looking at the financial section as he ate his breakfast (some dried meat which had been marinated in fish sauce, topped with some berries). The economy was doing excellently, although the Ik Corporation was still recovering after that scandal involving his son. People were hesitant to invest in a conglomerate ran by someone whose heir was associated with tomfoolery (one of the sins on the lowest tier of how the [church] ranked them, but one of the most inappropriate for a gentleman of his station – at least murder was done in private!). The fact that the boy had disappeared without a word was the talk of the town for several weeks, and Kli/’s reputation had taken quite the blow.

He flipped through the newspaper, going to the opinion pieces to—oh, someone had written *another* article about him and his son. Well, that was understandable—

&gt;'Was Toh/ Ik: the victim of a crime most foul?'

The man’s eyes widened at the title. “Goodness! What is this?”

“Balderdash...” He began to read it. Whoever wrote the thing was claiming that there was a *possibility* that Toh/ may have been killed, and that it wouldn’t have been out of the question for someone close to him to have done it in order to cover up a dishonourable act. “Balderdash and poppycock!”

“Sir?” A footman just outside the circular doorway entrance popped his head inside. “Is everything alright?”

“My honour has been sullied!” The man angrily slammed down the newspaper – well, were it possible to do that. He attempted to slam it down, but it simply fell gracefully onto his desk, slipping off the sleek wooden surface and falling apart on the floor. “Sullied greatly! I must challenge this...” he stomped around to the other side of the desk to the fallen article, locating the article to find the journalist’s name. “This... Rok-pa person to a duel!” There was no way to tell if the person in question was a man or a woman: you couldn’t tell just from someone’s name, after all.

He hadn’t had a duel in years! He’d have to get some practice in before sending the invitation, just to make sure he was still able to aim properly. 

“Forgive me if I am speaking out of turn, sir,” the servant bowed his head slightly as he entered, not wanting to look impudent, “but your family already misses your beloved son, and may not be in favour if you risking your life. Perhaps you should choose a proxy to act on your behalf?”

“An interesting idea.” Normally he would have someone of his station beaten for giving him life advice, but the boy was a favourite of Kli/’s. “Thank you for volunteering, Tro;k!”

The footman looked at the other man with wide eyes, giving his wings a few alarmed, involuntary flaps. “Forgive me, my lord, but I didn’t mean to suggest—“

“We’ll start your pistol training immediately.” The aristocrat clapped his two hand-feet together, summoning a chamber maid to clean up the newspaper. “Let us go to the grounds, post haste! I’ll have the [page boy] bring out some pistols and an appropriately large amount of ammunition for you to sharpen your skills.”

*Meanwhile, on Earth...*

Zhang sat down in the diner, trying to pretend that he didn’t notice the looks he was getting. He was sure the stares weren’t ones of animosity, but rather of curiosity. After all, it was a small town in the heart of Texas, and the residents probably weren’t used to seeing people who weren’t white or Hispanic.  He was on a stool at the counter, and had entered at a time the restaurant wasn’t too busy. 

The waitress gave him a friendly (if mildly forced looking) smile as she handed him a menu. “Thank you,” he said while giving her a much more natural looking smile. “This is such a lovely place.” He looked around, playing up the ‘tourist on a roadtrip’ aspect of his cover. “We don’t have diners like this in China.”

She seemed to get much more friendly at his words, relaxing somewhat. “Well thank you. I’d recommend the chicken-fried steak with a side of biscuits and gravy if you want the real Texan experience.”

Was it chicken? Or steak? And why did Americans call scones [cookies]? He was thankful he brushed up on the peculiarities of American English on the flight over. He decided not to ask what sort of meat it was to avoid offending her, and simply smiled and said “that sounds wonderful, thank you.”

Sarah Wilson’s father would be in there any minute. He and his colleagues frequented the location for lunch on Fridays. Once that happened, all Zhang would have to do is—

Someone sat on the stool right next to him. This was quite odd, considering there were plenty of other spaces available at other parts of the diner’s counter, and several booths available. At first Zhang assumed that it was a local would try to intimidate him, some xenophobe who didn’t like his looks or accent. 

Then, he got a better look at the man. Physically imposing and in shape, with clothes that fit him just a bit too well. He wasn’t an average Joe – it wasn’t just obvious from the nice looking clothes or fifty dollar haircut, but his posture as well. 

“I’ll have a burger and fries with a glass of Coke,” he said to the waitress. He didn’t have a Texan accent.

Well, shit.

Zhang got up to leave, but the man next to him casually opened the side of his jacket, revealing a holstered weapon. “Siddown,” he said in a quick whisper. “You and I, mister Zhang, are going to enjoy our meals separately.” He was leaning forwards, propping his head up with his hand and casually concealing his mouth with his hands so that his words were muffled and no one else would be the wiser. “I will eat and leave before you. You will finish your meal, pay, and meet me across the street in the parking lot.”

Double shit.

He supposed he *could* get up and leave. It wasn’t as if he was going to shoot him dead right then and there, in a diner about to experience the lunch rush. But, it would escalate things.

“Interpol?” whispered Zhang.

The man grimaced, as if insulted. “FBI.”

“I’m here as a tourist.”

“Bullshit.” 

The influx of diners coming in overshadowed the volume of the men’s voices, letting them speak to each other with relative impunity. 

That must’ve been Mister Wilson and his colleagues coming in to order delicious, artery-clogging cuisine, which they would take bites of between talking business and sports. The fact that they prayed before eating helped confirmed it was them.  He was going to miss out on gathering intel.

“You’re here,” said the American government agent, “as part of something so covert that your own agency doesn’t have any info on it.”

So, that explained it. Those Cold War style in the field confrontations didn’t happen anymore, which is why Zhang had been caught so off-guard. Normally they would’ve simply detained him at the airport when he first landed if they thought anything was up. The man was going to try to get information out of him because what he knew wasn’t encoded anywhere: there may have been data breaches at the databases at Zhang’s level of clearance, but the fact that it was all tacit data (that is, information existing solely in an individual’s mind) rather than explicit (something encoded, either on-paper or electronically) meant that the U.S. needed to ring him in under unofficial terms. No formal detainment at the airport, but a confrontation in a backwater town's diner where if a fella got in a scuffle with some foreigner not much would be said. 

“I’m on vacation.”

“Driving from Corpus Christi to New Orleans, making a little detour in some rinky-dink town? You expect me to believe that?”

“I wanted to experience small town Americana.”

“We’ll see about that.” His tone was weighty, as if he was trying to be menacing. But were his implied threats empty?

Zhang realized he was in no real danger. The Cold War was over, and torturing a Chinese spy in any way would never be tolerated... they’d probably just detain him somewhere covert and unofficial and demand information. That wasn’t especially a problem since Zhang still *had no information*. Well, probably nothing more than what the Americans had. 

“Are you new at this?” asked Zhang, his voice returning to its normal smooth-sounding, amicable treble once the shock of being approached by a field agent wore off. “You seem young. I’m sort of insulted that the FBI didn’t send someone with a bit more experience.” He couldn’t help but get a bit of pleasure from the look on the other agent’s face, at him no longer being in control. “Guess the agents who fought the commies are too old to see any action, and the ones in their thirties and forties specialize in counter-terrorism instead of proper espionage. They chose you because you speak and read Mandarin, am I right?  You’re what, twenty-six? Twenty-seven?”

“None of your goddamn busin—“ He shut his mouth when the waitress approached, putting his burger and fries in front of him. “This looks great, ma’am. Thank you.” 

The Chinese agent nodded as the woman set down his meal in front of him. “Thanks.” Zhang eyed the chicken-fried steak in front of him. It looked like schnitzel. Once the waitress went to check on another table, he whispered to the FBI agent.  “I have no idea what I ordered. Is it chicken, or is it steak?”

The American agent gave him an angry look, barely controlled rage bubbling under the surface. It was definitely his first proper field mission, and it wasn’t going like he thought. “But you don’t know, do you?” asked Zhang. “Where are you from, Boston? Philadelphia?” The man cut off a piece of meat, beginning to eat his meal. “Ah, I’ve solved the mystery! This is dog meat.” He smirked at the other man. “Sweet, juicy dog meat.”

(He knew it was beef seasoned to taste like fried chicken upon cutting a piece off --- he just wanted to see the other man’s expression.)

*On The Sanctum of Everlasting Diplomacy...*

Kra watched them from a distance. Watched them being all *happy* and *frolicking* and making jokes. It wasn’t fair! Why couldn’t it be her at Elijah’s side instead of Sarah!? She would give anything to have that again. They hadn’t even gone swimming together since before the battle on Ninsara II, and she feared that they’d grow apart.

On the rare instances when they were together and alone she could pretend that things were back to how they used to be, but then he would bring up *her* and...

“Being The Aquatic Maiden is suffering.”

Kra turned towards the Ke Tee man, her scales flickering orange in annoyance. “What’s that supposed to mean!?”

Toh/ bobbed back and forth in a movement equivalent to a shrug. “I’m not sure, really! It just sounded poetic.”

“Well I don’t appreciate it.” She looked back towards the couple in the distance, longingly. They were walking beneath a sculpture in the neutral section of the ring, far enough away that the bend of the space station meant she could look up at them somewhat.

“Perhaps you should just let it go?”

“Let what go? My feelings for him?”

“Your feelings for a man who doesn’t return them? Yes! Absolving yourself of some things would be for the best.”

“He likes me too, though.”  She could tell that he did. He treated her differently than he treated other female friends, like Xiuying and Isabella. “I... I think he doesn’t return my feelings because we’re from different worlds.” How silly was that? ZidChaMa were the xenophobes of the universe, and yet *he* was the one not accepting her because of her species.

“Well that’s apt, isn’t it? Birds of a feather flock together!” He gave a little wing flap as he gesticulated, but the play on words was totally lost on them both, considering they weren’t speaking English. 

“You don’t think people should date across species lines?”

Toh/ gave a snort-like chortle. “Madame, listen to the ridiculousness of that question! What if someone asked you that same question before you were brought to this vessel, hmm?”

“That’s different! That was before I knew there was intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy. If you phrased it as ‘you don’t think people should date aliens...’” she trailed off. To her, before uplift started, she would have given that question a resounding “yes.” While she was more open-minded than other ZidChaMa, the idea of dating someone from a different culture, never mind a different species, would have been repugnant.

Toh/ took her silence as a sign she was on the same page as him. “You see? People shouldn’t stray outside of the lines they were born into.”

The woman was about to bring up the subject of Toh/’s former marriage, to someone of a totally different culture, but decided not to. She didn’t want to reopen any wounds.

“Are most Ke Tee in agreement with that idea?”

“But of course! In fact, I’m sure anti-miscegenation laws we have in The Empire already cover such infractions.”

The whole concept of laws such as those were alien to her. On ZraDraub it was about religion, not phenotype. One’s race was a non-issue as long as they were the same religion as someone else, which seemed downright progressive compared to how things were in the Empire of Enlightenment on Planet Ke Tee. 

“His species is a non-issue to me, and that’s that.” The girl gave a melancholy exhalation of air. “I don’t think I’ll ever stop adoring him, Toh/. He’s my first love.”

*Back on Earth...*

Zhang left the diner and met with the American agent, who, after repeatedly being asked his name, finally mumbled ‘Rick’, although that was probably just an alias. 

The FBI agent silently lead the man down a few streets, and then into a parked camper. Both their covers were tourists, then. He’d probably been following him for ages, on a similar road trip. “Are the FBI using RVs now?” He asked, chipper. “I suppose the white van thing is just a cliché at this point—“ He was cut off when the American man punched him in the gut.

What was that!? Didn’t he know this wasn’t a Hollywood action film? Things simply weren’t done that way!

“Are you *trying* to start an international incident!?” He wheezed slightly, the wind knocked out of him. 
The other man responded in Mandarin spoken in an American English accent. “What do you know about the anomalous radiation signatures!?” The man’s posture indicated he was ready to land another blow if need be. Zhang, for his part, stood there stoically, not afraid at all. The Chinese agent’s body language was as confident as ever, and he knew that it only made Rick even more annoyed after the fifty minutes they’d just spent with Zhang shit-talking to him in the middle of a crowded diner. 

“Just that they’re linked to the disappearances of undergraduate students from around the globe.” He wasn’t technically on a mission, according to his organization’s bureaucracy, and that information wasn’t classified at any level. So, he was more than able to admit that.

“You’re lying.” He made a motion as if about to slam Zhang’s head into the faux laminated wood interior of the RV, but then looked as if he'd decided against it.

Did he think he was fucking Batman? What was this? Zhang made a mental note to write a strongly worded letter to the FBI upon getting back to China. “I’m not lying. Hey, Jason Bourne, did you consider *asking* before hitting me?” He felt his years of character acting training temporarily wane, his true (admittedly quite snarky) personality shining through. “Because I would’ve told you that in exchange for what you know. None of that was confidential.”

“... What?”

“What do you mean ‘what’? Are you an intern? Oh god, the FBI sent an intern after me. I’m insulted.” He leaned against the wall of the RV’s kitchenette. “I’m not here on any official capacity, which is why your cyber espionage division didn’t find anything on our servers.” The other man put down his fists, letting his guard down. “I’m assuming that’s how you found out about this whole thing. I’m here on a personal favour to my boss, to tell you the truth. Let’s get her on the line and figure out a solution, shall we?”

I've been looking to find an internship but seems like most companies are only hiring juniors and seniors. It's now starting to get a bit late in terms of finding internship positions (from where I live anyways) and I would love to work in a professional environment during the summer. I have had one internship last year but honestly, the experience wasn't that great and I didn't have that much programming experience under my belt to make the most of the job. I am just now finishing my data structures and algorithms course and have made a game app using Unity3D as a personal side project with 2 other friends and I'm definitely more prepared to handle and make the most of an internship now. 


&amp;nbsp;


I guess I'm just asking if it's still possible for me to find an internship considering the time and my current college standing right now. I would really love to work in the summer but I guess it would leave me more time to learn about web development during the summer. I've submitted to many places online but I don't hear very often from them and if I do it's usually just a fast rejection lol. 


&amp;nbsp;


Is there still hope for me to get an internship this summer? Or should I just put my efforts aside for next year and just start focusing on other things?

Thanks. I appreciate everyone who reads and helps me out!"
82a80z,13,2018-03-05,3 months into remote web developer internship and feeling useless and confused,totoro_x,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/82a80z/3_months_into_remote_web_developer_internship_and/,"Back in December, I was hired as an intern by a small company that had no web developers inhouse. All their website work was outsourced meaning they had no web developers within the company.

I am self-taught in web development (started learning since end of 2016) where I know the basics of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and some libraries and frameworks. The internship required someone that knew front and backend but they hired me since I showed I was willing to learn. During the interview, there was no techinical questions about the code which makes me believe it was a mistake that they hired me because they don't even know how to interview a web dev?

I work at home and I knew that this would be hard since there was no one within the company that I could ask for help (no developers). My manager knows what he wants but doesn't know how to create it which is where I come in. The problem is I feel like I don't know enough and I haven't actually coded anything for them since starting the job. Just been researching and trying to learn as much as possible from online things. My manager knows this but I don't think he's very happy since it's been 3 months and I'm doing the same.

I've started to learn backend now (since I need to for the job) but I feel like I don't even know enough about the frontend and now I'm starting on the backend side of things!

I'm constantly watching and doing tutorials (my life basically revolves around nothing other than code) which includes weeknights and weekends.

I feel like I'm very slow and my manager will soon notice that I'm probably too inexperienced and won't be of use to the company. I know I'm only an intern but I feel like this internship I'm not learning from anyone as I'm just relying on myself and I'm no expert.

I feel very useless and confused most of the time. Is it normal that I'm feeling this way?"

I lost motivation in the last week of school and flunked my CS final, giving me roughly a B-. Right now, I'm completely unmotivated; I'm taking my next required CS course and I failed the first test (59) and I feel like I'm also going to fail the one I took a few days ago. I've  also been missing crucial homeworks because I've been doing them last minute, unable to meet the deadline. Although I'll gladly take advice on how to stay disciplined and focused on directing my priorities onto school, should I drop this course so that it won't damage my GPA? It makes it worse that it's a tough course, likely still tough the second time around. I also don't want to be left one semester behind; it is a relatively prestigous school and it's already hard finding an internship - I feel as if it will be harder to find an internship -&gt; job while everyone is essentially 'one ahead'.

Also, is it likely that my financial aid could easily be rescinded just because my GPA dropped so much from one class? I'd then assume I won't be able to do poorly on any other classes in my remaining 4 years..

Should I just buckle up and try to ace the remaining 2 tests and homeworks? I'd likely be aiming for a C minimum then, which will still hurt my GPA. "

I recently got a job offer at a very interesting consulting company and after a little bit of 'negotiation' by both parties, my role, the compensation, benefits, etc. have all been decided and I start work next Monday.

However, this will be my first 'proper' job, so to say. I've done a couple of internships during my undergrad but that's about it. 
This leads me to my question : what are some of the things that I can do in order to be an outstanding employee?

In school, I think it's sort of clear as to what exactly you're supposed to do - and I did these things reasonably well, I think - getting decent grades, sports, extra curricular activities and maintaining good relationships with professors and fellow students. 

Other than the relationships part, I don't really know what I can do beside what I am supposed to do (other than the job itself). I mean I've always taken pride in the fact that I've often gone the extra mile in 'fulfilling my duties' in school, and I'd like to continue doing that in the workplace as well. 

Thanks in advance.

I began working at this company about 4 years ago, and they're the main company that I've worked for post-college. I'm confused about how to list transitional/temporary time I've spent between teams on my resume. 

Here's a very quick background of my roles/transitions/titles at this company:


-Began as an hourly intern, had one consistent boss/responsibilities, this lasted 11 months


-Hr then brought me on as a salaried employee once headcount was confirmed for this team. I finally had an official title within the company - let's call it Title A. 


-A year after being salaried, a turnover occurred in my company and a lot of upper management was let go or left. My boss was one of them. 


-I then spent 2 months working with another employee where I gained a lot of new experience that has carried through to what I do now. Still technically had Title A, but none of the responsibilities were the same.


-Interest-wise, it wasn't a great fit, so I reached out to another employee to see if I could work with them instead. I ended up working on projects at a higher level than my Title A implies. I learned a lot of new things with this as well, and had a lot of responsibilities. This lasted 4 months.


-I then transitioned to be temporarily assigned to another team for 6 months (it ended up being 7). Again, much different role than Title A would imply, but my title didn't change during this time.


-After those 7 months, headcount became available for me to officially be a part of that team. My title changed and it kinda makes sense for what I do, but it is more junior than what is comparable to my accomplishments and my responsibilities and the role I play on my team within this industry. 


A friend of mine that works in HR told me that I must only list my official titles that my company's HR has on record. If I were to do what the HR friend said, it would be very confusing to try and list my accomplishments and responsibilities under Title A and New Title because there's such a variety. If I were to leave out the accomplishments from my 'temporary times' on other teams, then I'm leaving out a full year of great experience and accomplishments, which is 1/4th of my experience, a huge chunk.
 


Please let me know what the correct way to go about this is. How do I include this experience? 

Thanks"
82bzx0,3,2018-03-05,How can I adjust my resume to explain my job hopping and employment gaps?,interstellarrr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/82bzx0/how_can_i_adjust_my_resume_to_explain_my_job/,"So, I guess I would preface this by saying I'm 24, unemployed, and I've had a bumpy history of jobs. I attended community college after high school, for about 2 years, before I had a very severe stint with depression that lasted another 2 years until I finally got professional help. I changed dramatically, lost 40 lbs, began a series of good habits, got a gym membership, learned everything about self presentation, etc. Good? Not quite.

* It was difficult getting a job with no work experience so at 22, I took the first job that called back and ended up working for what I thought was a legal marijuana facility (it was not.) I was employed there for almost a year before it was busted. No references there. Gained social skills from this job.

* My second job was at a law firm as a marketing assistant. Very quickly, I found my job to be soul sucking and I somehow landed up with the role of ""networking"" aka flirting with execs and lawyers to get my own boss meetings at fancy bars and hotels. It was uncomfortable and I lasted only 3 months before another partner in the firm realized it was more effective to hire a third party advertising company instead of hiring a single assistant. I was laid off. My boss had offered to leave me good references but because of the uncomfortable role of my job, and solely because I didn't like my boss, I use my coworker at that job as a reference instead. 

I returned to school for a bit while recovering from a break up but found a job working at a starter up restaurant business. 

* My boss for this company saw that I had editing skills, and hired me instead as a graphic designer for their clothing company. I lasted only a month and a half due to the fact that the office was in complete organizational disarray. At one point, the office desktop was freezing and shutting down. I had to completely do a clean out and a defrag which took several hours because it was never done before. I was then chewed out for not having work to show despite my boss sitting a few feet from me and watched me deal with a completely frozen computer. I couldn't deal with the pressure or the constant passive aggressive environment in the office so I left. Also, my boss took a huge offense to me leaving despite me letting her know I was just not fit for the job. I'm certain I don't have a good reference there.

* I finally ended up taking a seasonal retail job (with a chance to stay) but I was let go before I hit the 3 month mark for not being an aggressive enough seller. It was hourly with commission to make more, I was told I didn't have enough of an extroverted sales personality to grab that sale which is true. I'm not sure whether or not I get a good reference from here, mostly because I was struggling with another stint of depression after all that job hopping and stress and it showed. I was told I could reapply next season but that won't really help me now.

So even though I have been working pretty consistently, I don't have a very good job history. I had to self reflect at some point, and I know I tried my best at every job I've taken. I'm also pretty sure I've had sheer bad luck for the last couple of years regarding getting any consistent and stable employment. 

I feel stuck. I'm not even sure what I can do at this point. I know I want to do visual effects/motion graphics/retouching as an career choice actually but school is expensive. I still want to maintain some employment but the responses I've gotten have been slim to none (only got responses to internships that turn out to be unpaid.)

I checked out some schools in this field but the deadlines are still ahead in the Fall '18, and don't start until Spring '19. I guess this is a good time to start to get some portfolio work done. 

In the meanwhile, I have some savings but not enough to rent for more than a month. I'm certain I'll also be homeless soon due to the mental health of my own parents. They've refused professional help so I know I'm soon to be on my own.  

What can I do with my resume in regards to finding employment again? I know it's not my resume itself. I've had friends from different industries and careers look at it and it's presentationally fine... it's more in my job history and my lack of stable employment that's resulting in my lack of call backs. 

TL;DR: I've had episodes of depression that I'm recovering from, as well as some bad luck with jobs that I know will affect my future employment. I've been consistently working, but just not lasting more than a year at most. How can I erase these years? What are my options to get my life back on track? "

* I'm also in graduate school and didn't get any financial aid this semester (because i am only taking 1 'course' which is bullshit because this 1 'course' is a mandatory full time internship and is unpaid). This means I have to work full time at my internship and then come home and work part time at a second job which doesn't matter anyway because I still don't make enough money to really get by.

* I also hate the second job that I have to work.

* I'm exhausted every day. No friends because I have no time for friends right now. Just totally miserable and alone. Not in contact with any family.

* I just feel so hopeless right about now. It feels like i'm running out of options. I feel like I can't drop out of school because I only have a few months left.

* The sad thing is that this will all ratify itself by July or August of this year when I have graduated and am able to get a job (it's easy to get a job in my particularly career because there is a shortage), but I don't know if I can make it that long. 

* It's really funny because you always hear that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and that's very true for me, but it feels like the only solution for me right now.

* I just don't know if I can make it. "

This is internship doesn't have an end date but i'm sure there is a 1 or 2 year limit due to state or federal laws. This job is challenging but I do enjoy it and as an analytics major I've gone through the a number of CS courses but spent most of my time with statistics so jumping into a development role was a switch up.

Today I was offered a BI position over the summer at a larger healthcare company. This position is only for the summer and pays less per hour, however it is more related to my field of study. I was thinking it would also be more beneficial on my grad school application to have working in an analytics position like BI as opposed to app development.

With that said, I'm leaning toward a graduate program in analytics but would also do a CS one as well.

I'm going to try see if I can work it out to do both over the summer and not take any classes but I'm not sure how realistic that is.

What do you guys think?"

I graduated from a good university with a degree in computer science recently with a 3.55 GPA, and graded for an algorithm analysis class.  However, I never did an internship and haven't done much since graduating last year in June.  I have a little activity on github from a coding project on Hackerrank, but not much.  I live in the Bay Area.  The reasons I never did anything are psychological and are problems that have been recurring in my life, but I'm making progress on changing my behavior (this post is one of them - I wouldn't have made this post a few weeks ago).  I don't believe I'm a bad coder at all, and I'm not bad socially though I can be awkward.

My questions pertain to the following:

1. Should I go for an internship or junior programming position?  I would like something in backend programming but without much experience I can't really be picky.

2. What should I say in regards to the period of inactivity, if they ask?  Should I/how should I address it on my resume?"

I've been browsing of a lot of subs for advice in the realm of IT part-time jobs. 

I want to find a part-time job somewhere in my area, something that will help me get a foot in the door. I don't know what kind of jobs to look for though.

I've heard good and bad about the help desk position. Others have said try finding part time NOC positions, what do I need to know for that?

I would definitely apply for any entry level cybersecurity jobs but I've found maybe one in all my time job searching that would be suitable for me.

My college's tech support position is already filled, and I have applied for some internships but have not received any offers yet.

Are there any other options for me? I'm willing to do any amount of studying if there is a position that is slightly out of reach for me at the moment. I'm also in the process of studying for the 902 which will complete my A+. Any ideas?"

I feel like school hasn't taught me enough and that I'm vastly underprepared.  On top of that, because I had to move before graduating, the last year or so of my education was online, so I didn't have the resources that an on-campus student would have had.

I have a few questions about getting started in the right direction, and this seems like a good place to find answers.  If any of you could help me out, I would appreciate it so much.

This is kind of a long post, so thanks for taking the time to help.

Originally my plan was to get into Cybersecurity, which is why I took the effort to get my Cybersecurity minor.  After spending some time searching for a Cybersecurity job, I realized that there are not really entry level positions in Cybersecurity and that jobs expect me to have related experience first.  I'm starting to transition my goals to work in other fields like programming or network engineering first.

This made me start to miss programming in general and I think I might just be happier with some sort of Software Engineering job anyway.  Programming was my original passion and Cybersecurity was something I discovered later in college.  I'm really conflicted about this and I think it's slowing me down.  Everyone always tells me great things about Cybersecurity and I really did enjoy it in college, but now I'm not as sure.  Maybe someone here with experience in either Cybersecurity or Software Engineering can help me decide what to focus on?

With all of that said, I'm not really sure where to go from here.  I'm reasonably comfortable in Java, since that's what we were taught in school, but I only have a little experience in other languages like C++ and Python.  Should I be spending time learning new languages to broaden my options and look good to employers, or would my time be better spent reviewing more general programming concepts that I'm probably rusty on?  How much information am I expected to know before getting my first job?

Also, is looking for a job straight away my best option?  Should I first spend time looking for internships, getting certifications, or working on personal projects?

Lastly, since I don't have any related experience yet, I want to put as much as I can on my resume.  I had a job at a movie theater in a leadership role that was somewhat tech related.  I was the lead projectionist and I was responsible for managing and training the other projectionists, operating film/digital projectors, and making the film schedule each week for the theater.  Also, I've moderated a relatively large subreddit (about 650,000 subscribers) for about four years now, which has included a lot of teamwork and responsibility.  Would listing either of these on my resume seem ridiculous?  People I have asked told me to include them, but I wanted the perspective of people more familiar with the industry.

I guess what I'm really looking for is what my first steps should be.  I feel like I was so focused on graduating that I didn't really plan for what comes next and now I'm not sure what to do.  I'm thinking about just applying to as many places as I can and seeing what happens, but I don't want to go ahead and do that if more preparation would have been more successful.

I know this seems a little rambly, but I've had all of it on my mind lately and no one to really ask.  Again, thanks so much for any help you can offer.

82en5k,140,2018-03-06,How do I quit my job without burning bridges?,wfhere,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/82en5k/how_do_i_quit_my_job_without_burning_bridges/,"So I have been working with a local small company as an intern (11 people, but was started 10 years ago). Yesterday I was offered a summer internship with another company that I will most likely be accepting today. 

Which means that I will have to give my notice soon before the internship starts. 


I am not sure how to go about it without pissing off the main developer? who should I be telling first him or the company owner? Technically I was hired by the owner, but 95% of my interactions were with the main developer and he is the one who assigns me tasks and tells me what to do. I am worried about this conversation because he seems like the type of person to take things personal and he has being alluding to me for months that he is expecting me to stay with them long term, and my reaction usually was just me laughing it off or just trying to change the topic since I knew that I want to go elsewhere eventually. The company is very small and I was the second person hired in the development team. So I did spend a lot of time with the main developer working and we developed a ""freindship""/close relationship over the span of the last year. 



How do I give my notice without losing my connections with my current job? "

I need your suggestions on the following aspects-

1. Any life pro tips to keep the motivation going, I tend to quit after 10-15 days and especially with increasing workload as semester progresses and grad school applications and internships and all. 

2. Any life pro tips for avoiding unhealthy food?

3. Most important of all, is there any way I can maintain a tracker/journal of sorts which will help me stay motivated by looking at the results- including pictures etc. In the end if possible I could even make a data visualization about it? (I am a CS undergrad and play with data often)

4. Any other tips in general.

5. WAKING UP - Seriously. This is a major concern. With college and other umpteen commitments I can only manage a one hour slot 6-7 am in the morning. And more often than not, I have difficulty waking up in the morning. Any ideas to fix this once and for all?

Need some help regarding my career situation. Some background info:

22M in Canada, in university for Business Degree, has one more year left (8 courses)

Current job: Part time contractor at one of the biggest oil and gas company in Calgary, Canada, making about 50k CAD a year, doing it while in school, I used to intern here and that's why I have this nice gig. I have a lot of coop experiences at big oil companies. Love my coworkers, and my boss, he is the most caring and chill manager I've had so far. I pretty much can stay part time until I graduate and very confident that I will receive a full time offer from this company (already verbally confirmed from my boss) making about 80k CAD right after graduating. The work itself isn't too exciting (IT Application support) but its not demanding at all, I prob only work half of the time and chill for the rest. 

Potentially I have an offer from a startup in San Francisco coming up for this summer, 4-8 months term. They just raised their series A and prob doing their series B this year. I believe in their mission and business model.  I will be helping out with their business team doing project management and operation roles. The pay isn't great, like 15 US a hour. They are looking to double their headcount this year and I do think I have a good chance to stay full time after internship. I always wanted to work at a startup because I believe I can learn a lot there vs at a big company since they will be growing really fast. And I love SF as a city, so much more things to do than Calgary. 

My problem: SF is a really expensive city to live in vs where I am now, I am looking at double the cost of living. And 50% pay cut vs what I make now. So every month I am there I will need to put in my own saving while working at that startup. And if I were to leave my corporate job now I doubt I will be able to get it back after. Also there is a chance of full time at the startup which means I wont finish my undergrad degree (1 year left). Talked to my family and friends about it, all of my friends support me to go but my family not so much. They think I should finish school and my job is really good so I should stay at this oil company. But my argument is that if the startup fail I can always come back to school and finish up (you can take 10 years max to finish your degree), and the learning experience/opportunity I will have at that startup is very valuable, I see it as my ticket into the tech industry.

I'm currently business-preference at Michigan State and I have about a year to make my decision as to what I would like to major in. 

I've been reading this subreddit and many other online forums, and I've only heard bad things about going into finance. I've heard mostly about 80+ hour weeks, every single week.

While I do enjoy finance, I like working with numbers, I am not sure if I will be the right fit. Coming from a non-target school, would it be a good choice to get my master's degree right after undergrad? Would it be more helpful to get it in Finance, or could I go along the lines of Information Systems.

Essentially, I'm conflicted as to what exactly I would like to do. I'm worried about having a poor quality of life with my relationships/family/myself. Of course money is a large factor for me, but I would like to be able to enjoy my life.

Due to a family-friend connection, I will be able to have an internship at KPMG. Will this help a lot or should I look elsewhere? 

If anyone has advice as where to start, or has dealt with a situation similar to this, any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I've been at a Financial company for about 5 months now, currently I'm the only and first in-house IT guy for about 60 users. When I first started I was so excited for having my first full time job (before this I only did Co-ops/Payed internships). There were a lot of plans to do a cloud migration to Azure and implementing a lot other cool projects. 

However, I didn't realize all these great projects I'd have no input in them. Everything exciting that I wanted to work on is now being given to our MSP. I've tried to start my own projects like implementing an MDM solution but everything short of new desktop procurement has been denied. I would call myself desktop support now, but I don't even have a ticketing system to workout of but a very rigged CRM. Just recently I now must come in every Saturday for 4 hours, but the kicker is I don't get payed for it. That's because I'm salary and don't get overtime until I'm over 44 hours but I was hired on to work only 40. I basically have less money now because I'm having to commute every Saturday. 

Comparing myself to friends I honestly feel like I'm getting screwed over. I make about 30% less then them with no perks like working from home.
I know I need to get a new position but I’m unsure how long I should stay. I have a few certifications for AWS and been studying to get my MCSE: Cloud Platform. I guess study a lot in my free time and hopefully get something new by the end of the year? I’ve honestly felt like shit for the past 2 weeks. How do I stay motivated, I feel like I’ve been doing the bare minimum to get by. 

Thanks for any input.

TLDR: 
When should I quit

Advice for Moving Forward?,SmartnSad,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/82iku1/lost_in_my_career_path_and_life_in_general_advice/,"Short Story: Rejected a job opportunity, and now I'm not sure how to find a job that fulfills me, or is at least tolerable.

Long story: I'm an employed, recent college grad (BS Public Health). I just had an interview today, for an Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Specialist position at a manufacturing company. It went well, but they were frank about the mess they were in (safety culture-wise), and I got bad vibes, so I contacted the recruiter who originally reached out to me and expressed I wasn't interested.

And I feel IMMENSELY guilty about this. The truth is, I didn't like this kind of work when I did this as an intern, and there WAS a firm safety culture in place. I just don't have the personality to revamp a broken system, when I couldn't tolerate when things were running smoothly.

I have since been promoted to regulatory compliance in my current company, which I don't like much, either (hence my continuing job search). I can feel myself fraying and I want to try something else; I'm ready to move on to the next thing, or quit with nothing lined up (I've been crying at work, and I'm not sure how much longer I will be able to hide it. Being emotionally compromised is putting me behind on projects, and I'm certain the mask I put on is thin).

I have applied to other positions outside my field of work for months with no success. The only interviews I've been able to get are for EHS or regulatory compliance, both of which I already know I don't like, and do not want to invest my career further in.

I continue to interview because any interview experience is good experience, and others tell me to try to do the same position in another company and I might feel differently about it. But the company I work for, while not perfect, isn't the reason I want to leave. The work itself is just so abysmal. Unfortunately, the job market is booming for these kinds of jobs right now (which is partly why I went into it), so I feel depressed that it's not working out. It feels like a long and ugly breakup, and my shitty ex keeps calling, and I keep answering.

I have considered going back to school, but I don't know how I would be able to afford to go back. I would still need to have a job , one that doesn't make me go nuts, while I study.

Have I made a mistake? Part of me knows that I would have hated taking this job. I already played that game and know it's not for me, but at least I would have tried again. At least I would be able to say I got out of my current crumby job.

I'm really at a loss of what to do. There is a creative side of me I want to pursue (I am currently maintaining a blog and collaborating with a local band), but I know I need a steady income while I nurse that metaphorical baby. But coming home upset every night makes that difficult. It puts a strain on my romantic relationship as well.

Any advice you all can throw at me would be greatly appreciated."

I've graduated with a BA degree at 25 but am considering going back to help pivot a career.

I have been a web developer since my senior year in college, in 2007 (about 10 years on and off, mostly LAMP stack, JavaScript and C#) but recently I have been given the cold shoulder generally speaking in terms of jobs. I've been searching for my next full time job since 2015 but only am able to get some short term contracts.

So I want to turn a new leaf and find a better path in life. I'm considering returning to college for a major in computer science.

Why do I need comp sci if I am already doing web development? Because I don't want to do web development anymore. I am interested in learning more low-level programming, and working for a company such as JPL, NASA or Nvidia. Working on code where real-time performance is critical seems to be my main interest. And I heard that co-op programs would be great for someone with some programming knowledge who wants to work at better places, and get paid experience as I study.

With that said, do you recommend going to a university with a good co-op program? And if so, where would you suggest I go for co-ops for a computer science major? 

I live in Chicago if that helps. Don't know of any colleges here that have affiliations with companies that have good paying CS internships, co-ops, preferably ones that offer housing. I have no job right now, so I need some kind of way to maintain a living if I return to college. I have programming experience and would be overqualified for service jobs (and don't want to do that again anyways). "

But my current job doesn't have me doing a whole lot of that kind of thing. I'm in the mood to practice these skills to keep them sharp, and I'm interested in learning about options for developing microcontroller and FPGA applications on my own time.

With that established, what sort of boards should I look into purchasing? I guess I'd like to get one of those boards that comes with both a microcontroller and an FPGA, but I'm not sure how those would end up working. Can the two devices be programmed independently, or would it be the case that, for example, the microcontroller can't be reprogrammed and can only be used to configure the FPGA or something? I'm a little embarrassed to admit that, while I'm decent at embedded design, and *very* good at HDL, I'm not all that experienced at using both together.

Also, I have no idea what sort of project ideas to try out. I'm not interested in simplistic stuff like LED patterns or gathering data from a sensor. I want to do something badass. I've written a simulation model for a computer processor in a class once, and I'm wondering if I can do something like that and implement it in the FPGA, and then develop a simplistic OS. Can I find FPGA boards with chunky quantities of RAM and external storage?

I don't know. What kind of applications would I be capable of developing using a home user's kit?"

I have been pursuing a degree in math, and this past year I picked up computer science, and I absolutely love it. So much so that this is where I want my career to go. My situation is that I am already most of the way through my math degree, with only two semester's worth of classes left to go.

If I were to finish it out, it would take me two years after this semester to finish school, and if I were to drop it and focus on computer science, I can finish within a year, possibly having to take summer and winterm courses.

Looking at it from one way, finishing my math degree means I have two B.S. degrees, which I feel like can look very good to future employers, it would kind of a waste to not finish when I am already this close, and it gives me an extra summer before graduation to get a good internship (since the time has come and gone to get one for this summer seeing as I only just picked up this degree).

Looking at it from the other way, this is an extra year of loans to pay, a year further away from my career, and taking classes that will potentially distract me a lot from the more important ones.

TL;DR; Was it worth it to get a double major with math and computer science, or is my time better spent focusing entirely on my CS degree?"

Previous studio I worked for basically closed. I really liked working with some of the guys there, and we got a gig between ""friends"". So I made the mistake of not demanding a contract. I was provided with a PC to do the job, so I felt some what safe that if anything happened I would at least have the PC.

The guy who organized the gig and is funneling the payments, hasn't payed me in over a month. I was promised I would receive payments but have yet to. I gave notice that I was no longer going to work on the project, and was going to pursue other opportunities. Of course they are demanding for the PC and I made it known that if I received my two remaining payments I would be glad to return it. The PC's value is just a little under the cost of my last two payments. Which is part of why I allowed it to get to this point. But there was some other hardware I asked to be purchased for me earlier on in the project, in exchange for one of my payments. They are demanding that be returned as well.

I am some what concerned that this will likely be escalated on their end, and would like to be prepared by getting some advice now. I am in the state of California in the LA area and would love to get recommendations on lawyers I might be able to contact.

I was backing up the work on a shared google drive, as was made a requirement earlier on. I am suspecting they wanted me to get the project up to a certain point that an intern or some one they could get much cheaper could finish off. From the beginning they were fighting hard to get a lot of the work outsourced to India or elsewhere. But because of how rushed things were in filming, and their complete disregard for advice given from the VFX supervisors on set, even the team in India refused to take on the work.

Unfortunately some how the guy who organized the gig has made himself known within some big industry circles, mostly with large oversea cinema studios. He himself not being from the US, making me feel like he made his money off of shady deals with people from his home country. So this has me a bit concerned."

The internship is for Online Learning Management System (LMS) Tech for a Nonprofit organization. 



It lists that I will be supporting the development of an online learning management system, assist in the creation of website and mobile app framework (and importing data), and branding.



My own research shows that a lot of people say that unpaid internships aren't good because the company or business may be less likely hire you, and statistically graduates with unpaid interns get paid less (I believe).



I've had a difficult time trying to take on school and work, and applying for internships. It seems hard to get any, but I got this one and passed the first interview and they set up an appointment to go meet with a hiring manager for the second interview.




Any thoughts and suggestions? Should I back out of this? Is an unpaid internship better than no internship at all?

82jz1h,1,2018-03-06,Should I stay an unhappy puffin researcher or be temporarily unemployed? (long post),anonymouth42,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/82jz1h/should_i_stay_an_unhappy_puffin_researcher_or_be/,"Posted yesterday from a less-recognizable throwaway but I think it was filtered by automod, apologies if this is a doublepost

**Bold text and bulletpoints are good for skimming** plain text gives the whole range of this decision.

I just graduated college in December and have been faced with a pretty important decision--staying at one of my jobs with a 2-year contract in a role I don't want where the work environment is unhealthy, or losing full employment for a while in a risk-all attempt to find a job I'll like.

Puffin research sounds appealing straight-off, but the circumstances make the offer more bittersweet. I have zero mentorship, my PI degrades me something fierce, and there's constant behind-the-back digs by the head scientists to essentially everyone else in the lab. The role is a very technical one (databases and code) which is a field I have no interest or passion for. In my undergraduate role, I've been coerced into all-nighters, torn apart to the point of tears at lab meetings (afterward ofc, never let them see you cry), and mislead about opportunities available to me. I've worked at this place for 3 years and can't imagine 2 more.

I love marine science. I'm a scuba diver, a nature-lover, and passionate about coral restoration in a way you'd think it's impossible to care about non-charismatic invertebrates. Paying jobs in this field are few and far between, and very competitive. I've applied for maybe 40 in the past 3 months and have only even heard back from 1 (a rejection). Each time I see one of these jobs, though, I'm absolutely giddy, and that excitement is something I want to feel about a job. I see myself as a strong candidate. I've had 3 simultaneous jobs in my time at uni with database, marine policy, GIS, public outreach, stats, and web design/coding experience melded into them. **I don't think I'm hopeless getting a job I'd actually really enjoy.**

The timeline is the hard part. **My current position at the lab ends at the end of the month, and job decisions aren't even beginning to trickle in yet.** I have 2 apps out that could very well be my dream job, but no idea if I'm even being considered. Even so, I expect a pretty constant flow of job openings for the next few months in line with seasonal fieldwork schedules. **If I take the puffin research job, I'll have continuous full-time employment guaranteed, but will be locked into a job I have no passion for for 2 years and be unable to seek out these more appealing offers.**

Extra context:

* Because of holding 3 jobs alongside classes the past few years, I have no student loans and well over 10k in savings. Financially, I'm stable enough to be unstable for a while.
* Seasonal Affective Disorder hit me hard this year and I'm constantly unhappy with my life despite having a v good one living in a dreary place. A new job would bring the opportunity to move to a climate that may mitigate the effects of SAD.
* The puffin job requires fieldwork at an intensity I think would break me. Coworkers I trust the opinion of come back and say they could never do it again. I'm not a brave or particularly hearty soul, and I think this fieldwork may be far too much for me to handle. 
* Time spent in the field is also unpaid and unbenefitted--I become unemployed for 6-8 weeks out of the year in my own personal puffin-filled hell.
* After my lab employment ends, I still have another part-time job guaranteed--though not in my conservation field at all. I could probably increase to 21 hours a week to keep up some sort of income (which would just about cover rent but I would definitely be dipping into savings)

**Questions I'd love advice on:**

* As a recent grad, am I supposed to love my job? Or am I lucky just to be employed even if it's something I hate?
* How long can I put off enjoying my life? Like, I'd love to go do a 3 month dive internship abroad, or Workaway around SE Asia; but even though I can fully fund that kind of endeavor already it terrifies me to give up an opportunity of guaranteed employment to do so, even if that employment is near-guaranteed unhappiness.
* Should I be transparent about my feelings to my PI who is offering me the job? Or should I let her believe that I'm wholly interested in accepting the position? (Mostly concerned with reneging if a dream job comes through a bit too late or if the fieldwork a few months into the job really does break me)
* This one is sappy and I feel bad for even typing it, but can I bank on *learning* to love my life in this job? I love pole dancing and ice cream and chocolate so maybe if I bought a home pole and more Ben &amp; Jerry's I could be happy again working at the lab--but can I rely on that? 

I'm a lucky person in a good place in life and I recognize that. Any life I lead will be a good one objectively. But how much should I prioritize security over happiness? Or happiness over any sort of job security?

**TL;DR- I lose my only part-time job in my field at the end of this month. I have guaranteed employment in a position I don't want, where I'm stressed and degraded and will be trapped for 2 years if I take it. Additionally, 6-8 weeks each year I'll be put through my own personal version of purgatory. BUT it means a solid job as a recent Biology grad, which I'm sure is a miracle in this job market. I have no student loans and enough funds to sustain my current way of life for about a year, and another part-time job to fall back on to cushion the financial blow of losing my current position there if I decline. Do I take the job?**

Production line mangers will be able to view this on a mobile application and view line specs, as well as sign off on orders. I will be using as of now Java, JS, bootstrap, firebase. Might consider .NET as well asMySQL. 

Does this sound like a decent plan?


Also I am at a top 10 public university in the United States.

Any thoughts or advice would be helpful.

Thanks"

I'm an older-ish guy. Not crazy old, but in my early 30s. As far as I know, this is an irrelevant detail because I don't include it in my applications unless absolutely required (I don't recall when this has been the case). I've worked in other fields before, but I went to school to finally get a degree in what I had been hobbying at for a couple decades.

So here I am about to graduate, and I cannot for the life of me get an internship. I don't mean the jobs are unavailable - there are postings everywhere, I'm in a major tech area (that isn't Silicon Valley). I also don't mean that I'm flubbing interviews. I can't even get an interview. I'm just shooting my resume into the void and hearing nothing back but my own echoes as I occasionally send a followup after a couple of weeks.

I have software experience, even before I went to school for it - I completed massive software projects a few years back. I have a near flawless GPA (a single B+ broke my perfect 4.0). I have a fairly varied portfolio of some interesting work. I have a good array of CS skills that I've worked on over the years. And as a last ditch concern, I shopped my resume and cover letters around to a few experienced CS career folks and all of them were impressed.

Yet for the damn life of me, I have only received a single interview, with AT&amp;T, who advanced me to the second-to-last interview, only to boot me out of the selection field because they chose on a ""first-come-first-serve"" basis and ran out of spots.

I'm completely bewildered by this. I have CS friends left and right scoring internships - one of which got with a NASA project *based on his GPA alone* - and despite every box I've checked and rechecked to make sure that I'm a prime candidate, I can't even get a response. It's absolutely maddening, and it's not filling me with confidence for actually getting a *career* after the internship."

I found this 55 hour in depth Java course that I'd like to complete to at least feel more sufficient as a dev in my line of work.

Company A is a 500 employee defense contractor that has offered a 3 month internship in what they call ""a 3 month interview"" leading to a full-time offer dependent on performance. The company has many good reviews and awards online, offers 401K matching, tuition reimbursement for grad school, paid holiday/vacation/sick leave etc. The pay is competitive for an internship and i'm expecting the full-time offer to be competitive as well. The commute to this company is better than company B as well in the morning/evening. 

Company B sells a software product and has around 2500 employees. This company is off the bat offering a full-time with a competitive salary. They have 401K matching, Paid Time Off/Sick leave, Gym Discounts &amp; Pet Insurance but no tuition reimbursement for grad school. The company does not have great reviews like company A, the reviews aren't terrible however (average).

82om7t,7,2018-03-07,Quitting finance for tech? How can I make it? I am lost (French),Deltaa1995,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/82om7t/quitting_finance_for_tech_how_can_i_make_it_i_am/,"Hello everyone,

let me introduce myself first. So I am french, 22 yo and I graduated with a 3-year BSc in International Business (according to WES my US GPA is 3.1/4 but I still have to confirm that information). My GPA is low because I was in the military reserve for almost 3 years and I also started my own business at the age of 17 to finance my ug degree (debt free now). 

My initial plan was to work in investment banking for few years before to start my business. I did my undergrad in a non-target school and I am currently doing my internship in a small M&amp;A boutique in Pairs. I was planning to ice the GMAT score + leverage that investment bank internship in order to get into a tier-1 MSc in Finance (perhaps schools like UCL, IE, RSM...) and try to be a good in London later on.

Why banking ? Because I am an entrepreneur and I always had a lack of discipline and I wanted to work in M&amp;A for maximum 3 years before to start my own business. I thought (and still belive) that a banking experience is going to bring me credibility to launch my venture and also soft skills such as work ethic.

However, my internship is almost over and I am not happy in that industry. First of all, the work seems to be changeling but at the analyst level it's very boring. Plus, I don't think I can apply what I am learning in the real business world since 90% of my time is spent on either PowerPoint or Excel.

But, I made that decision where I was almost at the end of GMAT Prep, already registered for the TOEFL and few applications open for a MSc in Finance. 

I am not ready to start my own business right now since I have no idea and I would like to spend 2 or 3 years to learn CS since I think it's a extremely useful skill. I also went to a coding bootcamp in December and I really enjoyed it. 

My problem is : In France you need to hold a undergrad in CS in order to get accepted to a MS in CS. The only one option left is 42 (top coding school in France but coding is different from CS). But I always wanted to moved to the US or Canada.

It seems that it's easier in the US and the UK as a non CS student. I already contacted few universities:
- Northeastern (Align MS in Computer Science) : I don't need any GMAT or GRE score only a TOEFL &gt;100 and a GPA &gt;3. However, they told me it's better if I already took calculus I during my ug. https://align.ccis.northeastern.edu
- UPenn : They don't accept the GMAT, I need the GRE
- NYU : They don't accept the GMAT, I need the GRE
- UCL (UK) : I don't need any GMAT or GRE score only a TOEFL &gt;100 and a GPA &gt;3.5 --&gt; My GPA is too low for that school, I don't know if I can still apply or it's a waste of time?

I have a lot of red flags in my application for any of these schools : mediocre GPA, no quant classes, no GRE score...

I was thinking to quit my internship this week, cancel my GMAT and just study a lot for the GRE. I also had the idea to take few online classes such as calculus, try to get an A and put the transcript in my application. 

But right now, I am kind of lost, I don't know where I can apply and what strategy to use. There is only few schools who are offering CS programs for non CS majors...

I'm a 24 year old Belgian citizen who is hoping to get some advice from all you Danes out here.
As the title says, I'm considering heading over to Denmark so I can do an AP degree in either CS or IT technology.
I know I can do the same thing in Belgium but I just don't see myself stay in Belgium for the rest of my life and after a lot of extended traveling and research I have decided that Denmark is the place I want to be, and getting an education in the country you want to move to seems like a perfect way to kick things off.
I'll have a budget of approx 186,000 DKK (25k euros) which I hope will be enough to cover the costs for two years. Regardless of that I'd like to not be fully reliant on my savings so I was wondering what the possibilities are of finding any work as an English speaker? Obviously I will try to learn Danish as well as I can but it will probably take a while before I can speak it at a working level. Also I saw that these AP courses come with a 4 month internship during the 4th semester, do interns get payed in Denmark and if so how much can be expected? Also how hard will it be for me to find an internship at a Danish company as a foreigner who (hopefully by then) speaks some Danish?
Now my biggest concern is if I will be admitted, I have found 5 different schools who offer courses I like in English but I have no idea how competitive they are to get into. I will probably end up applying to all of them. I have an upper secondary school diploma that grants me access to higher education in Belgium but my grades have always been low and I got held back one year. I'm considering doing an A level in math through the British consulate where I currently live in Guangzhou (China) to improve my chances of getting in. Any advice on how I can improve my chances would be greatly appreciated! (I'm hoping to start in the Fall of 2019 btw, so I still have some time to prepare.)
Now as a final thought, say I successfully complete the degree and internship and I learn how to speak Danish somewhat proficiently, can this realistically lead to finding a decent job and permanent residence in Denmark or would I struggle?
Sorry for this long and slightly incoherent rant, I guess I'm just looking for some advice and a possible reality check. I know that a lot of what I'm asking can be found on Google and I have already done plenty of online research but it is always great to hear what the locals think and that is what makes this sub so awesome.
Thanks everyone, have a great day!"

I'm responsible for minor C# development (not super enjoyable), SQL query development (good at it but it gets monotonous), SSRS reporting (see SQL), data analysis for upper management (pretty enjoyable), project management (no certification but they've offered to pay for classes), and really anything else that needs to be done.

First time poster &amp; on mobile (double whammy), so sorry about any mistakes :)

SOME BACKGROUND:

I am a 22 y.o. in San Diego, California that is trying to balance a work/study life. I'm taking some classes at the local Comunity College right now. I quit my first big office internship back in October 2017 for morale reasons - it was a really toxic environment. They treated their employees like animals, worked us waaaay too hard, and pulled a huge stunt at the end that caused both me and multiple employees that worked there for 10+ years leave. After that, I never wanted to work for a company that is outwardly hostile to their employees. Corporate is corporate, I get that, but they were actual trash.

Flash-forward to the end of January 2018, when I applied for a temp (4-5 weeks) Data Entry position at a small start-up. I got the job easily, which was a relief. It seemed awesome at first - I was doing taxes and data entry stuff. They had me do overtime my first day, which they said I would get paid for but walked that back the next week. Understandable - I'm a contractor, that's how it goes.

After the first week, things got a little odd. They had me put everything on hold to set up the company VoIP system - something that IT should definitely be taking care of. But I did it, took about 70% of my working time over a month to get this sucker set up (whole lot of issues with the VoIP company). Now, not even 2 weeks after I got everything set up, the CEO decides to drop everything and move to another VoIP system. Once again, understandable, but really frustrating as I feel like a lot of my time was wasted.

Now I'm working on more data entry projects but they keep throwing things my way that take up my time, so I can never finish what I start because ""this is more important"" but then I'll get scolded for not finishing what the CEO marked as lower priority.

DRAMA-RAMA:

The CEO is a nasty individual. She's petty, rude, snarky, and just plain mean. She hired 2 new girls, about my age, and ended up firing one &amp; harassing the other until she quit. Both within the week. One ""didn't fit what she wanted."" Ok. Whatever. I get that.

The other girl, hired as an EA, is another story. She quit her job bc the CEO told her she was hired. Then, once she got here for her first day, the CEO switches the deal with her and says she's on a 4-week trial period, then a 2-week trial. I start training her, setting up her computer and phone, get her familiar with what I know. I ended up with the flu, so I on my experienced a half-day of the shit that went down.

Essentially, the CEO just degraded her new EA every day. While she was learning how to manage CEO's calendar, she was told that she couldn't handle it again and again. During a meeting with our recruiter, the CEO asked how the ""on-going search for her new EA"" was going, while the newly hired EA was right there. A lot more mean things were said during the meeting (and not constructive criticism), causing the EA to break down after the meeting. How she was treated was mainly what led her to quit 2 days later.

So all that happened while the CEO was managing to also treat our Office Manager/her Personal Assistant like crap. It can all be summed up as what happened above but more passive aggressively. Basically, as stated above, CEO is cruel af.

WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS/TLDR:

I am still finishing up projects that have been stalled by other projects that I've been assigned and have finished my official contracted time with the company. The CEO makes day-to-day work life unbearable &amp; there is a constant stream of emails/texts outside of work hours that impede on my personal study time. I want to quit as soon as I can. I have an interview for another job on Friday (that pays $1 more an hour!) that is in a career path I'd like to check out. I'm just not sure how to handle this as I am a first-time temp/contact employee. 

Edit #1: I get paid a livable wage ($14/hour) but less than I did at my internship :)

Thanks All! Please let me know if I missed anything in the details :)"

As a result, it's really difficult when I do try and talk to people because not only am I awkward, I also struggle with talking about myself. I try to lie to cover my shitty childhood, but am not really good at it. If I try to speak vaguely on the other hand, people usually probe. 

Here's the sauce:

Abusive religious family that homeschooled me to enforce there perceptions of the world up until high school where I went to an all girls public  school. Worked hard to get good grades though in order to escape, and got full ride for uni freshman year, but fell into depression soon after. Uni was less about passion and more about escape; I had ambitions but the depression made me desultory and I picked a random major.   Became a full blown hermit and took down all my social media and still have none to this day- not that I was ever social but I did make some effort. As I was working to finance my college, sophomore year I  bumped into my then bf, who knew of my situation, took pity, and housed me and fed me for the next 2 years (junior and senior year) while I paid tuition. 

Since I was so sad all the time however and financially stressed, I barely scraped by and graduated with  a 3.0 in Econ with a ton of C's in my major classes. I also had shitty bs internships because no firm in Finance would take me. My fault there- I should have been better as far as my academics. I should not have lost my vision there. I am trying to read up on career sites to fix this however. 

In any case, post college I struggled to get a job, and with no friends, had to live with my bf's family because he isn't doing so well for himself either. I've been with his family the past six months, but I am tired of living this way though I fully appreciate everything. I've finally saved enough to move out, and have gotten a two month lease in a major US city while I look for work. 

No fish has bitten yet though, because, and I quote recruiters, as per my resume its blatantly obvious I don't know what I want to do (no surprise there). 

In any case, my problem, besides getting a job, mainly rests in talking about myself. I don't have social media, friends, or a job. My life is pretty screwed up and I do not know how to navigate social waters in introducing myself and getting to know people. 

Any tips?

I desperately want to change and am trying to get over my SA by forcing myself out of my comfort zone (can't afford a therapist unfortunately so this is self-dedicated). So far I've only scared people in being honest and made them suspicious in being vague or lying. 

I really am trying to better my life but I also need your brains because I can't figure this all out on my own. "

This is my last semester and while I was always debating between studying computer science vs computer engineering, I've been told that computer engineering provides a better chance of landing a job with a better pay. The reasoning was that it combines knowledge for electrical engineering and computer software.

To be completely honest, I feel like my curriculum has been shit, while indeed I've had a lot of electrical classes (network theory, signal and systems, digital signal processing etc) and some somewhat useful computer classes (embedded systems, robotics etc), I feel like everything I have learned does not give me enough skills to land my first job. The only programming language I actually learned was C/C++. VHDL was supposed to be taught but they removed it because no one was able to teach it. I'm taking a class where we have to use Java but very very briefly. And I had to learn Python on my own for my senior design project.

Now I've been applying for jobs like crazy, but almost all of them have insane requirements for experience AND some programming languages that I've never even heard of. I haven't had any luck even getting a call back for an interview. I've had only one so far, and I didn't get the offer. I will add that I've had an internship with one of the leading nuclear companies in the US. and of course I have that on my resume, but that did not help at all. 

Even when applying  to jobs online, when they ask for my major %99 of the time I don't see ""computer engineering"" even listed in the drop down menu. So I always choose computer science just to complete my application. 

For those of you who work in the software industry. Should I only apply to positions that I actually have all their required skills needed? What if for example I don't know SQL but would love to have an entry level job to learn it?

I am finishing up my third year of an ME degree. I have a decent GPA at a 3.5 cumulative and a 3.64 major GPA. I am taking Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Machine Design, and FEA. I am also working an internship at 24-30hrs a week and I am dead tired. My grades are beginning to suffer because I can't find the time to study and I am averaging about 4-5 hours of sleep a night. I have spoken with my managers about reducing my work time and they mention that I just need to stick it out and push through. Maybe they are right but I feel incredibly stressed and exhausted and my grades are suffering because of it.

I think I can manage passing all my classes this semester, but I'm not sure whether or not I can keep a +3.0 at my current rate. I have been at my internship for 9 months and I have learned a ton but I am beginning to wonder if this is worth the stress and exhaustion.

Should I quit my internship to focus on school? The people I have spoken to mention how important the internship is over my academics, but I've already been there for 9 months and I don't see how hindering my ability to learn this material can be better than quitting and having the free time to sufficiently study.

I should also add that I'm trying to find something at a few other companies for the summer only, so the ideal scenario would be I quit and finish this semester strong and possibly get another internship which gives me some variety.

4. DUI - 2012


Obviously this looks pretty bad, 3 misdemeanors, with one that always shows up on the background check like a misdemeanor would, even though at the time, it wasn't a misdemeanor in the state of Oklahoma but a traffic violation (transporting open container). Over the years, I have had several job offers redacted after the background check. Unfortunately, most everywhere I've applied ask about background AFTER the interview. After several redactions, my job hunting spirit was broken and I went back to college for a couple years.

I am finishing my degree in computer science and now going through a round of meet and greets, job fairs, and internship hunting. One of the worst feelings is stressing for the call back, stressing over the interview, getting the offer, and then being shut down.

Here is my cover letter. The *WORDS* I omitted on purpose, but they are styled to the company. Any suggestions?  


To Whom It May Concern,
When I saw the posting for the position of an entry-level Modeling and Simulation Engineer position with *COMPANY NAME* on Indeed.com, I knew that I must apply. I believe I am not only qualified for this position, but would thrive in it. I desire to join the Torch team to help contribute to the safety of our great nation in a way that fits both my skill set and my interests.
In my undergraduate studies at *MY UNDERGRAD UNIVERSITY*, the aerospace department taught me to code using both C++ and Matlab, as well as digitally model using AutoCAD and SolidWorks. I routinely developed programs that modeled atmospheric phenomena like shocks and fluid flow alongside programs that modeled structural systems using the Finite Element Method. Even now I am currently building upon this knowledge by pursuing a Master’s degree in aerospace engineering from *MY GRADUATE UNIVERSITY* online. I am proud to report that as of writing this, my grades in my compressible flow course are all 100’s!
Professionally, I currently serve as an intern at *MY CURRENT COMPANY*, a parachute and deceleration device manufacturer located in *CURRENT COMPANY LOCATION*. My relevant duties here include the design of temples in AutoCAD for the operators to use for reference while sewing. I also have been put in charge of the design of entire production lines from the ground up. I reverse engineer different systems, then design a work flow using LEAN manufacturing principles to ensure an efficient flow of product built to government specifications. This frequently involves the interpretation of government technical drawing packages as well as coordinating with operators, supervisors, managers, and others important to the chain of command. I also frequently deliver reports both written and verbal on the progress of the development of various products under my supervision. I must work both autonomously and with a team to achieve these ends.
Personally, coworkers frequently praise my work ethic and attitude. I interface well with people of all educations and backgrounds. I am a self-starter, determined, and love to learn. I am curious and ask numerous questions. I also enjoy using AutoCAD and SolidWorks to create digital models, and coding to create digital environments to test various atmospheric phenomena like shocks, expansions, lift, drag, etc.
In conclusion, not only do I think I am qualified for the position of an entry-level Modeling and Simulation Engineer, but I believe I would enjoy the work. If hired, I will strive every day to learn, impress, and fulfill your expectations.
I can provide references upon request.

This is my last semester and while I was always debating between studying computer science vs computer engineering, I've been told that computer engineering provides a better chance of landing a job with a better pay. The reasoning was that it combines knowledge for electrical engineering and computer software.

To be completely honest, I feel like my curriculum has been shit, while indeed I've had a lot of electrical classes (network theory, signal and systems, digital signal processing etc) and some somewhat useful computer classes (embedded systems, robotics etc), I feel like everything I have learned does not give me enough skills to land my first job. The only programming language I actually learned was C/C++. VHDL was supposed to be taught but they removed it because no one was able to teach it. I'm taking a class where we have to use Java but very very briefly. And I had to learn Python on my own for my senior design project.

Now I've been applying for jobs like crazy, but almost all of them have insane requirements for experience AND some programming languages that I've never even heard of. I haven't had any luck even getting a call back for an interview. I've had only one so far, and I didn't get the offer. I will add that I've had an internship with one of the leading nuclear companies in the US. and of course I have that on my resume, but that did not help at all. 

Even when applying  to jobs online, when they ask for my major %99 of the time I don't see ""computer engineering"" even listed in the drop down menu. So I always choose computer science just to complete my application. 

For those of you who work in the software industry. Should I only apply to positions that I actually have all their required skills needed? What if for example I don't know SQL but would love to have an entry level job to learn it? 

I've also been applying like crazy for positions similar to my internship (controls engineer, with SCADS and PLC programming), and some of the positions I have applied for need exactly the skills that I have but I haven't heard back from any of them.

82t325,7,2018-03-07,Need to vent,crystalballer122,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/82t325/need_to_vent/,"Desperately need to vent and I think my friends are getting tired of hearing me stressing about this...

So I went to a top 10 liberal arts college and graduated last year, with a major in Computer Science. I was homeschooled so I was 16 when I started (graduated June 2017, am 20 now). Like most 16 year olds I was a fucking idiot and didn’t care about my grades, plus I had a lot of mental health issues going in that got worse in school (depression, anxiety, ADHD... etc) Then sophomore year I was sexually assaulted, tried reporting it summer before senior year later, that didn’t work out for me and I got PTSD added onto the list. Oh, and I’m trans and transitioned my freshman year which was another big mess. Never took any time off, maybe should have, but too late for that now.

Unsurprisingly my grades were not so good. I have a lot of drops in my transcript, a few Cs, and failed a major class during my worst term academically (retook it later and got a B or B+). I was on academic probation after I failed that class but got off it the next term, and my grades stabilized around late sophomore/early junior year but still weren’t great, mostly Bs with a handful of A- and C/C+ here and there. Grades in and outside my major were about the same. I graduated with a 3.004 after hovering around a 2.9something until my very last term. 

I’ve wanted to get a Ph.D in CS for a while and I’m especially interested in AI/ML and NLP and CS education. Because of all the shit that happened in college I was only taking steps toward grad school on and off, I applied for REUs and got rejected (understandably, my grades weren’t very good and I probably had a pretty weak app). I didn’t do any research or internships. I took some higher level electives and did ok in some of them, and was a grader for Evolutionary Computing during my last term. I worked for the sys admin for the CS department at my school for my last year. Right now I’m doing a year of service unrelated to my field and intensive therapy to get my mental health more under control.

One of my professors (who wrote one of my LORs) told me that if I want to get a PhD my best bet is to get an MS with a thesis from a mid or lower ranked program, get great grades, do research while there, and then apply for a PhD. I applied for 8 programs, some were reaches, and one unranked as my safety. So far I’ve gotten 3 rejects, 2 from reach schools and 1 from a school that was more in my range. Nothing from the other 5 but I’m anticipating a reject from at least 2 of them and potentially all. 

I understand why I got rejected but I’m terrified I’m going to get 8/8 rejections even though I suspect I will and have for this whole process. My SOP was ok, got better as I refined it each time, but I should have started earlier and made it more polished. 2 LORs are from professors who know and like me (academic adviser and senior project adviser), 1 is from a professor whose class I did well in (hardest required class in the major) despite having my rapist come on campus for a week during that term but I kept it together and got extensions and did great on the final. GRE was 169 V / 164 Q / 5.0 AW. GPA is a 3.00. No research, no internships, no jobs in the field. If I don’t get into the unranked program I don’t know if I have it in me to apply again next year, and even if I do get in I feel kind of shitty going from a top college to an unranked MS program. I know I need to get over myself but it still sucks. I just really want this to work out and it’s not looking good. I’m tired of feeling like I’m not good enough or smart enough and watching my classmates get great jobs or attend top graduate schools when I don’t even know what I’m doing after my service year ends. I hate feeling like I fucked up my entire undergrad and fucked up all my applications by not spending enough time on them. Waiting sucks and I’m so depressed and stressed out all the time. I just want to know whether I’m rejected or not. 

Thanks for reading if you actually read this far. 

tl;dr CS major, graduated with a 3.0, want a PhD but applying for MS to start, suspect I’m going to get rejected everywhere, feeling sad &amp; inadequate, going nuts from waiting "

Last semester, I applied to over 50 companies (both ""reach"" companies and local options) and heard back from a number of them. After weighing my options, I am down to two companies - one whom I've already accepted.

Let me explain:

1.) Around February 1st, I accepted an offer at a Fortune 500 Insurance/Finance Company (located in Connecticut) working in their software development department. I accepted the offer as I had finished all my interviews and was given an offer valid for only 72 hours. At this point, I figured this was my best option for the Summer. Although it was not my ""dream"" internship or company, I accepted it as I wanted to have something for this summer. This job pays mid-$20s/hr.

2.)Fast forward to the last two week, a major US Defense Contractor/Missle Developer contacts me to begin interviewing for a position I applied for back in October. I go through the interview process - because why not - and end up landing an internship as a Software Engineering Intern paying around mid-$30s/hr. I would consider this company and internship program to be my ""dream"". I am highly considering accepting this offer because I knew it is an opportunity that, if missed, would haunt me for the rest of my college career. 

But now I am in a shitty situation. Company #1 was incredibly nice, well organized, and really made me feel wanted; but dream Company #2 just started their process incredibly late and has put me in a complex situation.

Do I bite the bullet, accept my dream internship and email company #1 saying ""Um, Sorry..."". Or should I remain ethical and stick with my original offer. Plz help.

I'm going to list some things on my mind, things I'm currently doing, and things I plan on doing. Let me know what yall think. 

* First and foremost, what should I be teaching myself? I mean outside of class. What are worthwhile things to learn that are valuable in the industry? I just purchased *Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes* and hoping that will help me out a lot. I'm in my first database class so there's also that reason. 

* This kind of goes with my first question, but what can I really expect post grad? What are the best paying, and most likely jobs to land post grad? (Houston/Austin TX area if that matters) 

* Do I need certs to go along with my degree?

* What are the chances of landing a good job right out of college with zero job experience in that field, and no internship experience? Assume I graduate with a 3.0+ GPA. I'm hoping to obtain an internship prior to graduation, but I have expenses and I am not sure I will be able to handle an internship, job, full time classes, and a personal life. 

* What are good/high paying jobs that can be worked remotely? 

* Also alike question one but more specifically, do yall have any recommendations on books to learn C#? I took my intro C# class last semester and honestly did not learn much. The professor was really bad, and from what I hear, the professor that teaches the second C# class (which I'll be taking next fall) is much worse with harder material. 

* I just joined AITP (Association of IT Professionals) at my school, not sure if that can go on my resume, but that's the only club I'm in. 

* That's all I got for now. Any other advice is much appreciated. Thank you for reading.

* Academically, I'm most interested in math and algorithms. I also like writing and economics. For this reason, I think I will major in computer science.

* I can code and make apps, webpages, etc. But implementing this stuff might not be for me anymore. Sometimes it feels really repetitive.

* I'm lucky to have opportunities that will let me afford college and any grad school w/o debt. 

* I'm looking for a career that will bring in $$$ without compromising happiness. I'm okay working an average 9-5 and doing what makes me happy at home but I think that I might find more success in a field that I'm passionate in.

* **My ideal would involve a lot of logical thinking and either short term or long term problem solving. I want to continue to learn throughout my career.**

Some career options I've though of are: 

* **Research and development:** (which my aunt does). Right now this is what I'm aiming for. It seems really fun to explore the cutting edge and learn. My biggest worries are that I'm not smart enough for the field and the competitive job market.

* **Lawyer:** Patent law (which my dad does) interests me because you have to learn about new technology to write patent applications. This would probably keep things fresh. But I think I'd rather be on the inventor side than the patent side. Technology specific law could be cool too and would force me to engage with new technology also.

* **Software Developer:** (which my sister does) I'd be solving problems and mentally engaged but I'm worried that it would get repetitive. But I think I'll try to intern as a SWE early on in college and see how it goes.


* **Doctor:** I've thought about becoming a doctor because I could afford school without debt and face new problems with patients everyday. But as of now, I don't like biology and, to a lesser extent, chemistry. So for now this is out.

What do you think? What would you do? Am I missing any other career options?

Our chamber of commerce has an IT group from all the local companies who get together once a month and I was asking the other IT directors and nobody uses it for anything. One IT director told me he's letting the intern screw around with Ubuntu but they're not using it for anything real.

I'm not going to have our help desk guy do all that command line stuff. We'd have to hire teams of CS graduates to make it all work when we can easily find tons of people with the knowledge to create users in AD and image computers.

I wasn’t expecting any results considering I’m only on my second class in CS with no actual prior job experience. But a couple hours after I applied I was contacted by a Non-Profit organization for an interview for app development. My question is, should I go for it? Honestly I’m not qualified for this internship considering I’m only in my second class and I can’t see myself actually contributing anything. I know this is a fantastic opportunity that’ll help my resume a ton but at the same time I’m worried about how much I can actually do. Also do any of you have experience in doing an unpaid internship? How was it and would you have rather gone for a paid internship that’s not CS related?

Edit: Looked more into this, Unpaid Internships are illegal in the United States if the employer is called it an “internship” and not “volunteer work”. Any company hiring software developers and calling it an unpaid internship is a huge red flag."

I have no internship experience, some short lived time working in a lab under an EE professor making a hardware interface (first time I coded anything), and have some projects thanks to a class. After graduating, I felt woefully unprepared and went hermit mode to do 500 leetcode problems without looking at solutions 90% of the time. I'm pretty confident in DS&amp;A but I just don't have much knowledge/experience in frameworks and in actual development. 

End of January, I began applying to jobs and had my first job interview last week in the Bay Area. They told me today they wanted to employ me and will send me an offer letter once they talk with my references. I'm guessing my salary for this job will only be about $55k. I have several onsite interviews coming up but stress is telling me to accept this offer now. I have no experience and my professional references are professors from several years ago that I never really talked to and I'm worried that I won't receive a better offer as a result.

Because salary often grows as a percentage, I'm worried that accepting this low wage will give me a slow start to my career. On the other hand, I may not get another offer in the near future and it may be better for my career to get some experience at this place and go for a better job after half a year. 

I don't want my anxiety to make me settle on a poor career decision. Does anybody have advice for somebody like myself, given my (lack of) credentials? 


**TL;DR:**
I have no work/internship experience and Im not a CS major nor do I come from a top 20 school. I got a low salary job offer. Is it better for my career (salary wise) to wait for a better one or to avoid risk and get experience by taking this one?"

I am a recent grad still looking for their first real salaried job. I'm an Industrial Designer, and I really want to work in the toy industry and be a toy designer, and maybe even a brand manager one day. The thing about the toy industry is that it is very small, and very competitive. With the two major companies (Hasbro and Mattel) having their pick of the litter when it comes to talent, finding openings there is tough. 

So rewind to graduation, I got a design internship at a major toy company. After the term of the internship was over they weren't in a position to hire anyone so they released me in to the world to find a real job. So, the office at this company was pretty casual. One of the female designers would sometimes wear fairly formal blouses and dresses, but the rest of the team would dress very casually. The most senior designer would regularly wear cargo shorts and a T-shirt to work, and the design manager (everyone's boss who reports directly to the CEO) would regularly wear T-shirts, torn, ripped jeans, and skater shoes. Everyone else was fairly casual, but fell somewhere inbetween. I regularly dressed nicer than the average (button ups, khakis, ect) if for nothing else but to impress and not be the lowest common denominator. 

Fast forward a few months, I've been working with a recruiter who specializes in the toy industry, and I had a very promising opportunity at a small company. Several rounds of phone interviews went stellar, and they finally flew me out to Atlanta for the big interview. Now, somewhere along the way I remember either reading or being taught that wearing what you might normally wear to work to a job interview is usually acceptable. I have interviewed at other toy companies in person with this strategy and never seemed to have an issue (But never got the job either).  Not wanting to seem stiff, I left the blazer at home and hit the airport wearing pretty much exactly what I would regularly wear as an intern. Button up (with a small, fun but not casual repeating print of cactuses) khakis and some dope sneaks for some flair. 

So I walk into their reception area and look around and think to my self, *wow, it is REALLY nice in here*. I instantly become self conscious because the office is WAY more formal than I was expecting from all my previous interviewing and work experience in the industry. I go into the interview desperately hoping I just come off as the young, energetic, fun designer they are looking for. I meet the design manager who will be my boss  for the first time in person (I would have been the 3rd member of the team), and we instantly hit it off. The interview is going very well and I never get any vibes from him that my clothes are unacceptable (he was wearing jeans). The interview is going super well, and the language starts to change from ""if you start"" to ""when you start"" and I am elated. He loves my work, my personality, and I like the product they make and immediately see many ways to help them develop it further (which is why they were hiring)

Then a knock comes on the door. It's the COO. I knew he was going to be attending the interview at some point, but it had been almost an hour and a half before he shows up. In his words, he was checking for ""corporate and office fit"" and was leaving the talent and personality evaluation to the other guy since I would be working with him directly. He was wearing a purple long sleeve formal button up, with slacks and dress shoes. This portion of the interview goes well, and the design manager is visibly excited, telling the COO about me, and what I brought to the table (figuratively and literally). We wrap up after about another additional hour (2.5 hours total!) and I head back to the airport thinking I nailed it. We even talked about areas of Atlanta I could look at moving to, moving assistance, and temporary housing while I looked for a place. They tell me they are interviewing another guy and I will know in about a week. 

So I get a call from my recruiter expecting good news. He tells me they went with the other guy and I'm crushed. He tells me they just wanted someone with a little more real world experience (I've heard this several times and it is beyond frustrating), and he leaves it at that. He tells me the other guy isn't a slam dunk because he has a small family to move and they weren't sure if he would accept, and I would be the guy if it falls through. It didn't fall through.

It isn't until a few days later when I'm chatting with my recruiter about other possibilities and asking him to critique me as a candidate based on the feed back he has been getting (I had interviewed with 5 companies at this point, get furthest with the Atlanta guys) and he drops the bomb that they thought I was dressed poorly! He quoted them as saying I ""looked like I was dressed to go to the mall"" and I wanted to shoot myself for not dressing up more. I could tell this was all coming from the COO and he most likely vetoed me because I didn't impress him with my atire. I was, and am still (it's been 2 months) crushed. And unemployed.

TL:DR the Toy industry is laid back overall, and I assumed they would all be that way, but was rejected for not dressing formally enough in an interview by a c-level employee of the company I was interviewing for, even though I was a slam dunk with the guy I would have worked directly under. 

EDIT: Several people are commenting about the ""wear what you might wear to work"" idea. This came from my vocational background. I went to school to be an automotive technician before I went to art school for design. The idea behind that thinking is to ""look ready to start working immediatley"". Obviously I realize now that this isn't appropriate for a corporate setting, but that was the idea behind it anyway."

82vpaj,2,2018-03-08,Are industry recommendation letters accepted?,raghu112233,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/82vpaj/are_industry_recommendation_letters_accepted/,"**About me and my career:**

I am 25 yo and a Masters graduate(2016 passed out) in Comp. Science from India with average GPA(6.9/10) from a good university. Then, I worked for a year(till May,2017) with a good Machine Learning startup, but I messed up there because of some personal reasons.

For some reason, I wanted to do PhD and my brother also suggested it to be a good decision. I was mostly inspired by Andrej Karpathy from Stanford.

I applied for and got a research internship position(on June 2017) from a reputed Prof. in *Computer Vision*.**But, the project I got was into web development(which I didn't wanted to do and found tough)**. While,I could have focused and finished it off and moved on, but the personal issues cropped up again. 

With 9 months into the project, **I made literally no progress**. At the same time, I have been fooling around my senior that I am working on it/got some bugs and working on it. Now that, it has reached a critical level. They haven't identified it yet. **But, I feel I no longer want to waste time trying to do something I am unhappy and which leads me nowhere.**

**I was staying there only for the recommendation letter, but now it might be little tough to get that too**. I never interacted with the Prof. other than the regular weekly meetings. It's a great mistake, I know. Even, I never interacted in the group meetings too.

Last week ,I have got a part-time job offer from a startup making educational content for Tensor flow, deep learning and all related topics. 

I have some financial constraints too now. This is also one of the reasons I am thinking of moving to job now.

*I am planning to join this company and postpone my PhD plans.*

**My questions: **

* Should I ask the Prof. to change the project? This is unlikely, because my progress so far is very less and could lead to more deeper interrogations from him and he could find out that I was lying throughout. 

*My doubt always was, Is it possible to get a PhD from Germany/Europe with **1-2 recommendation letters from my previous college Profs. (not so popular in their field)** and **1-2 recommendation letters from the current company people**(has some reputation) I am intending to work? 

*Are recos. from industry people recognized?? . I also learnt a lot from him,about how to do research and many more things.
*I was clinging to this prof. just for this single reason--recommendation letter.* He is one of the top Computer Vision researchers in the country.

P.S: 
* Though, I told about my interests to my Prof. at the time of joining and also in between hoping to change the project, but he told me to continue working on this and finish it off and move on.

Tl;Dr:
Should I go to job, leaving my current research internship which is not taking me anywhere?I hate my current project and have no clue whether it will lead me to a successful PhD program.I have wasted the last 9 months literally making no progress. Are industry recommendation letters accepted?"

Grade: Junior

School Type: Public

Unweighted GPA: 4.0

Weighted: 4.54

Class Rank: 1/~400

ACT: 35 (Shooting for 36 in April and believe I have a good shot.)

Subject Tests: Math II: 800, Chemistry: Not Taken Yet (Believe I will do good)

Teacher Recommendations: I have secured two teachers who I believe will give me very strong letters of rec. (Computer Science and Chemistry teacher).

**Identity:**

Sex: Male

Race: Asian-Indian

Economic Class: Upper Middle Class ($200 K+)

Location: Born and raised in wealthy, gated community in California

**Classes Taken**

- Taken most rigorous schedule possible at my school.

- By graduation, I will have taken 10 AP classes and 9 Honors Classes.

- Took AP Computer Science A in freshmen year, and got the only 5 on the test at my school.

**Extra Curriculars:**

- Have been a part of cub scouts and boy scouts since Kindergarten. Received my Eagle Scout rank at 15. Have over 40 various merit badges.

- Helped create a non-profit dedicated to getting computer science education into elementary schools in my town. This organization, and a picture of me, were featured on the front page of the Sunday New York Times. Also helped create template lesson plans for classes taught by our organization

- Have had multiple internships at start ups near me. At these internships, I learned about commercial code development and helped develop backend algorithms for one of these startups.

- On track and field team, running the 1 and 2 mile races. However, was not overly good at it, so this might not be important. Also on the volleyball team.

- Tutored at an organization that helped under privileged kids.

- Created engineering club at our school and helped run it for the past two years.

- Attempted to create a young republicans club at our school, but eventually shut it down due to a lack of people willing to join. I attribute this mostly to the area I live being mostly liberal. (Honestly, I am a bit afraid to even mention this in my college apps because of a possible negative connotation some admission officers might have with Republicans. Should I mention this my political affiliation, or is it possible to backfire?)

- Wrote the code for an app that helped kids learn sign language.

**Work Experience:**

- Began private tutoring when I was in 8th grade. Continued to do this for about a year.

- Moved to tutoring at a company called Mathnasium. Did this for about 4 months.

- The next summer, I worked for a tech start up company that was developing a product to help companies protect their intellectual property. The company was very small (&lt; 10 people), so I got a lot of experience helping write code for their backend systems. Was honestly one of the coolest summers of my life.

- Various other small jobs, such as camp counselor and swim instructor at community pool.

**Prospective Colleges:**

Prospective Major: Computer Science (also considering physics, but almost certainly a STEM field).

I've gotten interviews but no offers, so initially I thought my resume was fine and focused solely on applying to more places and studying interview questions. But even when my interviews go well I don't advance to the next stages, I think mostly because of behavioral questions. And my dad's friend also said my resume makes it look like I don't have much experience. 

Which, yeah, I'm a new grad. I had internships as you can see but at every single one they didn't give me what I think is any substantial work.  It seems like for even entry level positions companies want me to have considerable depth in one area, which I'm kind of confused by since by definition entry level means no experience. 

The nature of my degree was also kind of shallow, we didn't have the option of choosing an emphasis, did a couple projects in various languages, and though we were required to take a few 'technical electives', there were very very few options for the courses. 

I guess I'm mainly looking at full stack web development sort of roles--in the long term I'd want to get into data science but don't have experience for it as of yet obviously. 

I'm frustrated because I feel like I have all the components for an entry level job and to prove that I can learn on it--CS degree, internship, projects, interview practice.

My fall and spring GPA's were 3.24 and 3.45 and over that summer I did a math/research program at my school. I wasn't involved much but my plan had always been to do that sophomore year anyways.

Over the summer however, I had about 10 hours worth of work per week and spent the rest of my time fucking around and picking up a ton of bad habits that carried over into the semester. In the fall my gpa tanked (semester gpa 2.24, an entire point down from my lowest gpa thusfar) and I even got a D in a course for the first time ever, C- being the cutoff for if a course can be used to fulfill a major requirement for me, meaning I need to retake/replace it. This semester I've learned from some of my mistakes, but I got behind in a couple courses right at the start and now I think I'm gonna have to drop one of them just to not drown.

All in all, had a good year, followed by what's shaping up to be a bad one. This summer I wanted to get an internship but I think I'm gonna need to take courses instead since I'm undercredited to be on track for graduation. I just feel very worried about future internship/job prospects, considering my resume boasts a now mediocre gpa/transcript, few work experiences, and about 0 extracurriculars, and that's what I'll be walking into junior year with. If I make sure to buckle down, up my gpa, and start getting involved on-campus next semester as best I can, do you think it's possible I'll build a strong enough resume to secure a good internship the summer following junior year?

Last semester I got myself into a position where I wanted to just give up but I know doing that would just run me further into a hole. Any advice or similar experiences would be great to hear!"

I'm a senior in college studying data analytics and currently work as an android developer intern at a decent sized company. This is internship doesn't have an end date but i'm sure there is a 1 or 2 year limit due to state or federal laws. This job is challenging but I do enjoy it and as an analytics major I've gone through the a number of CS courses but spent most of my time with statistics so jumping into a development role was a switch up.

Today I was offered a BI position over the summer at a larger healthcare company. This position is only for the summer and pays less per hour, however it is more related to my field of study. I was thinking it would also be more beneficial on my grad school application to have working in an analytics position like BI as opposed to app development.

With that said, I'm leaning toward a graduate program in analytics but would also do a CS one as well.

I'm going to try see if I can work it out to do both over the summer and not take any classes but I'm not sure how realistic that is.

I felt pretty confident about it. And I failed. Okay, you either win or you learn, I guess. Yet it had me worrying a bit. 

So after this quite long back story I'd like to ask you, the learning to program community, will I be able to better my so-called spatial intelligence by just programming more? Or do I need to do something more specific? Since this mental ability seems to be kinda big deal, I guess?

I thought I wanted to go into medicine and I would take the pre-requisites I missed in my spare time while working full-time in the area, but living up in the Oakland, CA area is expensive and I couldn't take time off from work to take classes only available during the day. 

I discovered a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp that was available for me to take part-time over the course of 6 months, and I graduated from it in October 2017. They taught me skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React, and loads of other stuff. Since then, I've been applying for jobs and so far, I've only had one interview and that's because my friend gave me a referral (it didn't go well). That put me into another depression and I started reflecting that maybe I shouldn't be applying for Front-End Engineer positions yet, but maybe Junior Web Development or Junior Software Engineer or even any internship positions would be better suited for me. 

I recently started sending applications out again and still haven't received much luck, most likely since I'm close to UC Berkeley and I'm competing against CS/EECS students and more in this competitive area. In my spare time, I've been trying to supplement my knowledge by following alongside UC Berkeley's intro classes to CS without being enrolled (Python and Java on ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" and ""Data Structures"").

I'm just at a loss for what I should do because I really want to put the skills I learned to use and I want to transition into the tech field, but not being a current computer science student seems to be putting me at a disadvantage for internships in the area. At this point, I'm considering just applying for random roles in companies in the area and working my way up as a receptionist or something. 

I'd be happy to provide more details, and I appreciate any input you may have on what you think my next step should be. Thanks &lt;3"

I barely took intro to compsci, and now I'm taking Programming in Java. 

Unfortunately, I feel I have many problems that hinder my progress. The first, and most important problem, my math skill is very poor; I placed very poorly in my mathematics placement exam (I'm currently taking Algebra)! I know that math is an important skill for computer science so it's very discouraging placing so poorly. I'm already 21, and I still got a long way to go before I even think about transfer (Already beginning on my third year)!

My second problem is where do I get started? There is so much information to take in, like what do I focus on? Java or another programming language, internships, etc. I'm barely scratching the surface, and I feel insignificant. Sometimes I think why bother? I'm starting off so poorly that there's no way I'll get a career. 
But then I'm reminded of why I even pursue this field. I love computers, I love the way they work, their history, and their impact on our progress.

But love alone won't get me anywhere, I need to work and study hard, but on what?
What should be my main focus? What should I change?
Sorry for the huge wall of text, I'm just really anxious about falling behind (because I already am).

I'm currently a student in IT with an internship in a startup company, at school I mostly learn fundamental knowledge such as linux &amp;windows administration, networking, voip, security and a bit of programming.

At work we work with an Openstack public cloud and are mostly doing R&amp;D.

I really like what I'm doing but I feel like what I'm learning at school maybe kind of out-dated when I see technologies involded at my workplace, I've recently tried to set up a kubernetes / docker cluster and I've just realised the future of operation is mostly cloud-based with a big focus on automation and large scaling.

I'd like to dedicate a few hours of my week end to learn new technologies but I'm not sure what are the biggest things right now, so I'm submitting a post on this sub' since you guys have been a big source of knowledge these past years :)

tldr; in your opinion what technology is worth learning as someone who would like to remain in Ops and why ?

So a few months back I had an online class where I basically sat at a computer and did my class alone for the whole hour. It was nice, and I did complete all my classes. But I also explored the school computer system (Windows Server 2012). While doing this, I came across a way to find student's passwords. I wrote a script that extracted student's passwords from a list of usernames and wrote them to a file. These passwords are pre-assigned, they are NOT people's real, personal passwords.

I thought this was pretty cool so I told a few friends that I what I found, not giving them any passwords. I haven't give anyone any passwords aside from their own. It's pretty funny. You go up to people and slip their school password in. They get spooked and ask how you got their password. 

Yeah, it's awful. But I got attention. I'm not exactly popular. So this goes on, I do this occasionally to new people until someone reports it to the office. The IT peeps don't make a big deal because honestly, I hadn't done much, I cooperated and showed them how I did it.  They fixed the error which let you get the passwords it and even offered me an ""internship"" over break. My internship went well. I enjoyed it a lot and I learned a lot.

However, they didn't know I still had a list. I didn't tell them because I was afraid they would not like it. And I don't think they did.

Fast forward to today. I'm in English and a slip another kid their password. He freaks out and is like ""HOW WHAT!??!"". I make a typing motion and he says ""ooh I'm snitchin"" and goes to the teacher, who understands I am a smart kid and talks to me about what happened. I tell her I talked to the Tech Department and I realize it was wrong to keep them. Which is sincere. I feel awful because I not only betrayed the tech department's trust by lying to them but I also betrayed my own morals. I'm a good guy. Anyways, she sends an email to the assistant principal and the head of the tech department. At this point I'm half crying and covering my face at my desk while thinking of what could happen. What if they revoke my computer access? That's my career. I've always wanted to be a programmer. I couldn't take any classes, and it would be very difficult to do my current broadcasting class because how would I use premiere pro? What if they expel me?

While being nervous the whole day I am at an after-school club when I get a ""google account error"" on my phone. I click it and it's my school account. I try to log on. My screen reads ""Account disabled by domain administrator.""

~~That's all I know.~~

~~UPDATE:~~
~~Account is disabled temporarily. The rest is being decided.~~

Final Update:
2 weeks no school computers (so far making a few of my classes a pain)
16 hours helping clean school (1hr a day after school with janitors)
Basically all the students are either: ""Did you really get all the passwords?"" or ""Ugh I forgot my new password, thanks (name)"" (they changed the passwords, duh)
Can't work for TD over spring break (obviously)
and I have to write a research paper on confidentiality.

TL;DR: I got all the kids passwords and the tech department found out and a lot of things happened (see update)

I'm looking to go back closer to home and work in the city to try to better my career situation and transition to something with more possibility for growth (I'm only 22 right now). 

I'm currently working at a small newspaper in upstate NY as a reporter and page designer. In May I will be one year removed from getting a BA in communication from a respected NY public school (not a great GPA), the reporting/page designing job was my first real job after college. I have one prior internship during college and a senior editor of my college newspaper.

I'm having a tough time looking for jobs right now and only have a few months (my lease is up in May in upstate NY, not looking to commit to another lease here.)

All the journalism jobs in NYC are too competitive for my experience/education and I probably won't be able to do that. So how I do I transition to another communications-type job? Most jobs I've applied for want people with prior experience/at least a college major in said field (PR, advertising, etc.) and I'm not sure where my journalism experience would be considered an asset.

I am an award-winning journalist with a lot of really good writing clips, but most jobs don't seem to care from where I've applied. Even in the few phone screens I've had my journalism experience didn't seem to be something that really moved the needle for anyone.

How do I make the transition and convince people to give me a chance in a different field? Where should I look for places to apply? I've been using stuff like MediaBistro, Indeed, etc. but it hasn't been working out very well and those websites usually bring in a ton of applicants and a lot of competition.

I have barely any network right now. Does anyone have advice? I'm running out of time and don't want to leave a decent job to go back home and have no job again, but most leases around here are only for a year and I don't want to commit to that either."

I'm 16 and last October I managed to get an internship with a very small and brand new non profit here as part of their ""development team"" (which consisted of everyone in the non profit because we're a group of 6 and haven't gotten to our ""release"" phase yet) Part of what got me the job was my ability to do a few things with javascript and python that I exemplified on my application and their previous website manager had been rather lazy and not doing much so within a month I got put in charge of their website and now I'm a full member and essentially their ""tech lead"" if I had to put a title to the role. So the website went all and well, we're close to release and it's just WordPress based (although I have promised to make it my goal to redo it with javascript so we can have a more custom feel this summer while I'm out of school)

This is the issue which some may laugh at, who knows. We've recently managed to get a nice lead following and are starting to bring in more and more data that we need to be stored and visualized. At our recent team meeting, they brought up that they'd like to move over to a more professional database management system and asked me for a couple recommendations. So I did a bit of research over our numbers and growth and was able to reason with them that google sheets/excel are all we need for at least the next few months unless we hit some overnight miracle growth. Though I have looked into the idea and I'm aware this may be a great chance for me to add something pretty cool to my resume by utilizing a SQL database. (I plan on going to college for computer science and getting a job in the industry)

The two relevant issues are:
A.) I've been recently trying to learn C++ as game development is something I'd enjoy and by going through about 15-30 of the places I'd like to get an internship at while in college they all have C++ knowledge as a requirement so I'm trying to start now. Dropping it to pick up SQL would mean distracting myself from what I enjoy and have been working on for a while. 
B.) I really don't know much about SQL at all, hell I'd say the most advanced thing I know about SQL is that it's not pronounced S-Q-L it's pronounced ""Sequel"", lol. This is an issue, but obviously, most places like their engineering to have SQL/Database knowledge so maybe this issue isn't such a big deal as I'll need to learn it eventually.

TL;DR:
The non-profit I work IT for wants to start incorporating a more ""professional"" database, would stopping the language I'm currently experimenting with so I can fulfill this request with a database that uses SQL be beneficial as a resume booster or should I just cheat it out with some easy to use database and keep learning C++ like I've been doing."

He said that he doesn’t think recruiters and HR will see “just a business degree” as very competent. The thing is, I often see here that having a degree by itself is enough to be qualified for many IT positions that are higher than support / helpdesk, let alone the degree type for a rather IT-specific program.

And I am definitely looking into summer internship opportunities, although being in community college and living in the Bay Area definitely limits my options given my level of education, as I am competing against Berkeley and Stanford students. I do have software dev intern experience, albeit from a very small startup. It was mainly database and JavaScript, so let me know where this could take me within IT.

Obligatory throwaway because my family reddits.  

US citizen
Education: BS in mathematics, BA in economics, MS in Computer Science from US colleges
Work History: 2 internships in a financial payment tech company.  2 years experience in same financial payment company as a developerconsulting.
Programming languages I know: Java, C++, C, SQL, C#, Perl, Ruby
I have permanent residency in India because of my grandfather who is an Indian citizen.  I have an OCI card which is basically permanent residency with few limitations, none of which apply to me.

So I realize people typically don't do this. This is sort of like the reverse of typical I want out stories.  However, in the past year I have grown more and more spiritual.  There is an ashram where I would like to spend a few years doing religious stuff, while still having some income from a job in my field or a related field.

I won't be at the ashram 24/7.  Rather the ashram is located in one western Indian state, and I would be there 15 days of month.  I do have relatives in Mumbai who would be happy to rent a room to me for around 75000 rupees per month (actual market rent is probably higher...).

I have approximately $10000 savings.  Currently I earn $5000 per month after tax.  

1) I would like to start this as soon as possible.  With that in mind, is there some target amount of savings I should accumulate?  I do have intentions of coming back to the US after living there a few years.

2)  What is your opinion of the work culture like in India in general for the professional class?  
Do any of you know what might be a good way to strategize get a job with this rather unique situation?  Should I just look online or exploit personal connections?  Currently, my responsibilities are mostly consulting based.  Of course I don't expect to find anything paying nearly anything I am earning right now, but any type of work in this field is fine for me.

3) Any other useful tips?"

I really want to move out of the current state I am because the career I want to go into (computer science) doesn't really have any job prospects I'd enjoy much at all here or anywhere near here for the matter.

I have a few options: I could go to school at my state university, hope I can manage a 3.7-4.0 GPA and if I get lucky transfer to a UC. (plan on completing masters)

Or I could apply directly to SJSU, hope I get in and just stay there for at least my undergrad then either complete my masters there or try for a UC grad program.

Both options would cost relatively the same and are within my price range, I want to(like everyone else) work at a top company for internships/when I graduate.

My top companies, though I'd be happy anywhere are Blizzard Entertainment, NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, Tesla, and Apple. Though generally if I could get an internship/job at anywhere remotely similar to any of those companies I think I'd be ecstatic, money is obviously important to me but not to the point where I'd only be happy if I'm making enough to afford some nice car and a big house. Living comfortably == success to me. 

What do you guys think would be the best route for me? (I'm visiting UC Irvine this fall but sadly won't be able to make it to any SJSU or UC San Diego but I have about a year to ask around and learn about the area. 

What I've learned so far: UC San Diego frequently has Blizzard Entertainment(My top choice for internships) at their career fair and recruiting. To counter that SJSU currently holds the spot for most graduates working at apple and also is pretty high up there in terms of Bay Area recruiting, but is average or sub-par nationally. 

Cons of UC option: ~10-15 thousand more to finish masters, will have never seen UC San Diego if I go there, will have to spend my first two years of college no lifing academics to hope to get in

Cons of SJSU: Classes are supposedly hard to get into and people will end up taking 5 years to complete their undergrad, reputation scope may not exceed bay area.

8331uu,0,2018-03-08,Shape my career,baked_evo,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8331uu/shape_my_career/,"Hello all,

So a little background. I went to college for electrical engineering then ended up graduating with a computer science degree. I found something I liked and went for it. I had an IT internship at a software development company while in college. This is where I picked up basic troubleshooting and got my entry into the IT field.

I now have about 4 years experience including my internship. I'm 24 years and I'm hungry to learn as much as I can. I come home spend hours in the lab.. Long story this IT is my shi*. I've had more than a few jobs in the industry: network administrator, field engineer, Systems Administrator and currently a systems engineer. Personally I feel like I don't know nearly as much as I'd like to and I'm struggling to find the most important items to focus on

In a nutshell I know a lot... But not know it enough to say I know it on my resume, if that makes since. Best way to describe my experience: I've built a few vpns, updated firmware on switches via ssh, created a few firewall rules, RE created some exchange arbitration mailboxes, I've set up some wireless networks, vlans, I understand dns, dhcp, ad, GPOs, set up a few datastores (migrated one server), set up ssls etc. Overall I'd say I'm a good troubleshooter with a process. But I am only learning with what I am task with fixing at my job and what I can set up in a test lab. I don't understand networking nearly as well as I'd like to. 

I am a insanely driven and a very quick learner. I currently work for an MSP supporting a rather large client network of about 5 sites. Ad trust, site to site Vpn, the whole shebang. I am now trying to shape my career, right now I am touching everything, but I am not ""learning it"" I haven't set a firewall up from scratch do I think I could figure it out? Yes but not why I am posting here.

How do I get into a job where I start learning the advanced network skills I want to learn? Or do I entirely take matters into my own hands and set up a super at home lab buy some static ips and just be self taught ? I already have an IT mentor I hired but that's just once a weekend.. And I need more than that. I want a job where left and right I am working to the next level! I want learn how to set up switch stacks, migrate servers, migrate exchange etc etc. How do I pick what to focus on and how do I go about learning it without doing the..I wanna learn it all and begin picking up little bits and pieces. Unfortunately little bits and pieces aren't going to advance my knowledge or bring in the big bucks.

Any advance appreciated!"

Databases we're getting into Oracle SQL after spending the first half using MS Access (Which I already know from a previous job, but I'm not particularly interested in being a database programmer especially with MS Access)

As if that wasn't enough, my girlfriend at the time broke up with me a few weeks later because of my poor empathy skills.


At first I became pretty depressed. After a bit of that I got back in touch with my therapist, found a specialty adhd clinic, and restarted treatment. I went on a 7 week, 14,000 mile solo roadtrip, which gave me _a lot_ of time to think. When I returned home, I enrolled in a vocational program and completely changed career fields (from finance to programming).


When I finished the program, I spent a short time still in finance working as the controller at a startup. I was underqualified, overworked, and it was more responsibility than I had ever had before. Nonetheless, thanks to working so hard to get my shit together so quickly, I completely smashed it. The CEO was speechless--he said he had never seen anyone learn anything so quickly. After a short time, I decided it wasn't for me and tendered my resignation. Even though I left them in a tough spot, I handled it so professionally that just recently the COO asked me if I wanted to come back and be their controller again (!!!).


After leaving the startup, I took a programming internship at a different tech company. I smashed the shit out of that too, and at the end of the internship they offered a permanent position making almost as much as I made at the startup.


That was two years ago. One year ago, they gave me a 15 percent raise. *Today*, my boss gave me a 12 percent raise, told me they wanted to give me another raise midyear if they can, asked for my help negotiating the biggest deal my company has ever made, and told me I could move my stuff to a better workspace. I've been told my communication skills are better than anyone else on my team and my boss actively seeks my advice on management and interpersonal situations. Among friends, I went from being known as a terrible listener to being the best listener many people know. I've been dating a wonderful woman for two years and couldn't be happier. Things aren't perfect, but when adhd-related problems arise I have the tools to recognize and work around them.


TL;DR: Untreated adhd ruined everything. I got my shit together, changed careers, unlearned and relearned basically every habit in my life within 6 months, and now I'm more successful than most of my peers. If I did it, you can too."

Did you transfer to a 4 year school? Was it worth it?

Did you enter the workforce immediately? Did you feel prepared?

Did you look for an internship? Are there even internships that would fit with me?

I'm also wondering if there are any gaps I should try to fill in my curriculum. For example, we have not hit on BigO notation yet. Idk if that's even something I should have a grasp on yet, but here are my courses and if there is anything that seems to be missing I'd like to hear it so I can prepare on my own. My preference is to be employable after this 2 years.

4 Semesters Java, Finishing with 
"" topics within the Java EE application platform. Topics include JSPs, Servlets, session management, Expression Language, JSTL, JavaBeans, asynchronous processing, and tag files. Other topics include working with HTTP requests and responses as well as security concepts.""

I'm a computer science major, but I've spent the last year working as a penetration tester. I spent 3 months at my first internship, and then found an internship at school that allows me to work during the school year, which has been an amazing experience. As I don't learn the skills for security in school, work has been how I've learned them and continued to grow. 

Recently, I got an offer from another security job for a summer internship. I initially turned down the offer as I can't devote the time to both, but was able to negotiate with the time requirements. My current job caps me at 30 hours a week, but I can work less if I need as long as my work gets done, which typically takes me ~20 hours. This other company has said that they're okay with me only working 30 hours a week, so I'd be looking at 50-60 hour work weeks. 

I absolutely love the work I do at my current internship, and I have no intention of leaving. I like the work that I'd be doing at this other job and the people that I'd be working under, but my only concern is that I'll get burnt out. 

I feel like I need to pursue as many opportunities in security as possible, as I don't have a formal education in it, but want to make sure I'm not rushing into a decision in the excitement of getting an offer. Assuming that both employers are okay with it, is this a good idea? 

Thanks for reading."

I am a recent graduated that graduated last Summer in Computer Science. I interned for my company ABC for 6 months and months later, I got a phone call from my manager at company ABC for a job out of state and I accepted because the job market is a bit rough. The recruiter asked me how much I wanted and all I said was around 60k. Cutting to the chase, I ended up getting the job and moved out of state. The starting salary was 57k and 3k bonus. I started around November 2017 and I just did a compensation talk with my new manager and he told me since I just started, there’s not much to discuss basically. I did some research before the compensation talk and found out the base salary for what I do is 66k excluding bonus. The caveat is, I am still in training because it’s a new product I am learning, so it might be the reason I am only getting paid less? Should I ask my manager for another meeting or not? I am glad they accepted me and I don’t want to ruin any relationship with my manager if I am asking for base salary pay from my research. I don’t know if this can come into play, but I overhear my manager said “&lt;position&gt; will only be happy if the pay is good”. 

If you guys have any experience or any opinions, please let me know. I just don’t want to be on bad terms since I am practically the new guy 

edit: I forgot to add, my previous manager told me the salary should be 64k and other very similar position is 65k when I was interviewing within the company. The next time I will have a compensation review is next year. One of the intern who made it to full time is getting 80k at the location of my previous internship.

8371ue,0,2018-03-09,1.5 years of C++; where do I go from here?,ReverendHerby,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8371ue/15_years_of_c_where_do_i_go_from_here/,"**Background/goals**

I have an interest in game design, as well as mobile app design. However, I would consider these to be long-term goals. A more short-term goal of mine is to land any job where I can work with code. I have no post-secondary education or certifications to put on a resume; I have to hope for a position I can earn through knowledge of the subject matter and a project portfolio. I am willing to work a low-paying programming job while holding down my current job, or possibly even an internship if that's what it takes to garner experience.

**Programming**

I've been working on learning C++ independently for over a year now. I've completed all the lessons on learncpp.com, and completed the book Beginning C++ Through Game Programming. I also have Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, though that was over my head at the time (it was basically the first resource I tried to learn from, it may be time to go back to it). Some of the concepts my lessons have covered:

* Function templates/template classes/typename
* Inheritance/object relationships
* Smart pointers
* Container classes/iterators
* input/output streams


I've been working on games and calculators along the way to better familiarize myself with these concepts. However, in terms of what to do next, I'm a little lost. I know I need to build further on my knowledge of C++, and will continue to do that regardless of what path I take from here (suggestions on new resources are very welcome!). However, based on advice from other programmers and my perusing of job listings, it seems basically impossible to land any job with only C++ and no degree. For this reason, I'm trying to decide what language to move towards next, and when I should start.

**Languages I'm considering**

Ruby - There seems to be a lot of demand for Ruby, and I've heard over and over how much easier it is than C++. With it being so intuitive, this feels like it might be a good get-your-foot-in-the-door choice, career-wise. Also, from the tiny, tiny bit I've messed with Ruby, the syntax doesn't really seem that different from C++.

Swift - I would love to design apps/games for the iPhone, and between that and the respectable demand for Swift, it seems like a good choice to satisfy both my short and long-term goals. 

Java - SO. MUCH. DEMAND. There also seems to be a lot that will carry over from C++, both in terms of syntax, and the general concepts of working with an object-oriented language.


***My questions***

When should I start learning a second language?

What language would you recommend, and why?

Are there any resources you'd recommend to further my knowledge of C++?"

This is my first full-time job and first job in the field (not counting my internship). Don't get me wrong, I like the customers and don't mind the work, but it's the management that is a major issue. Some of my customer's are leaving our service due to rifts and lack of communication from management and I have been told that they did not even contact the customer directly and talk with them.

Turnover recently has been high among new hires since they often hire people, throw them into the fire with little or no training, and then fire them. I'm an exception since I was more properly trained by one of the senior techs who left after about 6 months. 

The overall feeling is that the ship is sinking and management doesn't appear to be making the correct moves to get the water out of the engine room. Apparently the owner had passed before I started here and from what I've heard things have gone downhill quickly since. This entire situation and environment is wearing me away inside.

I can't help to feel like my production is dropping with my mood as well. Since this is my first full-time job I am very inexperienced when it comes to communicating a lot of things. 

I've put some thought into maybe trying to go back to school for a bachelor's (I have an associates in CiT), and/or finding something else but I am afraid that if I do leave and work somewhere else, I might walk into a similar situation or worse.

I have been lucky enough to have been accepted into both the SPPG MPP program as well as the MScPl programs at U of T. I was honestly hoping to just get into one of the two and have my decision made for me, but it seems like I have to make the decision for myself now.

I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit has experiences with either of these programs? Ultimately my goal is to work on policy issues and projects at a smaller scale level (ideally municipal or regional), either from the public sector or as a consultant/analyst in the private sector. I should also say that I come from BC and it is important for me to work my way back there eventually (hopefully). 

Initially I seem to be drawn a bit more towards the Planning program -- it is more in line with my current interests, more theory focussed, and for better or for worse a bit less pragmatic. However, I know the MPP has much to offer in terms of reputation, placements, and opportunities for internships.

I guess I'm just looking for input from anyone who is a part of either of these programs and what their experiences have been in them. I've already asked the schools for additional information and placements -- I'm just looking for a more personal take.

Thanks!"

How can I best spend my time?,alien6,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/83d6in/looking_to_apply_next_year_because_this_year_is/,"Some background:  I graduated in 2013 with a BS in aerospace engineering at an R1 school.  I wasn't ready for grad school at that time, but I want to pursue my master's.  However, I have quite a few issues:

(1)  My GPA.  My last couple of semesters I had some personal issues and my overall GPA dropped from around 3.4 at the end of sophomore year to 3.0 graduating and 2.9 major.  

(2)  Letters of recommendation.  I haven't stayed in touch with any of my professors, and I graduated nearly five years ago.  There is nobody who can write a decent letter of recommendation.

(3)  Research experience.  I have none.  No internships either.  At the time I naively figured I was better off focusing exclusively on my courses and that ended up burning me out.

(4) The coursework.  I got D's in Calc 3 and Thermodynamics, and C's in a few other engineering courses.

(5)  The gap.  I've spent the last five years ""soul searching,"" i.e., doing nothing related to my major.  I moved away from my university back with my parents

I was originally hoping to spend the next few months studying for the GREs, busting that (I am very good at standardized tests), and getting in in fall 2019, but after reading the FAQs here it doesn't look like that's going to work.  So I have 19 months before October 2019 to get in in 2020.

I'll need to retake some courses and get some research experience before I can think about applying.  I live near a (rather expensive) R1 school and three R2 schools, so I suppose I'll need to contact those schools and take some courses.

That leaves the question of research experience.  I'm a bit stumped there.  Do I just ask around and see if anyone needs a volunteer lab assistant?  Is it even legal to have someone help like that on a volunteer basis?

Would it instead be more worthwhile to go back to my old alma mater to take courses there?  Would they be more likely to let me get involved in research?

What about online courses?  They always seemed kind of hokey to me, but could they help me here?

And finally, the letters of recommendation.  I know people who can write letters to say I'm a good person and great to work with, but none of them are in academia or engineering.  If I were to somehow get a research position, I suppose the professor I work under would be able to write one, but what aside from that?  I don't honestly expect that I can write to a professor who taught me 5+ years ago and say ""Hey, remember me?  Write me a rec letter kthxbai.""

I know this isn't impossible.  I just need to figure out the steps and run up them."

I live just south of Seattle, and am in my 3rd year for comp Sci (well technically it's a BAS in Application Development since apparently UW has ""rights"" to the comp Sci degree in these parts, but you get the idea). I've taken to programming pretty damn well - C# came to me easily, I'm OK with Java, and have been working with CSS, Javascript, HTML, ASP.Net and MVC to name a few.

However, I don't have any real world experience with programming, and aside from my already-present worries about bad habits forming, the half-dozen applications I put in for internships each week that I never hear back for are a bit disheartening. Do I have a shot at a job once I have my 4-year degree, or should I expect to have to take further measures?"

My side projects are incredibly simple, yet both of them took ENORMOUS amounts of time to finish compared to how simple they are, and even then people report bugs in them. Even if the bugfixes are simple, I take stupidly long amounts of time to fix even the simplest ones

I took a break from grinding CTCI/Leetcode to do schoolwork, and by god all my assignments take a minimum of 2 days to do well. If I don't devote at least 2 days to any assignment I'll bomb it hard.

-big city, lots of job opportunities. One of the best places for CS jobs in the state.
-I know people already there, have roommates set up to go there, and have easy ways to meet people.
-The computer science course is pretty good
-the dorms are all new and really good.
-great campus
Cons:
-a ton of crime right outside of campus
-ive been told that a good majority of professors either dont care or dont speak english.
-it is mainly a commuter school, so the campus is a dead town on the weekends (ive witnessed it)
-not at all seen as a prestigious school, and the graduation rate is pretty low.
UNC Wilmington:
Pros:
-a mile from the beach and there is always something to do
-good CS program
-warmer weather which i prefer
-beautiful campus
-i have relatives always at the beach
-seen as a more prestigious school
-more girls than boys (i am a boy lol)

Cons:
-i know absolutely no one else going there so i wouldnt have a roommate yet. my brother did random roommate when he went and he had to call cop on the kid
-going somewhere and knowing not a single person frightens me.
-not as many job opportunities, although i have an internship i can always go back to for summer in my home town

* There is a smaller market for game developer jobs vs. standard software engineering jobs. Because of this, more people probably apply to the regular Computer Science major since there would be more job and internship openings to take advantage of. There is a less chance of ending up at McDonalds post-graduation. 

* Computer Game Science is less mathy and sciency. Don't get me wrong, I know I'll have to take some math and science courses, but game developing also has a focus on graphics, imagery, etc. 

* Computer Game Science isn't as much of an established major as the regular Computer Science major. When I say this, I mean that the program isn't deemed as well as the regular Computer Science major. There are probably some bumps and rough spots. I asked UC Irvine about their Computer Game Science program on /r/uci and they said the same about the UC Irvine Game Science program. Since there are probably more bumps and rough spots in the UC Santa Cruz Game Science program, I don't see why a lot of other people would want to take it. **In fact, I only know one other person in my school besides me who has signed up for the Computer Game Science Major.**

For reference I'm 24 now and I'll almost be 25 when I graduate so I started college late due to having a great paying job in the mining industry which is now slowed down to a near halt, which is why I went to college for something more marketable like Network Security and Electronics (My actual program name).

Now I'm having to do an internship for a credit to be eligible for graduation but all the internships I've seen posted through my school as well as the one I lined up myself are all unpaid. I see tons of posts saying not to take an unpaid internship but I'm at a point where I have to and everyone knows it's required for our department so they never offer compensation anyway.

Coming into my internship I have an A+ and Network+ through my community college from some classes I took there before moving to my 4 year university. I'm currently working on my full fledged CompTIA issued Project+ to take since we have to get a certification to graduate as well. Luckily I have extensive exposure to hardware since I built my first PC with my dad when I was 7 and have built several more since then. 

I'm terrified that I'm going to be unmarketable after I graduate since my internship search has been such a disaster. I truly enjoy the IT field and really enjoy the electronics side of my major so I'd love to be able to work in it reliably. I'm just scared now since everyone kept insisting unpaid internships was the way to go that I'm never going to find a job.

This will be long so tl;dr at the bottom :).

I come from a middle class family. Me and my siblings are the second generation from our extended family to go to college. Both parents are educated but most of our relatives are uneducated.

I was the topper of my school and was also able to secure excellent ranks in all the college entrance exams in India (in 2012):

 * IIT JEE:	   4500	(Conducted Country-wide, written by 500,000 topmost students of country)
 * AIEEE:     1100	(Conducted Country-wide, written by 1,500,000 students)
 * EAMCET:  150	(Conducted State-wide, written by 500,000 students)

This was such an unprecedented feat for someone from this part of the city (read ghetto) that I was featured in newspapers and had my interview taken by a local journalist.

4 years of College: I joined the one of the top-most university (NIT Trichy) for college with majors in ECE (electronics and electrical engg). The college is constantly ranked among top 10 universities in India ranked only after the IITs.
ECE never really appealed to me and my 4 years of college were spent aimlessly and unsurprisingly resulted in me graduating with an average CGPA (7/10) .I do not have any legitimate reasons for this. In college, I would make most of the sudden freedom I found away from home by lazing around, playing games and watching lots of TV series. Although I never failed in any subject (which I find surprising given the low amount of effort that I would put in my studies - but thats a different story). I did pull my shit together in final year and got a job in a very reputable and popular US based MNC in my final year.

1.5 years of work exp: Primary role- Devops (mostly Infrastructure, system administration), JAVA Spring and have also worked on adobe after effects (couple of projects). I was working on a lot multiple tools and technologies which I had to self learn and implement in my project. My team has been extremely happy with my performance. Although my manager complains that I am almost always late to office. But my senior manager supports me greatly and has nominated me for promotion this month after just 1.5 years of work experience (The promotion would normally take 3 years and sometimes even 4 years).
Last year I was also awarded an ""outstanding award"" for my contributions to the project (highest possible award and very rare for a entry level employee to get this award). This year I was also assigned a new resource to work under me and made a team lead of sort (if you can call it that). As of now I am trying my hands on enterprise JAVA (going for a full stack developer profile).
						
In these past 2 years I was able to greatly recover my lost confidence from the college fiasco and was ready to try new things. Inspired by my friends, I gave machine learning a shot and discovered that I really have a knack for it and really liked it. I have completed 3 courses on coursera on machine learning (ML and DL specialization by Andrew NG) as of now.						

Since I basically flunked 4 years of college, I want to have another shot at proper education (to redeem myself of the guilt). I have recently given my GRE and got a great score: 160(V)+169(Q).
I have decided to apply for 2019 fall and since I have more than half a year before the application process starts in November, I would like your suggestions on how to improve my profile to make it stand-out more. I will be targeting top 10 data science programs and my ideal program would be MCDS at CMU.
I should add that since my major was in ECE I will probably face an even tougher time as I have seen my other friends struggle with this.

Ideally, I would like to apply to a college which would give more cred to work-exp and where my bad grades would not dampen my application much.

I must also add that during my term break in 2014 I have done a 2 month project in an external university where I helped the professor with his project; Natural language processing: Translating English to Indian Languages (Hindi). This is the only research experience I have. The professor was quite old while I was working on this project and I guess he has retired as I was unable to find his profile on the uni page.

Currently I am looking for ways to offset the low GPA and any suggestions are helpful. I would also like to know if I can try for any foreign research assistant positions that would help me get good LORs for application.
I can get great LORs from my supervisors but as far as I know academic recommendations have more impact on the application than the former.

I have shortlisted my options below. What do you guys think about them:

 * continue to work (best case scenario: get promoted - probable but hard, due to internal politics).
 * resign and work in a research lab (how?) or under a professor in related field.
 * Foreign internships (like MITACS or DAAD) or research assistant-ship (is this possible ??).
 * Coursera courses (deep learning specialization) - 3 completed, 4 in pursuit.
 * Try for onsite opportunity in company (highly improbable).

**tl;dr:**

I have completed my college from top Indian university with 7.0/10 CGPA.
Since I basically flunked 4 years of college, I want to have another shot at proper education. I have recently given my GRE	and got a great score: 160(V)+169(Q). Things are a lot different from 2 years ago and I am more confident about this.
Now I am looking for ways to offset the low GPA and any suggestions are helpful. I would also like to know if I can try for any foreign research assistant positions that would help me get good LORs for application.
I can get great LORs from my supervisors but as far as I know academic LORs have more impact on the application than the former.

I will be mainly targeting North American universities (esp US) but I am also open to European universities.

I have shortlisted my options below. What do you guys think about them:

 * continue to work (best case scenario: get promoted - probable but hard, due to internal politics).

 * Coursera courses (deep learning specialization) - 3 completed, 4 in progress.
 * Try for onsite opportunity in company (highly improbable).


PS: I am not sure how to convert my CGPA to GPA on 4.0 scale. As far as I know the average student in US would score around 3.0. The grading in my program was tougher and an average student would get 7.25 - 7.5/10.
I would also like to know if the reputation of my university carries any weight during while evaluating my application.

Thanks for reading. Have a great day.

My only fear is that the projects that I did in college feel very easy(reading ASCII images, decrypting/encrypting data and Java for programming TCP sockets) and that I will really struggle with commercial programming once I find a coding related career.

I have worked for 7 months as a net engineer intern in an ISP but I didn't program at all, I was just updating an already existing PHP(as far as I was told it was in PHP) database and logging into routers and updating the database etc using up IP addresses onsite and later from home via a company laptop.

My question is what are some careers or places I could look for a career that would suit someone with my networking/programming skill set

I had some notes I took for what I wanted to ask and what points I wanted to notify them of, such as my work history, etc. I had also asked about an IT security position I applied to due to my major being Cyber Security and asked if there was any overlap between the two, because the Help Desk Position is what I did last summer and she said they're not hiring any security interns at the moment although there's a job posting. She didn't ask me if I had any questions pertaining to the company and said she will pass my resume up to the hiring manager of IT and will notify me next week for further details, but I'm unsure of it. The interview only lasted 10 minutes to my surprise. 

Was it rude of me to inquire about the security position? I'd love to take the help desk position if possible to garner more experience but I was curious about the security portion."

83kj19,1,2018-03-10,HackerRank Coding Challenges,brownenotbrown,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/83kj19/hackerrank_coding_challenges/,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently a sophomore at University of California, San Diego, studying Computer Science with an emphasis on Machine Learning and Neural Computation. This past summer internship recruiting season has been... rough, to say the least.

Of the 40+ applications I filled out and two career fairs on campus that I attended, I ended up getting rejected from a majority of them. A few companies were interested but didn't like that I'm not a junior; some had already filled their hiring spots, and others just rejected me straightaway. This was all expected though; my only true experience is as an undergraduate TA for some courses in the CSE department.

However, two companies did end up sending me evaluations (Dropbox and Bluebeam), but those evaluations ended up being on HackerRank. I did sort of okay on both, but overall, I didn't do well enough and didn't progress beyond that first initial online evaluation.

Both times, I felt that the questions they asked were too difficult for the amount of time allotted. I know I'm not an outstanding programmer yet, so I'm thinking that I may just need a new strategy for these type of challenges. What should I do to be more adequately prepared for these challenges next year?

I've read a decent amount of articles online saying that these types of challenges are really unhelpful and shouldn't be used and stuff, but this doesn't change that I more than likely will have tons more of these things in the future. I've been completing challenges on Leetcode and HackerRank but those don't have the same pressure as the timed challenges sent by those companies.

Any advice for how succeed at these in the future?"

I posted here a few days ago asking about SQL I believe asking a similar question. I am stuck because there are so many interesting things I want to learn and they can all solve relevant problems in my life:

-I work for a nonprofit that would like to set up a database and SQL is a very employable skill so I want to learn that.

-I'd like to set up my own website based resume using Javascript at some point this summer

-I also would like to revamp the nonprofit's website this summer with javascript

-I enjoy C++ a ton(I enjoy all of this a ton) but only know the bare basics and would like to know more(I can make text-based console adventure games, would like to get really in-depth knowledge of c++ because about 80% of the places I'd like to get internships in college require it!) I'd say this is my favorite choice and I'd honestly be okay with ditching all other options for this except I just feel like I'm missing out if I do that.

-My college won't let CS students take a Data Structures and Algorithms class until spring Sophomore year which is an issue since I want to apply for internships all years of college. So I'd like to take some sort of MOOC(Preferably from a reputable source on EdX) over this so I can start working on it in my own time so I'll be more prepared for interviews when that time comes

Also, I really want to start contributing to open source ASAP and I feel the only way to do that would be the focus in on one language here but correct me if you think there's a just as suitable way.

Maybe I'm just way too ahead of myself but I just have this fear of being underprepared because that was basically the story of my life in high school. But I am also very very anxious to learn everything here, it all seems fun to me and it can all solve a problem in my life so now I'm just confused about what to do!



Side note: I'll also be learning Java next year...taking two high school classes(one taught through local college about programming in java directly and one is AP Computer Science Principles which allows Java as one of the languages to be used) so I'll be learning that next year too though I'd say Java was the language that started me with serious programming/the fundamentals of computer science and I'm already fairly strong in it as far as amateurs go."

My current situation: I'm working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, but I won't be finishing it anytime soon because of finances (at least 3 years). So now I'm looking at full time Help Desk positions. I've been working as a help desk intern for a little over a year - the pay is decent for an internship and for how easy the job is. The problem is my IT knowledge and skills have actually dulled over the time I've been here, and I've taken off most of the skills I used to have from my resume. I do the same work as full time help desk employees (at my company), and most of my responsibilities are:

- Building/imaging PCs/laptops. This is mostly automated (PXE server/SCCM). I just go through a couple of menus, and then have to make sure all the requisite software and security measures have been installed. Occasionally I'll have to look through logs to see why certain packages failed to install. Pretty simple stuff.

- Installing printers/printer maintenance. 

- Software installs (really just pushed out through SCCM. Sometimes I'll have to look through SCCM logs to figure out why a package isn't work it and email the details to the admins)

- Moving employee equipment

- Replacing employee desktops

- Deploying laptops to employees and the instruction required

- Level 1 tickets and phone support. (Really easy stuff like account unlocks, network drives not mapping properly, users having trouble figuring out software, driver issues etc)

- Following up on tickets, documenting work notes in tickets, etc

- During my free time I mess around with PowerShell to write simple scripts to make my life a bit easier. This isn't that fancy, I just take scripts that I find online and patch them together and edit some stuff to create patchwork scripts. 

And some other miscellaneous tasks that aren't really worth mentioning (such as asset management). 

I don't want my next position to be this fruitless, so after another year or so of a full time help desk position, I'd like something more challenging. 

Here's what I'd like advice on:

Before I started this job, I already had 2/3 of the Windows Server 2012 MCSA exams passed. Between school and work, I have very limited time, but I'm on spring break now and I'll have 2 months of just 40 hour work weeks in the summer to work on certs. **Should I focus on finishing the MCSA track, or should I work on basics like A+, and Security+ and CCENT to land a full time help desk position?**

My gut is telling me to finish the MCSA, but most help desk jobs I see require A+ and some of the recruiters I talk to don't even know/understand what the MCSA is. (Also all the stuff I learned for 70-410 and 70-411 has been irrelevant for a help desk role)

-or- 

**Should I focus on getting a SCCM cert?** I've fallen in love with how powerful SCCM is but I don't think it's realistic for me to pursue a job working with SCCM until I have more years of actual full time help desk experience on my resume.  

Apologies for the super long post, I just wanted to be clear about my situation. "

So I was kinda confused since I came across few sites such as teachyourself cs and opensource university. So should I follow there curriculum over the summer or should I get a course on udemy and follow that course or maybe pluralsight or udacity.
I am doing this because I have refused to do internships As I want to level up my skills and get better understanding,
I need a better Advice Should I intern or should learn and pickup new skills and better understanding of computer science principles.

Female international student (Canada), grade 11 at a private school (I go with merit-based financial aid, 50% tuition)

GPA: we don't calculate it, but counsellor said it was 97 on a 100 scale (but when I calculated it was 96? Whatever, let's go with the higher one lol)
Not sure if it's right because I did it myself, but got around a 4.05 UW and a 4.69 W GPA.
(I'm a solid 5~10% ahead in my STEM subjects compared to English and Humanities. Essays are a nightmare for me.)
(also, I have a somewhat upwards trend like 1% per year since g8, when I may or may not have been addicted to gaming)
Still managed to make the Distinguished Honour Roll since grade 8 (I think it's for having an average that's 90 and over)

ACT: 36 (36 grammar, 35 math, 35 reading, 36 science 8 essay)

SAT II Math 2: 800
SAT II Chem: taking later this year
SAT II Physics: taking in April

APs:
G10: AP Physics 1 (4)
G11: AP Physics 2, AP Physics C (both of them), AP Human Geography, AP Computer Science A (taking all exams in May)
G12: AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics, AP Lang, possibly AP Micro/Macro?
Our school discourages taking APs outside of school, so I'm taking all the courses I can in school and a few that aren't offered at school like Physics C.

Other courses:
Accelerated math (take 1 grade earlier) since grade 8 (currently in grade 12 math)
Accelerated English (same as above^) starting this year (boy, I made a mistake. Still getting a higher mark than my English mark last year, though.)

ECs:
Lots of regional awards and scholarships for flute
1st in provincials, 2nd in nationals, going to be competing in provincial/nationals again this year
principal flute in youth orchestra which I've been a part of for 4 years now
part of the Canadian national youth band last year
part of the school orchestra, chamber choir, and choir
math club captain + a few minor awards in math contests
science club, robotics club, yearbook club, ""underground"" engineering club (coordinate meetings)
lots of science challenges but no prizes here
SHAD Valley (competitive STEM summer camp)
A few engineering summer programs at UBC
A couple computer programming internships at local companies

Volunteering:
Coordinator for peer tutoring organization for kids who need help with reading and math
occasional volunteer at events for Kids Code and Canadian Cancer Society

I'm only applying for high reach schools in the US because there are a lot of good schools that are match/low reach for me in Canada (and slightly easier for me to get into + financially more feasible). 

I'm mostly interested in engineering, sciences, and computer programming, but I can't really choose between them, nor the schools I want to go into. I don't want to apply to too many schools (at most 8?) because the applications might become a burden and affect my grade 12 marks.

For music, I've considered going into it, but as much as I love performing, composing, and playing, I can't do it for a career. I just really can't. Performing is fine, but competing/auditioning just wrecks my nerves and I do very poorly. Nope.

My mom is also the only one supporting our family and she makes barely enough to continue sending me to the private school with financial aid AND support me in my music endeavours. If I even have a chance at my reach schools, I probably need financial aid...

Another note that my application essays may be at best slightly better than average. As I said before, essays are not at all my strength. I'm also very bad at speaking confidently, so I can't really depend on doing well at interviews. :(

Thank you so much! &lt;3 "

Here's the context and a summary: 22 year old student from Bulgaria. Studied 2 years CS at a university in Sofia , where I was introduced for the first time to Computer Science. Switched to Pure Mathematics after 2nd year, and my graduation got delayed a year. The Math program sucks big time, and I see no career prospects of finishing it, and to top it off I already have an accepted offer for full-time internship at a good tech office here in Bulgaria. 

To clarify: an education here lasts 4 years, and I am currently a 2nd year at Mathematics (was supposed to be 3rd year in CS).

So here I am, completely sunk in depression about my terrible choice making, trying to decide what my next move should be and trying to let go of regret and fear. I decided to post here, because I know I will get advice from software engineers and developers from all walks of life. To start off, here's what I was considering:

I am thinking about several options:

   - Entering industry without finishing a degree, and maybe years later return to finish a CS degree, or perhaps go to a foreign university (although, I don't know whether mature students are allowed financial aid). Here it would be nice, if anyone knows which Universities are best suited for mature students.

   - Starting this CS degree over (I have already completed 2 years of it, so I think at least the credits will be accepted, and I will just have more time to take more elective courses) and finish in perhaps 2 to 4 years time.

   - Continue with Mathematics, barely scraping by, finish with awful grades, if I finish at all, and just focus on my internships and code in my spare time.

Please, can you give some advice as to what I can do? Are there other options I am missing out on?

I have been in contact with several people about these issues, my mother, two of the teachers responsible for my internship and several of my friends and nothing has made me able to tackle them.


I'm just going to lay it all out as what has set me off were several episodes last week and has made me anxious and extremely nervous to go to work tomorrow. I just feel like hell.


I am a teaching intern at a public school and this internship has been extremely hard on me. We are six students at a school in two groups of three and we're supposed to take care of the English lessons for a class of 14 year olds that sometimes can be quite a mouthful.


I'm in a team with ""John"" and ""Mary"". 


On Monday Mary was supposed to teach a 90 minute morning lesson for these kids and I was not doing too god. I hadn't slept more than 4 hours and I didn't manage to get breakfast, so I was already not in my best shape. Mary and John has a different approach to these students than me, as they will reprimand and yell at them in a much harsher fashion than I would, add to that, Mary is scary to me in general. She is a tiny 24 yo, who talks about teachers, students and John behind their backs. She's is constantly complaining and being shrill. So yes, as you might have guessed, she's the one making things hard for me.


Add to that, this lesson their usual teacher wasn't there, so we had a substitute instead, meaning we are four teachers during this lesson.


Mary starts the lesson out by telling the kids to converse in English about their favorite movie. Two of the boys aren't willing to participate, despite my trying to motivate them. I drop the subject, since I don't believe this is a battle worth fighting. Mary decides to start arguing with the students and ends up making them do grammar and again starts a conflict with them when the other kids are reading for a new activity. Mary yells at them for not participating, which confuses even me. As we're four teachers (three interns and the substitute) in the room, I feel the atmosphere as very tense and I don't really feel like I can help in any way. I want to make light of the situation and keep establishing a good rapport with the students, as we'd agreed beforehand but can’t do this without undermining Mary’s attempts at disciplining, I can't really tell Mary that I think she's overreacting in the middle of a lesson either and I hate this approach of yelling at the students myself, meaning I won’t be joining in the abuse, so I decide to step outside to check on some students out there. They're reading. Acknowledging that I'm kind of stuck because I can't disturb the students and I can't see myself as a positive force in the classroom, I stay outside.


Mary ends the lesson by reprimanding the students once more and I feel sick to my stomach at the end, because of how unmanageable the situation became. Then John and I spend over an hour trying to calm Mary down, me trying to be constructive about it, and John mostly agreeing with her about how terrible the students are and now right she is to be offended. During this I completely lose all motivation to stay positive, because I realize I have to spend my energy keeping Mary happy and agreeing with the two or risk the whole team falling apart, since I just can't take more of that negativity.


The next few days I spend in agony, because I know that at any point I'm with Mary, I will have to listen to her negativity and I don't feel like going to work. Also, we have a meeting with the regular teacher scheduled on Wednesday. I really don't want to go to this meeting, as every meeting so far, has been John and Mary complaining about the students. 


At the meeting, Mary is already there talking with the teacher. My thought is “oh no, are they talking about me? Is she now bent on ruining my reputation as well? No calm down”.


Mary starts out by saying that she feels like John and I abandoned her during the lesson and she is especially angry that I left the classroom. I am mortified by this, since not only is she attacking me, or reprimanding me, really, while the teacher and John are there, she is also disrespecting me immensely.


How do I handle this situation? I can't remember exactly what happened, I was experiencing so much inner turmoil. But I believe I explained that I thought there were too many teachers in the classroom and I couldn't see myself helping out. She continues the tirade, so I respond annoyed that I don't think it's okay for her to blame the failure of the lesson on me. We make agreements about teaching the next weeks without the issues being resolved.


I have the lesson on Friday and I take on Monday as well, as to not stress Mary out further, but we don't manage to make a complete plan and at this point I'm scared to be in the classroom with Mary. Cue another day in complete agony.


I go straight to bed when I come home, I just can't handle anymore. In the evening I write an e-mail to our teacher at the college, who is responsible for the internship detailing my problems. She writes me the next day about how to proceed. I also write a mail to the teacher at the school about not wanting to teach the next morning due to issues in the group and not feeling like continuing things. She is understanding and kindly offers to tell John and Mary that she will teach on Friday, which I agree to. I also tell her that I want to do the exam alone, even though we had planned to go together, again, I am scared of working with Mary. The teacher relays this information as well.


I don't talk to any of the two before Friday, when I meet Mary on the bus, we exchange a few words about her new cellphone, but she doesn't seem talkative and I imagine she is angry with me. So that is it. On our way to the school I am walking in front and we talk a bit about the snow. I am painfully aware that I might offend her, by not slowing down to walk beside her, but I guess if she's angry with me, it doesn't make sense and isn't it normal for some people to work together, but not be happy about each other's company?


At the school we hardly speak, we're both focused on our cellphones until the meeting with the teacher, where I'm supposed to explain what's going on. I stick to what I've been counseled on by the teacher at the college. ""I feel that our way of handling the planning and execution of a lesson is too different and I'd prefer that you two observe when I teach and I do the same during your lessons, also I would rather do the exam project on my own"", this is what it's meant to sound like, but of course I'm stammering and stuttering, not making much sense probably. I feel horribly sensitive.


Now Mary makes my worst fears come true, she openly confronts me about being ""mad at her"", ""not wanting to talk to her today"", ""making it personal"". I respond that I'm not willing to talk about it under these circumstances that this is something that should be discussed in private. At this point I'm feverishly looking at the teacher for help and I feel like I'm drowning and completely empty inside. The teacher tries to negotiate some sort of agreement and I just try to de-escalate the situation. The teacher ends up saying that ""she thinks this is very hard"", ""she's no psychologist"" and ""seems like Mary and I should have a chat"", she even points out that my body-language communicates that I would rather not talk.


What makes this such a humiliating experience, is the fact that I have to illicit help from the teacher. I don't feel like ever going back there and yet I have to teach tomorrow. I just want to run away and never show up again. I almost started crying. Worst of all, they all saw me humiliated and helpless and it makes me want to kill myself for being so worthless.


I talked to Mary after the meeting and she was still angry about all of the things listed, which we talked out, but she made it seem like I had fucked up, obviously this is what it was about. I asked whether she understood that I didn't like being confronted with a personal confrontation in public and I don't think she acknowledged it. She did however say that ""I could always come to her with my issues"", ""she wanted me to have a good internship but was adamant that she should too"" and that she wanted to continue to cooperate in the future.


Yet I just don't think I can handle this last week and I feel like never showing up at school again. I can't handle the thought of being near her, having to keep up appearances and being friendly. I never want to talk with her again and I can't see myself looking anyone of the three in the eye.


What if she does something similar again? What if she brings it up? What if one of the guys in the other group points it out during lunch?


I feel like entirely removing myself from this situation and never looking back. 


I am not a strong person right now, I know that. I am very anxious and very neurotic. I spend half the time being scared that previous fuck-ups will ruin my life and make people ostracize me. I have low self-confidence, I am sometimes paranoid. I was somewhat convinced Mary would want to sabotage me even before the internship, because I had drunkenly committed a horrible faux par during out first meeting, which I had apologized for. But since working with Mary my fear was mounting as she was describing the offence she took by so many of her acquaintances: her roommate, who was always on her lips because she had committed yet another horrible blunder and gotten on Mary’s bad side without really doing much; John, who admittedly is a bit eccentric, for being a bit too forward or confident in his opinions; the students at the school and the teachers. I expected her eventual revenge to be pre-meditated, but I don’t think it was, I don’t think she really means any harm, but I am terrified regardless.


What should I do?"
83olcw,1,2018-03-11,still upset over someone,aantho,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/83olcw/still_upset_over_someone/,"this is a update to the post i made with my other account 

POST https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7ox4hy/almost_killed_myself/?utm_source=reddit-android

i wanted to thank everyone from that post, 
u/KeronCyst
u/KungFuDabu
and u/throwawayguy11115
even though they commented just once and we didnt really talk, i wanted to let you know that you guys helped a lot &lt;3

so here's the update
I began speaking to Allie again, she ignored me for a short while but on New Years, we began texting again. So after that she began to grow on me and I began to 'feel' things. I wanted to get closer to her but didn't know how. We only knew each other through our history class and through theatre club. I mostly sat by myself during lunch at a tree and just listen to music. One day she asked me about what I did there at the tree.
""so antho, why do you sit there all lunch?""
""I have no one to talk to""
""why not sit with me?""
so at that point I was hesitant. I never been invited to be with others so I didn't know what to do. I accepted it and soon we began sitting together, eating lunch and watching cartoon network shows. I thought I liked her and she liked me. Then came February, I was ready to tell her, I wanted to tell her so bad. I began asking her stuff about her and from there I bought her chocolates, sunflowers and made her a card saying what needed to be said a while ago. It was a B-Day so we didn't have history class together and she had to leave off campus for her internship program. So I brought it all up to her morning class and left it there for her. The day goes on and comes lunchtime and I go and sit at our usual spot with her friends that aren't in the internship program and here she comes. She came over and was really really happy (idk if its just her natural personality tho, shes usually positive and upgoing) and she came over 
""hey antho, that was really cute thank you""
and she hugged me.
I don't think I ever touched her before so I just embraced it for the short time it lasted. So I'm happy and we start hanging out and start text each other more. And then she joined the tracm team in the middle of the month. She had to join track because her mom was making her join it. Now things shifted. She stopped texting me and responing to my stories. She still was at lunch but never like talked about anyone to me. I didn't think about it at the time and I thought something happened with her parents and she couldn't talk about it. So around the 20th the school announced the Junior trip to Hollywood Studios, So excited we began talking about it and I settled to go, I was ready to be with her and her friends. The trip was in the beginning of March and we were gonna meet up at the school at 4:00 A.M. in the morning. I'm there sitting on a bench and there she comes over and sits next to me.
""yo whats up allie?""
""hi""
""you got a partner for the trip? I heard you didnt have one so wanna be mine?""
""nah, I got a parnter but you can hang out with us""
Ok, weird the day before she said she didn't have a partner. 
So we are waiting and she goes off to find her partner. So I'm there by myself just listening to music and we get called to board the bus. I sat in a seat and from where I sat Allie sat behind me and here comes her partner, Kyle. (Kyle is a basketball player at our school notorious for being a trashy person, cheated on his last girlfriend) Kyle comes over and sits to Allie and they began cuddling. My reaction was that of shock, anger, and sadness. the whole ride to Hollywood Studios I cried silently while hearing them hugging and kissing and shit. One of her friends saw me and began texting me
""whats wrong?""
""Im upset""
""Y""
""Did you know about this?""
""yea but he's toxic""
Was done, no one told me shit and everyone else was telling me she was leading me on. So we are 2 hours into our drive and we stop at one of those like road stops and I go and sit by myself and there she comes trotting along like the she was in a field of flowers or some shit. and goes up and asks me 
""whats wrong?""
I couldnt even look into her eyes, I couldn't look at her 
""nothing""
""wanna come sit with me?"" 
""no im good""
and so defeated she went and sat with her friends
We make it to Hollywood Studios and I merge into another group with someone else from my theatre club. I saw her a lot through the day and did my absolute best to avoid her at all costs, even walking out of conversations when she came up to talk to someone behind or next to us. So the trip passes and then the next day, I get a notification that she's typing to me over snap, I wait a hour to see if I got a message or not and nothing, so I took the offensive 
""hey you were typing, whats up""
I waited like around 2 mintunes but it felt even longer than that and then
""can I talk to you?"" 
god I fucking knew it
""what about?""
""are you anger at me?""
""yes""
""what about?""
""oh you dont know?""
""yea i do know but i want to hear it from you""
I went and told her everything
I told her, I like her straight up, I told her that she was the first ever person that I trusted fully, I told her that what bothered more the most was that you didn't tell me anything, and then she says
""I didn't tell you anything not because I didn't trust you, it has nothing to do with trust, I'm sorry if I hurt you but I thought you would be happy for me, good night""
it hurt me, when I read that, it hit me harder than any sledgehammer and cutted me deeper than any knife could. However, even with that I didnt want to leave it from a low blow. So I told her.
""Hey I'm happy for you but you have no idea how that makes me feel seeing y'all like that, I'm fine being your friend and forgive you. Sorry for acting like a brat""
""its okay, i understand why you were upset.""
and fron there we talked about the trip and I thought everything was fine between us and that on tuesday we would talk about it and maybe clear some more stuff up. 
Come monday, its a B-Day so I didnt see her that whole day. Come tuesday and she saw me and said hi and didn't talk to me. Weird, usually she would ask about something but she just left me off. Then we were supposed to get into groups of two and we sat next to each other so I turn and she got up and went with her other friends and left me alone. Super weird. She's ignoring me. Sit at our spot, she comes by greets one of her friends and ask something about me and leaves. The whole week she only said ""hi, antho"" and ""good bye, antho"" like nothing was between us and there was no problems. So why ignore me? I never got that answer. So comes to last night, I made a sarahah for the fuck of it and 30 mintunes later she made one too. Weird.
I swiped up and left ""💚 u"" 
and she replied on her story ""💚 u too"" and fron there I changed my name to 💚 so she would know it was me and I sent her a message and it was delivered, hours pass and it was never opened. The next day passes to today and I couldnt find her on my friends list. I fucked up and went too far. I don't know what to do and I still have really have strong feelings for her. I know it in my bones that Kyle is going to break her heart and leave her a broken person. She changed a lot and I'm not the only one to notice it. I don't want her to hate me.

P.S. I think something is bothering her l, during history class she was like laying on her desk and then punched the desk and began kicking her feet together. idk whats going on and I know she isnt gonna tell me 

TLDR, girl i liked betrayed me we talked about, she ignores me now, kinda."

83p46x,3,2018-03-11,Should I use a job offer for leverage in getting a raise?,TVolts,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/83p46x/should_i_use_a_job_offer_for_leverage_in_getting/,"tldr: I'm getting severely underpaid at my dream job and am going in for other interviews this week. I have a large workload at the company and don't believe they could let me go. Should I tell my company I want a raise before or after getting a job offer?


I started out at my current job roughly four and a half years back, right after starting college, as an intern. It's a smaller company (&lt;40), office job, where most of the workers have been around for 15+ years... so it was an amazing opportunity with a great future in growth and job security. When in my hiring interview, I had been told that I would get a raise after each educational milestone with smaller raises with experience gained. There was no need to make it seasonal work though because I was attending a local community college to get my associates degree (aiming for a bachelors, but transferring into a university later to save on money) and the company wanted me around. After a year and a half I was starting to get more accustomed to my position and was given a pretty nice raise and seen as an employee rather than an intern. Shortly after this though, there were a few management changes. Including when one who really helped my cause, the one who mentioned raises with education and experience when I was hired on, retired.

About another year and a half later I finished my associates degree and expected that first raise, but instead, at an employee evaluation, I was given the ""offer"" of coming on full time. This was unexpected as I had always been told I could work as many or few hours as I wanted, including full time if I could handle it. My boss (him and I are the only two in our department) told me I was being cheated, deserved more, and should start looking at other companies. However I stuck around and went on full time because I enjoy my job. I knew I was working at a discount at this point, but there wasn't much I could do (limited job market and my wife and I bought a house) and the flexible schedule we run really helps with my schoolwork. 

After another year (this past Fall), I was expecting some sort of raise with my employee evaluation. Instead, I didn't even have an evaluation - they didn't believe I needed one because I'm apparently exactly where I should be in their opinion. For the first time actually considering them, I started looking at and applying to a couple other jobs. However, I was limited in opportunities because I hadn't yet finished my bachelors degree and most of the positions didn't seem worthy of leaving what I had and switching up my life. Although I knew I was being underpaid, and again I have only received that one raise since starting over four years ago, I didn't know exactly by how much. Until recently, when I found out that a guy who was hired on within the last year and does essentially my job for a different department, makes about 150% of what I do.

I'm now at the point that I handle roughly 90% of the work for our department - my boss covers mainly internal paperwork. I am able to start and finish jobs with little to no input from my boss. My workload has drastically increased recently with multiple large projects coming up. My stress levels have also being going up because of this, but also because of the increase in schoolwork as I'm leading up to graduation after this summer semester. The only thing I can think about constantly is just how much more I should be and have been making. I accepted this back whenever I thought I was missing out on a small sum for the benefits that my job gave me, but it was never worth 50%.

So I've been heavily applying and am here for advice on the rest of this. I really enjoy my job and ideally do not want to leave, instead I want leverage to negotiate my raise. I don't see any other way as I wouldn't think that I can say ""I know xyz makes 150% more than me."", but I feel like I need something to justify myself in value? Other than the workload that I hold and wouldn't believe is replaceable?

I have two interviews later this week. One of them I would willingly accept if they come back with the right salary, as it'd be closer to home and sounds like an interesting position - although a large shift from what I do now. The other is at a much larger company that I would definitely want to work for and more likely to give me an offer I could use for negotiating, but the position isn't exactly what I'd want to be doing there.

The large projects upcoming would be too great for just my boss to handle and there isn't anyone else who could be transferred in to take over my position, but I also doubt they could find a new employee for that either. I like my boss and wouldn't want to throw this at him at this time or burn bridges by leaving the company hanging on these projects. I feel like they couldn't let me go currently, I just doubt that they would approve of such a large raise without having another offer.

Should I try and talk to management prior to getting another job offer, or should I wait and use one as leverage? If I talk to them before having a competing offer, what do I say? Should I mention that I am currently looking and have interviews? Should I tell my boss about all of this before talking to someone higher up? He has no vote in raises, but could be a recommendation. Thanks for reading this far."
83pax5,23,2018-03-11,My unpaid internship just expired and I've been given a very lowball offer to become a permanent employee... what to do,PSChris33,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/83pax5/my_unpaid_internship_just_expired_and_ive_been/,"Alright, so here's the situation. For the past 3 months, I've been working as a web developer for this startup which I landed about 6 months after graduating and completing my bachelor's in computer science. They brought me onboard for an unpaid internship back in December. I was pretty unsure as to whether I should take it, but given that they are only the third time I've ever gotten past a first interview (in 40-50+ tries) and the fact that the only other offer I ever received was from a notorious staffing agency that imposed pretty significant financial penalties for leaving or getting fired early... I decided to take it since I was desperate for some real world programming experience and didn't want to face the prospect of being in a situation where I'd be more than a year since graduation and no job. The hours haven't been too bad thus far and I get to work from home most of the week since this company doesn't even have an office space yet.

&amp;nbsp;

That being said, since my internship officially expired on the 9th, they tendered me an offer... and quite honestly, it's a very disappointing offer. I'm being offered $560/week to come aboard. That translates out to about ~$29k a year and given a 40 hour work week, is $14/hr... which is literally exactly minimum wage where I live (Toronto). The industry standard for entry level web devs, according to my research, is $51k. Yeah. So... what should I do now? Should I...

&amp;nbsp;

1. Take it and immediately start looking for work elsewhere? I don't wanna have a rep as a job hopper but outside of summer part time, this is my first job in my field, so I don't think that should be an issue. That said, that may arise, so who knows.

2. Say no and start looking for work elsewhere? This offer is straight trash, no doubt about it. But some money is better than no money and given the flexibility of the job hours wise and working from home, I can always get out to interviews whenever I need to.

3. Take it and stick it out? They're not in great shape financially but they promised to give me a raise as soon as they secure some more financing. Plus, the long game could be nice if the company goes anywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, I really enjoyed my 3 months working there. and it's never been about the money, because truth be told, if it was something like even a $40-41k salary, I would take it since I enjoy working there and the relative lack of stress is far more valuable to me than any money. But this is a truly terrible offer. I'm so conflicted on what to do, but I'm really leaning towards #1. But I'm not sure and need some help here."

I attend Stony Brook University and am currently in the spring semester of my freshman year. I have coded Python for one semester and Java for about 2 months now. I basically decided on CS bc the program at Stony was great and I think I'm enjoying it. I have a 3.67 gpa right now. 

My friends mom (who works for Oracle) just told me she could get me an internship for the Summer.

Here is my dilemma:

How am I going to get this internship and assuming I do because of inside connections, what am I going to be expected to do?

I have only been coding Java for 2 months, and have just started learning about classes, and 2D arrays. I can't imagine being able to do much in terms of help and I can't imagine being paid for the work  at that point. I'm currently coding everyday in order to grasp topics more and learn new things everyday, but still, I have no idea what I would be doing. I wanted to take another CSE class over the summer, so I think I would still do that, but otherwise, I would love the internship, I am just skeptical. "
83pve6,8,2018-03-11,College Student with a good problem. Too many opportunities to pick from. Need some advice.,whitebojxsn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/83pve6/college_student_with_a_good_problem_too_many/,"Let me preface this by saying I am in no way bragging or overstating facts. I have worked really hard to get to where I am right now. 
As the title states, I am in a predicament, but a very good predicament. Here’s a little background info:

I am a senior studying Construction Management, which if you aren’t familiar with the industry, is booming in most major cities right now.  I have one last summer to intern, and I will graduate in December 2018.  I currently live in Baton Rouge, LA and have been an intern for one of the states top commercial general contractors for the last year and a half. They are a great company with great people, culture, and benefits. In the last 18 months of working for them I have developed a great relationship with many of the people that work there, and although they haven’t given me a written offer for full time employment, they have hinted that I will be getting one before I graduate. 

Here is the dilemma. Over the last few months I have been reaching out to other companies in other states, and attended the university engineering job fair to interview with some other companies. I’m doing this because I obviously want to network and get my name out there just in case things don’t work out with my current job.  Because I have a great resume, very high GPA, and tons of valuable experience, at least 7 other companies have been knocking down my door: offering me summer internships and even full time offers to start upon graduation. The only reason I would want to leave my current company is that I want to get out of Louisiana, and that is the only state my company operates in. I have the opportunity to basically choose any city in America that I would want to work. 

I want to talk to the head of Human Resources at my company ( who I have a good relationship with) about these other companies and the offers that I am getting. I have a feeling that if I accept a summer internship with another company, I may hurt some feelings and ruin my chances of getting the job that is guaranteed to be mine if I stay with my company. Like I said, I really like the company I’m with now, but the opportunity to work in a more desirable location has me excited. 

How should I go about talking to head of HR about this? Should I tell him that I have other offers, and try to use that to get a full time offer from him sooner than it would normally come? Should I straight up ask him that if I choose to intern with Company B for the summer, would you guys take me back if I decide I like you better? Also, I feel like this is a great opportunity to “wage bargain” with my current company to get a higher starting salary if and when I start my full time employment (I know that is risky and can come off as arrogant but I want to make as much money as possible right?)

Professionals of the reddit community, please give me some advice on how you would handle my situation. "

I graduate from college I’m May and my dream has always been to move from Ohio to the West Coast. I have two job offers, one in Ohio and one in my ideal location. 

Job 1: I would be a marketing coordinator for a nonprofit on the west coast in my ideal city. 
Pros: The job and location are exciting to me and I really enjoyed the people who interviewed me.
Cons: This is an Americorps VISTA position, meaning that I receive a stipend, help with moving costs, and $5000 off of my student loans after completion of the 1 year program. I would have time to network in my ideal area but I would not technically receive an income. Although I would have roommates and a second job, I’m nervous to do this in a high COL area.

Job 2: I have been a marketing intern at a nonprofit for roughly a year and a position as the Marketing and Development director has been presented to me. It pays roughly $34,000 which is okay for the low cost of living area I’m in.
Pros: it’s an exciting job and I like the people I work with. I would also get to be near my Ohio family and have a reasonable income to work with.
Cons: my dream is to move and I’m afraid that if I hesitate here, something in the future will prevent me from moving. 

TLDR: Please help! Should I move to my ideal city on the West Coast and struggle financially or should I accept a comfortable position in Ohio even though this is not where I’d like to be?

Thanks for any help or insight you can give me!!"

I'm currently a second-year at the University of Chicago. I'm majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics and I'm hoping to go to pursue a PH.D. in CS. 

Essentially here's my stretch goal, I want to go to Oxford and intern at the FHI (Future of Humanity Institute) working on technical AI safety. Here's the problem, machine learning is really hard to get into as an undergrad. I've been taking statistics and advanced math courses to prepare for my first machine learning course next fall quarter. However, currently, I've only played around with neural networks and basic learning methods, no research or projects to be had. 

I know that I should try and engage with the faculty to see if I could do research, however, there are literally only two people who do ML research and I don't want to burn through them before I even take a single ML class! I've been thinking about just self-teaching myself and working on projects with Kaggle, but I'm not sure if that's a great idea. I have research experience working on coding for the astrophysics department, and I'm sure I could find someone in one of my major's allied departments to do research with. 

How fucked am I for pursuing this goal, and what advice should I try and apply to up my chances of success with applying for this internship next winter? Thanks!"

Though, I honestly don't know where to start. I don't know what steps I should take. I feel overwhelmed. Though, this is what I want. I can see a future in this field.

I'm not sure if this is allowed or not, but I want to give everyone reading this a bit of background information. I want to let others know where I'm coming from and why I'm looking to enter this field. I apologize if I'm crossing any boundaries, I'm new to Reddit. 

I'm not going to sugar-coat it, I'm poor. I don't have a penny to my name. My parents have always worked hard for me. Even now, they're willing to support me until I figure things out. They did their part and I'm grateful for that.  I really am. They are my motivation. 

I want to move up in the world, I see the IT field as the land of opportunity. All I need is an opportunity to make something of myself. I've always loved technology too. In my eyes, entering this field is perfect. I'm going to make my parents proud. I'm going to become someone. It's about time for me to do my part now. 

I've looked into it and I really want to become network engineer, along with that, I want to work with hardware and such. It seems as if I need to earn certain certifications. Such as a CCNA certification.

What steps can I take to break into that specfic part of the IT field? How do I gain experience? What type of jobs can I apply for that give me hands on experience as a network engineer? Are internships good, if so, which ones? etc.

My resources are limited but I'm determined and willing.

Excuse me if I'm all over the place, for those who read this all, thank you. It means a lot to me. I have no prior knowlegde or experience. I just know that this is something I want.

83rdg3,7,2018-03-11,Prepping to save for MBA worth it?,mozillameister,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/83rdg3/prepping_to_save_for_mba_worth_it/,"My lease runs out tomorrow for my apartment and planning my finances for next year. Applying FT for 2019 and starting in the Fall next year. 

I already saved $30k over the past 5 years and my new position is a $20k bump from prior. Have stock investments that I'll sell now and make $12k on including taxes, and planning to sell some collectible items I have for another $6-8k.

I was looking at loans, and the rates are actually a lot more reasonable than I expected (3-5% annually). Which made me wonder...is it worth it to even save for an MBA considering the personal sacrifice to do so now and amount of income made post MBA?


------



Extra details:
Assuming a $30-40k scholarship for applying early, minority student, and decent stats, most programs would need $120k additional capital with frugal living expenses covered in. Have about $50k already when all set and done. The internship will be another $20k that can go into the pot, so we're talking about a $50-55k loan here.

I can save anywhere from $0-30k this year depending on how frugal I am. 3 options for apartments:

1) Small studio for $1k/mo. The building has mixed reviews (old and some complaining about bugs) but it's cheap and close to work.

2) Small apartment for $1.7k with basic amenities but a new building and trendy part of town.

3) All-in on the luxury living scene for around $2.5k in downtown for a nice apartment with tons of amenities.



I want to celebrate the fact that I can have a higher SOL than I used to, but I've been considering saving for my MBA to minimize loans. However, I'm wondering if that logic holds water when you can just offload a lot of those expenses for just $15k more over 5 years or so."

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10jt6q/the_showers_part_2/)

My name is Jack and some of you may have read or heard a story about me, by me, a few years back.

I’m writing this from the same shitty laptop that I used to drunkenly post “The Showers” on Reddit a little over five years ago. It has spent the better part of two years at the bottom of a box in my bedroom closet. I haven’t had much use for it recently and it honestly isn’t in the best of shape. The damn thing takes about twenty minutes to start up properly and dies the instant it unplugs from its charger. Some of the keys are missing; some of them stick. I’ve spent a good amount of time clumsily cleaning sugary soft drinks cut with whiskey out of every nook and cranny, but a thing can only take so much abuse before it just goes.

Tonight, I got lucky.

She managed to boot, just for me. I think she has one more decent story left in her, for better or worse.

I don’t really remember writing or posting either part of “The Showers.”. I do, however, remember feeling simultaneously listless and restless around that time period. I was tremendously unproductive, not working in my chosen field, and had too much free time to spend thinking about those facts. I had told the story to some friends at the bar one night and shaken some memories loose which led to that post. I woke up one evening and hopped on my laptop to find that the story thread was left open. I had typed it directly into the submission box, not leaving myself anything to edit. I just forced it of me over a couple of long, drunken nights and threw it up on the internet for everyone to see.  I tried to read it but even outside of the memories that I would have rather avoided, each spelling and grammatical error made me want to shoot whiskey or chug bleach. I went with the former and, as far as I can remember I have never made it through the whole story as it was written. It seems pointless to go back and read it even now. I’ve lived through this all enough times in my head. I don’t need to do that to myself.

I did read the comments, though. I may have hated myself, but seeing a bit of interest in my work gave my ego a boost, if only for a moment. I went back every now and then to check on them, but for the most part I was forced to continue on with my stagnant life while the story spread quietly around the web. I worked as a bartender at the time and split my free hours between sleeping and drinking. These occasionally overlapped or synched up with work. It was a vicious little loop I had carved for myself. I wasn’t a writer like I had hoped to be at that point in my life so getting to play one on the internet for a few minutes every now and then helped to break up the monotony of reality.

Over the course of the next several months, I received several emails and friend requests from old classmates or strangers who had taken an interest in my story. My former classmates’ messages generally consisted of their memories of Mr. Mays and his story, asking nothing in return. I had guessed that most of them were either married or lost and needed a dose of nostalgia as a pick-me-up. Who could blame them? Though, some of them actually wanted to meet up, grab drinks, and really get into the past. I lived half a continent away from the town where I attended Mr. Mays’ class at this point, but that didn’t stop me from making empty offers of company to several different people if our paths were to ever cross. I did wind up grabbing a beer with one guy who was “just passing through” on some Summer night in Denver, but it wasn’t what I was expecting. I’m ninety-nine percent sure he had never met Mr. Mays or myself. He dodged specifics when I asked him questions and repeated a lot of my statements back to me in agreement. I remember him nodding his head a lot and saying “yeah, that’s right” over and over again. But he was picking up the tab, so I didn’t notice a lot of this until the next afternoon. That was also the last time I met up with anyone from the internet.

I also got a surprising number of requests for the specific coordinates of the showers from a wide variety of personalities. There were people offering money, transport, and even what was essentially militia support if I would take them there, like it was some sort of guided tour. I turned them down but would be lying if I said I didn’t consider accepting some cash in exchange for the coordinates of any random barn I could pull up on Google Maps. I didn’t, though.

As foreign and surreal as the whole thing was, I did take pretty immediate notice of the power it gave me over people. It felt like I was back around a campfire with a group of friends hanging on my every word, but with a much larger audience. It all started innocently enough. I would be out with a friend, looking for some decent conversation or a better lay. My friend would bring up the showers and ask me to tell the story, then I would fight him on it for a bit before caving, ordering another round, and launching into some variation of the bit. It really did work like a charm. It seemed like every time I went out I ended up with a new friend or another notch on my belt. I hardly had to try; I was just drunkenly wandering down memory lane. After a while I had narrowed my sights, only bringing out the story for certain people for very specific ends. 

I used it to get laid. It’s as simple as that.

I would talk to a girl for a little while, get to know her just enough, take a guess at some of her fears, and work them into the climax of the story. I have faced down ghosts, encountered demons, and even had spiders rain down on me from the shower heads. But, I made it out intact every time, if only ever-so-slightly worse for wear. I was just damaged enough from the experience that a pretty girl might feel some sympathy for me, which I would thank her for while reaching out for her hands or maybe grabbing her leg. All roads lead to the same place: hers. 

I would stumble back to my barren apartment every afternoon, throw on some different clothes, and head back out to the bar. Whether it was for work or play didn’t really matter; like I said, all roads... 

I don’t know how long I spent in this “piece of shit” phase, but I do know that Karen broke me out of it. Initially she was just the next in a long line of women I had yet to woo. We met at a bar where I told her a story which led to her place, but instead of passing out after sex we stayed up and talked. It didn’t feel like needless bullshit, either; I felt like she understood me and I her. In reality, I think we just both liked getting really messed up and swapping stories about our shitty childhoods and mental ailments with someone else so that we wouldn’t have to make excuses for being alone. We actually did have the mental stuff in common, though. Two different kinds of Bipolar Disorder.. We thought that in some strange way it meant that we were perfect for each other. I don’t need to be told how stupid that sounds.

Karen also had a degree in political science from Rutgers, a wicked right hook, and one of the most persuasive and charismatic personalities that I have ever encountered. I worry that sort of thing isn’t going to come across here because of what this is all ultimately leading to. I just don’t want to do her a disservice. We didn’t end up together for a year and a half because we were awful for each other. At that point in my life I was both lost and an asshole. I had turned her into a concept or an archetype in my head; she was the Nancy to my Sid, the Bonnie to my Clyde and we were probably headed down the same path as both couples.. I guess looking back I had fit her into that awful manic pixie dream girl trope in my head. I was a lost guy looking for a girl with hair the color of a mood ring to solve the complex problem that was me. On any given day, she was the love of my life and my partner in crime. The next day, she was my antagonist, an obstacle to overcome. It was all part of this story that I had seen play out in movies and books so many times before. But, in the end it was me trying to fit a square peg in a nonexistent hole. She made me feel good about myself, though. I’m pretty sure I loved her; it’s just that I was simultaneously loving and using her without really realizing what I was doing.This isn’t to say that she didn’t get use out of me. 

She started coming over to my place after we had spent a couple of nights spent together and never really left. Items of her clothing and her toiletries started showing up around the apartment and I just kind of went with it. There was one night where I brought up how we had never actually talked about living together before it had already happened. That night somehow ended with both of us blacking out in tears. But, by the time happy hour rolled around the next evening, we were as good as new. It wasn’t an issue at the time. We just sort of fell in together. I know this probably sounds unhealthy, and it was.

I’ve gotten off track. 

Karen took a great interest in my stories. “The Showers” particularly interested her because she had come across a reading of it on a podcast or youtube channel and knew about it before she had even met me. She thought I was messing with her at the bar, trying to taking credit for a story someone else had lived. But, I was able to convince her and she didn’t let it go after that. After long nights, we would lay in bed together and she would ask me to tell her the story again like some sort of morbid bedtime story. Each time I told it to her I would embellish a little more or shake loose a new memory pulled from deep within my imagination. I don’t know if she actually believed it or if she just wanted to, but it became our “thing.” But of course the story eventually wasn’t enough. She wanted to live it.

“Can we go there? Let’s go to the showers.”

She wanted us to go together and “face them down,” like some sort of boss fight. She constantly told me that it would be good for me to go back there and get “perspective.” 

She was convinced it would help me pick up writing again. Karen always told me that I had such good ideas but that something held me back from letting them loose. She genuinely wanted to help, but I couldn’t see how this would do that. Now it seems obvious. 

I think another aspect of her interest in the showers was just honest fixation. We both had a tendency to key in on a particular subject and dig deep into it until there was nothing of interest left to to uncover. This meant that her attention generally burned intensely before quickly fizzling out. My refusal to indulge her one last wish and take her there kept her going. She would strategically pick the moments where I was just drunk enough to loosen my lips but not so drunk that I was off in my own world to ask about the place. Occasionally she would bring up a piece of information I had told her about the showers while blacked out that would resonate with me enough to put my arm hair on edge. Even if I couldn’t conjure the memory while sober, my body recognized it. I knew she was getting closer to a something in me that I didn’t want to address, but I never stopped her outright. I don’t know if I even believed my own story anymore. I just felt a bit sick when I thought about it. She persisted, using every method in the book to try to convince me to take her there. Every new detail, real or otherwise, would motivate her to push me harder on the subject. It was the middle of Winter when I caved. 

We were living in Fort Collins, Colorado at this time which was only a short drive from Broken Bow, Nebraska. I had still maintained my ground when it came to making a trip there, claiming that I didn’t remember that we didn’t have the time and that I had forgotten exactly how to get to the farmhouse which were both partially true. But like I said, she knew when she could get to me best. We were sat on the couch following a long night of bar-hopping and friend drama. Luckily we had found ourselves on the same side of this particular situation which meant that the night was going to close quietly. We were snuggled together under a blanket and watching the Coen Brothers’ 2013 flick “Inside Llewyn Davis.” Well, Karen was watching while I split my time between nodding off and attempting to read screenplay that a friend of mine had sent me. I had seen the film a half-dozen times at this point. In it, a struggling folk singer loses his way after his partner commits suicide. Spoilers.

Karen and I shared a mutual fascination with the subject of suicide so it was only a matter of time before one of us said something.

“I would hate to jump off of a bridge, I think,” she said. “There’s a chance you live when you’re hitting water and you’d wind up, what, paralyzed or something. I guess I’d feel like an even bigger waste of space if I couldn’t even kill myself properly.” I wasn’t sure if she actually wanted to get into it or not, but I bit.

“I couldn’t jump,” I said, pulling her closely and closing my eyes. “That’s way too much buildup and pressure. Too much time to regret it when you’re falling.” It wasn’t a taboo subject with us. It’s difficult to explain to those unfamiliar with lifelong suicidal ideation, but discussing it in blunt and honest terms is comforting. When faced with it every single day, familiarizing oneself with something typically viewed as morbid was its own sort of victory. We shined a light on it - “know your enemy” and whatnot. 

“Even if it were concrete or lava below me, I couldn’t do it. I don’t want anything flashy, honestly. Give me benzos and a couple of pints of Chivas and I’ll go gentle,” I said.

“Maybe I would jump,” Karen thought out loud. “But I would do it from a plane. I just want that one last rush of adrenaline.” 

“You could stay alive and get a lot more of that,” I replied.

“Not with those kinds of stakes.” She had a point.

“I just want it to be quiet. Let me drink myself to death with a book and some relaxing music to play me out,” I sighed. “Probably some Bright Eyes, I don’t know.”
Karen was quiet for a while. A character in the film overdosed in a bathroom stall and she spoke up. “I just don’t want to go like that. At the very least I’d want to be around friends or even family if no one else is available.” I was nodding off. “Kind of like your teacher.”

I stirred. She hadn’t brought up the story in a while and when she did, she never led into it with Mr. Mays.

“I guess,” I said. If I fell asleep she would be forced to leave it be for tonight

“Let’s go, bub” she said.

“Go where?”

“You know.” I knew.

“Liquor store’s closed,” I grumbled.

“Nebraska.”

“It’s late.”

“Next week. I’ll take it off work. I’ll get someone to drive us.”

“Why would anyone want to drive us to Nebraska?”

“Brian seems interested.”

“In Nebraska?”

“In your story. You could write about it. It’s been awhile since you’ve written. I could bring my camera. From the way you described it I’m sure that I can get some good pictures.”

I was getting uncomfortable but that was offset by my exhaustion. “I don’t want to go.” I didn’t put up much of a fight.

“Please. For me? We never go anywhere and the apartment gets stuffy and it is my birthday next month.”

“Okay, alright” I said, trying to appease her so that I could drift off. “But what about the cat?” 

The next thing I knew, we were packed up and leaving the comforts of home for Nebraska. I had said yes to the trip and then fallen asleep. By the time I woke up the following afternoon, Karen had already secured one of her friends as our chauffeur and was requesting time off work that fit with my schedule. She was so happy and I was on quite a bit of Xanax but I wanted to keep the good times rolling. With our schedules and switching moods, happy was sometimes hard to come by. So I thought about that as we packed up my car. I was asleep before we made it out of town.

I woke up in another dimension. The view out my window was an icy tundra that hurt my eyes; I hadn’t seen that much sun in months and the ice amplified it. Our friend Brian was behind the wheel of my shitty 2005 Ford Escape as we flew down the interstate towards Broken Bow. Everyone called him the responsible one in our group of friends because he wouldn't get behind the wheel after drinking any booze at all. What only Karen and I knew was that he would be high as a kite while driving us all home and telling how he was the only one of us not destined for a DUI. But he hadn’t been in an accident yet so we didn’t say a word. Karen sat shotgun with a Sonic cup in her lap. If I knew her, which I did, she had poured out three quarters of her drink and filled the rest of the cup with vodka. She noticed after a minute that I had woken up.

""Hey bub! Sleep well?"" she asked, turning around in her seat to face me. A vapor of vodka with a hint of cherry limeade flooded my nostrils and burned my eyes. Karen refused to travel long distances without what she affectionately called a ""roadie."" She had adopted the term from her late father who had killed himself when she was fourteen. He had opened his wrists over the sink in the bathroom while Karen was doing homework in her upstairs bedroom and Karen’s mom was doing an intern in her office at work. Her preoccupation with suicide at least came from somewhere logical. She had always idolized Randy, her dad, and hadn’t spoken to her mother in a decade. She told me this story often, frequently reinforcing the idea that any of her idiosyncrasies (read: bad habits) that related to Randy were exempt from criticism. I made my only sensible move in this situation.

“Did you get me a one?”

“Extra cup is for you, my dear. Half and half.” She winked and handed me the styrofoam cup of cure-all. I needed it. My jaw was throbbing. I have always had a problem with grinding my teeth in my sleep. It was so bad growing up that my canines actually grew outward like vampire teeth. It hadn’t been an issue in some time. I figured that the previous night of partying alongside the anxiety about the trip had just taken a toll. I took a sip of the drink and winced. It was about one quarter limeade to three quarters cheap vodka. 

“Burnetts,” I groaned. “I guess it fits the scenery.” Karen laughed. Nothing except the frost-covered remains of last season’s harvest and frozen dirt surrounded us for miles. 

I stared out over the miles of repetitious backdrop for a couple of hours. Barren earth occasionally gave way to tufts of shorn trees that reached futilely towards the grey heavens above, seemingly ignored. They now resembled petrified roots that had aggressively snuffed out any hint of life that had once inhabited their numbers. Every now and then I was able to spot the rusting remnants of a vehicle or a crumbling shed hidden amongst the branches, surely soon to be overtaken by the vindictive woodland. 

The three of us passed the time by fiddling with a barely functioning tape to auxiliary cord converter so that we could play music off of our phones. Unfortunately, even when we had gotten that to work it was still a crapshoot thanks to a spotty 4G connection on the plains. Karen and I chain-smoked Camel Menthol cigarettes, much to Brian's chagrin. He smoked too, but would only touch the baby blue packs of American Spirits which were ""all-natural"" and burned for an eternity. Smoking anything else, he believed, was just asking for cancer. 

The drive was familiar and had me wandering through foggy memories of my last trip to Broken Bow. I was frustrated and getting a bit uncomfortable because of the haze so I had a drink about it. My own head was keeping me in the dark. Brian and Karen, despite having heard the story of the showers tens of times by this point, prodded me for new details once we had crossed the state line into Nebraska. I managed to dodge their inquisition by telling them how it was a violation of tradition to listen to a band while on the way to the concert. This eased the pressure a bit, but my teeth were grinding and my jaw was aching. This place was bringing something out in me, leaving me anxious and reflexively defensive.

Brian had grown up in New Jersey and, despite the relative emptiness of the two lane highway, he was driving like he was still there. I had no problem with sweeping across lanes without a signal, speeding, or rapidly jerking left and rights to exit the interstate on any regular day. As uncomfortable as it might be to avoid the eye contact of an angry truck driver that Brian had cut off, we always got to our destination significantly faster than the GPS estimated. However, today his highway practices were making me queasy. The honks from several angry passerby got to be too much and I threw in my headphones and pulled my beanie over my eyes in an attempt at sensory deprivation. I ended up drifting off after a bit. 

I had a dream that felt vaguely familiar, but I hadn't remembered my dreams in years so I couldn't be sure. I was back at the bar I frequented during college, the same place where I had last met Mr. Mays almost a decade ago. The voices of the faceless patrons around the two of us were muted. I sat next to my deceased former teacher, who was sporting a sweater that read ""I'm the birthday boy."" Mr. Mays looked up at me from a drink, eyes bloodshot from holding his booze and holding back tears. He didn't say anything, but I slowly recalled the conversation between the two of us from years ago which rang through my head loud enough to fill the silence. I remembered his friend, the one they had lost. Mr. Mays looked away from me and into his drink. He didn't look back up.

I heard a noise like dripping water that echoed around the bar. Looking in front of me, I found a highball glass that was filled to the brim with what I guessed to be whiskey. Without a second thought, I threw it back. It didn't sit well. I pursed my lips and sat it back on the table as the lights around the bar began to dim from the outside-in. I rubbed my eyes and breathed deep to quell the nausea, but it wasn't working. The room continued to dim as the dripping noise rang out around me once again. I looked up at the glass before me to find it filled again, the liquid still rippling from a recent pour. Another drop fell from above, breaking the surface tension and spilling drink all over the bar top. I looked up to see a shower head hanging just beyond the light, dripping liquid. The sound of violently shaking pipes echoed around me and the shower head began to shake. It began to erupt just as I was pulled back to reality with a jolt.

I panicked and thrashed about for a moment. My knee and arm cracked as I moved about, adjusting once again to the real world. 

""Woah, bubs. Easy now,"" said Karen with a chuckle.

We had parked at a rest stop. Brian must have pulled in too quickly and hit the curb which is what had woken me up. I tasted Cherry Limeade crawling up the back of my throat and felt my stomach rumble. 

""We're outside of Hastings. Don't know how far. Use the restroom now or forever hold your pees,"" said Karen.

I opened the car door and the icy wind pushed it against me, slamming my foot in the door. Annoyed, I pushed back and rushed across the lot to the surprisingly bustling rest area. I did my business and washed my hands, attempting to ignore the leaking shower heads in the stalls at the back of the room. I felt every drop in my chest. I hadn't had anxiety like this in ages. The nausea had come with me from the dream and I gagged slightly at the sink. I closed my eyes and breathed deeply, pulling a flask from my jacket pocket and looking around me to gauge the judgement I was about to receive. 

The truckers around me didn't take a second look, but a father who was changing his infant at the station near the door shot me a look. Maybe he didn't. I'm not sure why I cared; it wasn't going to stop me. One of the showers in the back turned on full blast. I took a pull from the flask and, unlike my dream, my stomach relaxed and the gagging ceased. I cleared my throat of whatever had built up prior to the nip of whiskey and spit it into the sink. It was a bright shade of red. I didn't panic. I just needed to eat at some point. 

I pushed back through the line of people that had gathered at the restroom door and jogged out back to the car. Karen was sitting inside with the window cracked, holding a dying cigarette halfway out the window. When she saw me, she flicked it out and rolled the window up, gesturing for me to hurry up. I hopped inside and we were back on the interstate within seconds.

""Don't fall asleep on us again, bub. We are gonna need you to steer us from here, I think,"" Karen said.

""Just get us to Broken Bow,"" I said, staring out over some of the harvested fields that looked like they had been burnt. ""I'll guide us from there."" I guess I did do tours.

We continued down the interstate for a while while Brian and Karen sung songs and I sat in the backseat working trying to ground myself. 

""We are gonna need some gas if we are going to be hunting for this place the boonies,"" said Brian. He broke my concentration.

""Well there are only about ten gas stations in the entire state so exit where you can,"" I said. I caught the tail end of a sign that read ""Broken Bow"" but didn't catch the other information. Within minutes Brian was exiting the highway and pulling into what appeared to be a gas station.

It had the pumps out front, and a small convenient store. But behind it was a rickety single-story house. The design was Victorian, but it was faded and chipped to all hell. Some of the windows appeared to be busted in, the holes stuffed with assorted cloths and rags. 

I felt a sense of recognition as I stepped out of the car and began to pump gas. Karen was running inside to grab snacks as Brian shouted after her.

""Get me sunflower seeds,"" he yelled. She was already inside. Brian looked to me. ""Jack, sunflower seeds? Please and thanks, man."" He closed the door behind him before I was able to tell him that I wasn't going inside. I grumbled as I walked into the old station. Brian was driving us, so I couldn't get too upset with him barking orders. I was just irritable and all over the place.

The building had a familiar musty smell to it that, much to my surprise, started to help clear away some of the fog that had been bugging me. I was pretty sure I had been to this particular gas station before. I figured that was  pretty likely considering where we were at and the aforementioned lack of stops in the area. It was a neat coincidence; that's what I told myself.

Karen was up at the counter, cheerily chatting with a young girl who couldn't have been much older than eighteen about something or other. The girl was talking to Karen, but staring daggers at me the entire time. She wasn't even subtle about it. I figured I looked nervous and sweaty, so I didn't blame her for keeping an eye on me. But, it still made me uncomfortable and I found myself grinding my teeth. I was attempting to work the pain out of my jaw muscles with my knuckle while aimlessly wandering the aisles when Karen asked the young lady at the counter point blank:

""What do you know about the showers?"" The woman didn’t miss a beat.

""People don't deal with anything relating to that sort of business around here anymore,"" she said. My legs locked up and I turned my head towards her. She was staring directly at me despite Karen being directly in front of her. ""That was all a long time ago.""

Her eyes remained locked on me. I felt the pain in my jaw pulse and my stomach lurched. This was not possible; consciously and unconsciously I was rejecting the overwhelming feeling of deja vu. I raced for the small hallway in the back of the store. I held my stomach and refused to look up at the woman, but I could feel her gaze on me still as Karen pressed her unsuccessfully for more information. 

I managed to get through the door and locked it behind me before falling to my knees and onto the toilet that sat only a few feet in front of me. I could feel my stomach clench tightly over and over again, but nothing was coming out. I was violently dry heaving and struggling to breath. With the pressure behind my eyes and skull building, I forced a finger down my throat. I thought that if I could just get whatever this was out of me, I would feel so much better. I was choking on my own finger and seeing stars, eyes on the verge of bursting, before I gave up. I didn't need to pass out in a gas station bathroom. That sounded too close to rock bottom for comfort.

I sat back, my body lightly glazed with sweat, and concentrated hard on a number of deep breaths in an effort to get my vision to stabilize. It was a half assed version of a ""grounding technique"" for anxiety that I had picked up at some point. I could feel the pressure release as I wiped away the torrent of tears that had wet my face. My eyes finally focused on a green picture frame next to the mirror above the sink. 

The picture frame read ""You can't choose 'em You just gotta love 'em"" and featured what appeared to be three generations of women laughing while posing outside of a large green farmhouse. The youngest of the three I recognized as the woman at the counter just outside. Next to her was what I guessed to be her mother. Next to the mother was someone familiar. It was a sweet old woman in a sundress, the same dress that she had been wearing when I had ventured into this shop with my friend Steve many years ago. The three of us had a nice conversation about the town and our post-college trip until our motives for staying in Broken Bow were made clear. When she found out that we were in search of the showers, her demeanor changed and she had given us a stern and very measured answer:

""People don't deal with anything relating to that sort of business around here anymore. That was all a long time ago.""

I got to my feet, my head spinning, and splashed some water on my face. I had burst a capillary in my right eye. It was blood red, dilated, and raining tears. I looked like a mess, but didn't care. After spitting up a bit of red into the sink, I walked out into the hallway, shooting one last glance at the picture just to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. It was still the same old woman; I was definitely losing my mind.

I quickly made my way towards the front door, knocking bags of sunflower seeds and sticks of jerky onto the floor. Karen was still talking with the girl at the counter. The girl was no longer looking at me; was she ever? 

If I didn't know Karen, I would have assumed that she was hitting on the girl. But that's just how she was; she had a way with people. 

""You feeling okay?"" Karen looked me up and down with a concerned look on her face. The girl at the counter stared at her. ""Did you get sick?"" I looked at Karen, the girl, Karen again, out towards the car, and back at Karen.

""Must have eaten something bad,"" I said, glancing up at the girl. ""Bad stomach; medications."" She looked at me and calmly nodded, understanding. She seemed to sense that something else was going on, but I didn't care. ""Thanks-have-a-good-day,"" I said, bolting out the door. The bell above me rang. I could feel it in my jaw. Karen followed after giving the girl some sort of excuse for my behavior. 

""Hey, hey!"" Karen caught up with me before I got to the car. ""What's up with you?""

""I'm just tired,"" I said. She saw through that. ""I took a nip that went down the wrong pipe and got a little sick. It happens. Just wanted to avoid her judgy eyes."" I gestured back towards the door. ""I mean, this is Jesus country and I feel like she would try to walk me through a pamphlet or something."" Karen appeared to buy it and we continued towards the car. ""I'm not looking to get saved anytime soon,"" I laughed. 

""Who needs Jesus when you have me as your guardian angel,"" Karen said with an exaggerated smile and wink. I faked a gag. 

""You're gonna make me sick again,"" I said. She kissed me on the cheek and hopped into the passenger seat of the car. Brian had put on a Dandy Warhols album and was jamming by himself.

""I'd like to thank you, my dear. In less than a year,"" he sang, poorly. ""Are we good to go, team?"" Karen took control of the phone and switched the song. ""Bohemian Like You"" blasted through the speakers.

""Let's bounce,"" said Karen, putting her sunglasses on and lighting a cigarette. I tried not to look back as we drove away from the gas station.

Give me a bit to post the next section. This is all getting out as soon as possible."

My grandma had Parkinson’s disease for a good part of her life. In fact, I can’t remember a time when she didn’t shake. It was a part of her, and as much as she didn’t want it to define her, Parkinson’s overtook her entirely. Most people have heard of this disease, and many know someone with it, but the majority don’t realize that it isn’t just about the tremors. Slow movement is a hallmark of Parkinson’s, as is a decrease in facial expressions. Because of the difficulty of muscle coordination, many afflicted with it develop micrographia, or small handwriting. But like my grandma, many people with Parkinson’s can live for years, and in those who live long enough, there is a higher rate of Lewy Body Dementia. 

We didn’t initially realize that she had this type of dementia, probably because it’s not as common as Alzheimer’s dementia, and because, well, we just thought being confused was part of getting really old. Lewy Body Dementia is unique because of the visual hallucinations that accompany it, and they’re not just any random hallucinations either. Descriptions frequently involve visualizations of children playing, or small animals scurrying about, and often it includes seeing deceased loved ones. Sometimes, these hallucinations don’t seem to be distressing to the person suffering from them, and can even be something pleasant for them. However, they’re often extremely unpleasant for others. 

Before I tell about the haunting things my grandma saw, and the horrific things that followed, I should give some background about my grandma’s personality. She was hilarious; not the typical “I-made-you-your-favorite-cookies” type, but the storytelling, prankster, joking, mischievous type. I remember lying on the floor in her living room at the age of 8, surrounded by a ton of cousins in sleeping bags, with my grandma sitting on the piano bench, shaking uncontrollably, but rehearsing the bloody tales of Crazy Dan, or of the poor children abandoned by their parents, only to be stalked by the local escaped prisoners. All these stories were created by her, and the creativity was inspiring. I swear her goal was to make us wet ourselves, (which she accomplished with my younger brother), but I loved these ghost stories, and I continue to tell them to my own kids, much to the dismay of my wife. As usual, my grandma’s own children would chastise her in the morning for psychologically torturing her young grandchildren, but in the end, this was one of our most endearing memories of her. 


Fast forward 20 years. My grandma resided in a nursing home. She was in a wheelchair, and each meal was blended, even the cheeseburgers, as trouble swallowing affects many with Parkinson’s. She was much more quiet, though you couldn’t escape her without hearing a favorite joke. My new wife at the time always got of one of my grandma’s classics: “What are the three rings of marriage? The engagement ring, the wedding ring, and the suffering”. After a courtesy laugh, grandma would turn to me: “How do you kill a polar bear? Line up peas around a hole in the ice, and when the bear goes to take a pee, kick him in the ice-hole”. I couldn’t suppress a laugh every time. 

My grandma didn’t shake as much by this stage of her disease. From her decades of daily dopamine-increasing drugs, she was left with a writhing, constantly moving gesture called chorea. Sometimes her eyes would roll in the back of her head, and you think she was asleep, but then suddenly she’d come back around and continue her story. She still looked forward to my visits, and despite it all, she was social in that depressing nursing home. She even had a boyfriend, Harold (Hal for short), who thought the world of her. Hal, a widower, and a good 10 years older than my grandma, had most of his wits about him, and took to protecting my grandma as his central preoccupation. I initially thought it was because he was so lonely, but I soon realized that he genuinely loved her, as he could have dated any of the other healthier (and less demented) women in the home. 

It was during one of my latter visits before my grandma died that Hal asked to speak with me in private. I was just completing my intern year as a medical resident, and Hal liked to ask me medical questions, mostly about his enlarged prostate, and I assumed this time he’d have similar inquiries. I was surprised when he began asking questions about Lewy Body Dementia. He told me that my grandma’s hallucinations were getting stranger, that she kept yelling at children to keep quiet, often in the middle of the night. I tried using my budding doctoring skills with reassuring phrases like, “Don’t worry Hal, it’s common for people with this condition to hallucinate,” or “It’s okay Hal, these things can be a side effect of the meds...” and Hal seemed to buy it a little. 

Then Hal said, “I’m worried about the little boy she says she sees. He tells her things, and sometimes they come true.” 

I asked him to tell me more about the boy, convinced this was the classic presentation of this dementia. He went on, “She sees him now every night, though before it was once every few weeks or so.”

“What does he do?” I asked. 

“Well, she usually sees him on the edge of her bed. She likes to sleep in her chair you know, and she wakes up and sees him sitting there. She says he does the same thing every time—breathing in and out really fast, leaning forward with his hands on his knees like he’s out of breath. She says he’s real pale, dressed in clothes like kids did in the thirties. And his gums are bleeding.”

“Why are they bleeding?” (As if he knew why). 

“No clue, they just are bleeding—always.”

At this point I’m a bit disturbed but intrigued, wondering if my grandma is trying to freak Hal out. This type of creepy story was right up her alley in her storytelling days. “So what does the little boy tell her?”

Hal shifted uncomfortably, trying to find the words. “Sometimes he says just simple things like, ‘Better watch out for that hot dog’ or ‘don’t take the pill’ or ‘that’s a live wire’—something like that. I didn’t think anything of it because she’s always talking about the kids in the closet or the squirrels in the bathroom, but now some of the things he says to her are…well, strange.”

Having just finished an inpatient hospital rotation, I knew precisely how to handle this. “You know Hal, there’s this thing called Sundowning, and it happens to older individuals, especially at night. They can be perfectly with it during the day, but when night comes, they start getting confused, particularly when they are living or sleeping in someplace that isn’t their home. Sometimes it’s really frightening to people around them, but believe me, it’s common.”

“You don’t understand,” Hal continued, “The things the little boy tells her come true. Just last week, the boy said ‘That rug could kill you’ to her. She told me that he said it the very next morning, and wouldn’t you know it—later that night she tripped on the rug and split her forehead open!” (I’d been meaning to ask my grandma how she got those 4 stitches over her eyebrow.)

“Hal,” I began, trying to not be patronizing, “Grandma falls all the time—I don’t even know why she has a rug in that room, but it isn’t the first time she’s tripped over it…”

“That wasn’t the first time though,” he interrupted, “he told her two months ago about Eloise, told her that Eloise would drown in her toilet. Eloise was the social chair for the B group, and she had that heart condition, but was doing pretty good, then sure enough, the next day, Eloise was found dead in her bathroom, surrounded by water.”

“But Hal, that doesn’t mean she stuck her head in the toilet and killed herself,” I said.

But Hal proceeded, ignoring me. “And then Wendall, the boy told her Wendall’s heart was going to explode. This was last month, and guess what happened to Wendall last Tuesday?!”

“His heart exploded.”

“Damn right it did, his little pacemaker fried right up, there was even smoke and charred skin over it—I saw it!” Hal was standing up now, wobbling on his cane.

I placed my hand on his shoulder awkwardly (he was still six inches taller than I was, even with his severe osteoporotic back). “Listen Hal, pacemakers can’t—“

“And NOW” Hal says, his voice rising, “he’s told her something about me! She told me last night! Something about my brains leaking out!”

Two nursing aids opened the door and came towards Hal, trying to deescalate the situation. “Now Hal, everything is okay, let’s get you back to your room,” they said, ushering him out, and I accompanied him. 

“Hal,” I said, “please don’t worry too much about this, these things can seem troubling, but they are just hallucinations, and no one can tell the future. This is just sundowning.”

He wasn’t buying it now and I sensed he was too upset to continue the conversation, so I headed back to my grandma’s room. She was right were I left her, in her recliner, sleeping. She looked peaceful. When people with Parkinson’s sleep, they don’t shake or writhe at all.


Let me just say that in my medical career, I have spent countless hours reassuring people that what they observe can be easily explained by medical science, or if it can’t be explained, that it’s because it has yet to be discovered. Never do I feed in to their misconceptions that what is happening is paranormal or supernatural. But I lie to myself in this, because I have seen things that are too coincidental and unbelievable to be explained by medical science, and I have many more stories I could share. I knew something was abnormal when I left my grandma’s home that day, but here I was, a new doctor, filled with the knowledge and the power of allopathic medicine, ready to heal the world, and I couldn’t let an anemic boy with gum disease get the best of me or my grandma. 

I was only in town this trip for less than a week, and knowing that my grandma’s days were limited, I made another visit to her the following day. She was watching Wheel of Fortune, her favorite show, when I came in. “Where do baby giraffes eat?” she started. I smiled and put my hand on her twisting wrists. “High chairs.” Her face didn’t crack a smile. I heard this joke at least twenty times before, probably more. 

“Leonard hates this place”, she said suddenly.

“Who’s Leonard, Grandma?”

“The little boy in my room,” she stated matter of factly. “He’s very sick you know.”

I felt chilled. “Is he the one with bleeding gums?”

“Yes, that’s him!” she said, pleasantly surprised that I knew.

“Why does he hate this place, Grandma?” 

“Because, he used to live here, and he couldn’t leave,” she said.

“Grandma, Hal told me about him. He told me about that poor lady that died in her bathroom, and the man whose, um, heart exploded. Hal said that the little boy Leonard told you this would happen before it did.”

“Oh yes, he knows. I don’t know how he does, but he knows so many things.”

I had to ask, “Grandma, Hal told me that Leonard said Hal’s brains were going to leak out. Is that true?”

“Oh yes, he did say that. Sounds unpleasant,” she said, giggling, though her decreased facial expressions held motionless.

“Are you worried about Hal, Grandma?” I asked, more disturbed now.

“Hal, oh no, Hal’s time will come when it comes, just like mine,” she said, then she fell asleep right in her chair. This happened frequently. I glanced down at the rug with its curled edges, such an obvious tripping hazard. Why are these even allowed?  I wondered, and when I looked up she was staring right at me, eyes wide.

“They’ll all burn in hell. All of them.” 

I was speechless. Before I could say anything, she turned back to Pat Sajak, like nothing had happened. Finally, I spoke, “Is that what Leonard told you?”

“Ah hum,” she mumbled, writhing, then again fell asleep.


I told my wife that evening about what Hal had said, about Leonard, about his bleeding gums and his hyperventilation. The thought of that frail boy, bleeding would be enough to torture my 8-year-old self, but to my grandma, he was just a casual visitor, making morbid conversation. I knew I had to let it go, that it was nothing more than a hallucination, brought on by sundowning and Lewy Body dementia. My wife was mortified and thought we ought to ask the staff about it, to see if my grandma mentioned Leonard, his predictions, and whether anything came to pass. I was planning one more visit to my grandma before I left town, and two days later, we both went to the nursing home, planning to make a stop at the administrative offices first. I would let them have it about that rug as well…

As we entered the home, we saw staff in white scrubs sprinting down the hall. “Code Blue, room 15, code blue, room 15” blared overhead, and my body suddenly went cold, knowing room 15 was Hal’s. I grabbed my wife’s hand and followed the staff down to Hal’s room. He had been down for at least a day, I guessed, who knows why he wasn’t checked on the night before or even that morning. There was coagulated blood that had come from his nose. Behind Hal’s ears were bruises, and he had two black eyes, all signs of a skull fracture. Dried clear fluid had dripped from each ear, most certainly cerebrospinal fluid. His brains…

There was nothing that could be done, but in that moment, I knew Leonard was not just a product of sundowning, of dementia. My spine tingled as I thought what “They’ll all burn in hell” meant, and I rushed to my grandmother’s room, forgetting my wife at that terrifying scene. My grandma sat there in her chair as if she hadn’t moved for two days, writhing about, her arms uncontrolled as they dipped up and down. Wheel of Fortune was on. 

“Grandma! Hal’s dead. Did you know he was dead?!” I yelled a little too loudly. Her hearing was fine after all. She continued to watch the show. “Poor Hal, he was so good.” 

“Grandma listen,” I pleaded, “Leonard knew that was going to happen, right?”

“Of course he did silly,” she said, a hint of amusement on her masked face. “I keep telling you—“

“What did he mean ‘They’ll all burn in hell’ Grandma? Tell me what he meant!”

“Well, I don’t know.”

Crying, my wife entered the room and knelt down by my side. I looked at her helplessly, then at my Grandma. “Who’s in trouble, Grandma, who is going to die next?” I needed to do something, even if it was just warning the next victim, or victims.

“I don’t know,” she muttered, with a tone like I had just asked the most ridiculous question.

I stood up. “Grandma, if Leonard comes again, when Leonard comes again, you need to tell him to go away. Tell him he can’t hurt anybody anymore.”

“He doesn’t hurt people, silly,” she said. The look on my wife’s face mirrored my own horror. “Who does then?” I asked.

“Others do. He knows a lot of people, you know.” 

I pulled a chair up next to hers, “Who are these ‘others’ Grandma? I begged. No response. I put my arm around her. “I love you Grandma” I whispered, but she was already asleep. 

The staff knew nothing about Leonard, and hadn’t heard any of these predictions from my grandma either. They looked downward with smug smiles when I told them what she said about Hal, about Eloise and Wendell, about the rug. They said they’d deal with the dangerous rug soon. Bastards. 

“It’s called sundowning,” one of the younger male nursing assistants informed me. “They all go crazy after sunset.”

“Thanks,” I said, and we left shaken and terrified. 


My grandma died four months later. Apparently most of the residents there were being prescribed methadone to help them be more manageable. As time went on, it had an increasingly sedating effect on my grandma and she was completely confused by the end. Her cause of death was choking on one of her blended meals: strawberry ice cream, corn, and hot dogs. 

Right before her funeral, I helped clean out her room. I threw that rug away. The staff wanted us to hurry as there was another tenant moving in that evening, but they were content to watch us carry everything out. Taking a break, I went to the nurses station and asked how old the building was. The young assistants looked at me with annoyance, but an older women piped up from the back office. “It was built in the thirties,” she said, “Used to be a convalescent home for kids.”

Of course it was. 

Nor was I surprised when just 3 years later, my mom called and told me the nursing home had burned down. It made national news that evening: over ten residents and five staff dead. Faulty electrical wire, the story said.

Every. Single. Time. I think it's telling of how truly different their world was when they were our age. They didn't grow up in a world where everything - from what qualifies someone to hold a job to the value of a college degree - changes from year to year. They grew up in a world where qualifications for jobs rarely changed because the jobs themselves rarely changed. They also grew up in a world where college degrees were highly coveted and got you in the door at nearly any business. We grew up in a world where jobs are constantly evolving and where so many individuals have Bachelor's degrees that obtaining one in many fields means practically nothing to employers. Nowadays, many employers care far more about how many years of experience you have in your field than they do about education levels. Parents don't even begin to understand this, but for us, it's common knowledge. We know that to get a good job in many fields, we will either have to get extraordinarily lucky, have good connections inside a company, or work unpaid internships first. Internships and apprenticeships certainly existed in our parents' day, but they were typically paid and practically guaranteed them a position at a company.

Working hard to get where you want to be is a virtue that spans both generations, but what our parents don't understand is that we must work hard for far longer to get where we want to be than they did. One of the reasons that the mental health system is so overwhelmed - at least, in my opinion - is that school and work are far more mentally taxing than they once were, leaving millions of people constantly drained and stressed beyond belief. Many of our parents worked jobs which were far more physically taxing; this left their bodies sore but their minds largely untouched. The rapid evolution of technology flipped the script, and many people just don't understand the causes of the additional stress that younger people are feeling, leaving them without effective counsel from older generations.

I seriously doubt that this is the first time in history that the younger generations have been left largely stranded. And it's wrong to blame our parents for not comprehending our problems. It's much easier for someone to relate to someone else and give that person effective counsel when he or she has had similar experiences in life. The massive changes which have taken place over the past couple of decades severely limited our parents' ability to relate to us; therefore, much of the advice they give us is bound to be largely outdated. 

But we can turn this into a positive.

Those of us who grew up in such a rapidly changing world are used to the chaos; therefore, we will be far more finely attuned to the issues our children will face than our parents are. We'll be able to help our kids navigate through this world far more effectively than our parents ever could with us. So while we're burdened with the responsibility of being the first generations in decades to grow up without much help from older generations, we're also on the road to becoming some of the best parents and mentors of the technological age. 

Just something to think about when you're feeling down! Do with it what you will!"

So I've just graduated from college. I had a relevant internship in a very competitive and oversaturated entry level career field. Only problem is, I quit said internship a while back/dropped out for the semester because I was borderline suicidal. My boss was basically like ""you were good when you were good but I noticed you were slipping/skipping out"". Don't really know what kind of reference she would be.

I'm totally better now and finished with a decent GPA (around a 3.7) but now that I'm looking for entry level, it's all coming back to haunt me, so to speak. I've pretty much blotted that part of my life out but I still have to communicate the technical skills I learned--it was a pretty competitive and valuable internship and definitely sets me apart from other candidates.

I've been framing it as ""I had to deal with an urgent medical issue that is now resolved"". I just worry that this sort of thing will hurt my chances. It's not like I lost the knowledge I learned on the job, but I do think it makes me look lazy or a quitter. I really didn't give my employer any notice, because I truly thought I couldn't continue another day.

Any thoughts? I have a few interviews scheduled and just want to know how best to overshadow the bad (quitting w/ no notice) with the good (technical skills, experience, etc.)."
83uh0z,2,2018-03-12,I'm Improving in All Areas Except my Dating Life. What Additional Changes do I Need to Make?,myayhrowawaytay,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/83uh0z/im_improving_in_all_areas_except_my_dating_life/,"Also, posted this on r/datingadvice but I figure some extra opinions can't hurt.

College Aged Straight Male (5'8"", 190)

Recently in my life, I feel like I’ve been improving in every area except one; dating. Some background on me before I get into it: in high school I was extremely obese (260 lbs. at 5’8”). I had little social interaction outside of school. I had poor hygiene. I wasn’t involved in any many clubs or organizations. I had no idea what I wanted to do post graduation, other than go to college, which was expected of me.

My freshman year of college, I hit rock bottom and realized I needed to make some drastic lifestyle changes. I was unsure of what I wanted to major in. I was getting fatter and fatter. I was getting more isolated than ever before. All I did in my free time was play FIFA and watch Netflix. I was going nowhere. So, I took a year off and knocked out some prereqs at my local community college (online). I lost 100 pounds (though I put 30 back on eventually).

When I got back to college, I became more social. I meet a lot of people through classes, and a religious organization on campus I became involved in. I got my first job as a tutor, which helped me network and become more social &amp; ambitious. I decided to hit the gym more, and am starting to get strong (though I’m still about 25 pounds larger than I’d like to be, but I’m told I look normal sized). I started paying more attention to my fashion. I picked a major that suits my personality, and almost guarantees me a financially stable career upon graduation. I got a paid internship in that field that gives me enough money to pursue my passions (concerts, sports, eating out, new experiences, etc…). I decided to move away from home (I’d commuted for 3 years) for my senior year. I’ve gotten really confident with the person I am, and more importantly, who I’m going to become. It made me feel comfortable that I’m ready to date (something I’d always wanted to do in high school, but couldn’t due because of the aforementioned reasons).

So, I started reading up on dating advice. The majority of the advice that resonated with me was the advice that said cold approaching was the best option. As a self-improvement junkie, the concept of cold approach really spoke to me. In all other areas of my life, taking action by going after the things I want had been a great strategy! So, with the confidence in taking action I had gained from losing weight &amp; working on my career, I had started cold approaching (usually going indirect and asking girls to watch my stuff while I go to the bathroom, then starting a conversation upon return). I probably did this, or a similar approach, with around 130 girls (I lost count). When I started, I could barely even work up the courage to open my mouth… I was mortified of women. Thanks to cold approach, I’m now very comfortable talking to random girls like they’re old friends of mine. I really do not regret cold approach, and I credit it with improving my confidence around women... However, the results weren’t there.

In roughly 130 approaches, I got about 15 numbers. I also got a few instant dates. However, only on one occasion did I get beyond a first date, and that girl and I had a much more friendly vibe, and we stopped hanging out when I made it clear with my actions that I was looking to date and not be friends. I became almost numb to rejection, but after so many rejections and flakes, I just can’t go on with this. I’d be insane to continue to do the same thing and expect a different result. The “take action” method that has worked so well in all other areas of my life clearly isn’t working in my dating life.

So now I’m at a crossroads. I’m looking for a new way to improve my dating life. To clarify, I’m looking for a girlfriend (not hookups, just a girl I get along well with that I can spend time with and go to concerts, dinner, parks, and museums with). I’ve tried Tinder, but I’ve gotten under a dozen matches, none of which have gone anywhere (even using Tinder Gold). Must people say they meet their girlfriends through work, class, or their social circle. I’ve met a few girls in my work, classes, and social groups that I’d been interested in dating, but I have absolutely no idea how to ask them out. I know it’s weird, but I’m actually a lot more comfortable asking out a complete stranger than a girl I know and have a lot in common with. Because if the complete stranger rejects me, there’s no long-term consequences. If a girl I know well rejects me, then it could affect my reputation within my social circle, and have a long-lasting negative impact in my life. How can I change this mindset?

I’m not a bad-looking guy (I’m no stunner, but I pay attention to fashion and look normal sized in clothes, and I know that if I kept up with my diet &amp; exericse plan that I’ll be very good looking come the start of next school year). I’ve gotten confident in who I’m becoming. How do I find a girl to share my improved self with?

TL/DR: I’m a former fat &amp; lazy kid who’s now normal sized, confident, and ambitious. I’ve tried cold approach &amp; Tinder with no luck. What different approaches can I take to finding my first girlfriend?"

I used to be really socially awkward when I was a kid. I had very few friends when I was young. In high school, I tend to prefer one-on-one friendships as I am introverted.

Now that I am at uni, I have been working on my social skills. I was socially awkward when I first started uni. I tend to have the same classes with the same people in my major. I then became depressed. I got bad grades and failed some courses. 

Now that I am feeling better, I don't know what to do. I've been working really hard to make new friends and I only end up with acquaintances. Most people in my major have already formed their own social circles so they are not exactly open to the idea of me joining them no matter how much small talk I've done with them. Almost all of the girls in my major/class are taken so I guess they are less interested in pursuing a BFF-type friendship than me.

I've reached out to people at club events and dorm. I did end up knowing a lot of people and can easily engage in small talk with them. People never reach out back to me though. At the end, I only end up with acquaintances. At some point, even the friendly ones will decline my offer to hang out with them or catch up with them.

I don't know why it is so difficult for me to make friends. I've had people tell me they really enjoy talking to me, and a week later, they never talk to me again and ignore my text messages when I try to reach out to them.

It's not like I dislike being single but I just want companionship. I know that older single people often feel lonely when all the people they know are married or taken, but damn, I am feeling this at the age of 20. I don't think I've ever met a guy interested in me but this may have something to do with my social skills. I feel like everyone else has moved on in life except me.

As for my grades, they are really bad as I have failed a couple of courses. I tried applying for summer internships this year and got rejected from all of them. I feel like it is too late to do anything as I am already a junior.

Tl;Dr: I am a junior at uni and feel so hopeless after depression/withdrawing from other people/failing some courses. I failed some courses and got rejected by every company I've applied to for summer internships. I've tried making friends, but end up with dozens of acquaintances and no friends. I tend to have the same classes with the same group of people from my major and it's hard to find a BFF given how they already have their own social circles and a SO. Is there still hope for me and what can I do about this?"

I am currently on track for an English/Literature major, but I hope to take on CogSci as another major, with Design and Interaction as my specialization. 

I'm currently waiting on Assist.org to update so I know which courses to take, but I'm fairly sure that even if I end up completing all of the COGS equivalents, I won't be able to take the required math classes in time. I am hoping that I'll be able to take a class at a UC this summer so I can knock some of the classes out.

I'm curious about the following:
Is CogSci going to be impacted? (Since I have heard that the major tends to be a backup for CS people)

Is it difficult to double major after transferring, especially if you don't have the lower-division coursework completed? (i'm wondering if there's a time limit)
 
Will they allow students to double major if the student takes an extra year to take all the classes?

For anyone who has double majored or majored and minored, what are your experiences with the workload? Were you able to participate in clubs or have an internship? I'm currently taking 18 units or so per semester at my CC, and it's already eating up most of my time and energy, so I'm curious about the workload."
83ws4v,1,2018-03-12,Advice choosing between 2 internship offers soon.,void_blade,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/83ws4v/advice_choosing_between_2_internship_offers_soon/,"Hi, I'm in my junior year at school and I'm really happy to receive my first two internship offers for this summer, but I'm conflicted which one to accept and am seeking advice.

The first I must respond to within 2 days, and I already kinda said yes. It is close to home, where I would live with my parents. My tasks would include helping to program software drivers for medical equipment related to tumor treatment, and it seems like really interesting work.

The second offer I just got this morning, and is for a larger company doing cyber security related work, and I don't have much an idea of what exactly I'd be doing as of know. The pay rate is about 50% more. They also explicitly stated that they may hire me full time afterwards if I do well during the internship. Unlike offer #1, this job is out of state for me, but they said they will cover my relocation and living fees, and I don't have a preference of living in an apartment with another intern vs my parents house. I live at school with roommates currently, so I think I'd be comfortable in that situation.

Offer #2 also requires a government security clearance. I think I'd pass it fine, though ~6 years ago I was shy, went to therapy, and was prescribed anxiety medication. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'm unsure if that would prevent me from getting cleared. I don't want to decline offer #1, only to fail the clearance for #2 and then have nowhere to go.

Any advice on what should I do? Accept offer #1 in the next 2 days, where the works looks interesting, or take #2, which pays 50% more, I'm unsure of what the work entails, I would relocate, and is contingent on me getting security clearance?

Thanks

The security clearance is ""Top Secret"""
83wx0p,8,2018-03-12,How I Got An Internship My Freshman Year,cerealkillerzXx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/83wx0p/how_i_got_an_internship_my_freshman_year/,"So some context: I'm currently a freshman at a pretty good state school with a solid computer science program. I plan on double majoring in CS and PPE (philosophy, politics, and economics). I just received my first offer for the summer at a pretty big company (&gt;2,500) employees in a big city near my school.

I thought I'd give some tips on what I did to get the offer.

How I got the offer:

1. APPLY EVERYWHERE: 
Whether it be to some small local startup or some big-N freshman programs, apply everywhere. Not only could you actually hear back from these companies (which I didn't for the most part), but it also just gives you experience applying to companies. Most of the places I applied to were small startups (I assumed those companies would have the most jobs for freshman). I probably applied to 50+ companies, only hearing back from about 5 of them. It's easy to apply, just go online and click the apply button and fill out an application. It's definitely worth your time.

2. Go to every career fair:
This is how I got my offer, and what gave me the most opportunities. I went to 4 days worth of career fairs before I talked to a company that gave me an actual technical interview. I heard the words ""sorry we don't take freshman"" too many times to count. I spoke to recruiters representing companies that probably didn't even have CS internships. Just getting out there and talking to recruiters was already a positive experience. I know some smaller schools don't have career fairs, but if your school does, definitely take advantage of it.

3. Have some interesting extra-curriculars: I know this is easier said than done, but be active in searching for things to do on campus that can help build your resume. Whether it be emailing professors asking about research opportunities or developing an app on the side, recruiters love seeing something other than just classes on your resume. I'd also recommend making sure that you do things you enjoy. It's so much easier to explain to recruiters how to apply your extra-curriculars to the real world if your passionate about it.

4. Do some studying on your own time: The intro CS class and the data structures class you take your freshman year probably aren't going to be enough to get you an internship. Watch lecture recordings of the algorithms class (or whatever the next class is) to help increase your skills. Personally, as soon as I mentioned that I was a freshman and that I knew big O and could talk about it, recruiters already seemed very impressed. You're a FRESHMAN, recruiters aren't expecting much, but if you can deliver, all the better.

5. Build you resume: Your resume is what gets you from being one of the hundreds of applicants applying to one of the couple dozen or so that get a technical interview. Go to resume workshops and make sure yours is impressive. Honestly, even just using the resume workshop on this sub should help a lot. 

6. Once you get your offer, STUDY STUDY STUDY: I picked up a copy of CTCI the moment I started talking to companies. Once I got an interview, I read up on Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, and basic algorithms (quick sort, binary search, etc.). Once you get the interview, the only thing separating yourself from the offer is a few technical questions (and then some more depending on the number of interviews the company puts you through). At the beginning, I could barely brute force the easy questions on leetcode. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. Keep studying and watching videos on YouTube and you will get better. By the time I had finished studying, I was able to complete some medium questions with the most efficient solution. As a freshman, that's something recruiters don't expect.

7. Learn How To Talk about Your Resume: While some people don't agree, behaviorals are important. Run through your resume and make sure you feel confident talking about it. Understand how you would answer the ""why computer science?"" question, or the ""why this company?"" question. Being able to speak confidently is an under-appreciated skill. Computer scientists often get a bad rep for not being able to speak well and socialize. Separate yourself from that crowd.

8. I know I already said this but KEEP YOUR HEAD UP: I was rejected from over 40 companies online, most of the time not even getting an email back. I was told that as a freshman, I didn't have the experience to work at ""company X"". Don't let it get to you, just keep applying and applying. Even if you don't get an internship for the summer, at least you have the interviewing experience to be ready for sophomore year.

Sorry if this came off a bit boastful, I just wanted to share my experience with everyone and help out the people whose position I was in a few months ago.

The main thing I'd say that I would do differently is to focus more on myself. While I'm glad that I got the internship, I feel like I sacrificed a lot of personal time to do so. Don't forget to hang out with your friends every once in awhile. You're a freshman in college, have some fun."
83x6ub,7,2018-03-12,26 and still unsure what to do with my life / can’t let go of my childhood,midtwentydirtbag,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/83x6ub/26_and_still_unsure_what_to_do_with_my_life_cant/,"Hello everyone, so as the title says I’m going through a little bit of a “quarter life crisis” here. I’m hoping to get some advice from people who are my age, or have just been in my situation, or are older, more experienced; hell anyone really lol

So recently, I turned 26, and I am totally unhappy with where I am in life / totally scared for my future. I currently work at a bank (nothing fancy, just basically a teller with some other responsibilities mixed in), and I absolutely hate it. I hate the business model, the shallow socializing, pretty much everything.  Due to this (which I acknowledge is my own fault), I have no hope of being promoted (not like I’d really want to, anyway). 

On top of working full time, I am currently enrolled in school full time, pursuing a bachelors in Economics.  I already had an associates degree (Liberal Arts) that I got right out of high school, so I transferred in as a second half sophomore.  Originally, I had planned to continue onto law school (something I had flirted with in the past), but after noticing the abysmal job market, I decided to shelve that idea for now. 

Since I’m majoring in economics, I’m learning about data analysis and the like, which seems pretty interesting to me, but the way I entered into my present school I’m missing internship opportunities going into the summer, but even if wasn’t, I wouldn’t be able to take advantage of them anyway - due to me already having a full time day job - and needing the money I make from said job to pay the bills.  I also find it hard to quit this job because admittedly, the benefits and pay are decent for someone with my experience (which is not much).  This makes me stress even more because I feel like I’m missing out on experience that I will need with future jobs regarding my degree while wasting away here. So all this just leaves me feeling stuck. 

I also keep reverting back to childhood activities of mine - playing old video games (Pokemon, Diablo 2, CS 1.6) and rereading old books (Harry Potter), watching old shows (Dragon Ball, Jackass, Viva La Bam, etc). I haven’t thought much of this up until now, but I’ve recently realized that I probably do this to cope with my current issues - which makes me feel even worse. 

I feel lost and unsure. I see people like my S/O, 
majoring in something she loves and is on track to getting a job in a field she loves, while I have nothing that interests me as much.  I’m so happy for her, but I feel so upset with myself. 

I’ve tried to make it a point to make changes in my life (for example, as mentioned, I enrolled in school and I’m actually doing really well for once), but no matter what I do I don’t feel any closer to being content with my life.  I basically feel like a huge loser. 

Has anyone else felt like this and seen the light? Is there any glaring improvement opportunities with the limited information I provided you guys see? Any and all help is appreciated - nice stuff, tough stuff - anything. Thank you. 

P.S. didn’t realize how long this was lol, so extra thanks to everyone who made it this far"

I could avoid many mistakes like this but one day I actually messed up. I usually try to mention “my availability to work in a location” and on this particular one I ended up putting the wrong city name.

Today I got an email from one of the recruiters mentioning this and then telling me that the position is based in another city. Also asked was whether I am open to work in this city.

And so I was wondering, if you ever had such a situation and you were asked about it in an interview, what did you say to get out of this and not let the recruiter think that you did not do a thorough research on the company and position?

So I'm finishing up my junior year as a chemistry b.s and a 3.86 gpa. I'm doing just fine in the classes academically, and I have a paid chemistry internship this summer. I love learning the material, but I hate working in lab. It stresses me out to no end. I break glassware every week no matter how careful I try to be, and I'm always spilling stuff and doing things incorrectly.

Lab is a struggle for me. I can't seem to see the steps to get me from point A to point B. For example, I was waiting for hours on something to cool today, and it never occurred to me I could put it in the ice bath to cool faster. I sort of have this fear of getting cancer from chemistry work because I'm clumsy and will spill things on myself, like today I got dichloromethane on myself.

I wish I had majored in some type of computer science. I think I wold be able to do well in it, but I can't imagine doing four more years of school, and I feel like I've come too far to not get a degree in chemistry. I'm ready to get a 9-5 job and not have studying hanging over every hour of my life.

However, he sounds like he's speaking in general terms for any returning student, and not with a lot of perception about their CS department. So I want to ask the people who actually studied CS if these statements hold up? Or are they overblown?"

After this semester, the only required classes left I'll have to take are ECE/CS 374, ECE 391, ECE 411, and advanced comp. Ultimately, I've decided to spread the first three courses out over the next three semesters, so I don't want to kill myself, in addition to giving myself one more summer to land an internship (been very unfruitful thus far, but as I said I'm also ""behind"" my peers).

I know this really sounds like an ""ask your adviser"" question, but input from other students, professors, and alumni would be appreciated, especially:

Whether I should take 391 or 374 next semester, and 

Other technical electives I can take that will really help me with finding a job/giving me useful skills."

I have heard that it is probably unlikely I will get an internship. Last summer I worked at Walgreens and I could probably do that again. 

I do want to mention that I am probably not as ""ambitious"" as many of the people I have seen on this sub. What I mean is, I am not actively gunning for those coveted positions at Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc. I'm more than happy to land a job in my hometown at a local company, and have a lower salary than those aforementioned jobs.

83ze7o,1,2018-03-12,Am I crazy to consider quitting my job?,NegativeDepth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/83ze7o/am_i_crazy_to_consider_quitting_my_job/,"I've been working as a software engineer for about a month now after graduating in December, and my job is pretty bad. I'm underpaid, I have a toxic manager, and I'm the only developer besides her. I'm not really becoming a better developer here, and I dread coming in to the office and dealing with her every single day.

My goal is to get a different software engineering job as quickly as possible. To that end, I'm willing to relocate anywhere, although I'd prefer to stay in the decent-sized tech hub that I moved to for this job. I see two paths to that goal, and I find myself at a crossroads that requires a decision in the short term:

1. Stay for long enough that I can list this experience. Probably until I've been here for 6+ months, can list a few accomplishments, and it isn't a red flag how short I've been here. I could do this, but the drawback is that I can't even start searching until I've been here a few more months.

2. Leave before that. Just quit sometime in the next few weeks. I'd leave an employment gap between graduation and the present and not mention this job at all. If I'm going to leave within a short enough timeframe that the short tenure is a red flag, it makes sense to cut my losses and leave as quickly as possible. I'd rather try to explain a 3 month gap right now than a 4 month gap next month.

A third choice occurred to me, to stay at the job and start sending out applications. However, my issue with that decision is that I would have to choose whether or not to list this experience, in which case I should either quit (if I don't list it) or wait until it's longer (if I do list it). Because I have some savings, I don't believe this is a false dichotomy. I'm fortunate enough for the money to not be a big factor because of my internship savings and my scholarships. I don't have any debt and I could probably last about 18 months without working if I cut back my expenses. 

The only important factor is whether the first option will allow me to find work quicker because of my greater experience level, and if so, whether that experience is worth the unhappiness of coming to this office for the next few months. Am I crazy to think that that isn't the case? That I could probably start a different job faster as a new graduate applying today than I would in 6 months when I have 6 months of experience?"

I’m an incoming PhD in CompArch. I’ve done four internships at various leading semiconductor companies, so I’m fairly familiar with the field. I’ve always make more or less the same as software interns with similar experience. 

My question is for both experienced developers and experienced Computer Engineer types who I imagine also frequent this subreddit. 

I see these salary threads with 200/300/500k total comp packages for experienced developers at the Big Four types of the world.  I know these are anomalies, you need to be a rockstar/lucky/inhuman/etc. 

My question is if there’s any analogue to these positions in hardware. Are there any digital logic designers pulling that kind of cash?  Hardware tends to have a higher education floor, but just comparing the absolute best of either discipline. 

If there exist these positions, where and what job function? If there don’t, why is there such a discrepancy?"

After I quick journalism in my first period, I decided I wanted to be an actor. When I was ready for applying, something stopped me, and I didn't. Then, after so much thinking, I decided to study communication. I ended up becoming the assistant from a professor my last semester. However,  I couldn't get an internship the last period that would be 'validated' to get my degree...

I got the help from a close friend to work in a local citty hall. But I hated the job. I was trapped in a office. Routine killed me. Then, I found out I was living with HIV. That changed my whole plans...

I decided then to found an NGO, that now is stucked. The last time I worked was in Hollistic Center (2016), but, again, coming to the same place where sometimes I was the only person got me depressed, and I quick.

The last year I prostitute myself, but I could only make 50 soles/ 13 $. I'd like this thing to change, but I don't see where to go.

Although some of what I did there was development work (I was the only person there with that background), a significant portion was helpdesk support related like shipping PC's to other branches, setting up PC's, responding calls from users, etc. I have been applying for full time work since graduation, and although I have had interviews and some take home projects, I've not received any offers yet.

I know that I'm at a disadvantage compared to more recently graduated candidates (I've been asked ""Why haven't you found full time work yet"" during a few interviews).

SC has been the premier HPC conference since 1988 and features the presence of the world's leading industry and academic organizations in supercomputing. The Student Cluster Competition itself is a high-profile, nonstop 48 hour competition where various teams from around the world build custom cluster computers and compete with each other to obtain the fastest benchmarking scores.

The Illinois team is sponsored by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the Parallel Computing Institute (PCI) at Illinois. If the team is accepted to the competition, students will travel to Dallas, Texas in November to compete in SCC. The team will be meeting through part of the current spring semester and throughout most or all of the summer and Fall semesters to plan and prepare for the competition.

Students who apply to the team are expected to be familiar with or interested in Linux system administration, parallel computing, and HPC architecture, and are also expected to invest 8 hours a week during the summer and fall semesters. Students will have the opportunity to apply for anywhere from 1-4 independent study hours through the ECE or CS department. There are also opportunities for summer internships and research experience for members of the team.

8409eb,1,2018-03-12,How to ask for an unfulfilled raise for (entry-level?) software dev in London,londonCodingBeast,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8409eb/how_to_ask_for_an_unfulfilled_raise_for/,"Hi all, this is my first post on Reddit - my recent experience from work has urged me to break my slience and seek the collective intelligence from all you great reddit minds out there.

I graduated from a reputable university in Engineering Science in the US and worked briefly in the tech industry before switching to another field, where I obtained my master's and continued my career down another technical path ( not software development, but I do still code as part of my work) for the past ten years. I recently decided to switch back into the software development field, and had dived myself back in learning the JS track ( Node.js, React, etc). 

I was very lucky to be offered a position at a huge firm during this transition, where, given that I know that I am still relatively new at my journey in transitioning back into tech, was offered a salary of 25K pounds. ( this is like a third of my previous salary, but guess this is the expensive price I have to pay for being indecisive about your career lol.) I took the job on the premise that it will be adjusted in half a year.

So by this point in the post you might have guessed it - more than half a year down the line, the raise has not been fulfilled. I still have a lot to learn and pick up for sure, but it has kind of come to the point where I felt I am perhaps being quite underpaid for the nature of software development work. ( Though not taking any main development roles yet, I have started taking up tickets and doing day to day work as a software dev.)

So my question is: is 25K a very underpaid amount for software dev with less than one year of experience? Research on PayScale indicates the median entry level salary for a software developer is 35K pounds ( not including the fact the position is in London.) Is it common and acceptable for employers to use the ""learning"" card to pay a lower salary for their employees? Although, to be very frank, my first internship in the US during my third year in college even paid 2X higher than this salary, not to mention that I now posess a masters and 10 years of experience / maturity in the work place ( though in a different field, I believe it is still a huge asset.)

The other pressing question is on the effective way to bring this issue to my manager. I had indeed brought it up twice, but both times were responded with a 'I'm working on it' kind of answer. ( it has been 2 months since I first brought this up.) Other than the salary, I am very content with the working enviroment and would like to stay longer to continue building up my development skills; however my current salary has really put a lot of financial pressure given the high living cost in London, etc. ( and moreover on the fact whether I am being unjustly underpaid.)

What are your thoughts on this situation? Am I being taken advantage of, or is this normal? Should I stay and try to work this out with my manager, or should I just get over it and find another job?

I started with no training other than a couple of years as a tech, basically swimming with the sharks. During my time in the company I have worked on various projects and learned a lot from them. I am now feeling burned out, not by the job, but by the IT department &amp; company. The company is very cheap, we have 10+ yrs old servers, buy equipment 2nd hand, eBay sometimes (scary). There is little documentation from the people that have worked there before me. Our development team is all interns, or fresh out of school with no real life experience. The applications and webpages look poorly designed. The biggest turn down is my sr sa. He’s a good guy with a lot of knowledge, but with very bad habits. He thinks he knows everything, and it constantly shows. He does not follow up things, such as not patching servers for years! Gets sidetracked easily with level 1 things such as a printer troubleshooting that a tech can do. He got everyone used to call him directly and does not know when to say no. This is a big drag in his day, leaving him to spend little time to work on actual sysadmin work. He gets upset if you don’t agree with his decisions, constantly blocks projects if he does not think it’s good, which in 90% of the times we actually need these. Has only basic knowledge of networking (outsourced) and security (outsourced). I just recently finish my bachelors in it management/development, and planning on going for a master. After everything I learned from school I truly believe that the infrastructure could crash at any moment, not because I’m not doing my job, but because I really can’t, because I’m constantly blocked with the excuse of I have more experience than you. The company can do so much better if it focused on hiring the correct people. Some of the project managers treat employees rude.

I am a freshman at a top 15 university that's not really known that well for CS. My GPA is pretty low, around a ~3.0, and I am scared that it won't be competitive enough for data science/machine learning internships at prestigious tech companies. (I know for software engineering, a high GPA isn't too important, but I'm unsure if that's the case for data science/ML as well.) At my internship this summer (small company), I will do a machine learning related project, and I am currently working on some machine learning personal projects as well.

I enjoy machine learning, but I am not great nor passionate about math. I got through Linear Algebra ok, but I found multivariable/differential equations pretty bland. Is this a red flag that machine learning isn't right for me?

Ideally I want to interview with prestigious tech companies next semester for ML/data science roles. Do you think I stand a chance in my current position? Or should I just stick with looking for software engineering internships (I enjoy software engineering as well). Any advice to be more competitive for applying to data science/ML internships next semester would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Right now I am thinking to go with B because I think that since they are larger, I will have an easier time getting a full time position, either with them or elsewhere, after I graduate. Is this a good assumption, and should it be my deciding factor?

I think the work I'd do at both would be equally interesting with my current knowledge.

What should I be applying for? Any advice would be appreciated!

Hi! I'm just a young person trying to figure out what my next steps should be. Here's my story.

I didn't do well in college due to issues with depression and other personal issues, but I made it out with a bachelor's in Food Systems and Community Health Policy, with a minor in Education. I thought I wanted to go into medicine and I would take the pre-requisites I missed in my spare time while working full-time in the area, but living up in the Oakland, CA area is expensive and I couldn't take time off from work to take classes only available during the day.

I discovered a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp that was available for me to take part-time over the course of 6 months, and I graduated from it in October 2017. They taught me skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React, and loads of other stuff. Since then, I've been applying for jobs and so far, I've only had one interview and that's because my friend gave me a referral (it didn't go well). That put me into another depression and I started reflecting that maybe I shouldn't be applying for Front-End Engineer positions yet, but maybe Junior Web Development or Junior Software Engineer or even any internship positions would be better suited for me.

I recently started sending applications out again and still haven't received much luck, most likely since I'm close to UC Berkeley and I'm competing against CS/EECS students and more in this competitive area. In my spare time, I've been trying to supplement my knowledge by following alongside UC Berkeley's intro classes to CS without being enrolled (Python and Java on ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" and ""Data Structures"").

I'm just at a loss for what I should do because I really want to put the skills I learned to use and I want to transition into the tech field, but not being a current computer science student seems to be putting me at a disadvantage for internships in the area. At this point, I'm considering just applying for random roles in companies in the area and working my way up as a receptionist or something.

I'd be happy to provide more details, and I appreciate any input you may have on what you think my next step should be. Thanks &lt;3"

About 6 months ago, I took a job doing web development with a salary of 40k In the Los Angeles area. I was recently graduated and didn’t have much real world experience, no internships or anything like that so I took it like the noob I am.

This job has been a nightmare since the day I got it. Bosses are extremely abusive and everyone is severely overworked. For example, one of my bosses threatened that he could outsource us if he wanted. Also, our codebase is extremely outdated and very difficult to work with which leads to them getting even more upset with us. 

I am at my breaking point, but I think I have an out. I’ve been able to save a lot of money as I’ve been living with my parents. I recently talked with them about how awful my current situation is and they agreed that I could continue living there if I quit my job. I also recently interviewed with another company and was surprised at how successful I was. 

However, even though I had that interview, I still do not have anything lined up. I guess I’m torn because I’m afraid that quitting this job will look poorly on my resume, but I honestly don’t think I can do it much longer and I feel that if I quit I’ll be able to take the time I have between jobs and improve my skill set a lot. I know this job is a dead end job, I am not learning anything new and it won’t ever lead to anything. 

I’m curious if anyone has had a similar experience or if someone could impart some wisdom for the situation I currently find myself in.  Thank you. 

TLDR: stuck in low paying dead end job with abusive bosses and workload. I have the option to quit and live with my parents until I find something better, id greatly appreciate any concerns or criticisms. "

I’m 22 now, third year in college majoring in Criminal Justice and it just seems worthless as I don’t want to become a cop and don’t even need a degree to become a cop. Internships to get good jobs within places that involve the courts, drug enforcement agencies, or inspections only want the best of the best. Literally in class yesterday the only hot girl in my corrections morning class spoke about how she interns for a firm that deals with insurance fraud claims and such, while everyone else was wondering how did she even obtain an internship?  It seems super rare, and from just talking to the girls that are in my major, more likely than not, only the hot girls or good looking girls are getting internships (small handful) while other girls are having a tough time procuring one, some guys actually are getting internships too, but’s it’s the outgoing types, the ones culturally adroit with awesome backgrounds. I don’t have an awesome background or outgoing personality due to growing up in a home with a crazy family, which limited my social growth and opportunities to build a network. No matter how much advice I can look up online, it’s extremely tough to even be good at communicating when everyone else has already built this up, it’s embarrassing to have to be in college at the age of 22 and lack social experience, extensive work background, life experiences in general, that I’m missing. Well I’m not necessarily missing extensive work experience, but the work experience I have deals with receiving roles or stock roles that don’t revolve around communication with customers, it’s just do this and that and your done, and extremely under appreciated. Tag that with insecurities that are hard to cope with (bullied a lot by girls in high school about looking ugly and resembling a rat until senior when I got a job and started making money to buy clothes and grew out my hair, then the insults just turned to I’m ugly lol!!!). I’m not confident in the way I look because I know objectively that I’m genetically inferior and always feel terrible when I talk to guy friends or coworkers who are good looking that have girls just flock to talk to them and have a desire to actually get to know them. Doesn’t happen with me, it’s usually to get information from me or to pass time, or just as friends for me. How is someone susposed to make it when they have just bad opportunities or no opportunities for advancement? Like all the jobs on indeed for NJ that include a salary of around $30k want people with unreasonable experiences to back them up, couple that with rent being expensive in NJ, and needing a car because of unreliable public transportation, isn’t it easier to just die? My friends are okay, they don’t really hang with me much and the only time I get to hang with them usually is on Xbox, rarely will I get an invite to hang with them in the most inconvenient times. Dating is a whole other aspect since dating in NJ is awful in general, people love to hook up instead, and if your not well endowed or at least the high end of average forget about it. Sometimes I feel like I should travel to Florida and purchase a gun to off myself, but I do want to live, but it’s insanely hard when your not attractive and resemble a rats face, when your body proportions give you long legs and a atomically short torso (I feel your pain Ferb), when your home situation sucks and you can’t even immediately move it because the world is getting too expensive and if your not outgoing enough then your at a loss.

Other entry level jobs require very specific backgrounds, otherwise they hire you as an intern. However for those jobs, I seem to be under-qualified background-wise, yet also over-qualified being considered too old to be an intern or the company assumes I'll want a higher salary being a more established professional. Again, no traction.

The NYC job market notoriously seeks very specific candidates that match job descriptions simply due to how many people apply. Any ideas on breaking into new job landscapes with an awkward amount of varied experience? Thanks!

This is on top of a full time course load and an internship search, which recently yielded a decent offer.

* **DevOps Intern** for a telecom company (paid)
* **Full Stack Dev** on campus (I built an IT project management system, lots of work) (paid)
* Elected as **communications director** for a cybersec org with ties to homeland security (unpaid)

[Here's my resume for reference](https://imgur.com/a/rwlb0). I've been able to get away with doing all this just barely, up until recently where my situation has escalated from instability to volatility. This past quarter I wasn't able to go to any class lectures because of the moonlighting. I'd have to sneak away from my internship at lunch to fix website issues, code while in lab sections. I managed to make A's and B's this quarter, which is around the same as when I *wasn't* working as much, oddly.

I just started spring break and got bad news from pretty much every place:

* *Internship* - I rotated to a new org that seriously gave me the cold shoulder and ignored me for a month. I spent two weeks asking for work and gave up, stopped coming in. Today I got looped into an e-mail chain and now I'm coming in tomorrow to talk about the projects.
* *Web Developer* - I've been trying to hire my replacement for the past 2 months, but none of the candidates were qualified or interested in web dev per se (all into data science, apparently). I heard from the single qualified candidate today, who declined the offer for an internship.
* *Communications* - I keep getting a ton of work dumped on me, basically I not only have to rebuild and write content for a Wordpress site, but I have to coordinate a bunch of conferences and events. We partner with the government and there's so much red tape and procedure involved that it's hard to do anything. Everyone is nice but damn, I have no passion for this.

BUT, on the flip side, I have a sweet cybersec internship lined up and am taking ALL security classes that interest me next quarter, which I've never been able to do since up until last quarter I've been finishing graduation requirements. I'm registered for some super cool classes that are totally up my alley, but they're really intense. I also feel incredibly sleazy and guilty about this past quarter. I've worked so hard to get into a competitive program at a top school, even moving across the country to apply, BUT now that I'm in it, I've been cutting classes and whoring myself out to the industry instead. I hate it. I want to learn and be a student for just once.

I also to some degree CANNOT leave any of these positions without burning bridges or screwing people over. I'm on rocky ground with my internship (although FTE with them doesn't interest me, not enough work), the web platform I built is very complex and I need to mentor someone before leaving, and the cybersec job would flat out burn a ton of bridges. I can't handle this anymore. What do I do?

**EDIT:** Another thing to factor in, I'm overwhelmed by changing discliplines so much. Four years ago I was a research coordinator for studies on autism and traumatic injury outcomes, 2-3 was me working in IT / networking, and now I'm doing webdev and cybersec at the same time."

I previously worked as an undergraduate in a campus lab and then for a year after graduating and got a lot of experience doing the same things I am doing in my current job as well other things that are done by my company but not by the group I am in. There were three other people in my group when I was hired, my boss and two women -lets call them Cindy and Jenny. We all answered to our boss. They had both been there for more than 4 years and they had the same job title as I did: associate scientist. Cindy had a bs in ecology and had no previous lab experience when hired. We also had an intern Tammy who was part of a program to eventually be hired.  

We all could roughly do each other’s jobs but Cindy would order supplies and sort of kept track of projects and would sort of take certain tasks she wanted to do while we did the things she didn’t want to. Jenny did a specialized job that took a very long time to preform, and which was very monotonous. I was trained how to do this job that Jenny did and eventually took it over from her. Meanwhile we hired our intern Tammy. She had the same job title as all of us but was put under Cindy – whom she answered to as her manager. Jenny was trained how to do another job and for the most part left our lab- I took over what she did for the most part. 


Cindy and I grew close we would text each other and engaged on various social media platforms and would go out to lunch and dinner. I had been over her house and she had been over mine, we had met each other parents and she had even backed into my car once and we had a good laugh about it. Just to clarify we were both engaged to other people and I am gay so we were honestly just friends.


Recently half our company moved to a new location so a lot of room opened up at our current building. We all got offices and there was talk of title changes and rearrangement. One day it had snowed and I came in early worked 9 1/2 hours and still went home about an hour before everyone else did. The next day Tammy tells me that after I had left my boss and Cindy and her were all talking about the rearrangements and that Jenny and Cindy were getting title changes, that Cindy would start doing some of our boss’s work designing projects  and that it was still up in the air whether I would be put as one of Cindy’s subordinates or not. Meanwhile Cindy starts acting really cold towards me and distant. 


Anyway we had a large snow storm coming and I received this text from Cindy saying “Dear – op- if you come into work tomorrow please be safe sincerely Cindy”- I was extremely off put by the text we never talk to each other in that type manner so I responded with to saying oddly seriousness her text was and she responded with “ok sounds good, I was trying to be a professional manager obviously it doesn’t suit me”- so I then asked whether my boss was my manager or if she was and that Tammy had told about how they all had talked about rearrangements when I wasn’t there and that she seemed to be acting distant- Cindy then responded saying “you might become my very own –op-- but not yet” and blaming the distant feel on her having an office. Just as a note a few months before on the eve of a bad snow storm I was taking about calling in from work and notifying my boss and Cindy said I could just tell her and that she would let my boss know- I didn’t do this and never had because she isn’t my direct manager and I didn’t want be caught up if she didn’t actually tell him it would also look like I was taking orders from her which I wasn’t.


I really do not know what to do. On one had Cindy is one of my closest friends and if I was her subordinate it would certainly change the dynamic of our friendship. On the other I have more experience doing lab procedures and an actual relevant degree and have never been her subordinate- which would be like a demotion for me. This has all been going on for about a month and I am contemplating going to my boss and asking for clarification because I feel like I am being left in the dark about what is going on and someone who isn’t my manager is acting and telling me that they are. 
Also if I am placed as her subordinate Tammy and I make drastically different salaries so I wonder if that’d be an issue. 

What should I do ? What would you do ? Is Cindy being manipulative?

Sorry about any errors I am writing this on the fly. 
Thanks

Currently I'm a sophomore from Long Island who's studying IT with a concentration in networking. My issue at the moment is obtaining an entry-level position in IT. I have been applying to any help-desk position I can find, but I haven't had any luck getting a response or an interview yet. I have my A+ certification, and I should complete my CCNA on the side when I graduate.

At this point I feel like the issue lies in my resume, or the fact that people don't want to fill a help desk position with someone going to school full time. How long did it take you to get your first IT position? I would appreciate any guidance or advice. Thank you.

And by make it work, I mean hold any real steady employment (that includes TA'ing at a bootcamp for a shor stint). 

Amidst waking up in the middle of the night with panic attacks (I'm nearly broke) I'm considering giving up on this profession entirely and, alternatively, enrolling in a Bachleor's or Master's program. 

Let me explain. I love programming and could still see myself doing it professionally. However, the odds I'm up against in the job-market and the increasingly complex requirements for even entry-level position has me a) second-guessing  my ability to even cut the mustard in this field, b) wondering if a more structured, traditional CS program would've been the way to go rather than my motley blend of bootcamps and endless tutorials, and c) if I did somehow get into a BS/MS program in CS if it would really benefit me all that much.

Like for instance, a few major roadblocks I've recently run up against are testing my code, coming to grips with cloud providers like AWS, and authentication and encryption. 

Endlessly completing tutorials while also looking for work has not really been the best approach for me and it feels like I'm on a never-ending treadmill where I have to learn everything in the off chance a potential employer uses it.

I guess my main question is, will going through a BS/MS program—where I can presumably obtain internships and gain real-world experience—shore up my insecurities and knowledge gaps and ""plug the holes"" so to speak? Or will it be right back to the treadmill after completion since, I assume, many of the in-demand techonologies—like, say AWS, for instance—aren't taught in a school environment?

However, I'm also currently a full-time stay at home mom, with a toddler and a  baby, and plan (God willing) to have another baby in the next 18 months. And my kids have had some medical problems (nothing traumatic, but making the baby stage especially exhausting). So I'm progressing very, very slowly.

My question is, how do I prioritize to make the best use of this time? Time limitations are real, given that kids are young and it's hard to / I don't have a desire to pay for childcare on top of tuition. But I have time at night, or during naps, that's flexible.

Would you prioritize...
- finishing the degree?
- personal projects? (resume building)
- open source?
- leetcode?
- something else entirely?

Here was my plan: Finish most of the degree at my own pace, getting some foundational knowledge with which to build projects. Then, take time off to build a resume with first projects then (when kids are a little older and I have a resume that can get a good one) internships. Finish the degree right around when I am ready to seek a job, and market myself as a ""new grad"" -- vs finishing the degree ""early"" and then having to explain what the heck I was doing after graduating.

Still, it's going to look weird that I pursued a degree for so long, right? Or if I don't put a start date, my previous work experience will give it away? (Unless I did a project-focused/organized resume?)

Any advice appreciated. Let me know if I'm even asking the wrong questions or approaching this the wrong way.

Edit: My hope is to eventually intern at one of the more prestigious tech companies, and possibly work at one for a year or two, then seeking a lower-key role with a less competitive company or possibly even government."

84ceal,1,2018-03-14,OSSU Data Science Experience?,Kerr809,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/84ceal/ossu_data_science_experience/,"Hi everyone,

Apologies in advance for the longish post!

I'm currently a 3rd marketing major with a minor in CS who waited too long to get out of my useless major. Unfortunately I'm not in a financial position to pivot into a CS/DS-related major so I've decided to give my marketing classes the absolute bare minimum from now on and focus my energy on self-taught CS/DS.

I've chosen to enroll in either Open Source Society University (OSSU) [Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) or [Data Science](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) and I'm wondering which makes more sense to pursue. I have about 1 year of experience with Python, a little less with R, and did my last internship as a web traffic analyst which I really enjoyed. While my ultimate goal is most probably to be a data scientist, the software and web development side of things also interests me. So my questions are:

-First of all, does anyone have any experience with the Data Science program? It seems to be significantly less well-known than the Computer Science program and the github page isn't nearly as active. So I want to confirm that it's of the same quality as Computer Science.

-If I want exposure to the data side and software and web dev sides, does it make sense to go with CS? I figure that this way I get the fundamentals of CS that aren't really covered in the DS program, while still covering material relevant to DS. On the other hand, it's not as specialized as the DS courses.

Whichever path I choose, I want to go all in. In other words, I don't want to pick and choose classes from each program. While I understand that 100% completion of either will not be recognized as a real Bachelor's degree by employers, I would like to have the personal gratification of having completed the equivalent of a full degree.

Thanks in advance for the help!"
84d0vk,2,2018-03-14,Preparing to transition from Python to Java for an internship,henryfoole,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/84d0vk/preparing_to_transition_from_python_to_java_for/,"I have accepted an offer for a summer internship as a backend developer in a company that mostly uses Java. Most of my prior experience is in Python. I would like to prepare myself for using Java in a professional work environment, and in general would like to be better prepared for my internship.

I don't really have much Java experience. A few years ago, when I was relatively new to programming, I built a basic Android game as an experiment to learn some Java, but it was probably very poorly written.

A few months ago, using Python (Flask), I created my first backend application. But there is a lot more I can do to learn more about backend development.

*****

In order to better prepare myself, there are a few things that I could do:

- refactor my existing Python backend and add more proper error handling. This would expose me to iteratively improving an existing codebase (albeit my own), not to mention general good practices like error handling.

- make the existing infrastructure production ready. It's currently on Heroku, running on the built in Flask server, so I will want to eventually set up a production ready server. I might want to move to AWS just for the sake of moving to AWS (and also because I instinctively think AWS might be more scalable). Doing this could expose me to things like load balancing, application proxies, and uWSGI, and other infrastructurey things. Good for general backend learning.

- add unit tests for existing Python backend. This could be done in either Python or Java. Although, at first thought, it does feel a bit odd to test a Python backend using Java, but I guess it could work. Good practice.

- start from scratch and rewrite the backend in Java. This would be a good way to write a couple of thousand lines of Java.

- write an Android app (in Java) that interfaces with the Python backend. In the long run, I want to stick with a Python backend, so rewriting the backend in Java feels like it doesn't provide as much tangible returns. Additionally, I do eventually want mobile apps to interface with my backend, so writing an Android app seems promising.

- work on something unrelated to my side project and try and find ""beginner"" level Java issues on open source projects on Github.

*****

Ideally, it might be recommended to do all of the above. But, I want to prioritize, given that I have around six weeks till the start of my internship and also have school going on right now. I also don't want to burn myself out...

Any advice?"

First and foremost, I would like to preface this by saying that I posted in the daily chat thread a few days ago and received very helpful answers from two users. I thought a new post would help, however, as I am still a little confused. Anyways, I am currently a freshman studying at a huge university that is top 50 in CS. I (mistakenly) assumed that all internships were filled by January and quickly scrambled to at least find a research position for the summer. I was fortunate enough to get a research position for the summer although I am not sure if it will truly help me attain a job at the Big 4 in the future. How exactly do you determine the relevancy and benefit of different research projects? I don't want to get too specific here but I will essentially work with two faculty members to write code that can optimize the efficiency of a certain processor that my school has plenty of. While my mentor mentioned it would look good on my resume, I see a lot of different opinions on research and if it's beneficial for industry. For example, a lot of people were posting success stories about getting Big 4 interviews with only research experience the other day and claimed it was better than an internship at a no-name startup. I am not sure if I can get an offer, but I am also interested in GSOC which would further complicate things as I would then have to pick between the two. Does anyone know how to approach these situations where you must compare two completely different experiences? I know with internships, people generally compare the companies, salary, and projects but I don't know about comparing research and an internship. Thank you in advance!"

Long story short I'm trying to make major career change #3. I started in the sciences (admin &amp; research), then pivoted to advertising (starting as an intern) and worked up to an associate, now I'm trying to pivot again but meeting some walls. (I live in NYC for context).

Some entry level jobs that I apply for require little more than a college education (admin gigs), but I seem to be over-qualified as I've gotten zero traction thus far. Other entry level jobs require very specific backgrounds, otherwise they hire you as an intern. However for those jobs, I seem to be under-qualified background-wise, yet also over-qualified being considered too old to be an intern or the company assumes I'll want a higher salary being a more established professional. Again, no traction.

The NYC job market notoriously seeks very specific candidates that match job descriptions simply due to how many people apply. Any ideas on breaking into new job landscapes with an awkward amount of varied experience? Thanks!

Background -- I am a senior at a prestigious liberal arts college. I have a major in math and a minor in computer science, gpa 3.2/4.0.

Was hoping you guys could offer some advice. 


I graduated back in 2014 with a computer science degree and have since been working as a support engineer at a healthcare technologies company. Over these past few years, I feel like I haven't done anything to advance my career. Aside from learning the basic in's and out's of working the corporate grind (and some really basic java and SQL concepts), I’m basically in the same spot as when I graduated. The money is decent and hours are easy, but it feels rather like a dead end without much potential for growth.


I feel like I never really established the foundations needed to become a software developer. I did relatively well in school and understand the basics of data structures and algorithms; but if you asked to write a basic program from scratch, I'd have a hard time producing anything functional or even knowing where to start. I don't know what it's like to work in a SCRUM cycle, how to structure a project, and have barely done any testing. Without concepts like these (and a whole lot of other things), it seems I am too unqualified to apply to development positions. I've been trying to learn different languages, frameworks, and concepts (e.g. Android, Python, testing, Git, etc) but I feel like without any real direction or guidance, I always end up back at square one.


At this point, there isn't a specific industry or type of software development I am trying to get into. Android seems pretty cool, but I am open to anything. What I am currently hoping for is just becoming competent enough to get into an entry level software engineering position with a company that is able help me grow productively.


If anyone has any advice on some sort of direction or mindset I should be taking, I would really appreciate it. Any personal experience stories and timelines would be great too. Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this and my apologies if I'm asking in the wrong place or if I'm being too vague.




* As a side note, I have also been looking into internships and see a lot of requirements like: ""Pursuing Bachelor’s/Master’s degree in Computer Science or similar field from a four-year college/university"". Since I've been out of school for so long, would that disqualify me from these positions?

I love the college admissions process and sometimes get a little too over my head with what colleges I can and cannot get to. I'm a current junior at a good Jesuit school so any suggestions for where to look would be great, thanks! Some currents I'm thinking about:

* Brown University- Loved the atmosphere when I went, everybody seemed passionate, happy, intellectually engaged, etc. The Open Curriculum seems dope. 

* Georgetown University- My brother went there and it's always seemed cool to me. Having DC as a resource means a whole lot of options for getting things done, internships, etc. I haven't researched too much as a school itself.

* NYU

* Ivies (Columbia, Harvard, Princeton in particular)

* Fordham University

* UCLA

* Northeastern

* UMass Amherst

* Wake Forest/ UNC/ Duke

* Bentley University

* Boston College

GPA: 3.7 UW, 4.2 weighted cumulative. My school doesn't have a ranking system (which I like because that is cutthroat and counterintuitive to taking classes you actually like- a debate we can have another day :).

Tests:

* PSAT: 1220; ACT: 30 Composite (35E, 29M, 28R, 27S, 12W). I plan to study for and retake the ACT going forward with some SAT IIs (probably Spanish and US History), for some reason I just lose focus during the ACT and it's likely due to a lack of confidence/preparation going into it plus the fact that it's so long.
Demographic:

* Male, White/Hispanic (Chilean), &lt;100k income, New England Area

Classes:

* (Freshman Year) Spanish II Honors, Geometry Honors, English I, Christian Thought, Global History I, Visual Foundations

* (Sophomore Year) US History I Honors, Algebra II Honors, Greek I Honors (I dropped Greek because I'd have to drop Spanish classes and those mean too much to me to quit), Spanish III Honors, Scripture, English II

* (Junior Year)AP European History, AP Calculus AB, AP Spanish Language, Physics Honors, Ethics/Social Justice

* (Senior Year) AP Spanish Literature, AP English Language/Composition, AP Statistics, AP Economics, Computer Programming, Models of Leadership

Subjects of Interest:

* Spanish- It's become a passion of mine. I am participating in an exchange program with Argentinean students to take classes, do service work, and practice my Spanish.

* Government/Economics/Sociology- I have become interested in the way public policy, service, and leadership impacts lives in tangible ways.

Sports:

* JV Volleyball last season, either JV Captain or Varsity this year and next year idk

Extracurriculars: This is where I think I shine, I'll put the number of years by the time I'll graduate.

* Student Council Secretary this year and high chance of school President next year (3 years)

I'm trying to figure out if it is worth applying to HBS 2+2 cycle in April. I know it is hyper-competitive and if I have a better shot later then I rather not waste my time now. I am an Indian male, 21, studying computer science (engineering) at a top state school. My main stand-out experience is expanding and running a major Hack-a-thon at my school. Think 1000+ students, and almost 100K in funding for just this year. The main story would be the fact that I took it from being a very small hack-a-thon with limited students and sponsorships to an extremely large one in just one year.

Background

Work experience:

I have accepted a software development role at a top fortune 50 company. 
Had two internships with that same company and one internship at Fannie Mae my first year.

Extracurricular:

Running a major hack-a-thon on the east coast
Engineering student council 

Undergrad school/major:

Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Business. Somewhat of a shit GPA (3.55) though my CS major-specific GPA is (3.8)

Race/nationality:

Indian

Sex:

Male

Stats

GMAT Score (include breakdown!):

Have not taken, but I took it cold and got a 680 and after some minimal practice, I'm getting around 720. I can bring it up to a 750 by the time I take it in a few weeks. 


Goal of MBA:

My main goal for an MBA is to transition to leadership and product. Ideally, I want to work in Product Management and or Strategy at a tech company and an MBA will serve well for that transition. 

My current thoughts are that my gpa makes my application weak. I don't know if my current extracurriculars are enough to bring that up.

First time poster here. I'm 22 and was recently working full time as a student intern in a small organisation for about five months. During this time I was being paid a monthly wage for the work that I did. However, I decided that I needed to leave to return to university, which was something which my boss seemed to disagree with. My contract had said that I needed to give four weeks notice for my resignation, but since I was on probation, my impression had been that if he can terminate me instantly during that period, so could I in reverse (it was a horrible, abusive and toxic place to work). 

As this was a student internship for my university, I was required to write a report about it and have a meeting with my university to discuss my experience. I had been quite critical to my university and they had pointed out to me that previous interns there had also been poorly treated and exploited. Some of the work done was extremely unethical, to say the least. 

Two weeks after quitting, myself and another co-worker who had also recently quit for similar reasons have received legal threats from the ex-boss and his lawyer. I have been accused by him of defaming and denigrating him and his organisation to the university, as well as of breaching fidelity by keeping confidential information (I have no clue what they mean by this). They have also accused me of deleting many emails prior to my exit, which is true insofar that I was tidying up my email box. I have spoken with my university and they are appalled by these threats and have offered to help if they can. The letter of legal intent also demands that in order to avoid prosecution, I put it in writing that I will stop defaming them and that I will hand over any and all confidential information. I refuse to do this, as I know that my manipulative boss will use it against me and that it would count as an admission of wrong doing when I have done nothing of the sort. 

I have reached out to my family lawyer to draft a response to the letter, but the stress of all of this is really getting to me. Is there anything else that I can do? Most people I've spoken with seem to think that it's an empty threat in order to intimidate a former student intern, but I want to demonstrate to them that I'm legally prepared to fight this one out alongside my former colleagues against our horrific ex-boss. 

Thanks for your help! "

I've been looking for a summer internship and have had only a single interview in the last couple of months I've tried looking for something. It really comes down to two problems for me: a poorly formatted resume and few notable skills and projects. I'm currently working on the former, but a well designed resume won't get me far without any cool skills or projects on it.

I've decided to stop applying for internships as often as I have until after my 2 week Spring Break. I'm going to try to work on some sort of projects or learn some new tech then, but I have no idea what.

I currently really only ""do"" C++, with VERY little experience in Python, Java, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript (JQuery).

Any suggestions for what I should learn and build during Spring Break? I know a lot of you might just say learn something that you think you'd enjoy, but the thing is, I don't even have enough experience with CS/programming to really decide what I'd enjoy yet. Should I actually start learning HTML, CSS, Javascript? I see a lot of internships with those languages as preferred qualifications, but I'm not too terribly interested in web dev because I don't like designing pages or front end stuff with HTML and Bootstrap and all that. I also see lots of internships that have Java and Java related technologies/frameworks/etc. as preferred qualifications. Should I do something with that? What should I do at all?

Someone recommended an example project to work on that involves Golang and making a web-facing website and API that accepts text through some post request and returns an anagram of the text. Or something. Would that be doable in a few weeks with very little knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and no experience with anything else?

Guys, I really need some guidance. Thanks for any advice you might be able to give."

I am NOT trying to give advice of any kind. I am not telling anybody reading this that you will get the same results as I did. I am not suggesting that you take a gap year. In fact, many of you would be better off going to your “backup” school rather than take time off. I just want to post my story so that other people can know my experience. It is a unique one, and very few people will probably be in my shoes. I hope you enjoy my story.

Hello, I am /u/badwylf. I also go by Riven or Riv. Some of you might know me from my brief stint on the Discord server. If not, it’s nice to meet you. 

I’m a graduated high school student who’s currently on a gap year. As you may have guessed, that’s the topic of my story. A bit of background on me: I’m Asian-American (Vietnamese) and I was one of two valedictorians of my class. This was no small feat, since I attended an early-college high school, where students take community college classes while in high school. Not exactly dual enrollment. I actually had two associate’s degrees when I graduated. I had a 4.6W/4.0UW combined high school/college and my ACT was a 36. I was a National Merit Finalist and all that jazz. Ridiculous stats, right? I was also co-captain of my robotics team in my junior year and a few more typical EC’s. Whatever. Who cares. Let’s move on. 

Somewhere along my college search I had fallen in love with Columbia, the New York based Ivy League, and decided I would apply early decision. I spent probably as much time writing, having others read, and rewriting those essays as I did for all of the others. I thought I had a shot. 

December rolled around and… I was deferred. I was heartbroken, but I still held onto a smidgen of hope. While submitting all my other essays, I also wrote a letter of continued interest. Essentially, a love letter to Columbia.

It wasn’t until I submitted all of my applications that I began to think about a gap year. I was tired, burnt out from high school. I hadn’t had a summer break since between 7th and 8th grade. I still haven’t actually. I didn’t realize it at the time, but my depression probably contributed a lot to my lethargy. I didn’t know if I could jump straight into college. I was sure I’d crash and burn. 

That being said, I still waited anxiously for my results. I wanted to get into one of my top choices, and defer my enrollment for a year. I would spend that year… probably travelling, or something. I’d figure it out. 

The first result I got back was from, surprisingly enough, UC Berkeley/Cal. Accepted. Apparently, Cal sends out a small amount of acceptances early to its top students and Regents’ scholars. I was overjoyed; it wasn’t my first choice, but it was my first acceptance. Not much later, I visited Cal. The school was pretty nice, but I couldn’t help thinking, “Yeah, but it’s not Columbia.” 

Sometime around this, I got an email from UCLA. I was one of a rather small group invited to apply for their Regents’ scholarship. “NOT AN ACCEPTANCE” it said clearly in the letter. Still, it was basically an acceptance. When those results rolled around, I was accepted. I was not chosen for the Regents’ scholarship, however. They had given me a few tiny scholarships that barely made a dent.

Next, I believe, was UC Irvine, my “safety.” They slowly rolled out their decisions over a span of, I believe, 2 weeks. Acceptances first, then waitlists, then rejections. As the week stretched on, a sense of dread started to creep over me. Was I really about to get rejected from UCI after being accepted to Cal and UCLA? Yes, yes I was. I shrugged it off and moved on. 

Next, Northeastern. I never really liked this school much, but it didn’t matter, because I was rejected. 

I forgot when I received my decision from NYU. It was an acceptance, but the cost was astronomical. There was no way I could justify it. I had made it into their honors college, but I wouldn’t be able to go. 

USC was a last-minute addition to my college list, since it offered a half-tuition scholarship for National Merit Finalists. I was accepted. 

Last was Ivy Day, though you all know how this ended. Harvard - rejected. Yale - rejected. Princeton - rejected. Brown - rejected. UPenn - rejected. Cornell - waitlisted. Columbia - rejected. I was crushed. I didn’t even like Cornell much, yet I still accepted my place on the waitlist. My dreams of an Ivy League school in the Big Apple? Gone. 

So that left my choice between NYU, UCLA, Cal, and USC. I couldn’t afford NYU, so that was out. USC, luckily enough, had followed through on their scholarship, bringing it around the price of the other two. Cal didn’t give me a dime in financial aid. I just had to choose my favourite at that point.

Funnily enough, sometime later I received an email from UCI. They had reviewed my application and I was accepted. A few days later, I was also gifted their Regents’ scholarship. I laughed at the irony. I was never a big fan of the school, though, so they were basically out of the running. 

Cal had been my first choice for most of the time, but I felt like it was unfair if I didn’t give USC a visit. After all, it was just as far as UCLA. My mom was pushing hard for Cal (as Asian moms do), but I wanted to evaluate all my options. 

I used to roll my eyes when others talked about a ‘gut feeling,’ but when I visited USC, I understood. I fell in love. 

However, I still wanted my gap year. I had finally gotten my mom to accept the idea of USC, but she still hated the idea of a year off. Neither of us had any plans for me if I did take the break. I asked one of my teachers, who had often told us about doing biological research, if she had any connections. She didn’t have any nearby, and urged me to look for some opportunities locally.

A week or two later, the same teacher stopped me on my way in school. She had been talking to her husband about me (students, but mentioned me in particular), and he said, “I would hire her.” Her husband was the director of a research lab in the Air Force. I went to “interview” with him, which was essentially him selling the opportunity to me. I told him about my gap year plans, and he was happy to keep me on for half a year. I could even get a publication or two out of it. 

My plans were now cemented, and my mom’s stance was softened by the director. I turned in my deferred enrollment request and a few days later, it was approved. They would even defer my scholarship. 

As I considered options for the other half of my gap year, an idea started to form. Nowhere on USC’s deferral agreement forbade me from applying to other schools. I could re-apply to colleges with my newfound lab research experience. 

Two weeks after school ended, I started my new job. I was working as a co-op, 40 hours a week, a 50-minute commute from my house. I struggled heavily the first few months. In between having to go to sleep and wake up early, driving to and from work every day, and the newfound pressures of working, my depression started to worsen. A month or so later, my friends all were moving into their dorms. The other interns around the lab were also leaving for school. I was lonely, stuck in my little hometown.

My boss started to worry about me, telling me that I was more quiet than usual. Eventually I realized I had to do something about it. I spoke to a psychiatrist who prescribed me anti-depressants. It took a few months, but for the first time in years, my depression was waning. I don’t know, had I gone to university, if I would’ve gotten the help I needed. 

Now bent on chemistry after months in the chem lab, I decided I would go with my original plan and apply to some schools which had great programs in chemistry. I applied EA for MIT, getting an additional letter of recommendation from my boss and updated ones from my previous teachers. I rewrote all my essays, hoping that they now shone with the love and passion I had for chemistry. I found a professor whose research interested me, and I sent him an email asking him some questions about his experience and perhaps if I would be able to work in his lab. I got very positive answers, and my heart was now set on MIT. 

EA decisions rolled around and - deferred. My heart broke. I started to accept that I was probably going to USC, but, at least, I was happy about it.

Then, an email showed up in my inbox one day. My Caltech decision was in. I logged in, sure that it would be a rejection. Better to get it over with. I opened the update. 

I screamed. I was accepted... somehow? Even if I got rejected from all my other schools, I was ecstatic. Caltech was my #2 choice, tied with MIT. It was close, in sunny SoCal, and I loved small schools. 

Four days later, I got accepted to MIT. Honestly, I'm still in shock. I'm waiting on a few more decisions (Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford), but I expect to get rejected. Even so, I have a hard decision ahead of me. I have no idea how I'll make it.

MIT was the place I thought I would fit so well into, but I knew the acceptance rates had fallen even more. It was to be expected.

But honestly? I’m not ready to tell all of my classmates about it. They’ve been asking me every day for the last five months if I got in yet. I kept telling them every time, “Hell no, I’m not making the cut.” But they kept reassuring me I would.

The day I got deferred kinda sucked. I got pity pep talks, too much encouragement, and too many hopeful classmates. It made the deferral all the more painful.

I’m not ready to disappoint them again, or hear them tell me how I’ll definitely get into the other T20 schools I applied to. It’s too emotionally draining for me. My family was already greatly disappointed when I let them know. I don’t want to go through it multiple times. It’s just too much.

I am sad about my rejection, but most of that sadness really comes from having to see and hear people react to my rejection. I appreciate the fact that they care so much about me, but it really drains me to have to answer their questions and hear their predictions every day. I wish people realized that the acceptance rates are that low for a reason, and wouldn’t put so much faith into me.


And I know some of y’all will ask so here are some stats:

4.0 UW, 1560 SAT (800 math), 750 Chemistry, 760 Math II. National Merit Finalist
Swimming, Band, NHS, Asian Student Union, Lifeguarding, summer internship at state uni.
Shitty essays, shitty interview, shitty application. Decent/great recommendations though."
84i7dx,1,2018-03-14,Prospective student needing some advice,zytron11,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/84i7dx/prospective_student_needing_some_advice/,"Hey y'all, currently I'm currently facing quite a big dilemma, whether to leave my current school (UC Santa Cruz) and transfer to UCI, or to stay at UC Santa Cruz, let me explain:

So currently, I'm a freshman at UC Santa Cruz, and I'm enjoying my time here, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows here for me. I've found a decent core group of friends, and they're great, I get along with a majority of them, and we're like a big family. The issue though, is that I don't really feel fulfilled, or like I'm getting the most out of my time here. I've joined a bunch of clubs to find more friends, but I haven't really clicked with anyone yet. 

This all sort of came about around the end of last quarter and the beginning of this quarter, where I really felt that the CS department isn't in the best shape. With overflowing students and an understaffed department, the education here just doesn't feel as serious as if I were elsewhere. Overall, I just feel like I'm not getting the education I'm paying for here versus another UC such as Irvine.

Now here's the difficult part:

I still keep in contact with most of my high school friends, and I talk with my 2 best friends, call them T and L, almost daily. Now T currently goes to UC Irvine, and has plans to get an apartment next year, with another friend R, and L, who is going to transfer there next year from community college.

Now T and L are my very best friends, like I would take a bullet for either of them. They both are very important people in my life and have shaped me to be who I am today. L is also a Computer Science major, and he was the main person to give me the idea to transfer after I told him about the CS department here, hell he works part time in the same position I did last summer, and will go into again this summer(internship). So he and I will be working together this summer (and possibly spring) at the same place, same manager, and same work.

T and L both are very hard-working people, and they drive me to work harder too, I've yet to find people like them here at Santa Cruz however, most people seem to just go with the flow, which isn't bad, but it's hard to drive myself to do more without friends who also drive themselves to do more.

Last year we joked about me dropping and transferring to UCI to live together with them, as UCI has a much better computer science program than Santa Cruz, and much more funding and reputation. Recently I've been considering it seriously, and have kinda made 3 options for myself.

1) Stay at UC Santa Cruz and graduate here after 3 more years, possibly find friends like T and L, possibly not, and learn to live and love the slug life.

2) Return home next quarter, work full time at internship into the summer, but do summer classes online at Irvine Valley College, then in the fall, move in with T, L, and R, while going to IVC for a year to finish my GEs, then transfer to UCI the following year

There's also a 3rd sort of option where I stay at Santa Cruz next quarter, but still transfer to Irvine after.

I feel though that if I leave Santa Cruz this soon, I may not fully experience the school, and I may fall in love with it, and find the right friends. I also fear that I won't like Irvine as much, despite being there with my best friends, like Santa Cruz is great, but I don't feel I'm the happiest I could be here, and I feel I can amount to more at UCI.

Are there any transfer students who can chime in if they've had similar experiences, and what the school environment is like there? Despite living with my best friends I still want to be able to branch out and make some new friends too. What is life like at UCI versus a hippie beach town?

TL:DR UC Santa Cruz vs UC Irvine"

84jjz1,145,2018-03-14,"How do I avoid being shoehorned into duties that I'm good at, but lie outside of my interests?",plshelpcareer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/84jjz1/how_do_i_avoid_being_shoehorned_into_duties_that/,"I'm in my second job directly out of college and it's driving me crazy.  I'm a data scientist at a smallish/medium tech company in Denver.  When I was an undergrad I got really good at SQL, R, and Python because I wanted to be able to use those tools well for data science.  My entire academic background is in statistics, I'm a statistician by trade, and I'm losing it because I've had two jobs by now and both of them have resulted in me doing no statistics after a promising warmup period.

At both jobs I've had, database querying and random data manipulation tasks have gradually dominated my work duties at the expense of analysis experience, of which I have very little.  The same is true for internships.  For reference:

* One internship where they had no idea what to do with me and threw me random database tasks

* One *statistics* REU where I was one of two people who wasn't given a statistical project.  He and I were told we'd get to do a really cool project, and then were baited and switched and assigned a basic web development project despite having no web development experience.  They picked him because he had one C++ class under his belt.  They picked me because I had done a bit of coding and TAed a few computer science classes.

* In my first job (where I was told I'd do a mix of data analysis and data engineering-type work) I'd make suggestions on how to improve the business using data science and they'd ignore them.  Someone above me would vouch for me, the company would keep doing what it was doing, and I was eventually laid off because ""there's no room for data science here.""  The company is a clusterfuck and everyone I still know who worked there has left or been the victim of a round of layoffs, so it's not me.

* Current job started with me doing some data analysis.  I helped a coworker with a data manipulation task as a favor and did it quickly.  A few months later and I wasn't doing any more data analysis.  All data manipulation type work with no underlying analytical component.

My other duties always end up supporting the business with no analytical end goal in sight.  I become the designated ""data guy"".  Anyone who has questions about a particular technology or framework, or who can't solve their own problems assigns work to me.  I spend half a day or more writing queries or making dashboards, or doing tasks that fall into the ""oh you do data stuff.  Do data thing for me that has no analytical component"" category.  I spent over a month on one project that a senior person wanted because I was the only one who knew how to do data stuff in Python.

Both jobs I've had have turned into using technical skills in a DBA-like or data engineering-like context, instead of supporting data analysis like I'd like to be doing.  I asked my boss if I can take on more analytics duties during my last performance review, which was as glowing as possible. He gave me an unambigious ""no"" and said that my technical skills and dashboarding are too important to let me do anything else at the moment.

I've decided I'm going to quit this job in May once I hit the one year mark.  But for the future, how do I make sure that I don't get shoehorned into doing tasks that are outside my area of interest?  I feel like at this rate it's going to be more difficult than ever to get into an analytics focused role and my career on the right track.

**EDIT:  Many of you are interested in data science as a field.  That’s awesome, but due to the sensitive nature of this situation, I will not be answering any questions not directly related to this situation via message or in the body of this thread.**"

84js5h,1,2018-03-15,Deciding on Internship Offer,ecejobthrowaway,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/84js5h/deciding_on_internship_offer/,"I'm a grad student in ECE with a focus in signal processing, image processing, and machine learning. I accepted a summer internship offer at a large tech company, not a FANG company, but definitely large enough that most people have heard of their products. The position pays $11k after taxes and living expenses and deals mostly with image processing and computer vision. 

I was recently offered a position at a different company (after I had already accepted the other offer) which pays almost $15k more than the position I accepted after taxes and living expenses. This position deals mostly with signal processing and circuits for transmitters. One problem with this position is that there is not a lot of room for career growth, or even continuation in full time employment for this company (for reasons that I can't disclose), while the first offer has the potential for a return offer for full-time employment after the internship.

I am having a very tough time deciding what to do. On one hand, the extra money would be nice but it would mean reneging on the previous offer and on the other hand image processing and machine learning is something that has really interested me in school but is not something that I have done in a professional capacity before and the position has the potential to lead to a return offer.

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!"

Here is my latest resume https://imgur.com/a/kNgFz I have two there, the first one is computer engineering focused since that's my major, the second one is focused on purely the software side. Already got advice from the resume threads :).

I was thinking maybe not to apply to big places or some hot start ups, since I read they usually do the big technical coding interviews, (since I feel unprepared) while other places may be more traditional with some technical stuff here and there.

I've gotten an A in my Algorithms class last Spring, but 2 years ago my data structures class I got a C. I don't know what to think!

I want to say before I share it that my dad did not like pranks and he was not a fan of horror or the supernatural. I have no idea why he wrote this, but I need answers. Please, if you have any idea of what really happened to my dad, I have to know.

---

Ninety-seven. That’s how many days it’s been since the first time I came back to work. That’s how many days it’s been since I’ve seen my wife and son. That’s how many days it’s been since I’ve encountered another living human being. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going on like this, therefore I am writing this so that if anyone ever finds me, my family will know what happened to me.  

It started on a Monday in March. I’ve gone over the events of that day so many times in my head, regretting every moment of it. That morning, as usual, Kyle wouldn’t get out of bed and I yelled and screamed at him about making me late for work. Val tried calming me down and was in the middle of saying I needed to go a bit easier on him when I snapped at her that she should either help get his lazy ass out of bed or shut up.

That hurt look in her eyes is the last memory I have of her. Just remembering it breaks my fucking heart and it’s the reason I’ve been able to keep going for this long, because I can’t let it be her last memory of me. She walked away and I stormed out of the house so I wouldn’t be late for my stupid fucking job that I always put before the things that really should have mattered to me.  

I got to my office in no better mood than I had been in when I left the house. Karen offered me a cheerful greeting and a fresh coffee and I answered her coldly, “I sure hope you have the contracts for the new project on my desk.” God, I was such a dick. I see Karen now and wish I could apologize, but all that’s left is her tattered floral blouse draped around her skeletal remains.  

My day was filled with meetings that I gave more importance than they deserved and between them I managed to squeeze in enough time to emotionally abuse more than one of the new interns, all of whom are now skeletons piled in the northern corner of the main conference room. I remember how excited they were on their first day, but I sure as hell had quickly put an end to that.  

The work day ends at 5:30, but it was already past seven when Karen came in and asked if she could head home for the day, I think she told me it was someone’s birthday, maybe her son? As you can tell, I really cared about the lives of the people with whom I worked. “Absolutely not. Do you see me leaving yet? Are you saying your job is so unimportant that I won’t miss you if you’re gone?” I had snarled the words at her. Her head dropped and she shuffled back to her desk looking absolutely dejected.  

Just past 9 o’clock I finally decided to call it a day. Karen was still at her desk and I completely ignored her and headed for the door. Maybe if I’d paid attention I would have known then that something was wrong, or maybe not, maybe everything was still normal at that point, but either way, I hadn’t even looked in her direction so I’ll never know. I went out to the parking garage, got in my car, and that was the first time I left work.  

I’d driven the 45 minutes it takes to get home, waited for the garage door to open, pulled in, turned off the ignition, got out of the car, and realized I was back in the parking garage.  

It couldn’t be dementia, I told myself, I wasn’t that old yet. I had definitely arrived at home but I sure as shit wasn’t there now. My breathing sped up and I was starting to panic. I sat back down in the car, took a deep breath, and decided I must have dozed off when I got in the car and simply dreamt that I’d driven home. That made the most sense, it was no big deal, I’d just head home for real this time and laugh about it when I told Val later.  

As the sun rose that morning, I finally gave up on trying to drive home. I’d driven to my house and found myself back in the parking garage upon exiting my vehicle six times and I was almost out of gas. At one point I tried stopping at a gas station, but I’d simply been back at work when I got out at the pump.  

The rest of that day I spent trying to walk home. My office was at the end of its own street that branched off the main road about a mile away. I could make it to the main road, but once I turned onto it and walked a ways, I’d be walking back down the street toward my office. Eventually, I tried walking in a straight line through the woods behind the building, but every time I found myself back where I’d started about half an hour later.  

It was at that point I finally thought of Karen who had still been at her desk when I left the previous night. I had no idea if she’d managed to get out of the office or not, but I felt like an idiot for not thinking to check for people inside sooner. The relief I had felt when I first saw her sitting at her desk quickly faded when I saw how blue her face was. I checked for a pulse but there was none, she had most likely been dead the entire day.  

I was surprised to find everyone was still in the office, sitting at their desks or in conference rooms, but all of them were in the same state as Karen. I tried every device I could find that might be able to communicate with the outside world but nothing would turn on. Not the monitors, the computers, the cellphones, nothing. There was no way to call for help or even let anyone know where I was.  

The things I did on my last normal day will always haunt me, but I can’t say I’ve done any better in the months I’ve been trapped here. I was forced to accept the fact there was no way to contact the outside world and I collapsed in a corner of my office and sobbed. What felt like days went by while I stared at the wall, too numb to move or think. It was the hunger that finally roused me from my catatonic state. The building has a kitchen, but it is not stocked and there were only a few forgotten lunches that might last me a few days. It wasn’t long until I got desperate.  

It wasn’t by natural means that my colleagues became fleshless skeletons. Being the monster that I am, I have survived this long by feasting on the rancid meat from the bodies of the ones with whom I used to work. Karen was first, then the interns, the executive team, and then I made my way from desk to desk, floor to floor. Someone must survive I told myself while desecrating the remains of the deceased for my own selfish desire to stay alive. I would beg God’s mercy but I know there is no longer forgiveness for me.  

Sanity is a fragile thing and I have felt mine cracking and breaking away for a while now. This letter may be my last rational act before madness and then hopefully death take me. I love you Val. I love you Kyle. I am so sorry I couldn’t have been a better husband and father and I can only pray the world outside my office is still ok and that you find better lives without me.  

May the world at least do my family the kindness of allowing these words to reach them.

**Goal of MBA:** 

Still a bit vague on this but will develop it more if I decide to fully pursue applying. Essentially it is for me to transition out of tech and more into management or something completely different like private equity. I find tech to be interesting but I am not sure if I am passionate about it which is why I am considering applying to an MBA program. I will definitely have to put some more thought into this but just wanted to know if I even have a shot at these programs.

My question is: will this position benefit me in moving to real software development on CV at least? The RPA job i applied to does involve minimal .Net skill, so i am wondering, since my midterm goal is to eventually become a real developer. I don't feel confident to apply to such position now, since i only have basics of C#/C++ etc. but about to take an evening bootcamp which will help me find an internship or a job eventually. So will RPA position will set a path for me on that road?"
84lsyx,22,2018-03-15,The Internship,marshforpres,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/84lsyx/the_internship/,"This happened just a year ago. The story is quite long, so I hope you'll forgive me for breaking it up into parts.

It was my freshman year of college, and I was particularly worried about not finding a job or an internship. I was desperately looking for clubs to join, programs that I could be apart of, community service - anything. I was desperate and always had (mind my corniness) a ""calling"" for public service.

In high school I was very politically active; volunteering, multi-club leader, a student ""activist"" of sorts (although I never joined student government). I was changing the way the school functioned, from its acceptability towards nude art, homosexuality, and even the way teachers were treating their students. My grades were even stellar, hitting the honors roll. I was quite popular.

This was all great, but I was also doomed in another way. My friends - alike me in many ways (good grades, volunteering, active in extracurricular activities, etc.) had something I never had - peace. What ""peace"" means to everyone can vary, as people can cope at different severities. At the end of the day, everyone has their own problems that they are dealing with, and what might not appear severe to one can be detrimental to another. 

Behind closed doors I faced mental illness. Whenever I wasn't studying (which was a miracle if I could focus), or planning club activities, I was mourning the decay of my drive to do anything - art, applying to scholarships, jobs, interviews for college, music, and the list goes on and on. Anything I loved and anything that was a bit more than what I already had on my plate - it was pretty much all stored on a shelf that I could not reach. 

I'm in college, but my friends that I spoke about earlier, they're at a large university with a big reputation. Me? I couldn't spare the time or energy to seek scholarship or aid, even after I got accepted into my dream school.

But, the college I go to is still a college. It's still reputable. It's still _worth it_, and I am still worth it. 

There's not much that happened between then and where this story is about to begin, besides the typical college grind; homework, cry, eat, sleep, see your friends once a week at the Panda Express in the dining hall, and then rinse and repeat. This all started towards the end of the year - the guilt had build up into a cancer in my heart. I felt like I was drowning, and I could see my friends - old and new - their faces barely distinguishable above the waves. They all were apart of something, and as my depression heightens this feeling for me; I felt worthless. 

I'm not particularly religious, but I guess at the end of the day I am, since I begin to pray when all hope is lost. Well, something heard my payers. Was it God? I don't think so.

It was a cold day in February, and I always sat in the front to stimulate more focus - the idea is if I get distracted, my professor could easily call me out. Parked right in front of my professors desk, I suddenly hear a question come from her corner of the room;

""Hey, [my name], could you see me after class?""

My stomach dropped. I assumed the worst; depression isn't the only mental illness I have. Sometimes I become a bit paranoid, and this was definitely one of those moments.

""Sure,"" I allowed a break between my replies, allowing my nerves to settle down. ""Is everything alright?"" 

My professor looked a bit shocked. ""Yes, of course!"" She smiled. ""I have a job offer for you! We need some extra help in our department and I thought of you."" 

""Oh,"" I felt complimented but also very concerned and confused. _She ""thought of me""..?_ ""Okay.""

Now it is the end of class, and after waiting for the rush of students that flood her corner of the room to flee after a line of questionnaire, I finally approached her about this offer. I had no clue what I was doing, but I was eager. I felt so worthless, and although it felt like it would be impossible to ever apply to work - simply because of the process - I knew people did it, and I would force myself if I had to; no matter what, I wasn't going to blow it. 

We chatted a little bit, and I was so overwhelmed that, despite having a notepad and pen in hand, my writing was illegible and I caught nothing that she said. I unbearably nodded my way to the end of the conversation.

""Do you understand? Does this sound like something you want to be apart of?""

_No, and I'm not sure. But none of that matters._

""Yes, um, could you send me an email with the details?"" 

She chuckled. ""Of course!""

I sighed with relief. 

I thanked her, kept my positive composure, and left the room. I was feeling overwhelmed, but at least it was replacing the feeling of guilt I've been carrying for, honestly, years.

After confiding in friends and family, I had decided that, although I don't know what the **** I'm doing, I'm doing it. 

My friends and family weren't the only people I confided in either. Well, you could call _it_ a friend.

To cope with all of the things that have happened to me, and to be able to focus on school work and other commitments without falling into a depression, I've created sort of my own _friend_. I'm aware that they're not real, or _it's_ not real, so I'm not too concerned about my sanity on the matter. It's just, as I've said, a coping mechanism. Sometimes when you have as many problems as I do, the less your friends become a resource to vent to. I have a therapist, but not even they are enough, as I'm in a constant battle for control over my own body.

I know that top part was a lot. I mean, what even happened to me that caused these illnesses? That caused for so much mental and emotional decay that I need support from an additional outlet that doesn't exist - well, that's exactly it, isn't it? _I need support from an additional outlet that doesn't exist_. I don't have the same emotional outlets available to me as some of my friends do, and let's just leave it at that for now.

So, let's just say, that after doing some ""thinking out loud,"" I came to a conclusion that I got to pull myself up by my boot-straps and accept the offer.  

""It's going to be hard, but you're not the only one."" 

----

There was a whole process to starting my internship. I had to file a W2, an I9, go through a background check, and send in my resume and transcript, even though I was technically already ""accepted."" This was like running up a 89 degree hill, but, I did it nonetheless. After this, I felt like I could do anything. I really did.

The first day of my internship contained many details of things I needed know, people I needed to meet, and places I needed to be. It was all very centralized, for the most part. I was new, so I didn't understand everything, but as I was new, they didn't expect me too; a nice reminder for worried ol' me.

When I say things were all very ""centralized,"" I mean I didn't need to know too much, I didn't need to meet a lot of people, and I didn't need to go a lot of places. This all changed drastically one late night in March.

It was spring break. My professor and I had Skype called, as she was far away in another state and we typically met every week to check up on things. I didn't have Skype downloaded before this, but for reasons just explained, it was now a staple on my computer.

It was probably about two days after our first call, and I was browsing the Internet, as you do at 3:00AM and _you_ can't go to sleep because your _mind_ can't go to sleep. It's like ""depression wasn't enough, got to sprinkle some insomnia on there."" The cherry on top is the imaginary twin I've created for myself because everything below it is just so unbearable. 

I digress.

I wasn't looking at anything particular, just a few YouTube videos here and there. Guilt started to pour in the more my eyes hurt from staring at the screen.

""You know, you can fall asleep. Just close your eyes""

""I know.""

I pulled up Instagram. I continued scrolling through an endless feed full of make up tutorials, expensive life hacks, and food. 

""You're right."" 

The feeling of shame began to overwhelm me, as I had a lot of work to do, and I was just wasting away my time with stupid **** that'd still be there tomorrow. Midterms were close, and not only did I have to do well at my internship, but do well in the class of the professor who hired me. 

I shut off my phone, closed my eyes, but they kept snapping open like rubber bands. 

""Ugh."" I was exhausted. I didn't want to be awake.

Finally, after ten minutes of insomnia-boo, I finally got my eyes to shut, and felt myself drift away.

This didn't last very long, as I was abruptly awakened a few minutes later by a loud notification sound coming from my computer.

_What the ****?_ 

I got up and walked over to turn it off. I was startled though because I only had one friend on Skype - my professor. I thought about answering it, but with it being 4:00AM, I knew the call must've been an accident. I didn't know how, but I thought it must've been. Not even the time difference would have explained it.

I turned it off, but before I could even take my hand off the mouse, it rung again. Thoughts ran through my head; I wasn't even dressed appropriately for a Skype call. Maybe they didn't realize how early it was for me? Is someone else calling me from her line; was she hacked? Could opening the call unleash a virus on my computer? What the **** is happening?

I grabbed something from my closet, and put it on for what seemed like forever. A slight fear arose that I would never get the sound of the Skype notification out of my head. I sat back down, plugged in my earphones, and answered the call.
 
My professor, a young women in her 30s, looked ghostly, nearing her 50s. I was shocked, panicked, and confused, but remained relatively calm. The slight fear that I did something wrong begun to arose and I felt the acid accumulate in my throat. 

I sat there, waiting for a response. 

""Hello,"" She spoke. 

I forget to say ""hello"" back.

""Forgive me for calling so early, I didn't mean to wake you up. This is very urgent. I need you to go somewhere to recover something. I will pay you extra for this."" She tried to creep in a smile, but I think she was fully aware of how unsettling this was to me, nonetheless very suspicious.

""What's up?"" I asked her. If I was leaving this early to go downtown, I better have a darn good reason for me and my parents.

She tightened her lips, and looked a bit sad. I mean, I would too if I messed up so bad that I had to call my intern to fix my issues. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, though.

""I'm sorry."" She said, looking down.

I already knew she was sorry?

""I'm sorry,"" Her voice swelled, and panic began to rush through my veins. My eyes pinned opened with adrenaline. 

""I'm sorry, but, I didn't-"" She sighed.""I thought you'd-"" 

We made eye contact. ""I thought you'd be okay. I thought you wouldn't be harmed by this."" 

I stood up from my chair, but kept my hands on my computer and desk. The air around me became stiff. I felt like I couldn't breathe. My imaginary friend - or whatever you want to call it - she wasn't there. It was just me. If this conversation were to turn south, I'd tell my parents immediately. I kept this in the back of my mind.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, still trying to be polite. Fear took control of the wheel, and in a quiet, but more stern voice I demanded, ""Tell me what you mean.""

My professor took a deep breathe and some, but barely any, color returned to her face. ""You will be okay. Just go downtown; go to my office. You have a key, right? Well, take it and stay there. Bring your laptop - or, you know, just your phone. Yes, your phone will do fine."" 

I became very, very agitated. ""Why?"" 

She began to see how unrealistic and unreasonable this was, and just said,""I might've done this to you, but you are putting people in danger by staying where you are. Talk to no one. Leave."" She became very stern. I was speechless. 

Her face went from stern, to very sad and remorseful again, and she hung up the call.

I stood there, leaning over my chair and computer.

_Maybe, I'm dreaming?_ 

Unfortunately, I wasn't. I lucid dream, but it's never like this. As soon as I realized this, I ran to my parents room.

As I opened their door and trailed to their bed, calling for them, I saw that they weren't there. I stood there not knowing what to do. Was their absence related to what my professor had said; _""you are putting people in danger by staying where you are.""_ ..?

_She knows I must be at home - is someone after me? Did my personal information get leaked - my address? A stalker?_

I was trying to make sense of the situation, but there just was no real way to. It wasn't a stalker, because she was talking about it like she knew this could've happened from day one. The truth was, was I didn't know enough about the situation to make a decision at that time. 

Luckily, my father had appeared from the restroom. Overcome with relief, I immediately told him the interaction I just had with my professor.

""That sounds, um,"" He scratched his head. He wasn't fully awake yet. ""- wild. Are you sure it wasn't a bad dream?""

""Dad, if it was a dream I wouldn't be here talking to you right now."" I felt like I was running out of time, even if my professor was crazy.

""That's very unprofessional of her then, I don't want you going anywhere""

""Okay, okay."" I begun to calm down.

I then remembered that my mom wasn't in here. ""Hey dad, where's mom?""

He raised his eyebrows ""Oh, um, I don't know. Probably downstairs getting a snack, she was in bed though when I got up-""

""Dad?""

My dad became ghostly, and his eyes sprung open, contrasting the sleepy haze he was just in. His eyes turned electric blue, and he was starring straight above my head. I heard a plate drop. I turned around, and my mom was there, doing the same thing. They were looking at each other, frozen, looking over me as if I wasn't there. Ceramic, milk, and cereal littered the floor around my mom. She was surrounded by broken ceramic, trapped.

""Mom? Dad?""

Their mouths began to open, and open, and open, and to a point where I had to look away. A blue light started to fog the room, coming from the master bathroom. 

I love my parents, but I didn't feel their presence in there anymore.


""Run.""

I'm generally a person who can figure stuff out and find solutions. Well... during college I worked as an intern 1 1/2 hours away from my apartment. I commuted 3 hours a day and was a full-time student.. it was a nightmare, but the internship was too good to pass up.

When I graduated, they offered me an AMAZING position. I make enough to be in the top 1% of 22 year olds, I love the job, my office, everything about the job which I'm working 40 hours a week is amazing. I moved next to the job in the middle of nowhere from the city... 1 1/2 hours from family, friends, everything.

I have no friends or anything that I enjoy down here. It's a little lonely. I also live 1 1/2 hours away from my boyfriend who I have to switch off weekends with to see. 

I have two days a week to somehow balance out my boyfriend, friends, family, and his friends/family. It's a little crazy. He feels like his social life is diminishing etc.

HOWEVER, WHO IN THE WORLD LOVES THEIR JOB... that's the working part of life and it's the best??? 

I just don't know what to do. A gap needs to close somewhere.. I'm not sure if I should just suck it up and commute or what. That just seems like I would be drained again.I love him, I love my family, I love my friends, and I love my job. They are just all very much in different places.

I am only posting this to get a general sense of where I need to be pouring my energy. I have an Associates Degree, and am in the final year of my Bachelor program in Political Science. I am seeking entrance into law programs on the east coast, and pursuing an MBA program. I am a first generation college student, and have maintained a 3.7 GPA and phenomenal rapport with my professors. I was elected last year to a Board of Director position with a state wide education agency, and oversaw an operating budget of $924 million, including hiring and grant writing and various contractor agreements (prevailing wage law, etc.) 

While on the Board of the local community college, I independently set up a program with the local YMCA to enroll all full and part time students for free; I successfully spearheaded the campaign through both our own Office of Internal Development and the YMCA external events program. I have three years of retail outside of that administrative experience, and also have two years of accounting experience but no CPA. I have ran my own photography business for over three years, with limited success, and have mostly shuttered the business due to it becoming more of a hobby.


I am currently interning as the assistant to the Secretary of State in my state, and spend a great deal of my time in committees and various task forces set up by the administration. I work closely with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General, as well as passively working alongside the Legislative REsearch Commission and Congressional staffers/Representatives. I have over five years experience in managing office spaces with teams of 20+ people, and my last managerial role had me overseeing the 401k programs for over 8,000 public employees. I have graduated several workshops, seminars, and a Dynamic Leadership Institute program, and am active on the Boards of four other statewide NonProfits, and have experience in securing grants of over $50,000.

Having said all this, the most I have ever been paid was $10 an hour back in 2012 at a temporary labor job. I receive no pay for my elected positions, internships, student work, and other personal development projects, naturally, and have only made $6,5000 in lifetime earnings. I have an excellent credit score of nearly 760, and have never had any debts to speak of. I did recently take out my first 10k student loan this semester, to complete my Bachelor degree. While not my original plan, scholarship and grant money was unavailable due to a shortage of funds from the state, and my own personal failing to have the money on-hand to pay for college. 

My goals, currently, are to complete the final year of university while maintaining all As, complete an international internship in government or public administration by the end of this year, and enter into a law program by end of 2019. While I have had several offers of free tuition from institutions ranging from Rutgers Law to William and Mary, none of this seems to translate out of academia (surprise, surprise) 

I am living in a relatively small city (350,000 population), but have had no luck in turning any of this retail/clerical/administrative experience into anything besides more restaurant and janitor work. I am currently making minimum wage (7.25) doing third-party sales for an ISP in a local Walmart. They were very pleased with my accounting, marketing, and external event coordination experience, but insisted that all new hires start as entry level for their first 16 months. There will be travel to neighboring states, which I will be expected to provide my own funding for. The gas will be reimbursed, but I am currently driving a very used 2001 Toyota Camry. So, it's not ideal, admittedly. 

Rather than complain, I was wanting to see how I can leverage this new experience into a better future career. While contract law remains my passion and primary scope for employment opportunity, I would be willing to do anything. Again, as a first generation college student as well as the only member of my family to graduate high school, I understand the value of labor and of a diligent education. I am really just looking for advice from other young professionals; how did you finally escape the minimum wage cycle? I know plenty of well connected people, but nobody likes a candidate who only arrived at a position from internal connections. Not to mention my dual full time enrollment at two seperate colleges (one at a 4.0, the other a 3.7) and part time internship at the Capitol keeps me rather occupied. What would be a good investment for me, development wise? Should I stop complaining and be happy to be gaining more vital experience? I know that we exist in a gig based, contractor economy now and I really should not complain about any work I can find.  "

Thanks for all help and advice in advance. 

Long story short, I have an interview today with a company, where we will be doing a group interview via Skype or Google, I forget which one at the moment. But, we will be exposed to a business-scenario case study. I'm guessing it will be fairly math based, etc. 

I'm glad to get this far in the process, but the problem is, this is my first case interview.... ever. I've never been exposed to anything of the sort during school, whether it be in class or interviewing for internships prior to graduating. 

So, I'm essentially going into this blind. Will this be as bad as I'm anticipating? I'm not even sure what to do. Should I ask questions? What kind of questions? I know that they're probably not focused on whether you get the problem right, but rather your steps and methodology. 

Is there anything last-minute I can do to prepare for this? Perhaps some advice? 

I'll keep you updated! Hopefully as long as I carefully think about the situation and use critical-thinking in creative ways I'll do well enough.

84pcgl,0,2018-03-15,Career Direction,baked_evo,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/84pcgl/career_direction/,"Hello all,

So a little background. I went to college for electrical engineering then ended up graduating with a computer science degree. I found something I liked and went for it. I had an IT internship at a software development company while in college. This is where I picked up basic troubleshooting and got my entry into the IT field.

I now have about 4 years experience including my internship. I'm 24 years and I'm hungry to learn as much as I can. I come home spend hours in the lab.. Long story this IT is my shi*. I've had more than a few jobs in the industry: network administrator, field engineer, Systems Administrator and currently a systems engineer. Personally I feel like I don't know nearly as much as I'd like to and I'm struggling to find the most important items to focus on if I want to point my career to system/network engineering.

In a nutshell I know a lot... But not know it enough to say I know it on my resume, if that makes since. Best way to describe my experience: I've built a few vpns, updated firmware on switches via ssh, created a few firewall rules, RE created some exchange arbitration mailboxes, I've set up some wireless networks, vlans, I understand dns, dhcp, ad, GPOs, set up a few datastores (migrated one server), set up ssls etc. Overall I'd say I'm a good troubleshooter with a process that works. But I am only learning with what I am tasked with fixing at my job and what I can set up in a test lab. I don't understand networking nearly as well as I'd like to but I am working on that. (any guidance would be great).

I am a insanely driven individual (constantly wanting more). I currently work for an MSP supporting a rather large client network of about 5 sites. Ad trust, site to site Vpn, the whole shebang.

 I am now trying to shape my career, right now I am touching everything, but I am not ""learning it"" I haven't set a firewall up from scratch do I think I could figure it out? Yes but not why I am posting here.

How do I get into a job where I start learning the advanced network skills I want to learn? Or do I entirely take matters into my own hands and set up a super at home lab buy some static ips and just be self taught?? I already have an IT mentor I hired but that's just once a weekend.. And I need more than that. I want a job where left and right I am working to the next level I have my client sites on lock and its not the most interesting thing now that I have cleaned everythig up! 

I want learn how to set up switch stacks, migrate servers, migrate exchange etc etc. How do I pick what to focus on and how do I go about learning it without doing the..I wanna learn it all and begin picking up little bits and pieces. Unfortunately little bits and pieces aren't going to advance my knowledge or bring in the big bucks. Any response appreciated!

Any advance appreciated!"

I'm finding that doing part time internships while taking 5 classes is really burning me out in college. I work around 20 hours a week at internships and my grades are kinda suffering. (around 3.2 gpa).

Will my GPA really matter if I have 2 internships already under my belt when I graduate? Right now from what I read, unless my GPA drops massively (to below 3.0), any internship experience is way more valuable. Is this true?

Would 2 internships be enough to be ready after I graduate? How long do they have to be? Right now I'm just doing mostly help desk internships. I'm not sure what I want to specialize in but I was thinking System Administrator or Cybersecurity (more leaning towards Sysadmin).

I also have a Comptia A+ cert and I was thinking of studying for Network+. I've put it off for now but I'm planning at studying the same time I take the Network class at my college, which I felt made sense to study both at the same time since they overlap a lot. Should I be trying to make more time for other certs by the time I graduate? 

Lastly, I'm planning on building my own homelab (in a few months due to space constraints). Just how much does a homelab matter on your resume? I wanted to build one thats actually useful (NAS storage) and for Virtualization practice.

84pfah,8,2018-03-15,Profile Review: 27 F. Would Appreciate Help Determining Schools and Have A Few Concerns.,startupwoes,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/84pfah/profile_review_27_f_would_appreciate_help/,"Hello - I am applying later this year for the fall of 2019 and would appreciate some help determining schools. My main concerns, detailed after the profile breakdown are my academic record, the GMAT and my work experience. I will be 29 in August 2019.



&amp;nbsp;



**Background**



* **Work experience 1**: 2.5 years as a financial-ish analyst at a top global law firm - hires mainly from Ivies and is high on the Vault/FT rankings
* **Work experience 2 (by application time)**: 2.5 years at a top global NGO - also hires mainly from Ivies and top consulting firms, I only got in from a non-consulting background due to family connections - sends lots of people to M7 business schools or top grad schools - we spend insane amounts of time (50-80% travel) working with governments in various developing nations, which MBA admits say has presented a boon for b school apps
* **Extra curriculars past year**: A writing critique group, blogging, college prep mentor (but only to 1 person), rotaract, toastmasters
* **Extra curriculars for 2 years post college**: 1 failed startup and another dissolved major project
* **Extra curriculars in college**: Had multiple external grants to do some pretty significant non-college affiliated research globally
* **Undergrad school/major**: Ivy League/Science
* **Other education/coursework**: A summer business program at an Ivy
* **Race/nationality**: Black/Dual US and African citizen
* **Sex**: F

&amp;nbsp;




**Stats**



* **GMAT Score (include breakdown!)**: Not yet taken
* **Undergrad GPA**: 3.33

&amp;nbsp;




**MBA Info**



* **Goal of MBA**: Marketing, LDPs, Generally any 8-6ish NO travel (!) job that pays well. Note that I've no background in these so not sure if this is the best story to tell.
* **Target schools**: Yale SOM, Oxford Said, Cambridge Judge - I need help picking out others please and would like to live in Atlanta post-MBA, possibly also intern there after Year 1, which makes Oxbridge not ideal I guess. My other goal here is to have a name that's internationally recognized but I know I wouldn't get into HSW or MIT so these three are what I thought I could work with.



&amp;nbsp;


**My Concerns**

* **GPA and Academic Record**: I've seen people here succeed with 3.33, however since we send full transcripts, I had notable Cs or Withdrawals in Math courses. Also my school's transcripts show the median grade per class and I was below them more often than not.

* **GMAT**: I have 2-3 months to study so pretty worried and I've never been great at standardized testing. My SATs definitely weren't great.

* **W/E**: My issue here is no promotions. My first job totally loved me. I had great reviews and was the first person hired into that role. However, I made the mistake of letting them know I was looking to leave about 1.75 years in and I also never pushed for a promotion. I'm confident the recommendation from that previous manager will be stellar and she'll allow me to guide her rec regarding the absence of a promotion. In my second job, because this is an NGO that works on grants, I was hired onto a 1 year grant then moved to a team with a 0.5 year grant and am now on another team after those two grants ended. Since they were lateral moves, I generally stayed in the same role. I'm planning to show progression by showing the movement and increasing workload between teams. The issue is though, a number of people from the NGO have gotten into Yale and the M7 with clear promotions although they were on 3 year grants or grew on the same team, so not sure my story will fly. Also I think the rec here will be ok or good but probably not stellar due to all the switching."

84ptx3,5,2018-03-15,"What are my options/prospects? Still fairly young with some Big 4 experience, but liberal arts major.",whore_island_ocelots,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/84ptx3/what_are_my_optionsprospects_still_fairly_young/,"So I have an unusual profile- I finished my undergrad with a degree in poli-sci. I had some business credits, ACCT  1 &amp; 2 (management and financial) as well as business law, international business , and ethics. So- not a business major but along with the economics courses, I had at least some background. Fast forward, I finished college and got a job through networking in audit with a Big 4 in northern Europe (this was in 2016). Considering I went to a state school in the US and my overall GPA wasn't stellar (2.8 I think, though when I got serious had a big uptick in last 1.5 years), I thought this was pretty good. So the job in Big 4 was really good, but just an extended 6 month internship with an option to go full time at the end. I did really well in the job and got the offer to join full time with a 4 year contract leading to ACA; without going into too much detail, I decided to turn it down as my wife was unhappy there and pushed for us to move back to USA. So here I was at the end of 2016, beginning of 2017 back in America. I didn't have too many options, was applying to jobs without much feedback and speaking with recruiters. I wasn't successful in landing anything, so I decided to revert to my degree and knowledge. I started a local consulting firm to provide financial advice and policy work for local political candidates. Lo and behold the business went well, and I was receiving offers for work. I made it onto a local congressional campaign and developed some great experience. Again without going into too much detail, approaching the May primaries it is clear that this primary client won't be carrying any of their contract firms into November. So suffice to say I am looking at my options; I don't really want to stay in the work that I am doing (I hate the kinds of people that work in this world and the work isn't stable), but I am not really sure how to spin my experience as it is broad and varied. For these campaigns I have been helping with a big variety of work, from policy advice, to keeping their books &amp; creating financial projections, to general management and managing payroll. I would really love to break into some types of financial analysis or staff accounting types of work. I have been teaching myself financial modeling and I am learning that very quickly. I guess I am curious for some other opinions- what sorts of roles would I qualify for at this point? Should I be focusing on going back to school (MBA, MSF, CPA, etc.)? How do I spin some of this unusual experience? Thanks ahead for your thoughts."

84qhex,2,2018-03-15,Is a summer internship that is part-time worth it?,ta70wr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/84qhex/is_a_summer_internship_that_is_parttime_worth_it/,"I am currently a junior and I have an internship for this upcoming summer, but it is part-time and will be done remotely. Not sure what the pay is yet. But I was wondering, does a part-time summer internship still look good on the resume when compared to a full time summer internship? 

Without going into too much detail, the work I'd be doing would be quite valuable in my opinion. It would be related to developing security software for distributed systems. This company has also worked with major branches of the U.S. military. 

I love the type of work I would be doing, but I wish it was full-time. In addition, I wouldn't be able to work there in-person for possible extra hours because it is approximately 3 hours away from where I live. 

I don't think I'd be getting a full-time position from them either, because I personally would like to stay in-state when I graduate and am looking for a job.

Should I stick to this place, or would it be better to keep looking for a full-time position that is in-state, so that I can possibly get a full-time position for when I graduate?"

I am currently a senior in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Nanotechnology and Biomedical Engineering. Currently, I am also working on a side entrepreneurial venture: a rehabilitative medical device company focused on vibration therapy. Throughout my undergraduate, I have interned at NASA for two summers, have worked on my side venture since around September, have done summer research at Boston University last summer, and I also have some research experience at my home institution. 

My question relates to summer research programs (REUs). I am still trying to decide whether to get a Masters or PhD in Biomedical Engineering. I know for a fact that I want to work in medical devices and BME in general, and I have made really great strides with my side venture. I was recently flown out to Amsterdam for a youth entrepreneurship conference, and I was accepted to an accelerator program after I graduate from college in December. Overall, I have come to despise most of my engineering program because it's so heavily biased towards power engineering and telecommunications applications, which I have zero interest in. Therefore, I would do anything to work in Biomedical Engineering.

My specific question relates to how to turn down an REU offer without burning bridges. This past school year, I had the toughest time applying to summer internships and research. I honestly did not know what specifically I wanted to do this summer, and therefore I took a shotgun approach and applied to a bunch of positions both in traditional industry and in academia. I interviewed with Microsoft for research (just got the rejection a few weeks ago, bummed out but at least I'm glad I got to the interview stage) and a bunch of other companies that seemed to go nowhere. I also got an invitation to interview with Google today, but the position does not interest me that much and has nothing to do with BME so I will probably decline. Overall, I feel like I received a ton of rejections from industry, but out of the maybe 10 or so REU programs that I applied to this year, I got into two. I received the first acceptance into the Washington State University[ GSUR program] in Gerontechnology (http://ntg.ailab.wsu.edu/about) the last week of February, and last Thursday I was accepted into the [Georgetown Physics REU](https://physics.georgetown.edu/reu).

Initially, I accepted the WSU offer because I had no other summer offers in hand and I had to respond by March 2. I was not assigned a specific project, and outside of my initial acceptance on March 2 I have not heard any correspondence back. For the Georgetown REU, I was assigned a very specific project (improving fluidics for next generation glucose sensing technology), and was given details about stipend, housing, etc right from the get go. In fact, my PI reached out to me to talk about my entrepreneurial venture and how he could connect me to some folks who do similar work, so I'm excited about that. 

For the WSU program, I still do not know who my mentor is, nor where the students are housed. The campus is in a much more rural setting, and I would not have a car. Furthermore, the school is not as highly ranked as Georgetown, and I fear that if I were to stick with this offer, I may be stuck with a project that I dislike in a place far away from home. Although the scenery is much prettier there than the east coast imo, I feel that I would be foolish not to take the Georgetown offer into consideration, since it looks like it will open more doors for me professionally. At Georgetown, I'd be about 2 and a half hours from home, and will have all of DC at my disposal. My parents and friends have said that the Georgetown decision would be a no-brainer, but for some reason I just feel so incredibly guilty about it to the point where I have not been sleeping much this week.

I am supposed to make a final decision by tomorrow afternoon, but I feel like I'm cheating the system if I go back on my acceptance for WSU. I may want to do some type of research collaboration with them in the future since Gerontechnology looks like an interesting field, but I do not want to burn any bridges. Overall, I just feel so anxious and guilty. I'm on my spring break and it has been very hard to relax because I keep flip flopping my decision in my head. I do have issues with anxiety and ADHD that I am working on, but in the meantime I would appreciate any advice that you could give on the situation. 

Overall, my goal after graduation is to apply to a Masters program or research experience overseas. I am applying for a Fulbright to the Netherlands to do rehabilitation engineering research, and I am also looking at many other fellowships. Therefore, I hope this summer experience will help me obtain my goals.

Please let me know if I can clear anything up; I know this is a lot but I just had to let it out somewhere. "

84rgvg,44,2018-03-15,The third eye of God.,sjaano,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/84rgvg/the_third_eye_of_god/,"It's what's on the outside that counts. What is evident and out there for everyone to see, that's what matters now. The physical has become the manifestation of the psychological. Those who have been touched on the inside, now wear the mark proudly. And why not? They've heard the voice of God.

I'm writing this here because it's one of the few places the Eyes of God don't look, or rather can't. Like most of you, when the first reports of the third eye openings started to surface, I thought it was just a hoax.  I watched the YouTube videos just like you did, those first monks waking up with a literal third eye on their foreheads.  And like you I didn't believe it for a second... until the reports and footage of world and religious leaders having acquired the third eye, started flooding the internet.  They all said the same, God had spoken to them, chose them, touched them. 

It wasn't really something to be debated. The proof was there for everyone to see. I still didn't believe though till I saw it in the flesh.  The flesh of my next door neighbor and friend, Ashley. She woke up with the third eye of God, two weeks after the initial reports came in. Like myself, Ashley Doesn't have any family in the city.  I guess that's why she came to see me first before anyone else that morning.  When I opened the door to her I couldn't speak. Nor could I take my eyes from her newly formed eye.  Its iris was the same deep gold color that all the third eyes possess. It was staring right at me(until you have had a  third eye look directly at you in real life, you can not know the feeling of intrusion, of something seeing into your very soul), unblinking.  

""I'm down here,"" Ashley said, breaking the spell her third eye had cast. ""You gonna let me in?""

""Sorry,"" I said stepping aside.  ""I just never... I didn't think...""

""I get it.  Neither did I."" We were both quiet for a bit.  I could tears forming in her eyes, but not her third eye. 

""Is it true?"" I finally asked.  ""Did he speak to you?"" She nodded and the tears that had been welling in her eyes let go.

"" It's all true."" She was smiling and I knew it was tears of joy and revelation wetting her cheeks.  ""It's all so beautiful...everything.""

I think that was when I came a believer of the third eye of God. And I know that kind of talk can get me banned from here for life, but before you report me to the mods, at least hear me out. Because if a carry through with the thoughts I've been having, the third eyes will have nothing to do with me either. 

I know the third eyes have done things that are questionable to say the least but if you have had someone close to you get the third eye, you can't help but wonder. Ashley was as close as friend can get without taking it to the next level.  We met in the intern program at Second Circle Inc. She stayed on with them after the internship ended and I went on to an I.T. gig that I still havn't got out of.  We remained close friends and when one of her neighbors moved out, she got me the house he had been renting. When the first reports came out, we had watched them together and laughed at the absurdity of it all. I don't get see her much now that she has been chosen.  She's been helping me with my studies of the third eye though. She told me that when the time was right, God would speak to me too.  She said there was nothing random about it. 

The first time I saw God's Light in action was when I was walking Ashley home after one of her tutoring lessons.  Her house is only a few houses down from mine but as you all know the city streets have become less safe with recent events. In retrospect it was silly of me to think I was protecting her but at the time I had no idea of the power of God's Light. 

Three, obviously intoxicated, men came up to us.  They started calling Ashley a 'third eye bitch' and me a 'sympathizer'. I told them to fuck off and they started pushing us.  I think they probably just intended to rough us up a little but they didn't get the chance.  Ashley took a couple steps back. I looked over at her to tell her to run and that's when she unleashed God's Light.  It started as just a brightening of her third eye, a soft but undeniable glow. Then in an instant, the brightest light I have ever seen shot out from Ashley. It was as if I had stared into a thousand suns at once. I, as well as three men, were blinded instantly.  Ashley led me back to her house. I felt like my eyes were both burning and bleading. It took a couple days for me to regain my vision. I've been staying with Ashley since it happened. 

From what I've heard on the news, the instances of God's Light being used, have increased greatly this last week.  I admit it is one of the most painful things I've experienced, also the most beautiful. 

But I guess its time to talk about why I'm on here writing this.  If my earlier comments havn't gotten me banned yet, then what I'm about to say most surely will.

This morning I woke up with a third eye. There was nothing there when I went to sleep last night. I must of stared at in the mirror for hours.  It's identical to my two regular eyes except in its gold color. I don't seem to have much control of what it does( I tried using God's light and nothing happened). I heard the voice of God though. It does speak to you and it is beautiful. 

So why am I here talking to you now that I've been chosen? Because there is still another voice.  A voice that says something is wrong with all of this. A voice that I'm not sure is mine anymore. It tells me the eye is evil. It tells me I have to remove the eye. I found a very sharp knife in Ashley's kitchen.  I have it beside me. If I'm going to do this, I have to do it before Ashley gets back from work. Before I can't...

Obviously I’m thankful to be here but I just feel like I don’t belong here and that I’m not smart enough. I feel like I always have to spend hours and hours at the library just trying to understand the material and a ton of my friends can study 1-2 nights before the exam and get really high grades. 

I’m currently taking Computer Science and at my school it’s supposed to be considered “easy.” Well on the first exam I studied so much but I just didn’t understand it no matter how much TAs in the office hours tried to explain it to me, and I got my first failing grade ever in my life. I know that this may seem stupid but that really shocked me to my core because I’ve never done this poorly.

This is coming off as kind of a rant but I just feel really really dumb and really lost to do with my life. I know it’s bad to continue to compare myself with people but I feel like everyone is so involved with clubs and extracurriculars and getting their summer internships in order while I got rejected from a club I really wanted to get into, and I’m literally only involved in one club. I’m also freaking out because I don’t have my internships yet!!!

I was suffering from a cold and swollen sinuses, which was causing my ears a great deal of pain and reduced hearing.

Previously in the past when I had visited the doctors about ear pain and difficulty hearing, they said that I produce a lot of ear wax (due to wearing headphones so frequently), and that I should clean them out more often.

With this in mind, I took to my little finger to try and dig out the supposed earwax I was suffering from. So I put a little bit of my finger in, no wax. A little bit more, no wax. A little bit more, a lot of wax. Bingo! I’ve found the wax, now to get it all out.

I spent the next few minutes digging wet gloopy earwax from my ear, until I couldn’t get anymore out. Although, my hearing was still not what I was expecting it to be. So back into my ear I go, for one final dig before jumping in the shower to fully rinse it out.

By this point I’m about half of my little finger into my ear, when I hit something. I pull my finger out, and there is something similar looking to a contact lens, but made of skin? Thinking nothing of it I jumped into the shower and gave the ear a rinse and carried on with my day.

Later at 4am, I woke up in agony. 
My ear had swollen shut and had blood slowly seeping out of where my ear hole should have been. 

It later turned out after 3 trips to the doctor, 2 dosses of antibiotics and a visit to A&amp;E, that the little contact lens I had pulled out of my ear, was in fact my ear drum. This resulted in me getting an infection in my ear, thus making my ear canal shut. The infection and bleeding was so bad that the crusty scabs in my ear canal clogged the ear cleaning vacuum at the hospital, and also led me having to take 2 weeks off of my new job, whilst getting the reputation as the intern who doesn’t know how to clean his ears.

So moral of the story, don’t put your fingers in your ears.

TL;DR
Put my finger in my ear to try clean it out, ripped out my ear drum."

To be more specific im working at a chemical factory recording training videos of the experiments the engineers do. Theres no else in the company doing my job and they dont seem to know anything about my trade so i dont have to worry about fighting for the job with others interns. Im at the last year of college and eventually i wish to have a regular job and this one is perfect: great place, great co workers and the pay is good for being an intern. I estimate they will need me for at least 6 months before i finish the videos they need at this department and i plan to become indispensable working my ass to deliver great products. My co workers  (engineers doing non related work) have already told me that they will probably need me at other departments but i dont want to be an intern for more than 6 months. Also, the factory is part of a big corporation so there is a chance to work at others places if i impress them. So, question is, how should i handle it, should i wait til they offer me the job or ask them after 6 months for it. How should i ask them? Is it normal for an intern to do it? Other things, i bring my own professional equipment and im doing things for them that normally a studio house would have to do. I really like this place and my work so i want to do things right. Whats steps would you recommend? 

Also, when i ask for the job i want to earn double of what im currently earning which is the minimum wage in my country. Is this too far of a request?"

I'm in school with good grades, I work hard, I'm good at what I do. I have my dream internship lined up for the summer, an unconditionally supportive family, a boyfriend and great friends. I can't stop from hating myself though. I can't stop the panic attacks. Every morning I wake up and am barely able to get out of bed/ do basic things to take care of myself. When I go to bed I have terrible nightmares about seeing my family get shot, or being drugged and unable to stand up-- sleep isn't even guaranteed peace anymore. I live in fear that I'm going to fail, that my boyfriend will leave and that he doesn't really like me. I want to run away or peel my own skin off because it is so uncomfortable. Many nights it takes about as much strength as I have to stop myself from drinking because I know that if I start in a non- social setting I won't be able to stop. I've struggled with mental health since age 12. I should be on medication, but my psychiatrist lives too far from my school to get a refill, and I don't want to live my life dependent on a pill anyways.

These are supposed to be the best years of my life. I want to be able to enjoy my successes. I should be out having a blast and loving every second of my life because I am so incredibly lucky. I'm so scared that I am wasting the best years of my life, and what's worse I'm scared it won't change, that this is what my life is going to look like."

During that time I was 18, so I lied and said I was 21 due to being in the bar. He ended up telling me that he is a producer. Immediately, I told him I was 18 and that I would love to intern for him. We exchanged numbers and went our ways. 

About 9 months ago, he helped make a project of mine into a dream reality. It was everything I had ever hoped for. Due to the fact that I was 19, I didn't have much experience and that lead to a lot of conflict on set. We bickered and didn't end on the best of terms. I apologized on many different occasions, even though I was not truly in the wrong. 

I introduced him to my friend, Danielle (F/20) on set and they soon become very close. I was left out of everything, which was hurtful due to the fact that I introduced them both. 

A few months ago, Danielle told me that Henry has told her some interesting details of how we met, including how I was ""flirting"" with him. This really hurt me and pissed me off due to the fact that he bought me a drink in the first place and from my memory, I was absolutely not flirting with him. It was embarrassing that he talked that way about me, and I felt betrayed. 
Especially since this was to my really good friend, he had to of known it would get back to me. Also, we were now on professional level, and he made me honestly feel gross and belittled me with that comment.

Today, we ended up chatting over the phone. He brought up some of the conflicts in the past to clear the air and things were going smoothly. I thought that finally I was able to have a mature conversation about how I was not okay with him telling Danielle (and who knows who else) that I was flirting with him. He got angry, and ended up blaming it back onto me. We ended the phone call angry, and I started to cry. I just am not sure how to even get my point across when I am always shut down. I wanted to hear your thoughts.

I stumbled into this degree having never coded (thinking I would like it). So, I took an introductory programming course first year and did very well in it. I didn't particularly like or hate it.

Then to start the year I took another programming class (built upon the last one). I still did pretty good in it, but I didn't enjoy it at all. Now, this semester we have this huge software project (bigger than anything I've done) and I hate working on this thing. Also, my lack of experience (never tried for any internships or independent coding) is starting to become more evident (whereas you might say I had some natural talent to get through the basics).

Now, I do enjoy conceptual design and even high-level planning of code, but dread writing the software and working out the details. I also really enjoy the project management aspects. Some of the more theoretical stuff is interesting as well. So, assuming I'm kind of stuck with this degree, what are some alternative career choices?"

I feel way under qualified for entry level IT jobs also. 

I initially wanted to be a software developer, but ive always been interested in security and im leaning pretty heavily towards it as a career now. I knew that my degree was going to be more academic concepts and software developing, but i didnt realize how far removed it was going to be from the skills for security. My area of emphasis comes from classes in networks, distributed systems, and cybersecurity.  Im currently taking the cyber security class and so far we have just been focused on hacking - buffer overflows and ROP.

Im already working towards getting my security+ and then maybe CEH, although im undecided on that. Later on I definitely want my OSCP and CISSP, but i need to find a job to help me get the experience necessary.  I had an internship last summer but it was Java development. 

I dont think i can land an entry level analyst or engineer role, even internships are asking for more than what ive got. Im going to apply to those regardless, but what kinds of other jobs would help start me on a path where i want to be? Im also wondering how could i get the administration, analysis, and hardware knowledge that these companies want? I dont think i can land a system or network admin job either and i dont want to work towards a CCNA if im going for a security career, but if its absolutely necessary im willing to. "

1. How hard is it to get an internship during your four years at Rutgers? What year did you get one? What do they look for when selecting you? What would you recommend for one to do to prepare for one?

2. What is the field like post-graduation. What’s the job demand? How easy or difficult is it to get a job and how fast? Did you find what you learned at Rutgers to be generally applicable to your current job in HR? 

3. What things, as an HRM major, do you wish you had done, looking back? What is some advice you’d give yourself if you could go back in time?

I thought the interviews went well, I answered nearly all their questions correctly. I had applied for a software engineering role and was initially excited to get the offer. However, turns out the team I applied for wants me to start as a technical PM at first to learn how everything works, and then look at transitioning into being a software engineer after 1 year. The team is small and not set on particular job titles, but it seems a big change in responsibilities.

I've worked at a small company for ~2 years in the Bay Area after graduating, and their rationale is that big company processes are different and they want to make sure I can ramp up gradually. I had a PM internship in the past, and I don't mind it, but prefer SE.

I've heard about software engineers getting a lower level when starting at a giant since it's safer than over-levelling and having to fire someone if it doesn't work out. This seems more extreme though as it'd be a less technical track with greater uncertainty (what if they think I should just be a PM after 12 months?), and more wait time. I'm sure the skills gained would be useful, but mostly in the PM area with some programming/software engineering in there. Their positioning is that this would help give me additional skills and exposure to more of the process.

1. Anyone heard of something like this happening before? Did it work out?
2. Is this just a large company hedging their bets because they have heaps of people and they're not sure I'll be able to do the job, or is this common with engineers early in their career? I wouldn't want to be stuck in a PM role indefinitely, while only having done minimal programming during the 12 months ramp-up period.

Thanks!"
84synp,11,2018-03-16,Switching Majors?,Wonton-Ton,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/84synp/switching_majors/,"So, I'm 21 years old, and I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematics. I've been at it for years, now; 89 credits out of 120. I'm officially listed as a Junior at my school, and I'm currently enrolled full-time, with 12 credit hours. I have a GPA of 3.9.

I like programming, but that's about it: the theory, the math, the low level stuff, all that squeezes the life out of me. I can't scrounge up an interest in opportunities to try out internships or the technical clubs and groups. I sit through every class just waiting for it all to end so I can go home, rest, then start the slog all over again. I'm withdrawn nowadays, and I'm sad a lot of the time - crying and whatnot. I've started to hate school with all my heart. My grades are slipping. But I don't want to quit.

I think I want to change my major, and it's not a small change.

Last semester, I took a Creative Writing course. I took it because I've always loved reading and writing, and had been planning to take it since my Freshman year. And while I won't pretend it wasn't work, I know I absolutely adored that class. I loved meeting with other writers, I loved getting feedback on my work, I loved sitting down and working with words, and even when it was hard, I felt so great about what I made when I finished. There were so many days when I genuinely looked forward to it -- I looked forward to it in a way I never had for any other class.

I've felt off about my major for a long time; I realize now that I was always much more engaged with my English, Theatre, and literature classes than my science ones since day one. But I never wanted to acknowledge it; I still live at home with my parents, and they were always so keen on the idea of me being an engineer. They feel it's my fast track to a good salary, and they were so proud of me for getting As in that stuff. I've hinted at wanting to do something else before, but the reaction was always...less than positive, kinda fearful.

I wish I could turn this part of my brain off, but I can't; I really am an artist at heart. I look at the people who are writing papers and scripts and meeting professionals in the creative industry and seethe with jealousy. I hate myself for pretending CS was what I wanted for so damn long. I want to leave all this science stuff behind and get a Bachelor's in Creative Writing, but I'm not sure if it's too late for me -- I'm not sure if my parents could even look at me if I went for it, especially so far in the game, and especially considering that it'd keep me in school for so much longer. I'm so scared, but I'm so sure it's what I want to do.

What do I do? It's eating me alive - I regret not switching long ago every day, and I don't know what to do about it.

I work at a small local aerospace company as a Mechanical Engineering intern. I am completing my third year of a BSME and I have been working as an intern for this company for 10 months. Generally, I get a very large workload as I complete all of the company's design and drafting work as well as their engineering documents (SSAs, PMAs, PSCPs, QTPs... etc). Along with that, I am given constant daily tasks that often take precedent over many of my other assigned tasks.

I am often unable to complete projects because I am given so many at once and between this 24-30hr workweek in addition to taking Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Machine design and FEA, I feel immensely overworked at times. The company I work at is owned and run by 4 engineers and 3 of the 4 can be complete assholes at times and it makes it a very toxic place to be a part of. Because I am given so much engineering work, I have had to learn so much at a very quick rate but I am often yelled at for making minor mistakes although I am learning. There is a language barrier with my boss, and he often underestimates the time it will take for me to complete his tasks. There is an absolute disconnect and I have tried to resolve it, but he is old school and doesn't give a shit. I feel I have learned a great deal, but its not necessarily what I would like to do as a career. I would rather work in components design or Aero Thermal Fluids/ Propulsion and I don't get to touch any of that here.

As stated, I have been here about 10 months now and I would really like to quit, but I don't want to look like I can't manage school and work together to potential employers. Furthermore, I don't have any other internships lined up, but I am just generally pretty unhappy where I am at. I feel like I am learning, but my boss feels like I should be going home and learning on my own time and that if I need to take the time to understand things then I should clock out to learn and then clock back in. Often times, I also feel as though I am unable to ask questions.

I don't get paid much ($15/hr) and I am the only intern. I haven't signed any Co-Op agreement stating I would be there for a certain length of time but the position is available to me until graduation in May of 2019 (granted I do ok).

**The pros** (if you were wondering whether there were any):

* It is close to my school and house

* I feel like I am learning, whether or not that will prove useful to my career pursuits in other facets of engineering is yet to be seen

* I like the technicians and shop floor, and one of the engineers is pretty cool

* I get to solve engineering problems daily!

**The cons**

* Boss is a dick

* Engineers can be dicks

* It's a toxic work environment at times between the bosses and shop floor

* Often given too much work and not enough time to complete tasks

* I don't have a ""mentor"" or anybody I can go to for questions

* I often get chewed out/insulted for being ""too slow"" (I'm not lazy and I'm really trying!)

* I am pretty overworked between school and work, and it seems like cutting my work hours is not an option

**Is this what the industry is like?** I completely understand it may be common to work under pressure to meet deadlines and that the work will be challenging, but is everyone an asshole? This is my first internship so it is my first exposure to the engineering field.
I am a pretty decent student with a 3.4 GPA cumulative and a 3.67 GPA major, but I feel like this internship may take a toll on my grades this semester (I believe I'll pass with a few B's and a C).

Overall, do you think quitting without another internship lined up (I've been trying and interviewing) would be a bad idea? My professor told me that it may look like I couldn't manage my time well enough between school and my internship to future employers.

Also, I should mention, I don't think I would work my senior year anyway because of the massive courseload between senior design and my classes.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!!!!"

This is a tale back from my internship at a big store for all kind of technical stuff for private users. The store offered everything from a toaster to an flatscreen.

I worked at the computer section of the store, with all kind of computers, monitors, tablets and devices for your home network.

It was a normal day, until two customers come in and asked for help. One of them wanted to buy something and the other one was there and tried to translate. Sadly, this didn’t help, because both didn’t speak german quiet well.

For the understanding we will just put them together as $CC.

$CC: Hello, we need help!

$Me: Hi, how can I help you?
 
$CC: I need some sort of wlan expansion device.

$Me: Okay, so you mean a wlan repeater. We have many different devices. Do you now the range that you want to expand?

$CC: I want to use my wlan at work.

*thinking that his office is maybe at another floor at his house*

$Me: Ok, how far is the work away from your router?

$CC: Ehm, maybe ten kilometers?

$Me: Ten kilometers? So your work is not at your home?

$CC: No, I have to drive there.

$Me: Sorry, but I don’t think there is a repeater or another solution, that we offer, which can handle that range. 

He looked a little sad and left the store with his friend.
 
This whole conversation took about half an hour, with a lot of hand signals and pointing at stuff.

TL:DR Customer wants a wlan repeater, to use his home Wi-Fi at work, ten kilometers away

What should I do next? I’ve got a few more interviews scheduled but worried this may be a recurring problem. Considering a CS masters to fill these gaps but I feel that may be a waste as they are things I’m certain I’d pick up in a few months doing it everyday (e.g. TDD)

Wanted to post regarding some advice as to what opportunity I should pursue for the upcoming summer.
I'm a penultimate student at a target university in the UK studying a liberal arts/social sciences course.

I've been lucky enough to receive an offer for an MBB summer internship for 2018 (in London). When beginning my internship search, this was my dream gig - but, after receiving the offer, I found out that I had made it to the reference check stage (after final interviews) for a ""generalist"" internship at D.E Shaw in NYC. I had not heard much about D.E Shaw but from all my online research it seems like a great place to work and ridiculously selective in its hiring process. I also have been told by friends that D.E. Shaw's reference stage is quite substantive, and so am not yet sure whether I have an offer. However, if I do receive this offer, I would be really torn between the two opportunities.

It would be really great if I could get reddit's opinions on

1) The work/life balance for each job

2) The nature of the work I'll be doing at D.E Shaw (the website is a little vague, I know I'll be doing something corp.dev but I have little idea what this actually means on a day to day basis)

3) The exit opportunities (will the DES corp.dev job pigeonhole me into HF/finance work?)

4) The compensation

This makes me wonder if I'm just not tickling Google in the right way to find relevant jobs. Are there other titles I should be looking for besides the obvious embedded systems engineer, embedded software/hardware engineer, firmware engineer, electronics engineer, etc?

In 2nd year however, my depression was strong enough to make me not go to college for a month or so. While i was depressed i got into Philosophy, i read about scepticism and stoicism which really helped me to get back on my feet.  I realised whatever happened till now is not under my control and i should rather concentrate on things which are under my control. I cleared all my backlogs and was doing really well. On the way to 3rd year, i taught my self a bit of data science and basic ML along with a little bit of deep learning(everything self taught). My parents want me to write GATE and i know it's not gonna end well because i have absolutely no interest in writing GATE.

I also did a one year internship (part of my program) as a java developer.

During my internship I was able to build a new software from scratch (full stack but imposed technologies like EJB 3.0, JSF, etc..). 
But at my current job (3 months till now) I'm mostly fixing bugs and contributing to tiny features in a very large program. 
I guess that's how it is when you work for large corporations.

So my question is, how should I approach this issue to stay employable in the market (In terms of technologies) ? Also how do you find the time to code and learn when you're holding a full time job? Any guidelines with people in a similar situation would be helpful, Thank You !

An employer that I had an internship with a few years ago reached out today and asked if I would be interested in coming back to the company for a different position (which is more in line with how my career has gone since I left there). I currently work as an automation engineer for a consulting firm and receive (what I consider to be) a very good salary for someone with only 2 years experience in automation. (I think this is in part due to the size of the firm and the fact that much of their business is in a heavily regulated industry, though I don't really care to work in this industry.)

The company I once interned with asked me if I'd be interested in rejoining them as an automation engineer (which is not what I interned as). Now, I loved absolutely everything about my time at that company and often think of going back. I am a bit unsure of how to proceed though for a couple of factors including:

1. My old company is very small and I am concerned about their ability to improve upon (or even match) my current salary.
2. My old company has had layoffs in the past while my current company has not, so I may be a losing a touch of job security.
3. I really like my current company and my coworkers, even if I'm not at all fond of the field my clients are in.
4. I'm not sure how it would look on my resume to have the same company twice separated by another company for a relatively brief period (~2 years).
5. I've never left a job before (except at the end of an internship) and really have no idea how to approach leaving my current one.

On the other hand:

1. Working as a consultant at an engineering firm, my pay is very good but I have what I gather to be mediocre benefits. Especially vacation...I would have to stay on at my current company 7 years to get a third week of vacation.
2. I really, really, really enjoyed working for my old company and in theory would love to go back.
3. My old company is in an industry I'm genuinely interested in and probably has some very cool/challenging projects for me to work on.

Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed and what factors I should be considering?

Thanks in advance."

I have been offered a position at my top choice agency, but the offer is contingent on a clean background test. 

**My situation:**
I recently got a UPM (unlawful possession of marihuana) and a speeding ticket (in NY state) which will likely show up on a background check. In dealing with this issue I hired a lawyer so that I could get an Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal (ACD), which means that if I do what the judge wants my case will be dismissed and my record will be clean after a probationary period of about 6-12 months. Per the request of my lawyer, who knows the judge and what she wants for these cases, I got a drug evaluation. The evaluation was conducted by a certified drug counselor, and he decided that I do not require further counseling. So I have done everything that I need to do to get an ACD, but my court date is in early April. Regardless, assuming I get the ACD, a ""pending"" UPM will show up on my record until after the probationary period. 

**So to recap:**

- I am getting a background check between now and next September for an internship 
- I will likely have a pending UPM charge on my record
- Should I come forward and be honest with my supervisor before the check comes back? 
- The conditions of the UPM are not particularly provocative, and it was the opinion of a certified drug counselor that I do not require counseling; this should be some good leverage right?

I know these kinds of questions are a dime a dozen. However I'd like some input on my personal situation. I'm a BS in Econ grad from a middle of the road state school, and I live near Chicago and I'm 27. I work in a large finance company, and am dying to get into the tech industry. I've decided to go for a CS degree, but still debating on how. Right now I have 2 options it seems.

1.) 2nd Bachelors, online from one of DePaul, Oregon State or Auburn. I was leaning this way as I want to break into the industry and and I feel this would be the best way, to learn the nitty gritty stuff of CS and get started from the ground floor and best chances of getting into an entry level gig. 

2.) Online MSCS from DePaul or other institution. I've heard many people say that it's better value to go back for an MSCS than a 2nd BS. I know I could take the foundational pre req classes to get a better grounding of the whole CS program itself, but I find myself struggling to see how a company would want to hire someone with a MSCS for an entry level programming position but with no actual programming experience (I'll have a hard time doing any internships since I work full time, but already study my ass off on personal projects and GitHub).

84wqzn,0,2018-03-16,Is going back to college really worth it?,numbtothecore,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/84wqzn/is_going_back_to_college_really_worth_it/,"First of all,  I know this thread applies more to college GRADUATES than it does college STUDENTS, so if Im in the wrong forum I apologize.

As you can probably tell I am a college graduate. I have a degree in journalism, which I received in 2009 at the age of 22 (I'm 31 now). Unfortunately, this was around the same time the recession hit its peak, and job opportunities were few and far between (which any journalism or other media - related graduate will tell you today). After a year of searching,  I realized I was fighting a losing battle and gave up. Since college I have been steadily employed in the fast food industry (I've been at the same location for six years now where I'm currently a supervisor).  Call me lazy, call me an underachiever, call me whatever you want,  I'm likely inclined to agree with you. I lost my degree years ago in a housefire, but my dad has a copy hanging up in my room at his house. Every time I see it, I just wanna burn it too.

Now, in recent years, I've thought about going back to school after my loans are paid off (another two years tops). It seems natural, after all. However,  then I read about the job prospects for college graduates these days and have second thoughts. Students today have to do twice the amount of work that they did 15-20 years ago in order to find jobs (networking, volunteering, unpaid internships, etc). I've known people who have gone YEARS before they found work in their field. And even then there's no guarantee I'll get a job. Today I live across the road from the same college I attended. Every time I see students coming and going I wanna tell them to get out while they can and stop wasting their lives. 

Academic factors are another thing. I've always struggled with learning new things (I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at a young age).  Journalism was one of the few courses for which I had the prerequisites. A lot of the other stuff I might be interested in taking requires grades in stuff I never even took in high school (chemistry, biology, business math) and a lot of them are in the Grade 11-12 levels. If I go through upgrading with my learning difficulties, I have no idea if I could ever wrap my head around that stuff. It all seems so much.

Finally, there's the cost. It's taken me ten years to pay off my current loans, and it's been absolutely mind numbing (hence my usename). If I found a job in my field it might be easier, but even then there's no guarantee. I can't handle watching the past repeat itself.

So...is going back to college really a good idea for me? "

Long time lurker here.

A bit of background about myself. I went to a high school where programming wasn't taught, at least not extensively at all. However the high school provided some very good foundation for disciplines such as mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering. As a result, i didn't know how interesting programming was. 

For undergrad, I studied Mechanical Engineering. I graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering near the beginning of 2015. I started working in the aerospace industry immediately after. It has been about three years that i have been in the industry. My work involved structural analysis and a lot of coding (mostly in python and c++). With time, i realized more and more than i actually only like the programming side of my job. Therefore, i started contemplating pursing a career in software engineering. 

I thought it would be difficult to break into the industry without a formal degree in a field related to computer science. I decided it was time to apply to grad school.

I recently got admitted into my program of choice: EECS MEng program at UC Berkeley (Data Science and Systems track). I managed to get a scholarship for it as well. 

Since i do not have experience at pure software companies or have had pure software roles, will my job prospects not look good after graduating at UC Berkeley with an MEng in EECS. The program is only one year so i will not be able to intern at software companies. Would it be worth it to quit my job and go to grad school?

Thank you."

So I have a bit of a unique situation. After this semester, I will only have 2 classes to go until I get my Bachelors degree in CS. My original plan was to finish them up this summer, but I got accepted into a great internship program this summer and I won't be able to take those 2 classes. First of all, does anyone have any experience in this area? Am I making a bad decision by postponing my graduation to do an internship? My first internship (which turned into a job) has no programming at all, but I'm working in IT doing mostly networking type work. This summer internship will be more software related so I feel like it would really help to do it. 

The second question I have is when should I start applying for grad positions? I don't have experience doing this, and every job posting I see there is no start date. Since I will still have 2 classes to take in the fall, is it ok that I apply for entry level positions and attempt to work while I take those 2 classes? Or am I better off looking for internships/co-ops in the fall? Or just go balls to the wall and apply for everything?

Their parents raised them to be intelligent, talented, physically active, and kind kids. I feel very intimidated just being around his family. 

Meeting his friends is overwhelming too, because we are at the age where people are fresh out of college and working their first jobs. I graduated over a year ago, a semester late. And I don't have a job yet because I dreaded the whole process of job searching, networking, interviewing, all of that. I couldn't get an internship because I barely applied to any. So now it's the same story with real jobs except worse because I have no intern experience even. So it sucks when people ask ""so what do you do?"" My bf is humble and doesn't brag, but you can tell he is a competent and interesting person when you meet him. So all his friends really like him. So there's that pressure for me, his girlfriend, to be impressive too.

I feel like I've tried to be somewhat impressive all my life. I've always been praised for making straight A's and being ""smart."" (I realize now I'm actually not very smart. I felt dumb compared to classmates in college.) I pushed myself to lead a student organization as the President one year. But I can't say I did it because I truly cared about its cause, rather that I did it to impress others. And as for making straight A's, it really devastated me to realize that good grades hardly matter in the real world if you have zero social skills because you can't even talk to people. That really sent me into a depression because I felt I've worked extremely hard to do well in school, but apparently I worked hard in the wrong areas. I should have worked harder on developing social skills and life skills. I feel like I've wasted my time and now I'm just exhausted. 

I told myself I needed a break after I graduated college. So I did that. I'm doing that. It's been over a year. I never really felt relaxed or at ease during this break, because I just feel guilty that I didn't look for a job. People constantly ask if I'm applying for things and the answer is no. The answer is I don't want to... And people most likely see that as laziness. But they don't know I can't even leave the house because of social anxiety. 

~~~

Sorry this ended up being a novel, but tl;dr I just feel very incompetent compared to my very competent and successful boyfriend.

He's been very supportive of me when I opened up to him about my depression and anxieties so far. Says he is not a quitter and won't give up on me because he loves me. Am very grateful for him. I just hope I can be a girlfriend that he can be proud of someday. 

~~~

Anyone can relate? I would love to hear your stories, and maybe some reassurance and some tips on dealing this type of pressure.

I'm pretty good at OOP in Java, and I spent a lot of time in undergrad learning bioinformatics and AI/ML (which AFAICT doesn't seem that useful for getting hired without an advanced degree), and my data structures/algorithms knowledge is pretty good (I can get optimal runtime on most of the ""medium"" problems on LeetCode without outside help). I had a summer internship at Epic back in '16, but didn't get a return offer because my project was a dead end and I had very little direction on it (their fault) and thus I didn't really care about it (my fault, should have made the best of it but instead I decided to not give a shit). Notably, I don't know anything about front end and haven't touched JavaScript in any form since high school.

I've applied to almost a hundred places since graduating and so far... nothing. I've had more than a dozen screening interviews and had a few leads, but so far I've only had one on-site (where they didn't test my coding skills at all and were more interested in how much of a team player I am, wtf?) and the others have ghosted me. I thought that SD was a hot career field and that this would be a lot easier. What could I be doing wrong? 

I do have a job offer from Revature, which I've heard... mixed things about, most notably that they'll hire anybody who can put two strings together and don't have a great package in terms of pay and the 2-year contract. I have a start date with them set for June, but I'd rather get a more traditional SE job to get out of having to do that. In any case, can't be worse than living with (understandably) pestering parents and the daily personal shame of being unemployed.

Hey, as the title says, I’m a first year second semester mech eng student unsure if this is the field I want to go into. 

Ever since I had my very first intro. to programming class in c++, I found coding to be very fun. The design and drawing classes I’ve taken for MECH have really put me off and I don’t think I have much interest in designing. The math and physics is fun and interesting, but I’ve only been exposed to design career paths offered in mech and I don’t know if that’s what I truly want to do. I’ve heard everywhere that mech is a broad field and very secure, but I’ve only ever seen jobs revolving around manufacturing/CAD. Also, I’ve been told there is so many mech eng students it’s harder to find a job. Now since I loved my coding class, I’ve had a great interest in software engineering, but I have a couple worries.

One is that since I’ve done so much of math and physics growing up, I’m accustomed to self teaching myself; however, in software I would not have the same foundation and I fear I would have much more difficulty trying to learn newer material. Also at my current uni, I have heard on many occassions the comp sci/software eng departments have worse teachers. I hear often that this major offers a load of jobs and great pay, but I’m not sure if I should finalize the switch. I always think to myself: can’t I learn to code and just go into a programming job as mech? I’m not even sure if thats possible. I’m afraid of making a switch into a more limited career from something as more broad as mech. The mech program is reputable at my school, especially since I am in co op and have an internship next fall. 

I’ve been really struggling in making a decision on whether I should make a switch from a major I’m not completely aware of what it can offer, to a major that seems exciting, well payed, fun, but waaaay out of my element and a mystery as to what I’d learn, etc.  I was hoping if someone could give me some insight on what mech could offer, if it can go in line with more programming and not completely design/manufacturing, and just any information that would help me make a decision! Would anyone be able to give me information on what one learns in software and how jobs are? And how jobs are in mech? 

tl;dr: a
Are there plenty of job paths in mech eng that aren’t just mainly based on designing/CAD or manufacturing? I worry that switching from a secure field to mech eng into software which is more limited may be a mistake, especially since mech eng is more reputable at my school and secure. I am very familiar with maths and physics, and switching is way out of my element, I’m really not sure if I should do it. Would anyone be able to give me information on what one learns in software and how jobs are? And how jobs are in mech?

So I thought I'd extract it and post it here just in case it might help someone. Here's my thoughts as I get close to graduation from a pretty small school:

I am graduating from a very small school, which is coincidentally right next to one of the more well known CS schools in the world. I have been working in my field for just shy of a year now, will be starting at a fortune fifty company when I graduate and got through the first part of an interview with Google before I withdrew my application (timing wasn't right). So it's definitely possible. Here are my tips:

* Know ahead of time that you are going to have go the extra mile to distinguish yourself and **make up for any gaps in education**. This means constant learning outside of class. What I did was set aside my Saturday and Sunday (most the time) for personal stuff. Socializing, video games, whatever. On the weekdays, it's all business. And not half assed. Literally always doing something related to your field. This might be difficult for some, but it worked well for me. Form these habits early and stick to them.
* **Extracurricular stuff**. The advantage of a small school is there's less competition for extracurricular things like undergrad research and school organizations. Get into a chair position of the local chapter of a nationally known society if available.
* **Programming contests and hackathons** as much as possible. Great times to network, learn and they can be pretty fun. If you place well in a known one (doesn't have to be first) it can put you on the map. This is how Google ended up finding me.
* **Network**. I know, its overhyped. But it is for a reason. Go to meet ups in your area and school events. Meet people. Go to career fairs just to shake hands and see what people are looking for. Doors will open.
* Try to secure an **internship** (or many). For obvious reasons, but also because the more companies you see before you graduate, the better idea you have of what you personally want.
* The last point is more philosophical and subjective. But **don't sweat it** - you very well might not land a huge salary, dream job straight out of school. That's true no matter where you graduate, but especially small schools. First, be accepting of that. It's okay. You will still make good money and learn a ton. You are still young, both in age and career. You have plenty of time to grow into your desired position. And who knows? You might end up not even liking it. Keeping that perspective will be good. I definitely got wrapped up in the sauce personally, and didn't heed this last point. It led to a lot of jealousy, and at times depression when I heard of people around me or from other schools landing huge jobs. It's a toxic mindset if you let it overcome you.

This ended up being way longer that I intended. Hope someone finds it useful. "

* Availability of english IT jobs (willingness and desire to learn new languages but initially will need an english job)
* Good public transport (no driver's license nor wish to get one)
* Reasonable living costs (although i'm a bit frugal i'm very afraid of living paycheck to paycheck)

Some obstacles: 

* I've been out of the job market for two years now because of mental health issues and because i was focusing on finishing my degree which was on hold for some time. 
* I'm not nor ever will be a ""rock star"" programmer, I'll always be average at most. I'm not very confident in my skills (impostor syndrome maybe? haha) so i worry about being able to find a job. I only worked for a single company where i started as an intern and later was hired full-time.
* I've suffered from depression my whole life and i need therapy from time to time. Therefore a place with accessible mental health treatment would be preferred.
* I've never lived abroad for more than a month nor alone for that matter and i'm sure this will make things even harder for me in the beginning.

So which cities/countries do you suggest me? Is such a move feasible for 2019? If not, what should i start doing now to make it a possibility?

CS), Stanford (MS CS), and Industry",JDN3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/855r1s/advice_needed_choosing_between_berkeley_meng_cs/,"I received my BS CS from a lower-tier UC in 2016 with a high GPA and undergrad research experience, and I've been working as a Software Engineer since graduation in the valley at an enterprise company (not the new valley Google/Facebook type but more traditional). I like my work and the pay is good, but I've wanted to branch out into new topics and I thought that grad school might be a good opportunity to switch areas.

I recently found out I was accepted into the Berkeley M.Eng. CS Data Science and Systems concentration and Stanford MS CS programs. I'm currently leaning towards Stanford, but Berkeley or staying in industry are still in the mix.

Right after applying I received a large stock refresh that will vest over the next four years (roughly worth $400k after recent stock rise), and base of ~$115k + ~20% annual bonus. I'm really happy with my current compensation, especially given my experience level, so my motivation for going back to school is more to learn new things, find work I'm really interested in, and potential for future career growth with a masters degree and prestigious school on my resume. The only thing making me consider staying in industry is the FOMO around the stock, but I think I probably would have been looking at other companies if I hadn't gotten into grad school anyways, so I think I wouldn't have stayed around for the full four years regardless (I've been contacted by Google and Facebook, but for areas related to my current job, not for the areas I would be interested in).

Now getting to the Berkeley vs. Stanford arguments. From reading online it seems that both of these programs aren't considered to be the most competitive to get into, the Berkeley program having ~12% acceptance rate and the Stanford program ~18-20%, and that the Berkeley MS CS (~4% acceptance rate) is much more competitive, rigorous and research focused. I'm more industry oriented and not super interested in deep research, so the Berkeley MS CS didn't particularly interest me.

The main factors driving me towards Stanford are the location, length of program (2 years vs Berkeley's 1 year M.Eng.) with Summer internship opportunity, and yes, the name. From the cost side I'm hoping to TA to offset some of the tuition, and it seems that if you take 10 units per quarter or under there's a reduced tuition (not sure what the normal unit load is though).

The pros of the Berkeley program are mostly related to the costs (I received a grant for 1/3 tuition which would make it ~$35k for the year vs Stanfords ~$35k/55k per year) and the ability to get back into industry faster. I'm not sure I would get as much out of the program, as the capstone projects I looked over didn't particularly interest me, and only having two semesters of courses versus 5-6 quarters of courses makes a big difference.

I feel between the two programs Stanford is the better fit for me, but I'm curious as to whether going back to get my Masters will be worth it in the end from a financial perspective (rough opportunity cost + tuition calculation yields ~$300k(if I TA)-$410k cost for Stanford and ~$300k cost for Berkeley). I graduated with my BS a couple years early, so even with the industry experience I would be starting the grad program at the same age of most people going directly from undergrad, so I still (hopefully) have many years ahead of me in the industry, and I think in the long term it would pay off, but it's daunting right now seeing the large immediate costs.

I'm curious what other peoples thoughts are on these programs, especially in relation to industry. Any advice, anecdotes, or insights you can give would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Restructured a sentence.

EDIT: I decided on Stanford. No real reasons beyond what was already stated above."

I was somewhat upset yesterday after being rejected from UCLA and waitlisted from UC San Diego, but I quickly got over it when I realized that I have been fortunate enough to get into both UW and UC Davis, which are both great schools.

I just think for myself it was healthy to realize to be grateful that I have these options available to me when others with higher stats might not even have a place to go to yet, due to the admissions being so fucked this year.

3 LOR; one 10/10 (guess) and one 8/10 (guess), one more that I got for UC Berkeley (also submitted to 4 more Jan 1st schools) from my employer that's probably a 9-10/10

I am an ug student with no programming experience other than cs courses up to data structures and algorithms. To my surprise, I got a remote Full stack internship at a startup planned for the summer that is just founded by a person in asia looking to establish a location in the bay area. The person is finalizing a mentor for me and a few other interns to mentor us remotely through video conferences. 

The reason I am skeptical is why she would pick an inexperienced person like me. She says she wants passionate and driven people to work in her team, but wouldn't you want people more experienced if you're going to start building your startup from the ground up? 

I am happy that I got the position, but I am not sure how much I am going to be able to learn much remotely and if I should keep searching for other options until the summer but I am likely not given that I have no experience whatsoever. Is this a stable option for the summer? Is this a good opportunity or not going to look that impressive on my resume? Thanks! "

Looking to apply to High-Frequency Trading (HFT) companies and more selective companies like top unicorns (Dropbox, Snapchat, Quora), prop trading firms (Jane Street), and hedge funds (Two Sigma) for possibly Algorithmic Trading and SWE roles next year as a New Grad. How competitive is my resume?

I was lucky enough to land a Big 4 internship this upcoming summer, but I was getting &lt;10% responses back this year. Not sure if recruiters will notice, but half of my work experience and awards is stuff in high school. I know for regular SWE companies you don't have to put your GPA, but I'm not sure if you have to put it on for the more selective companies that I'm applying to or if they care about GPA. I have a pretty shit GPA ~3.3, and it might go down after this semester.

I'm not sure if being a Software Engineer is right for me. (As you can see from my resume, I don't have any prior internship experience) So I'm also trying to look into the finance (specifically algo trading) field as I have always like mathematics and computer science.

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.


**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target school, join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

My question is: what is the best way to fully learn these algos? So far I've been using my whiteboard to attempt to fully write out the algos in java without looking at the actual code provided to us. I'm having some difficulty remembering them and implementing even the easy ones correctly. Nevermind trying to remember merge sort and quicksort.  My reason for asking is two part. Firstly I'm taking data structures and algorithms over the summer (as a 14 week course) and want a good leg up and secondly I really want to try to get an internship possibly for the fall or next summer at the latest. I know community college students don't typically get internships but I'm actually transferring to university for the fall 2018 semester. Any and all input is greatly appreciated."

Company A: Big, well known company in salt lake city. Working on integration communication platform (emails, video calls, etc). Doesn't sound too interesting to me. But it's in a city and there will be around 30 tech interns at the location. There seems to be more opportunities for me here in the long run, in addition to going hiking etc outside of work. 

Company B: Not as big or well known, but will be working on their well known platform doing more interesting work. It's in Wilmington, where there doesn't seem like is much to do at all. There are only 5 interns and I will not be working on the same team as any of them.

I've coded as a hobby for a while and I'd like to work as a software developer.

I have a minor in computer science, so it will take me one extra year at my school to get an accredited degree in computer science. My problem with this plan is that I have zero work experience in this field, so getting a job straight out of Uni might be a nightmare, especially getting a good/wellpaying job.

Alternatively, I can take my second degree at a much more prestigious school that I was accepted to. The program is 5 years and involves up to 2 years of co-op placement. Upon graduating, I would have lots of work experience and I would be coming out of a great school instead of a mediocre school. Unfortunately, this puts me back 3 years to get into full time employment.   

What do you recommend?

But my situation is a little different:

- Currently in my 4th semester at a small no-name school
- Internship with a large, non-tech company with a household name last summer
- Manager was extremely impressed, especially since I was a freshman; they wanted me back this summer
- Internship with another large, non-tech company with a household name for this summer
- A plethora of very interesting side projects
- Pretty good at behavioral questions
- Not much experience with Leetcode-style questions (wasn't asked any for either internship)

As for school, I came in with a lot of credits, so I have been taking minimum (12) credit hour semesters since my 3rd semester. If I continue to do so, I will graduate after my 6th semester, Spring 2019. So if I wanted to go for the full 4 years, I would have to take more CS classes or pick up another major/minor, both of which I have no interest in doing. I don't hate college, but I would much rather be working.

Although I am interested in gaining some experience at a big 4, my main goal is to eventually live in NYC and not be in poverty. At this point, I do not believe I am prepared for a rigorous technical interview, but I am ramping up my studies starting this week and will hopefully be prepared by August/September when it is time to apply. Even then, I'm not sure I would be prepared for full time interviews, or that I would get them at all since I only went to school for 3 years.

So, here's my current, work-in-progress plan:

- I will apply for big-4 internships the beginning of my 5th semester/Fall 2018
- If I do get one, I will try and get another in Fall 2019 and/or Spring 2020.
- If I don't, I will apply for full-time positions in NYC.

My plan kind of breaks down after that. It would be amazing to do three big-4 internships in a row (Summer 2019, Fall 2019, Spring 2020, then graduate/go full-time) and not have to go back to school at all, but I'm not sure if that is a thing that universities allow. I could possibly go back to school Spring 2020 and take like one credit hour, but by that point I feel like I would probably already have a full-time offer and it would be a massive waste of my time and money.

Is this a crazy plan? I can't find any other post with someone in a similar situation, so I'd love to hear any thoughts. Thanks!"

However, I also feel confused as to how to go about that in a way. Background is that I went to art school, which I loved and feels like home to me a lot.

Part of me wants to try to become a known artist, but I am also really really afraid of doing that because it's unstable and the art community is extremely judgmental and insular, and I'm definitely an introvert who lacks charisma. I've never been popular in my life or drawn intrigue to my work.

So because of this, I just feel I resort to things like coding which I would 100% be good at, but are more low key, which I think after a while I will want to really ""prove myself"". Doing a coding bootcamp and an internship maybe. My problem with that is that I don't know how to incorporate coding into a creative endeavor, and part of me will feel like I could have maybe done ""more"" with my life.

I also was considering doing some kind of finance degree involving art (like CFO of a commercial art thingy idk), because I actually have always loved math and starting my own businesses (which always fail lol). But I wonder if it's actually just easier to do coding as I don't have to take the GMAT, apply to b-school, etc., and can just get straight into it. However I love math and numbers, and feel like it would make sense because as a kid I loved to start businesses. 



I honestly feel like both are viable but can't do everything. Does anyone know what I should do, and/or have program, career title suggestions?

Can I have just have 2 - 3 decent side projects? Also how important is it to be diverse for internships?

As a senior majoring in Information Technology and Informatics, I do not know what to expect in the next phase of my life. I am scared. It has gotten to the point where I started to cry every night during spring break knowing it is going to be my last college vacation. 

As of now, my grades are pretty strong. I was able to make Dean's List the past four semesters. The school aspect is easy for me, it's more of the work and social life I am afraid of. 

I was not able to land an internship last summer as a Web Developer. Instead I was doing freelance work for people on CraigsList and Reddit. I got paid a decent amount, but no where near a full-time salary.

I have been applying to almost one hundred companies and I have not gotten past the stage where I interview with a hiring manager. A lot of my friends have a job ready for them when they graduate, but I don't. I am struggling with confidence and always let emotion get in the way.

I am frightened about not having a place to live in as my parents told me I only have six months to find a job until they kick me out of the house. Even still, the salary expectations of a web developer is quite low. This stresses me out even more. I am not the most social person and I really do not like living with other people, as I like to get a lot of sleep and keep the place quiet. 

I hope all my fears do not become realities. If so, I am not sure how I am going to handle it."

I've been an Information Technology major at the University of Central Florida and I'm in my senior year. Most of my classes have either centered around, or used programming. This was great for me, because I found that I really enjoyed programming, and I quickly became good (for a student) in C and Java. After that I quickly picked up PHP, Javascript and several other languages that I love. Even when I'm not doing it for school it's something I enjoy so much I do it as a hobby as well. I started a server out of my apartment and made a website with a portfolio you can see [here](https://markspot.us).

Last month that got me an internship at a software company called ServiceNow. The role centers around working with clients and troubleshooting implementation problems with the platform. Code is involved, but it's not the center of the role. Since I've started working there I've been feeling very strongly that I want to go into software engineering. I saw an internal job application for Software Engineer and I felt like I fit the bill perfectly.

But lately I've talked to people and seen videos on YouTube like [this](https://youtu.be/DEdSx4jCIbA?t=5m39s) who/that have said I should not get an IT degree for this type of work. People say I should have gone for a Computer Science degree if this is what I wanted to do.

The main thing my degree lacks in comparison to Computer Science is higher level math. The highest math we do is Trigonometry and Discrete. We do a ton of programming, it's more than half of the degree, but I don't know if anyone else knows that outside of school.

I'm doing a programming class right now called Enterprise Computing which is an entirely programming based class that focuses on the exact kind of technology that we use at work. That makes me feel like I'm not in the wrong place.

Can I go into Software Engineering from where I am? Should I settle for an adjacent field?


Thanks,



Mark

“Problem” is I only know Python and c++ and I'm not really hoping to become an app Dev in the future.

To land an internship next summer, what do you guys think would be better?
Should I pick up Java and end up learning 3 languages as a college freshmen and show on my resume a “semi-popular” app or build a website in Flask and get better at Python.

So I was thinking I was doing ok since I was one of the 8 picked. I had decent clubs, recs, and grades. I thought I was set until I realized I was so far back even running for miles would do nothing. I only found out what common app, coalition, and apply Texas were my junior year because no school in Louisiana uses it except a few hard to get into places. I had no idea how much of a staple it was. 

I had the basic college prep courses but no AP/IB/whatever credits. My school doesn't offer anything special except some honors courses but they are not different curriculum/workload wise from regular classes. Our two AP classes are APUSH and AP Human Geography but we do take the AP test. We have DE for US history but it is not on a college campus or taught by a college professor (in LA a masters level teacher can do this)

I have decent grades, a steady weighted 3.9-4.4 GPA. I had a meh ACT score (22) so I applied test optional where I could. Our state average is 20 and most of my classmates take Work Keys instead of the ACT because it's easier + still gives you in state aid as they on average got 15-18 with 21/22 being outliers. 

My school doesn't offer theater/drama/dance but we have robotics and EAST. Our EAST is crap compared to others at EAST Con. Robotics does ok for our region. We do not have many clubs but we have NHS, Beta, Mu Alpha Theta, and a few others but nothing impressive. Leadership roles are a popularity contest. Our service clubs are not particularly outstanding.

My school only has Pre-calc as the highest math, with physics (our teacher graduated college last spring and is in his early 20s, this is his 1st year and it is bad) chem 1/2, clinical lab, bio 1/2, and environmental science. We just have Art 1/2 and you can take Fine Arts online (e2020). We are only able to take Spanish 1+2, and it is also online if you are in honors courses. We have a 60% turnover for teachers and I can count about 10 teachers I have had who left for better work. 

Behavior wise if you are in Biotech you will have minimal issues but not as bad as general. We aren't as bad as some schools but I guess we are average as far as discipline. 

Seeing what you guys have as far as available classes, clubs, leadership roles, and everything really is pretty lame. It makes me feel like when I do go to college (out of state to Ohio) that I will be far behind and will likely struggle. I know that a positive attitude can make or break you but ugh. It is getting hard watching people be upset when they actually have at least a strong foundation.

I am glad other people have good opportunities, and yeah our school has this internship thing but that's a drop in the bucket for what I've been seeing other students have. 

This is getting a bit long, but does anyone else feel like this?"
85ceye,49,2018-03-18,Considering a job offer from Oracle - Associate Solutions Engineer,96UEMCD,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85ceye/considering_a_job_offer_from_oracle_associate/,"I gotta lay out some facts and context before I ask my questions:

1) I am graduating school in May with a Computer Science degree

2) My work experience ranges from engineering projects, a product manager internship to a part-time sales job selling technology.

3) Job description says that it will be 70% coding and 30% sales. You are part of a team that is all about landing customers for Oracle. If they need demos or custom implementations to use Oracle's products, that's your job. You work with an insane amount of different technologies, languages and frameworks because every client is uniquely different.

4) Oracle ""prefers"" a 3.2 GPA for this job. I have a 2.9 (they know about it and have my transcript, I got that bad GPA for a plethora of reasons I won't bother to list) and still made it through the process and got an offer.

5) The offer is 60k base pay with a 2k signing bonus, 5k bonuses in first year only and 15k performance bonuses every single year.


Ok that was the context. Now onto my question. I feel like I am being low-balled like no other with this offer. Before my final interview I researched pay on glassdoor and stuff and found an 80k - 85k pay for that same role near my area. A theory I have is that they do want me but they are giving me this terrible offer because my GPA is not what they prefer. In the other hand the job lines up for people with sales expertise and that is just not something that can easily be found among CS people. 

What should I do? I have just 2 weeks to consider this and I really want this job but the pay is very, very low for what I was expecting. For one of the world leaders in the software industry, with a role that requires software development this offer is disappointing. I have interviews with other places still, just an fyi. My plan was to take the leap of faith and email the recruiter tomorrow to complain about pay, if then she asked how much I was looking for say 85k/year. What do you think?"
85cs2x,4,2018-03-18,Anger,unhappypatient,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/85cs2x/anger/,"I have wept bitterly thinking of the notes I would write my siblings and a very dear friend in a similar position - how sorry I am, that I will always love them, that I want them to go forward and be happy. 

But in the last year, what I've thought of more is just letting a decades or two worth of anger out too. 



I think of letting lose on the cosmetic surgeon who left me with a butchered, dysfunctional nose that has negatively affected my whole life, my stamina, daily migraines, my ability to endure an eight hour day or reading or anything that requires being awake and cognitive attention. (That one I feel less bad about.) 



For my shitsack high school administrators, who never connected a college education to working life - so I chose a useless, stupid degree without knowing what to do with it (not that it hindered so many people I know who were given unbelievable jobs - publishing jobs, marketing jobs, executive assistant jobs)  or that if I wouldn't intern, I would never enter the workforce (as has been born out). 

My father spent 2 years looking for a job for my younger brother after he graduated; he told me I was a fucking idiot for choosing sociology and didn't ask or inquire if he could help me for a month, nor did he ask me what I wanted to do. No adult guidance.

I needed it. I was so crazy and sick after graduating, it didn't even occur to me who to ask for help. 

For friends that judged me and tell me I'm a piece of shit - because they got marketing jobs with art history and English degrees and were literally handed them by mother's boyfriends, friends, the same temp agencies that send me to minimum wage filing clerk jobs (or did) that last three days, and end without warning or explanation. 


And most of all, for my mother, who destroyed me, who told me I was a piece of shit and bad from the time I was 8, who did when I applied to every job, who screamed at me about how stupid I was, that I was a consummate piece of shit who "" HATED EVERYTHING!!!!"" all work! All fields! A PIECE OF SHIT, REFUSING ALL WORK, LAZY, STUPID, DESERVING OF MISFORTUNE - because I balked at turning around and going back to school for early childhood education - ""glorified babysitting"", as one state Congressman referred to it - the least transferable thing requiring an MS that might exist, short of physical therapy.  Their cowering, stupid, ugly, co-dependent daughter, who has literally never been able to get a job or been trained in a skill). Who shrieks and babbles like someone is torturing her if she is around her family, the way a baby does, incessant - through college finals and job applications and essays and phone interviews that weren't even followed up with rejection letters and horrible, horrible continuing ed courses completely disconnected to employment. My mother has forced me into so much bullshit based on a crazy old woman's mixture of streams and contempt- I've spent more of my life in dump campuses or wiping asses and noses (as a volunteer - still no job leads!) than working in an office. 

I know how cruel it'd be. 

I have no proof to the contrary of what she said, despite trying desperately, from my shit-eating grin in interviews  to the 12/hour jobs I accepted to horrible sweaty brand-ambassador jobs (standing on the street with a fucking flag attached to me like a harness) just to get something, courtesy of temping agencies that fed my friends to reception jobs, admin jobs - permanent jobs. I don't know what makes me different. And thus a prophecy was fulfilled and made flesh.

If there is literally *any other job candidate* applying for an entry level job alongside me - I am passed over, because in 10 years, I have acquired 18 months of work experience. 11 months were unpaid, for a not for profit that made very clear I would never, ever be an actual employee, and they trained me to do dickshit. 

Temp agencies will not place me anymore.


Since I suspect someone will tells me I made my own bed due to my anger - it wasn't anger.

Being dumb as a box of rocks, scatterbrained, easily overwhelmed, social anxiety, and cowardice - particularly thanks to cystic acne - maybe. But not angry.

Do any of you coming here, probably having spent years dreaming of just ending it to make the impotence of trying and failing and slowly becoming less over a person each year you're alive, watching the world pass you by, relate? 

I'm already dead on the inside; I have been for a long, long time. 

I'm only here because I think if I killed myself I'd destroy my family, but the level of hatred I have for myself and my mother almost undoes that. I'm so tired. Every attempt I've made towards even a shitty but vaguely normal life with a shitty job blows  up in my face. It's more than humiliating - every time I send my pathetic resume around, I might as well be sending their hiring managers my contact information with a stamped form indicating I'm a stupid basket case who may or may not have a criminal record. Instead I know I go straight into the trash.

I don't even really want to work. Work sucks if you're pretty, smart, and feel valued by society - I have never been any of these things and feel like I missed the 21st century. I want to be dead. All of this, all this horseshit - it's a pretense of life until my father dies so I can too.

I’m not happy with where I am or who I am right now, but I know that I can change it with hard work and gradual self-improvement.

I’m going to state the facts, both positive and negative.

Positive:

I’m still young. I’m only 21 and a junior in college. I’m committing to myself now, and I know that I can improve myself.

I made it out of a terrible family situation. Growing up I was abused by my father and my mother wasn’t in the best emotional state. I was homeless for a while, and now I go to a top 3 liberal arts college so I know that I have the drive and determination to rise above obstacles when I’m motivated.

I have good friends. I’ve lost a lot of them, but the ones who are still there are very good to me.

I’m studying abroad in a country I love. Life is good. I have good grades and a good GPA, even after a really bad episode of OCD symptoms.

Negative:

I have OCD, but I’m working on it. For about 9 months, starting from my sophomore spring and going until November I had a very bad flare up of symptoms that made me miss out on a lot. I couldn’t get a good internship last summer (I got one, but I didn’t like it), I self-isolated a lot, and I lived in constant fear of my own mind. I was convinced that these thoughts defined me, but I know they don’t.

I can’t find an internship, and the ones that I can find are after the deadline for school funding (which I need to be able to afford an unpaid internship). I’m thinking about just working at a summer camp and studying very hard for the September LSAT, which would be very productive but not ultimately what I had hoped for this summer. Growing up I was literally homeless, so I don’t have any real connections or model for what I can do after college which makes my situation difficult. I’m networking slowly, but I feel like I lost a few months when all I could focus on was checking symptoms of various diseases because of my OCD.

I’m overweight and am addicted to vaping (lol). I hurt my ankle very badly, and in the throes of my OCD episode I overate and didn’t exercise, so I gained a bit of weight. I’ve lost about 10 pounds recently, which is good, and I’m on my way back down.

My relationship with my family is profoundly unhealthy. I just got off the phone with my mom, which inevitably makes me very sad. We all came up in a very tough situation together and leaned on some pretty unhealthy coping strategies and dynamics. Whenever I talk to her I feel like her release valve/therapist, which is fine, but whenever I try to bring anything that’s not positive with her she’s dismissive and invalidating. I love her a lot and know that she’s struggling, but it doesn’t make it any easier. Whenever I get off the phone or talk with her, I feel profoundly lonely and isolated.

All in all, it’s been a tough year. I know that if I succeed it’s from what I do from here on out and a little luck. Does anyone have any advice on where to get started? If this is rock bottom, I think I'll be okay. I've been given a very good opportunity through my school, but I'm afraid of not making the most of it"
85ddbc,6,2018-03-18,About to graduate college and I'm afraid I'm going into the wrong career. What are career paths that might match my strengths?,Raingul,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/85ddbc/about_to_graduate_college_and_im_afraid_im_going/,"This April I'll be graduating with B.S.'s in Molecular Biology, Chemistry, and Applied Math. I've been gearing up to into genetics research this entire time, but I'm starting to feel like it might not be what I really want to do. I applied to Ph.D programs in Computational Biology but I didn't end up getting in, so I decided to get more experience in research. Managed to land an internship this summer back home, and then was planning on trying for NIH's postbac program since my current PI has connections there. 


However, when I started looking into research more, I found that it doesn't pay nearly as well as I was hoping. Just looking at NIH's stipend, I'd have to live quite frugally and pretty much half to nearly two-thirds of my income would go to rent with how expensive the area is. Furthermore, I looked up other people's experience after they got their Ph.Ds, and it doesn't seem to get much brighter. Plus a lot of my friends are going to be making way more than me right off the bat. 


I do enjoy working in research, but the more that I've thought about it, I think I just enjoy the type of problem solving and analytical thinking that research requires. Even now, I have very few qualms about what specific research I would want to do; I don't really care if I'm doing genetics research or pharmaceutical research. So long as I was doing ""research"" I thought I was content. 


I'm really just feeling lost, and I'm not sure what other career options I might have that would match my strengths. As of right now, I'm really considering getting a Masters in Computer Science or Software Engineering and moving more into data analytics, but it would be really beneficial to learn what other paths may be open to me. 

EDIT: I'm also looking into going more towards economics as well, but I don't know if that would be wise. "
85dquw,46,2018-03-18,Impostor Syndrome: A Case Study (Longish Post),sphotavada,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85dquw/impostor_syndrome_a_case_study_longish_post/,"I know this topic has been discussed to death in this subreddit, but I would still like to share a bit of my story for those who struggle with impostor syndrome, constantly doubting their career choice and finding themselves conflicted for (probably) irrational reasons.

Programming sparked my interest back in high school. I wanted to create something useful and own it. I also looked up to an incredibly intelligent friend of mine, who at the age of 17 knew the Darwin (macOS) kernel inside out, and was writing firmware for knock-off Chinese smartphones for a living. I wanted to have the same depth of knowledge as him, and was constructing superficial, naive goals—like becoming a “coding expert” in the future, whatever the hell that meant.

It’s not a good sign when your intellectual “strengths” on paper betray what you *think* you are passionate about. I never felt like I had a mathematical mind. I did ""OK"" in math and science, but not many standard deviations above the average student. I had no respect for math, and was shocked by the realization that computer science is actually just a subset of the very subject I was not super comfortable with (hint: try to avoid being this ignorant.) This was many years ago, and to this day I have not fully overcome my complications with math. Recently I made 3 miserable attempts to improve my GRE score, and scored 156 in the Quantitative section only on the *3rd attempt* (for perspective, engineers typically score above 165 out of 170). I'm also a terrible test-taker, which doesn't help.

Over the years I developed that *nagging suspicion* that I don't belong in my field (you know what I'm talking about): while I may end up becoming a relatively successful developer by grinding my way through college and pushing attempts at self-study, I will never become a ""true"" computer scientist; I will never be good enough to advance the field, invent new algorithms, conduct research, or even be admitted to graduate school (pfft, not with that GRE score.) Every step of the way I felt like I am biting off more than I can chew, simply because I did not enjoy/excel at math in school, and now I'm naively putting on the act of being an engineer/problem solver/scientist. I thought the research papers I wrote and published during my BSCS were too shallow and not technical enough. I worried that the jobs and internships I landed were out of pure luck. I saw my good grades in core CS classes as a function of my CS program being too easy. 

Impostor syndrome can almost be comparable to a mental disorder (I don't mean to belittle mental disorders.) Your irrational thinking beats you down and strangles you mentally before you can leap forward and take a risk that may reveal that, perhaps, you are *enough*. Not a prodigy, a *natural*, or a ""rock star"" (a meaningless term that can go to hell), but simply enough. Unfortunately, I don't have an optimal solution to dealing with impostor syndrome. I struggle with it every day. If you can't escape the feeling that you're faking it, then maybe your only option is to fake it 'till you make it, as the cliché goes. And that's fine. If you truly want to be the best at what you're doing, you do not deserve to be considered a fraud.

Right now it is Spring of 2018, 6 years after I decided that I wanted to be a programmer and 4 years into thinking that I'm a fraud and a failure. I am the founding engineer of a promising AI startup. Last week, I was admitted to the #1 graduate school in the US for applied mathematics. I'll be starting my Master's in CS this Fall. Of course, I may still fail. Graduate school may crush me. I may lose my momentum at work. I might hate being in school again, or miserably fail at it while trying to balance a full-time job and graduate coursework. I might despise all of computer science in 2 years. But the awareness that, for now, I'm moving forward is very motivating.

Whatever your situation, I hope that you may find the strength to overcome your irrational fear. I hope you are moving forward."

2) Start my own projects. I want to focus on Android/iOS development the most (hence the Java and Objective C), but also want to make an application using Python. 

3)**Apply to LaunchCode**. I recently saw a job posting from LaunchCode on Indeed while searching for other jobs. They're a company that supposedly connects people without tech backgrounds with software companies and the like if they have an interest (and skills) in technology. A bit more research showed that people have been successful in using them, but they had projects that demonstrated their ability and knowledge of code. 

4) Certificates? So far I've not seen any reliable responses that have indicated the usefulness of getting certifications. They seem to be on the whole useless. But does that ring true for someone like me who has no demonstrable background in tech?

5) Internships? Without going into too much detail my living expenses will be covered for some months. Not sure for how long. Could be a few months, could be a year. But this also makes it possible to consider internships if there are any. Though I don't know any internship programs that would accept someone without a tech background. 

Anyways, does this plan sound solid? Is there any way I might be able to improve it? Thanks in advance! "

I'm almost completely new to the world of IT. I am in a program that has a week per subject (901 and 902) and I feel a bit overwhelmed. I finished 901 last week and I'm starting 902 tomorrow and I feel like I'm only absorbing 20% of what is taught. The bright side is that my teacher said I'm on the right track based on the questions I'm asking and he is recommending me for a month long internship. When I took my practice exam, I only got a 56% (70 being required to pass)

How long should I study material? I've done my research and am starting professor Messer's videos and plan to buy the practice tests on Udemy as well as studying the course objectives from the compTIA site, but I'm trying to figure out if I'm on track. My current plan is to study near full time for the rest of March and most of April and take both exams at the end of April. Does this sound like a good plan or am I giving myself too much time? 

When I read the material or my teacher is explaining a subject I understand it, but bringing up the knowledge is difficult when I'm in an exam situation. It's just so much to take in that I think taking extra time to study would be beneficial. Also, am I slow or is this normal when it comes to being new at this? Thanks in advance "

I wasted my freshman year thinking I wanted to be a doctor, and now I’m a sophomore in my second semester of being a Software Engineer major. Went in with no programming experience and constantly feel confused, but somehow I am earning decent grades (3.5 cumulative, so far all As in CS courses). Math has always been my favorite and best subject, so maybe that has helped

I can not say confidently that I really want a career in CS, but I definetely think it’s cool and interesting (especially the money involved). I have this passion to create something that other people can enjoy, and this seems like a good career for me to achieve something like that. For this reason, I just applied to a bunch of internships via LinkedIn. Lately I’ve been having all these scary feelings about life and being successful or whatever, so I was wondering if you guys could help put my mind at ease. 

*Some questions:*

 Is it normal to find your classes boring/difficult/uninspiring? Do they get more interesting as you get better at it/learn different things? 

I have heard people say college is not really needed for a CS career. Is this true? If so, should  I stop wasting time and money and start teaching myself the things I want to learn? Or, is this a truly valuable experience? 

How hard is it to land a job that actually fits your passion within the field? Are some areas easier to find a job in?

Last, but definetely not least, does CS actually pay well? I’ve also heard its easy to be unemployed. What’s the truth ?!


Any words to help an anxious college student are much appreciated! Thanks :)

What should I prepare myself in in order to succeed in UMich's first year eng classes for comp eng?


Also, I was wondering how difficult it is to work throughout the school year in research. I am particularly interested in research in robotics and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Walter Lasecki seems to have conducted some research that I'm interested in, so I was wondering if I should contact him in order to establish interest in his work. Has anyone worked with him before?


I was also wondering what type of internships people are able to get after their first year at UMich. Do people manage to work for the big 4 or get to SV right after first year? How can I try to be one of the people who manage to make it there? Should I attempt to find an internship the summer before going to UMich and what should I try to do to make this happen?


What do people in computer engineering/computer science commonly double major or minor in? In university, I want software and hardware experience, but to specialize in software. Also, I want to learn about entrepreneurship, business, and perhaps product design in order to possibly create a start up later on. Why do people double major in industrial and operations engineering + other engineering majors?


Lastly, what would you recommend as ""must-do's"" in Ann Arbor or at UMich. How should I try and find my niche?


P.S. What schools would you guys have chosen over UMich for computer engineering/computer science if you had been accepted there?"

I’m a fresh grad with a degree in economics and finance. I’m from a target school with an average GPA because I was lazy and uninterested until the course became more maths-heavy by the end of the second year. 

It's been 2 months since graduation yet I am still struggling to find a job. To make things worse, the job descriptions of almost all the entry-level positions on LinkedIn make me feel under-qualified.

I’m interested in investment banking but I didn't have any internship experience nor connection. So that seems quite out of my reach at the moment. I have also applied to a few trading firms but failed to make it to the interview. Therefore, I’m rather demoralised and lost right now. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I believe that when we enter the workforce, it is how fast we learn that matters the most instead of what we have learnt. However, it is difficult to prove that one is a fast-learner. 

Also, as I have spent so much time on job application, I feel that I have neglected my self-development for too long. So in the meanwhile, I’m thinking of expanding my skillsets to make myself more employable. I’m currently taking an online course on financial valuation and I’m also hoping to learn a programming language. If I wish to work in the financial sector, should I pick up R, Python or VBA for data analysis?

Thanks for reading."

85j4od,0,2018-03-19,Seventeen,Boba_F37T,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/85j4od/seventeen/,"Edgar raised his head up from his chest; back pressed firmly into his favorite recliner, his entire body drenched in cold sweat. He stared into shadows at the edge of the living room, eyes welling with tears as he lifted the revolver slowly and deliberately to his temple. “Seventeen”, he whispered to the darkness.
The index finger of his right hand had already found its perch on the trigger during the weapon’s ascent, during which he had hesitated no more than a second, his only concern ensuring that the angle he chose would prove fatal. He clenched his left hand into a fist at his side, steeling his will. He inhaled sharply. And with further need of neither breath nor will, he clenched his right hand.
Darkness flashed brilliantly to light from the barrel of a .38 Special, as the gunshot’s dull thunder echoed around the room. The remains of Edgar Freeman slumped sideways in what had once been his favorite chair. The other man with him in that chamber smiled softly, the one in the shadows who had been briefly illuminated by the muzzle flare, that sallow man in the dark suit with the pale blue eyes. He smiled as everything turned gray.
Edgar flailed his way to a sitting position, ripping the covers off the bed as he always did when waking up from that goddamned nightmare. After the fourth night in a row with the same dream, he had taken to sleeping with his bedside lamp turned on. After the sixth night in a row, his frenzy upon waking had sent it crashing to the floor – bulb broken and shade cracked by the impact. Tonight had been the eighth night, and as he recited every vulgarity he could recall into the inky darkness of his bedroom, he swore that today he’d find the time to go purchase a box of light bulbs.
Involuntarily recalling the stranger in the dream’s inappropriately sweet smile, he reminded himself to ask the clerk for their highest wattage.
After a warm shower and a few minutes collecting his thoughts on the side of the bed, Edgar set about his day. Nearly-tasteless scrambled eggs and coffee which would have been merciful if it had been tasteless comprised his breakfast, and his thoughts turned to how absurdly better Haley’s morning meal would have been. Whatever other problems they had, Haley’s cooking had been beyond reproach. He would regularly wake to the mouthwatering aroma of a nutritious breakfast which she had prepared for him – usually egg whites on a wheat English muffin with a tall glass of orange juice – at least before the morning sickness had started and kept her occupied in her prayers to the porcelean goddess for her first waking hour of every day. All this, he reminded himself bitterly, was in the past now.

 
As the Vice-President of Marketing for the second largest athletic apparel company in the country (and, as he thought of himself, a reasonably attractive man) Edgar was more than used to the occasional flirting – both casual and aggressive – from young female interns and employees within his department. It came with the territory, and it was never anything he couldn’t brush off. Thoughts of either taking it further than flirtations or reporting it to Human Resources very rarely crossed his mind; the former on account of his pregnant wife, the latter on account of the ego boost it provided. One month ago, however, Edgar began an affair with a particularly buxom college intern named Samantha. Above and below the brassiere, she had been nothing special; just a warm body to quell the urges to which Haley had been unwilling or unable to tend after entering her third trimester. Even the sex was unremarkable.
Their first rendezvous took place in a motel a few blocks away from the office, the type of place with bay windows overlooking less than scenic freeway overpasses, and even the roaches use black lights before scurrying under the unmade bed. As a cursory nod to legitimacy, the establishment stopped short of offering rates on a per-hour basis – a fact known because Edgar had inquired upon checking in.
After that first encounter, the two grew bolder and less discerning in their indiscretions. Edgar’s office came next, and that time had been a little more satisfying – a combination of the danger and the skirt Samantha kept on at his request. But boldness turned quickly to carelessness, and Edgar was an apprentice of infidelity less than two weeks before Haley discovered his betrayal.
Whether it was a whiff of unfamiliar perfume or a phone call from one of Edgar’s jealous rejects who had spotted the two of them around the office, his adultery with Samantha was soon the topic to which Edgar returned home from work. The accusation was on her face the minute he walked through the door. He had come home late from a particularly wild romp with Samantha, and the words from Haley’s trembling lips quickly disclosed exactly how much she knew.
It would have been pointless to lie – she had too many details and he too little imagination – so Edgar confessed, and made a perfunctory effort to justify his behavior. She cursed him with a severity and intensity which Edgar had never seen from her before, and in her final words to him she made it clear that she was leaving, and that she would make sure he would never in his life have a role in raising their child. Despite his heartache at the prospect of losing Haley, Edgar had spent too long in a cutthroat business to take threats passively, even from his wife. He laughed bitterly, and reminded her of the quality of the lawyers within his means. When he was done, Edgar said with words he instantly regretted but found himself powerless to silence, she would be lucky to get weekends and a few holidays with the kid.

 
That was a lie and he knew it, but at the time his main objective was to get off the defensive and regain the upper hand in the fight – maybe even make Haley reconsider her choice to leave. He would happily cut some hefty checks to a marriage counselor if it saved him from the much larger ones in the form of alimony and child support. But something in the way Haley was smiling at him suggested that he had misunderstood her intentions. And as he realized far too late; if he had been more observant, he might have noticed an empty hook on their key caddy, and connected it to that sardonic grin she was wearing.
She hadn’t left right away, like he had expected. Isn’t that always the way it works in the movies and on television? The guy comes out of the bathroom or back from the bar a little while after the fight to find the gal’s suitcases dusted off and bulging with all the expensive clothes he bought her over the course of their relationship? Her haughty and defiant, him prostrate and pleading?
Edgar would have never played the latter role in his life, but he had fully expected the former from Haley. Instead, an hour after he walked away from their screaming match to take a much-needed shower, he stuck his head into the living room to find her sitting in his favorite chair (what a bitch) staring off into space and rubbing her (Goddamn is she ready to pop) pregnant stomach.
As far as Edgar was concerned, that was the end of the first of presumably many arguments on the subject. He ascended the stairs quietly, and slipped into bed. The day had been long enough, and she clearly wasn’t going anywhere or she would have left already. Haley never came to bed, but neither did he hear the front door slamming behind her before he drifted off – so it seemed she had decided to stay at least for the night. All will be well, Edgar told himself as sleep overtook him. But I doubt she’s going to fix my breakfast for a few days.
The noise which ripped him out of that deep slumber came just after five o’clock in the morning, according to his alarm clock. By the time consciousness took hold, the sound had died as quickly as it came. He stood reflexively, and scanned over the bed with eyes barely awake enough for even that simple task. Eventually determining Haley’s side to be empty, Edgar shuffled out the bedroom door and down the stairs to determine what caused the sudden clamor.

 
He didn’t need to reach the bottom of the staircase, or allow his eyes further time to adjust, to know that she had decided to leave him after all. One glance into the living room cleared up any doubt on that subject. There were no bulging suitcases, or haughty looks – just an unlocked and opened gun cabinet, a crimson splatter on the wall, and a steady trickle of the same beading down the side of his favorite chair and pooling on the hardwood floor beside it.
After a moment of shocked paralysis, Edgar lunged for the house phone in huge, desperate strides. The rapidity was not for the sake of Haley, through whose newly-ventilated skull he could clearly catch glimpses of the televised presidential debate at the far side of the room, but for her blameless passenger of seven and a half months. He gave all the pertinent information to the infuriatingly indifferent emergency control room operator, and waited in the hallway with the front door flung open wide.
The gunshot had drawn a crowd of early-waking neighbors to the driveway in front of the Freeman residence, a phenomenon bred not out of bravery in the face of danger but from the casual ignorance of danger reserved exclusively for neighborhoods peopled by the wealthy and sheltered. They eyed him accusingly, none with less than dawning suspicion in their gaze. Edgar raged at them for this; first with harsh thoughts, then with guttural growls and impotent flailing. They would collectively step backward when his fury and frustration flowed strongest, and advance again when the yelling waned in ferocity – a human tide of slack-jawed gawkers.
The spectacle was temporarily dissolved by the wailing siren and subsequent appearance of an Advanced Life Support ambulance, from which paramedics rapidly spawned just a few minutes after Edgar’s conversation with their dispatcher (another feature exclusive to the type of neighborhood in which Edgar and Haley Freeman resided). The crowd made way for the emergency vehicles, but soon found a new vantage point on Edgar’s lawn.
The paramedics discovered Edgar’s wife slumped over in his recliner, and strapped her lifeless form into a gurney. Once she was properly secured, they wheeled her rapidly out of the house and into the back of their ambulance. Edgar jumped in as well, and there was no time to either ask or answer any questions before the crew slammed the bay doors and sped off toward the county hospital.
Between checking vital signs and attempts to keep oxygen pumping into the corpse of his wife for the sake of her unborn child, Edgar noted the cautious glances being shot his way by the Paramedics – as well as the blue flashes from multiple police vehicles following close behind the ambulance. I didn’t have anything to do with it, he wanted to say – to scream – but in the back of his mind he knew that was just a degree or two away from being precisely the truth, and so he remained silent.
He had thought they would throw the handcuffs on him as soon as they arrived at the hospital, but instead the throng of police officers just explained they would wait with Edgar while the doctors did what they could for the baby – and maybe get some information from him if he felt up to talking. Edgar nodded assent, largely because the officers bore all the mannerisms of men who intended to get some information from him whether or not he felt up to talking.
They stood outside the operating room, lined up in the viewing area. The officers gave Edgar his space; his face mere inches from the glass, taking occasional breaks to wipe the window off with his sleeve after frantic breaths had fogged it to the point of opacity. They questioned him hesitantly; he answered them hastily and with little regard for the words he used. His concerns were elsewhere, and he knew there was nothing he could unintentionally blurt out to incriminate himself. He watched as the surgeon made a large incision into Haley’s lower abdomen (at least she’s sedated for this, Edgar thought insanely) and set about removing the baby from her womb.
Within a few minutes, everyone in the viewing area knew everything they needed to know. The officers knew that Haley had apparently died at her own hand (the autopsy would either confirm or deny that), that she had likely done it as a result of her husband’s infidelity, and that Edgar had seen little or no warning signs leading up to the suicide. Edgar, meanwhile, knew that the baby was alive but fading fast, that the baby was a boy (they wanted the gender to be a surprise, one of the few things on which he and Haley never disagreed), and that the baby was being placed in an incubator as a last-ditch effort to save its life.
Edgar stood outside the room, the police now keeping an even more respectful distance as he watched his infant son die. There was little commotion about it, and little the doctors could do to prevent it. The child’s eyes opened once the entire time, and the next thing Edgar knew they were pronouncing the time of death as 5:46 AM. They just cut him out of Haley at 5:29, Edgar thought frantically. My kid – my son – was alive less than half an hour. I didn’t even have time to name him. A girl and Haley names him, a boy and I name him; that was the promise we made since we couldn’t even fucking agree on names. Edgar slammed his fist against the wall, and distantly felt his knuckles grinding. As he fell to his knees, his hand hurt far less than the scalding hot tears welling behind his eyes.
That was two weeks ago. Today, Edgar ate nearly-tasteless scrambled eggs, and drank coffee that would have been merciful if it were tasteless. Eight nights now he lived with the nightmare of killing himself destroying any semblance of sleep. Eight nights now he lived with the man in the shadows of that nightmare smiling at his decision to do so. Light bulbs, a huge box of them, highest wattage the hardware store sells, today after work. Edgar again reminded himself of the errand as he threw on his jacket and walked out the door.
Work went much the same as always, only with the added distraction and morbid water-cooler fodder provided by his wife’s suicide. It was annoying, more than anything.
Edgar first became consciously aware of a man’s form standing just outside the threshold of his office’s open doorway when he glanced at the clock to determine exactly how far into the night he had been lost in paperwork. He came to work at dawn and knew it was now certainly dusk, at a minimum. The day had been typical office fare for the return of a bereaved coworker – mindless platitudes and weightless sympathy, empty words from the empty hearts of people paid just enough to pretend to care but not enough to do so convincingly. There was no telling exactly how long the man had been silently standing in the darkness of the hallway, but Edgar recollected the first vague feeling of being watched a few minutes prior. Everyone but the night shift security guard had left hours ago, giving him a welcome respite in which to concentrate and catch up on missed work. Or so he had thought, until this new interruption.
“Hello?” Edgar hesitantly greeted the interloper, fearing the inevitable next in a long line of ham-handed jabs at emotional consolation.
“Evening, sir.” the reply came, grating and phlegmy. His eyes still attempting to adjust to the drastic change from the brightness of his office to the hallway illuminated only by the ambient moonlight leaking in from sporadically-placed windows, Edgar judged by the unfamiliar voice that this was either a stranger – a vendor, perhaps – or a colleague with a particularly nasty cold that he’d better not be spreading around.
“Step inside, I’ve been burning holes in my retinas under this lamp for the past two hours, I can’t see a damned thing out there.”
“Really can’t stay,” the man intoned, practically gargling, “just passing through”.
“Yeah, I know what you mean; it’s been quitting time for hou… have we met?” Edgar’s eyes had begun to adjust, and he grew uneasy. The stranger was still dim and blurry, but clearly wearing a dark suit of indeterminable quality. Another minute and it would be clear if this was some sort of tight-assed internal auditor from the 14th floor, or another detective sniffing around after Haley’s death. Whoever it was, the suit betrayed him for a stranger. Fridays around the office were always Casual Day, when even the senior executives wore polos and khakis. The man was showing no signs of leaving, so Edgar made his eyes’ next mission determining whether or not he had one of those idiotic access badge lanyards they all had to wear around the building.
“I’m new. I’m a messenger. I’m here to deliver a package.”

 
Edgar cocked his head, dubious. A courier in a three-piece suit? Pull the other one. No badge, either. Edgar did not reply, hoping the (Process Server? Jehovah’s Witness?) stranger would state their business and move along.
“You work such long hours. Don’t you miss your family, sir?”
A knot materialized in Edgar’s throat, and he sat bolt upright in his chair. After the initial shock wore off, Edgar softened his posture, quickly convincing himself of the question’s innocuous nature. A labor union representative – of course. He slipped in here to try and play on some suit’s delicate sensibilities, blather about unpaid overtime and kids tucking themselves into bed. Just trying to get us to abolish our non-unionizing clause with factory workers. “I receive fair compensation for the work that I do, as does everyone in our employ. So no, I’m fine, really. Thanks.” That should get the point across, he thought with a certain grim satisfaction.
“Oh. I’m sorry to hear that. Well…” The stranger turned slightly as if to leave, paused, and leaned his head inside the office for the first time.
“They certainly miss you.”
The words scraped like icicles up the length of Edgar’s spine, gripping his skull with tendrils as cold as the grave. The face was gone from view as quickly as it came – the form of the man as well – but the hideous visage remained burned into Edgar’s brain, and in the recesses of his mind he was acutely aware that it would be etched there until his dying breath. The eyes were of a milky blue so pale and distant they suggested blindness, but met Edgar’s with an unerring gaze that insisted they saw him very well indeed. The rest of the face was unburdened with such signs of vitality. His skin was sallow and sickly, and even at a distance it appeared to be the texture of well-worn leather. The man’s cheeks and eye sockets were sunken, the flesh drooping loose in these places, yet drawn tight against the skull around his forehead and mouth. Gaunt and cadaverous, every feature from the greasy, matted hair, to the quivering wattle of flesh when he spoke was identical to that of the dark stranger in Edgar’s recently acquired nightmares. But everything else was peripheral to the all-encompassing terror which he felt at seeing those damned eyes. There was something unpleasantly familiar in them, something horrible which he found himself powerless to name or explain.
Once he regained control of his frozen limbs, Edgar lunged toward the doorway where the man had stood moments prior. The elevator hadn’t dinged its arrival, and the stubborn latch on the stairwell door hadn’t let out the audible clack customary to every opening and closing. ‘He’s still somewhere on this floor’, Edgar thought frantically. The idea gave him strength, but no real clarity of purpose. He knew only that he needed to confirm that the stranger’s presence here was more than merely a result of his overtaxed mind and guilty conscience. There were no desks, no bathroom stalls, no supply closets left unsearched by the time Edgar’s frenzied investigation reached its fever pitch. Motivational posters tacked to the walls of overbearingly congenial and downright suspiciously diverse businesspeople smiling and clasping hands warmly seemed to be mocking him, silent conspirators against Edgar in his quest. “Sure we know who he is and where he went,” Edgar could imagine them saying, “but we’re too busy leveraging our synergy and engaging in value-added interfacing to dialogue on your initiative.” He dragged both hands through his hair, gripping thick handfuls of it and tugging slightly. His visitor, if something more than a delusion, had departed unseen and unheard. Edgar could feel his heart pounding wildly, seemingly slamming against the back of his ribcage. He stopped only to grab his briefcase before sprinting down the stairs to escape the increasingly oppressive emptiness of the office.
The executive parking deck was windowless, and thus even darker than the building from which he had just departed. It was barren except for him and his Lexus, and likely had been since the security guard made their most recent tour through it hours ago – the guard having shut off all but the emergency lights on the way out. Despite that small assurance, Edgar found himself casting furtive glances over both shoulders, and quickening his pace each time they revealed a total lack of reason to do so. He had never been a superstitious man, any fear of monsters had been laid to rest long ago by the waking horrors which walk amongst men brazenly in the daylight. Student loan debt, insurance premiums, layoffs, mortgage payments – life, Edgar had learned decades ago, sports fangs and claws that make laughingstocks of those belonging to the vampires and werewolves man invented to cope with it. And yet, he scolded himself while fumbling nervously for his keys, all it takes is a little nudge from the imagination to awaken that primordial terror – to populate the uninhabited darkness with things which have no right to exist.
He was five feet from his car and had just unlocked it with the electronic remote attached to his keys when he heard the scream. It was high-pitched, womanly, terrified, and resonated from the office area directly behind him. ‘Did Haley scream that way right before she pulled the trigger?’ Edgar thought wildly. He stopped in his tracks, turned sharply, and saw nothing. Then, as if in response to his silent inquiry, the gunshot came. Edgar snatched the cell phone from his pocket, frantically calling 911 for the second time in as many weeks. He flipped the phone open to his ear, but the operator requesting the nature of his emergency sounded a thousand miles away. The clacking, dragging footsteps coming down the corridor from the sound of the shot and toward the executive parking garage, however, sounded very close indeed. Edgar dropped the phone and practically dove into his car. His foot was on the accellerator as quickly as he could throw the vehicle into gear.
The roads outside the office were illuminated solely by street lights and the occassional flash of a passing motorist’s headlights. The sun had vanished below the horizon hours ago – when people in khakis or sensible skirts departed on a fourteen hour break from pretending to care about each other’s children or gastrointestinal complications, and left Edgar alone with two weeks worth of backlogged paperwork. Stress, Edgar attempted to convince himself, can make you see things. Stress, he rationalized, can make you hear things. Emotional trauma. None of it took any pressure off of his mind or the gas pedal as he sped toward home.
Upon his frantic arrival, Edgar knew something was wrong before he ever burst through the front door. He hadn’t turned any lights off since the nightmares started, much less when he expected to be out past sunset, and yet he found himself fumbling around the darkness of his hallway for the lights. When his blind groping finally brushed across the light switch, there was very little surprise in finding the knob broken off – following the day’s events, it would have been a bigger surprise if the switch had been in working order. Instinct told him to turn and flee the house, but the flashing red number ‘one’ on his answering machine called with an even greater urgency.
Despite his hand’s anxious trembling, Edgar’s finger struck the Play button with unerring precision, a motion he had grown well-acquainted with over the past two weeks. People he hadn’t spoken to or thought about since practically before meeting Haley had seemingly not forgotten him, and had spent the interval between his wife’s death and now calling to offer their condolences. Their concern only served to compound his feelings of guilt with each message – what had he done to deserve such loyal friends? He fully anticipated another instance of the same consolation, when one of the last voices he would ever have expected emanated from the machine.

 
“Edgar?” the voice’s normally chipper lilt came, tinged with an unmistakable edge of caution. “It’s Samantha. I know I shouldn’t be calling you. I’m probably the last person in the world you want to hear from right now, and I can’t tell you how sorry I am for what happened.” There was a pause and what sounded like a sob. Edgar thought this was quite possibly the most real, orgasm-less emotion he had heard from Samantha since they first met. “Sorry for everything, really. I… we… we couldn’t have known how this would end. But I know I have no right to call. I’m just worried about you, is all. I laid out of work today because I heard you were coming back, and thought you didn’t deserve to have to bear seeing me on top of everything else… I could only imagine how hard it must be for you right now… and to tell the truth, I was scared to see you. Scared you might point at me every time someone asked, or something… I know, it’s stupid. And selfish. But I came by the office just now to pick up some work to take home with me, and I saw your car in the parking garage…”
Edgar eyed the time of the message on the answering machine. She had called sometime between the end of his frantic search of the office, and before he made it to his car. Which means that she was there right about the time that…
The voice on the machine had kept talking, and Edgar found himself now listening more intently than ever, his knuckles turning white from clenching the kitchen counter so tightly.
“…saw your office light was on, but you aren’t anywhere around. And man… this place looks like a tornado hit it. Someone really tore through here. I thought about you right away, so that’s why I’m calling. I don’t know if this is long overdue, or if I should have just done a quick fade and found another job and never called you again, or what… I mean, what’s the appropriate thing to do here? I can never make things right, but… I’m just so sorry, Edgar. Please call me back when you get this. I miss…”
‘Miss’ was the last word spoken by Samantha – unless one counts a bloodcurdling scream, following which came the sound that silenced whatever would have come next. The gunshot rang out like a thunderclap, and lost none of its horrible potency on the way through the phone lines to Edgar’s answering machine. The ensuing silence was deafening, and Edgar stood rigid in front of the machine, bent forward and staring at it intently – as if he expected it to begin displaying visual clues as to what had taken place. He got audio instead.
“Miss you, yes. You are very missed, indeed.” The male voice, undeniably the same as earlier that day, gargled as it chuckled into the receiver. The machine beeped, and a solid red zero informed him that he now has no unheard messages. But to Edgar the zero represented far more than that. It seemed almost an answer to not just how many messages he had, but to every question that mattered. What, why, who, how? What’s left, what matters, what will tomorrow bring? Nothing but zero, of course. Just a big blood-red negation.
Edgar released his death grip from the counter, and groped his way into the darkness of the living room. He passed another light switch on the way, noted with no real interest that the switch had been broken off of this one as well, then flopped down into his favorite recliner. “I have had”, Edgar whispered into the emptiness of the house that would never again be a home, “a very tough month.” The answer to his presumedly receipientless statement came in the form of a chuckle from a dark corner of the chamber. Edgar felt every muscle in his body go tense, and he lost all control of his bladder. He could not possibly have cared less about the latter, he merely stared into the darkness and waited for whatever must come next as the warmth spread across the front of his pants.
The man in the shadows stepped forward and Edgar winced away, sinking as deep into the plush chair as he could dig himself. The stranger, simply put, had gone from looking like his flesh was preparing to free itself from its Earthly prison – to actually having accomplished the task. Edgar was staring at the face and body of a man who had begun to lose some very respectable chunks of himself. Like butter melting in a warm room, some of it actually sloughed off as he made a methodical exit from the darkness.
“I know you’re wondering why I’m here, and why the past few weeks have seen your life seemingly spiral out of your control. At this point it comes down to fate. Fate is like playing tug-of-war with an adversary significantly stronger than you: There will always be times when you feel the rope inching your way, your heels dug in and your earnest exertions yielding the result you’ve worked so hard for, the victory you know you deserve. But even the times in which you feel the most control, the firmest ground, those are merely your opponent adjusting its grip. But this doesn’t preclude what you might call free will; the choices people make are what set fate in motion, and those are the pivotal moments.” He paused, then seemingly as an afterthought, “Like you, renting that motel room. Very few things from that moment to this one have been in your control, and none of them of any consequence. Your whore is dead now, and killed by your own gun. Her right eye looks a great deal like your answering machine, now. Just a big red zero. No new messages. By dawn, you’ll be in a cell. Your wife found out about you and the whore a few weeks ago. Maybe she took her own life, maybe you had a role in that. The whore, though… she was murdered. There’s not a jury in the world for whom your guilt is anything but a foregone conclusion.”
“Why.” Edgar breathed the inquiry flatly, incapable of inflection. He had never felt so tired – so completely drained and hollow – in his entire life. With each word the pale stranger spoke a deep burning emanated from every muscle in Edgar’s body, and yet the frantic scurrying of his mind remained as strong as ever, desperate to place those eyes he felt he knew so well.
“Why what? Why did you stray from the wife who once loved you? I couldn’t help you there. Not that knowing would change anything for either of us. But that isn’t the most important ‘why’ for you, is it? You want to know why this is happening to you, why I’m doing this. But for some reason you’re afraid to ask me who I am, the true question behind the ‘why’, to which I can only say that you must answer for both of us.”
The stranger resumed his lumbering gait towards Edgar, halting and awkward as he tottered ever closer. Edgar’s mind was drawn deep inside of itself to access the half-recalled memory of something he saw years ago in a mid-dawn walk across the parking lot on his way into work. A tattered salt-and-pepper moth, deceased at the base of a light pole; a coroner’s inquest doubtless would have revealed an acute case of banging one’s self repeatedly into a domelike miniature plastic electrical sun. Then came a stiff breeze which sent the moth airborne, flapping and tumbling toward Edgar’s path through the parking lot. The breeze settled, and the moth resumed being a body perfectly at rest; as all dead things should, Edgar reckoned, unless acted upon by an outside force. An unseen force, in the case of the moth; and, Edgar again reckoned, in the case of the man now standing before him. Because in his movements, Edgar saw that moth very clearly. These were the movements of something which once lived, and was now being acted upon by an entirely different unseen force – one which could only approximate the mechanisms of the vessel it now controls. The wind had been the name of that force driving the moth back into a perversion of life, but to name the force which could do the same for a man?
After a moment of silence which seemed to stretch for hours, Edgar met the stranger’s pale blue eyes with the last shred of courage he had. “Death?”

 
Then, a little more confidently: “You’re Death.”
The stranger laughed uproariously, his gaunt frame convulsing with the rhythm of his dry, wheezing cackles. The withered flesh of his face stretched away from blackened gums and all-too-white teeth in the most hideous approximation of a smile Edgar could have ever imagined. After his laughter subsided, the dark man spoke, wiping away tears which were not there. “You misunderstand me. It wasn’t my intention to be cryptic; I was merely requesting that you provide me with a name. This body, I’m approximating. It’s the body I might have had, had I lived to grow into it. But the eyes, they’re the windows to the soul so they say, and I had hoped you would remember mine. I forgive you though. You saw me only briefly, and under duress. But you were supposed to name me. Dying without a name was the worst part.”
Comprehension more horrible than the bewilderment had ever been began to spawn in Edgar, as an icy, all-encompassing chill washed over him. The man clapped him gently on the shoulder, and leaned in close, placing four pounds of cold steel into Edgar’s open palm. “I told you I was a messenger, and now my task is done. Mom asked me to give you that. She says to hurry. She promises not to be too hard on you if you come home quickly.”
Edgar quivered helplessly; his eyes had begun to water and burn, searching for any sign of consolation in those of his son. He parted his lips as if to speak, but could not find the words. His silent plea’s response came in presumably the most compassionate tone manageable by his visitor, “It’s not terrible there, it’s just…” The corpse-thing’s head cocked to the side, a very boyishly quixotic look in those pale blue eyes. “Gray. It’s gray there. Time moves much slower, if at all. They show you things. They’ve shown me all I would have known in the life which your actions denied me.” Venom in that decaying voice now, and Edgar knew that pulling the trigger himself would be the only mercy granted today.
The visitor turned, staggering clumsily into the darkness toward the edge of the room, as Edgar sat and examined the loaded revolver. His would-be progeny had almost completely exited from sight, and spoke without any discernable emotion. “One more thing. After they cut me out, how long did I last on that incubator? She doesn’t know, but I thought you might. I tried my best to hang on, but it couldn’t have been long. Fifteen minutes? Twenty?”
Edgar raised his head up from his chest; back pressed firmly into his favorite recliner, his entire body drenched in cold sweat. He stared into shadows at the edge of the living room, eyes welling with tears as he lifted the revolver slowly and deliberately to his temple. “Seventeen”, he whispered to the darkness.

85kdam,2,2018-03-19,"First Job Offer Out of Military, Unsure on How to Negotiate Salary",tossaside1232,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/85kdam/first_job_offer_out_of_military_unsure_on_how_to/,"I got my first real deal adult job offer yesterday, and I need help negotiating the salary.

My background: I went to a university that highly encouraged internships. I unfortunately was looking into a career that was highly competitive (US foreign service), and at the time (2010-2012) had people much further along in their career/education path applying to entry level positions and never actually landed an internship, or job after graduation.

About a year after graduation I needed to really get a job, I decided the military would be a good first step into the career field I was looking for. I joined that Army as an Officer Candidate, and in the Army's infinite wisdom, they decided to make me an Ordnance Officer (Maintenance and Munitions). I was pretty disappointed, but was on a 3 year contract so had to learn to deal with it.

My first real position was warehouse Platoon Leader, which is a quartermaster job, not what I had been trained for. Ultimately I managed the warehouse personnel and operations. I learned some of the aspects of inventory control, shipping/receiving, convoy operations, demand forecasting etc.

With the help of my NCOs and Commander I figured out how to do the job, and about 10 months later was moved to the Maintenance Control Officer position. This job I had been trained for, beyond managing the maintenance personnel and motor pool oprations, maintenance schedule, the Lions share of my time was spent reporting maintenance efforts to superiors that didn't understand my job. At this point I embraced logistics, and decided I could do similar things in logistics that I wanted from foreign service.

After another 10 months I was moved to a position of greater authority as Company Executive Officer, which is effectively the operations manager, our company was made up of the 75 mechanics I used to manage, 60 cooks, 15 medics, and the headquarters element (certainly exercised some managing up skills) of 30 people with 1/3 of them outranking me.

I got my sweet honorable discharge in October 2016, took an extended vacation with my wife, and started the job hunt in earnest in February 2017.

I landed a position with the local port authority as a Finance analyst (something I had minimal experience with, but saw as an opportunity to add to my ""manager"" skill set). After the 6 month temporary hire my hire was extended and then extended again.

This employment opportunity.

After 10 months of looking I finally got a call for an interview for an operations superintendent position with a maritime terminal operations company. This was a surprise as I had not applied to the position, I got invited to the interview as a referral from an earlier networking effort. I got a call last Friday inviting me to interview on this past Wednesday. The interview went well, I had a solid answer for all of their questions, I feel like they were warming up to me already.

The morning after the interview I sent out my requisite 'thank you're email, quickly got an email along the lines of ""hey thanks for interviewing, if we choose to bring you in for a second interview we need you to fill out this application prior to"" this made sense, as I came in on a referral rather than an application. I filled out the application and sent it back Thursday morning. I expected a call maybe as early as Friday, but probably this coming week inviting me to a second interview.

I did get a call on Friday with a 'handshake' job offer. 7 days after getting a call for an interview and 36hrs after the interview I had a job offer.

The Job Offer: $65k through the initial review period (6 months) then up to $70k, salary exempt (which is important because given the task-oriented atmosphere of logistics operations there is a pretty good chance I will be working more than the prescribed 40 hours a week)

Company pays 100% of medical/dental/vision (unsure if this extends to family)

Offers 401k, after 1 year the company offers 4% matching (it sounds like one-to-one) with nothing matched prior to the 1 yr mark, but no vesting period there after.

I think in addition there is a pension, averaging 9% of base salary (I dont contributete to this) that begins getting paid into at 1 yr, and then I am vested at 5 yrs.

I am uncomfortable taking the first offer on principle, and because I feel like this is a low-ball.

My three years of military experience are clearly relevant to the position, and in the military I was being paid more than their initial offer.

In addition, I feel like I have a position to negotiate given the haste with which it seems they decided to hire me.

I intend to ask for 15% more than the ""permanent"" salary (so $80k) and be willing to settle for 10% more ($77k). I understand the ""probation period"" pay would be diminished due to them feeling me out, so I have no qualms taking $5k-7k below my floor ($77k) during the first 6 months from my time there.

I am entirely willing to walk away from this position for less than $75k, while I think the job would be exciting and fun, and start a path I would like to be on, it also will often require long hours, and potentially shitty shift/schedules, I am not willing to flip my life upside down and work 3rd shift for anything less than the $77k figure.

Does the hivemind of reddit think this is reasonable? Is there any way I should particularly frame this to better my chances of success? Or really any advice at all?

TLDR Got an initial job offer for $70k, a week after being called in for an interview. Asking for 15% more as my counter offer. Is this enough? Too much? I would accept their counter-counter offer at 5%.

I also posted this to r/personalfinance, but may have crossposted wrong, apologies for my lack of reddit knowledge."

I recently got an offer for a summer internship at a local business. The position is basically an IT Help Desk position. I'm located in a relatively medium/low CoL area, about an hour from a big city. I was offered $13/hr as my hourly pay. I feel as if this is pretty low!

As a student at a well-known, big university studying computer science, I feel as if I am very qualified for this job. My GPA is just short of 3.2, not that it matters but it definitely goes to show that I have somewhat of a work ethic. I also have a few years of job experience working with computer hardware and troubleshooting. This experience is listed on my resume, so the company knows about it.

I would have liked to get an internship pertaining to software development or engineering, but I am not too far into my degree so my experience is unfortunately limited. Other companies are still in the process of interviewing me/deciding whether or not to hire me, so the position I listed here is kind of a fall-back option. But the longer I wait, the more likely it feels like I will end up working for this company.

How could I go about negotiating a better pay for this position? I was thinking I could make a counteroffer of $18-$20/hr, and hope that they at least meet me halfway.

Any tips in going about this? Maybe even a sample response? Also, should I email or call when making the counteroffer?

**TLDR**: Offered $13/hr at company for IT Help Desk internship. Am hard working comp sci student at big university. Also have relevant job experience. Would like to negotiate salary. Wanting to make counteroffer of $18-$20/hr. Help?"

Within 5 months of m classes I had had numerous MTA Certifications for C# and Asp despite me spending little to no time practicing them and studying other languages while my teacher ranted about bs naming conventions. This course was 3 hours a day and by the end of my first year I had gained an Intern Web Developer position for my county Auditor's office.

It was less of an Intern position and more full web development as me and one other student completely remade the Office's website, which I learned PHP and Wordpress along with material design. By the end of my time in school (for 2 years) I had more Certifications and better programming skills than anyone else in my class, I was just extremely lazy and still am.

So for the past year and a half I worked a basic tech configuration job, with random binges into IT security. I want to develop more but I don't know what to do. 

Recently I was promoted to doing helpdesk and more System Admin stuff but I want to be able to code again.. My class in school drained my inspiration and wasted my time.. I just don't know how to get the drive I used to have again. I'm only 19 so I still got plenty of time, I just hate that I don't have a development job or anything to develop.. I'm amazing at solving problems but I don't have any problems to solve...

tldr: I was one of the best coders in my vocational school and very successful for my age, being 19. But I don't have the drive to apply my skills like I should

Edit: Could be very well that I just have imposter syndrome. As I read about it it seems to resonate with me, I wouldn't even play my guitar or clarinet in front of people when I was younger out of fear I would be a ""fraud"""

As a result, I've applied to many tech internships in the bay area, but did not get any concrete offers. I also applied to a few trading internships and got 2 offers. One being in NYC for crypto trading and another being in Toronto for algo crypto trading. I've completed internships in trading in the past.

I'm in a dillema if I should:

Accept my offer in NYC to grow my network &amp; work at a prestigious shop.
Accept my offer at the Toronto algo trading startup so I can use it as a stepping stone into a tech internships

Or lastly, go back to school during the summer (most of my friends will be in school this summer) and get ahead not only in school but also by spending my time working on side projects to land a successful tech internship for Fall 2018.

Recently over the past 2 semesters, I have taken several CS courses and realized that I like CS a lot more and that I want to pursue a career in CS. Unfortunately, transferring to the CS program in my school is practically impossible (too competitive, grades not high enough, already 3rd year). I was wondering if transferring to another university (specifically Ryerson) would benefit me in the future for job prospects. I'm positive that many of my credits will transfer over, so it won't be another 4 years of study, although it will definitely take longer to graduate.



  I hear that CS employers generally do not care too much about your undergrad degree, and that they care more about your abilities and what you worked on. On the other hand, I hear that my resume will be 99% screened off because I'll be competing against other uni grads with an actual cs degree + coop experience. I planned on working several projects myself (started on one), learning on myself on the side, and attending hackathons in the future. I also plan on taking more CS courses before I graduate, so I'll end up with a CS minor at the very least. I'm also trying to land an intern in the CS field by the time I graduate if I stay at Waterloo.



  I am wondering if it is just more worth it for me to transfer to another uni and obtain a CS degree + possibly coop experience. Any insight or advice would be appreciated, thanks."

A little background first, after this semester I'll have two more until I graduate (Fall 2018 and Spring 2019) and I have already secured my first internship for this upcoming summer and I have a pretty good GPA.

I transfered to my university from a community college so I only had my two intro to CS classes complete and all of my general education done. The problem with this is that my entire schedule is just full of upper-level CS classes with no easy classes, so a lot of studying during the week and serving at a restaurant all weekend. This obviously doesn't leave me much time to study for interviews and I want to make sure I secure a good job when I graduate.

What I want to do is spread out my last 2 semesters into 3, because I'll be doing a 17 credit load on both of the semesters and they are debatably the hardest classes I'll be taking in my degree. This would allow me time to grind leetcode and intern with a more ""prestigious"" company so that when I start applying to new grad positions I'll have more of a pool to choose from.

TLDR; Delay graduation to Fall 2019 for another internship and more time to practice for new grad interviews OR grind my interview prep this summer and apply to new grad positions and graduate Spring 2019."

There is this simple release that comes from watching the blood trickle from a fresh wound. It's like all of the bad thoughts and negative emotions are waiting just below the surface and this holy straight razor is cleansing my body of all the terrible things I endure throughout the day. Don't mistake my self-destructive behavior as suicidal intention or masochism. There is a spot on my thigh that I cut from time to time, but you'll find no scars on my arms or anywhere you'd see in daily life. This habit, it is almost a compulsion. It is like my blood is this foreign liquid that must be purged from my body. 

I work as a floor supervisor for a suicide hotline. The irony of a cutter working in such a place isn't lost on me. The volunteers sit at their phones while I walk the floor listening in on the calls and keeping notes on the call activity. It says something about how fucked up the world is that we actually have a quota. This quota is simple. If you call making a suicidal threat, we are to call the police and having you apprehended for a seventy-two hour hold. The charity that pays our bills is funded almost entirely by three different local psychiatric hospitals. If you call because life seems like it isn't worth living, chances are you'll help us meet our quota when we refer you for a psychiatric evaluation. 

When I am not walking the floor or training new volunteers you can find me holed up in my office browsing various internet forums. I think its fair to say I have an unhealthy fascination with death. From an early age I've been unable to accept that eighty or so years of consciousness is some meaningless interval that begins abruptly and ends in an instant. My obsession with death has more to do with discovering what, if anything comes after it. While the plebs on the floor are answering calls from morose motherfuckers sad about their lives I'm reading accounts of near death experiences and messaging people who claim to have had contact with supernatural forces. 

Most of my inquiries don't pan out. 

The vast majority of the people who claim to have contact with otherworldly forces are either liars, lunatics, or both. In nearly fifteen years of searching, I've seldom found more than misinterpreted coincidence and uncorroborated claims. Well, there is one girl who stands out, but I'll get to her later. For now, I'll just say that most of what you read on the internet is bullshit. One of my favorite quotes goes like this. 

*“Don't trust everything you read on the internet.""*

Pisha is a woman I met in an IRC chatroom over on freenode IRC. The room I had searched the active room list and found a room titled #Ouroboros. There were twenty users in the room, but she was the one that messaged me as soon as I entered. I saved the chatlog of our initial conversation. I'll display it below. 

&gt; Pisha216: You shouldn't be here.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Where should I be if not here?
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: I suppose you think you are clever?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Perhaps.
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: Cleverness &amp; Curiosity can get you killed.
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: Go back to whatever room you came from. 
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Suppose that I am curious and clever, what's the worst that could happen?
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: I'll send you an email later. For now, I'm booting you from the room. 
&gt; 
&gt; (User Pisha216 has kicked you from #Ouroboros, Reason: Uninvited)

It was an odd encounter, but not uncommon. A lot of those rooms are set up for private groups and I had stumbled in without knowing exactly what to say or do while there. A few days later I was checking my email at work when I received an email from Pisha216@hell(dot)com. It had been a while since I had seen an email from that domain. From what I understood, the mail server went offline back in 2010. Even still, there was an email with an attachment. 

It read:

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; The Temple of Ouroboros is not currently accepting new pledges. If you would be so kind as to explain how you entered the room without the appropriate password it would be appreciated. My name is Pisha Maxwell, but you may refer to me as Pisha. I am an apprentice with the Temple of Ouroboros. My superiors have tasked me with vetting you and figuring out your intent. Should you prove to be a worthy candidate, my superiors may allow further contact in a manner they see fitting.
&gt; 
&gt; — Second Level Apprentice Pisha Marie Maxwell

I replied:

&gt; Pisha,
&gt; 
&gt; There was no password prompt when I joined the channel. My intent was one of curiosity. I was completely unaware that your organization existed. Please forgive my intrusion. It was just one of my late night internet binges where I went looking for something spooky. Sorry to disturb you. 
&gt; 
&gt; — (Name Removed)

Several weeks passed and I received no response. I figured it was just some group of weirdos heavy into role play or some sort of kinky sex stuff. I was walking the floor and listening to a caller who identified themselves as Pisha. It's a rather uncommon name. Sometimes I would take over a call if it seemed like the volunteer was floundering. I made some excuse about protocol and had the call transferred to my office. 

I picked up the receiver and a timid female voice said, *“I'm sorry to bother you. I hope I didn't get the other guy in trouble.”* I responded, *“No ma'am, sometimes with special cases I step in and handle the calls personally. My name is (removed). How can I help you?”* From there, our conversation when as such. 

Pisha said, *“I'm up for review with this umm... internship I've taken up. I don't think I'll be selected for advancement. My next review won't be for another year. I don't know if I can take another year at this level of service. Most apprentices who fail their second review kill themselves. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live with the shame of being passed over.”*

I interjected, *“Why do you think you'll be rejected for advancement Pisha?”*

She continued, *“I was tasked with vetting a potential newcomer. His story checked out, but I set up my mail client to delete messages on the server after I downloaded them. My laptop fried and I didn't have a backup of his contact information. If I returned to my superiors to ask for it, they would have marked me unfavorably. I have two days to find someone and properly vet someone and I don't even know how to get a hold of them.”*

I sat back in my office chair and contemplated my next words carefully. It violated pretty much every ethical standard of my position to even take the call. But to identify myself could get me fired. I had to be careful, but I didn't want her to off herself.

I replied back, *“The Temple of Ouroboros sounds like a pretty hardcore organization. I don't know who this potential newcomer is, but if I were a betting man I'd say he could be found at the Book &amp; Bean off of 2nd &amp; Porter in (Town Removed) tomorrow at around five.”*

Pisha responded in a hushed tone, *“This is twice now you've inexplicably appeared. Someone will be there. Thank you. Thank you so very much.”*

Pisha assured me that she wouldn't harm herself and I ended the call. After filling out the appropriate forms I logged the call and then logged into the quality control system and ensured that the audio had been marked reviewed and approved. It was an abuse of my position, but there was something about her voice that seemed so familiar. I clocked out at eleven o'clock and I was home and in bed by midnight. 

I was anxious about my meeting with Pisha later in the day and overwhelmed with guilt from abusing my position at work. I was a bit more hurried than normal when I pulled the straight razor from my pocket and made an incision in my left thigh. I cut a little deeper than normal and ended up having to give myself stitches. After more than fifteen years of self-harm, I had become fairly adept at patching myself up. I winced with pain with each stroke of the needle moving through my flesh. After some cleanup and some fresh gauze I pulled my Tripp pants and a Social Distortion t-shirt from my closet and headed to the Book &amp; Bean.

A confused girl in an ankle length slim gray lace dress wondered into the coffee shop a little bit before five o'clock. She was carrying an attache case and wore black horn rimmed glasses that rested on a slender face that was partially hidden by jet black hair. I looked at her for a moment and marveled at how she was an almost classic beauty. Her eyes locked with mine and she made her way over to my table. She extended a tiny hand that I shook firmly. She introduced herself in a timid voice, *“My name is Pisha Maxwell and I represent The Temple of Ouroboros, I take it you're (removed.)”*

I nodded.

She continued, *“Do you believe in fate? I don't mean some hokey sense of predestination, but rather that from the first spark of the big bang that all of these random atoms collided into one another just so that two people could meet? Twice now you've inexplicably appeared when I needed you the most. I don't believe in coincidence.”*

I took a sip from my latte and responded, *“I don't buy into fate. As much as I'd like to think of a few girls weaving the circumstances of our lives with golden looms I'm a skeptic and a pragmatist. Things happen. Any meaning behind them is purely subjective. That being said, it is a pleasure to finally meet you Pisha.”*

A barista approached our table and took Pisha's order. She motioned for some more comfortable chairs in the back of the room and by the time we had moved over to the vinyl easy chairs the barista returned with a warm Earl Grey tea with a wedge of orange. Sat on a love seat and motioned for me to join her there. She sipped her tea and placed it on the table next to her. A single finger moved the hair out of her eyes and we locked into a gaze where I could have fallen into those cold brown eyes. 

She looked away quickly and said, *“It's strange. We've just met and I feel like I've known you my whole life.”*

Still looking where her eyes had just been I responded, *“I hope I'm not being too forward when I say this, as I'm sure it wasn't your intention when you came here, but I haven't been able to take my eyes off of you since you walked in the room. It's not something I saw often, but you are simply captivating.”*

She smiled and turned her feet inward as she tried to deflect the compliment and my advance saying, *“As much as I'd enjoy taking you back to my hotel room and removing your clothes with my teeth, this is purely a business meeting Mr. (removed.)”*

I scooted towards the arm a bit to try and give her some space and she put a hand on my shoulder saying, *“Don't get me wrong. I'm flattered, in any other circumstance you would have just sealed the deal, but I have some more questions you need answered and a 7 AM flight in the morning.”* Then she leaned up and kissed me on the cheek. Her timid voice seemed a bit more bold with that declaration. 

She asked a new question, *“What do you know about Ouroboros? What would you assume about an organization that treats the figure like a deity?”*

I responded, *“I know about a much as anyone else that shows up to a coffee shop with a triskelion tattoo on his wrist in full goth attire. I always saw it as an eternal cycle like that biologically immortal jellyfish in Japan that lives for a million or so years. I imagine a religion centered around such a figure would be focused on eternal life through perpetual rebirth.”*

She smirked, *“I pegged you as clever in our first encounter, but that was eerily insightful. You're right. The Temple of Ouroboros is a religious sect that is centered around the belief that death can be averted through rebirth. Membership is incredibly exclusive. There are only fifty members operating in the United States and that includes apprentices and neonates. You have gained the attention of my direct superior. If you pass this interview, it is likely that we will fly you to the temple for the initiation process, if that is what you desire.”*

I took a long sip from my latte and stared off into the distance saying, *“It might sound strange, but I'm not even sure such a thing would make sense for me. I've spent my whole life looking for meaning in death, the idea of averting it altogether seems almost cheap. I don't know why your superiors are so interested in me. I'm a thirty-three year old slacker in a dead end job that spends his free time looking for answers online. At this point I'm not even sure where I'm going in life, much less that I'd want to live forever.”*

Pisha leaned over and put her head on my shoulder as her arms wrapped around me in a warm embrace I recognized as the first intimate human contact I had experienced in the better part of eight months. She brought her lips so close to my ear that I could feel her warm breath against my skin. In that moment she said, *“I'm at the Marriott, room 734. You bent the rules for me, allow me to bend the rules for you.”*

We went through another hour of question and answer from that point, but I can't remember most of it. There was something about her that was so uncanny and out of place. I was completely enthralled, but wary of her frequent transition between timid and bold. There was something off about her, but as the interview ended I kissed her hand and she caught a cab. I walked back to the car debating whether or not I should take her up on her offer. 

Several months prior to this I got about this far with a girl but when it came time to do the deed she saw the scars on my thigh and a fresh incision that left her uncomfortable. That was the last I saw that girl. She stopped volunteering at the call center and I ended up in a performance review where my boss explained that while they had no problems employing someone with a mental illness, that I would need a note from a doctor stating that I wasn't a danger to myself of others. I had to go to three months of therapy just to keep my job. If they found out about this, I'd be fired. That is the main reason I continue to remove any of my personal information from this account of the past few months. 

I was about halfway to my apartment when I received a text from Pisha. We traded contact information before leaving the coffee shop. It read, *“Don't be ashamed of your scars. I'm not ashamed of mine.”* I never mentioned the cutting. It was a little eerie that she picked up on it, but then I pushed on my thigh for reassurance and realized I had popped a stitch at one point and my black denim pants were wet with blood. I turned my car around and made it to the Marriott around eight in the evening. 

---


I stood outside of room 734 pacing back and forth as I tried to decide whether or not to knock. As much as I wanted to know the woman, I had an overwhelming sense of dread creeping up and my hand slid into my pocket as I ran my fingers across the straight razor. As I turned to leave, Pisha opened the door and pulled me inside. She was wearing the same outfit as before. She led me to the bed and I sat there on the edge as she asked, *“Can I see it? The cut on your leg?”*

A surge of anxiety welled up from somewhere inside and I started to panic. I was about to bolt for the door when she sat next to me and put a hand on me leg. She leaned in and said, *“Lemme show you something.”* She stood up and turned away from me saying, *“Would you mind unzipping my dress?”* I pulled the small zipper down and almost instantly caught sight of ridges of scar tissue on her back. She dropped the dress to her ankles and revealed in a slow twirl that most of her torso and upper legs were covered in scar tissue.

She sat across from me on the dresser and said, *“When I was a little girl my father caught me kissing a neighbor boy. It wasn't anything major, just a peck on the lips. The old man lost it. He dragged me into the living room and bent me over his knee screaming about how no daughter of his was going to behave like a harlot. He was spanking so hard that I stopped feeling it after the second or third swat and as I struggled to get away I ended up tripping on the rug and falling in the fireplace. By the time he pulled me out I had burns on sixty percent of my body.”*

She lit a cigarette and took a long drag as I responded, *“That's terrible. I don't even...”*

She interrupted, *“Some would call it disfiguring, but your expression hasn't changed since you entered the room. I can tell that it is meaningless to you. I can smell the blood on your leg. Judging by your anxiety and shame, I'd say you were a cutter. I did that for a while.”* She spread her legs and pointed to her inner thigh where I could make out numerous linear scars in about the same location as mine. 

I unbuckled my belt and let wriggled my pants to the floor to expose the incision on my thigh. I scooted back on the bed and lit my own cigarette and we sat there in silence staring at each other as the embers on the ends of our cigarettes approached the filters. She finished her cigarette and came over to the bed and snuggled up next to me. We sat there in silence holding each other in that moment of perfect desperation for an unknown amount of time before I drifted off to sleep. 

My dreams were fitful and violent. Flashes of red shapes that bore sharp teeth tore at me as I fought to wake and found myself violently throwing myself on the floor. Pisha mumbled in her sleep as I climbed back on the bed. I moved over the table in the corner and sat there in the dark smoking a cigarette as she laid there sleeping. I contemplated sneaking out but found my legs unwilling to comply with the instinct to flee. She rolled over and slid her arm across the empty space in the bed only to sit up and look around. 

She called out, *“(removed) are you still here?”*

I responded softly, *“I had a nightmare, decided to get up and smoke.”*

She came over and sat in my lap as she pulled a cig from my pack and lit it off of my cherry. With her head leaned against my shoulder she said, *“I feel so safe with you.”*

I pet her hair as we sat there. After a few minutes she started talking. I had zoned out but when I started paying attention she was mid-sentence, *“-ing and what not. I don't know anymore. At first I joined because I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself. Fraternization between apprentices and neonates is strictly forbidden. If you join, we wouldn't be able to do this again for the better part of a year and that is only if you make apprentice. It would almost be worth it to fail the review and say you didn't pan out. I like this. I've never had this before.”* 

I put my cigarette out in the ashtray as I responded, *“I've lived thirty-three years without you, I can wait a year. It would be worth it just to be a part of your life.”*
She leaned up and kissed me on the cheek before walking over to her suitcase and getting dress. She tossed me my pants and shoes and we were both dressed within a couple of minutes. I kissed her on the forehead before heading to the door. I turned back towards her and said in a soft tone, *“Thank you for the best night of my life.”* She smiled from ear to ear and said, *“I hope to change that one day.”*

For the next several weeks I worked the floor and monitored calls and exchanged the occasional secret texts with Pisha. She wasn't allowed to interact with me during the review process, but she couldn't help herself, nor could I. It was around the first week of March when I received a package at work with  an Ouroboros logo in the upper right-hand corner of the label. Contained within was a plane ticket and a thirty page questionnaire I was to have filled out perfectly by the time I landed in Maine three days later. I completed the multiple choice section of the questionnaire in just a few hours but decided to track down a typewriter for the essay portions. Three days later I was on a plane to Bangor, Maine. 

A car met me outside the airport and for the next three hours I rode with an ill-tempered man in the backseat of an SUV to a mansion on the shore of Flagstaff Lake. What little conversation I had with my fellow passenger came from his repeated dismissals of my worthiness and that only one of us would be selected to join. He boasted a degree in ancient literature and an internship at the Smithsonian. I was a slacker with an associates of general studies from a community college and a dead-end job that I fell into because no one else wanted it. 

The two of us were brought into the foyer and asked to sit. The ill-tempered man I had rode with was called first and I sat on the bench going over my questionnaire one last time. I saw Pisha walk past one of the doorways in a crimson robe with white and yellow trim. She didn't look at me directly, but a smile crossed her face. I sat up slightly less concerned with my fate. About an hour passed and the ill-tempered man came back to the bench with a smug look on his face. He said under his breath, *“I've got this in the bag, fucking scrub.”*

I was called back through a long narrow hallway. An ornate door at the end led to a study where an elderly woman with thick glasses sat in a crimson robe with white and black trim staring over an old mahogany desk. *“Please sit Mr. (removed.)”* There were three chairs set in front of the desk. The were lined up perfectly, but one was ever so slightly off center. It was on the right of center, a wooden chair with a soft velvet cushion. The middle chair was an ornate leather upholstered chair with brass tacks running along the edges. The chair on the left was a simple wooden chair that seemed out of place in the otherwise ornate study. It is where I sat.

The woman gave an introduction, *“Mr. (removed), I am Adeline Devonshire. At one-hundred and three years old I am the matriarch of this temple. All applicants require my approval. Why did you sit in that chair?”*

I sat up a little more and responded, *“It seemed the least comfortable. I wanted to pay attention and I thought the others would be too distracting.”*

She nodded her head and wrote some notes before asking, *“What do you hope to gain from this order?”
*
I paused for a moment and gave it some thought before saying, *“Pisha. What I mean is that I could give you some story about finding meaning or rebirth, but it is so much a part of her identity that I'm willing to be a part of it to have the chance of spending time with her, even if it it means waiting a year just to be able to talk to her again.”*

Adeline's jaw dropped a little, *“Are you even taking this seriously?”*

I swallowed some spit that had been collecting in my mouth and responded, *“Yes, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out my utter skepticism on the primary tenets of this order. Everything I gathered by the nature of the questions you had me answer in this folder I am holding points towards wanting honesty and candor. Maybe I'm wrong, but I have a feeling you are looking for quality of character over qualifications.”*

The elderly woman stood up and walked slowly over to a bookshelf where she pulled back a thick tome and tucked it under her arm as she moved back to the desk. She turned through several pages before stopping and running her finger across the text and saying, *“Pisha said that you were clever, and sometimes eerily insightful. Am I to understand you spent an entire evening in her hotel room without even attempting to fornicate with her?”*

Without hesitation I responded, *“I felt it would have cheapened the experience. It was a pure moment that would have only been sullied by giving in to such urges. I would have loved to, but I couldn't bring myself to even suggest it.”*

Adeline nodded and then said, *“One last question. Why the triskelion tattoo on the back of your wrist?”*

I replied, *“It's to remind me that there are three separate and altogether opposing sides of my mind that are in constant conflict, but still the components that make up my whole being.”*

Adeline looked down at the book in front of her and without looking back up she said, *“Leave your questionnaire on my desk and go back to the bench in the foyer.”*

I stood and before turning I placed the folder on her desk and said, *“Thank you for your consideration.”*

The ill-tempered gentleman on the bench commented on my return, “I was in there for more than an hour, you were barely gone ten minutes. I think we both know who is staying and who is going home.” I thought about punching him in his smug face but opted to sit there silent. Nearly an hour had passed and no one had come by. The ill-tempered man got up and wandered off. I sat there on the bench for a while longer as Adeline and Pisha walked past without so much as looking at me. 

The ill-tempered man returned just as an attendant appeared and said, “You are both invited to the main dining hall for a meal prepared especially for you.”

We sat at a small table in the back of the room as the rest of the apprentices and neonates gathered around a dining table that was longer that my apartment and covered in gourmet dishes and fine china. The ill-tempered man and I were both brought covered platters. His was a fine cut steak cooked medium-rare with asparagus and a Gruyere sauce. Mine had an empty plate. He was given a goblet of wine and I was given a glass of water. 

The man in front of me smirked. Adeline stood at the end of the table and announced to the room, *“After some deliberation with the elders via Skype and scouring The Book of Ouroboros I have come to a decision on which supplicant will be allowed to complete the trials of initiation. We sit in front of this table of luxury with a feast set out before us. Our plates are empty, but we know that we will take part in the pleasures afforded to us by this celebration. As such, one supplicant has been given a fine meal which he will eat in peace before leaving never to return. The other supplicant has been given an empty plate, because he will join us in the feast we hold in his honor.”*

The smug look fell from the man's face as a smirk came across mine. He stood up in protest and shouted, *“I spent years studying the ancient texts of the old world just to find mention of your order and then spent six months preparing for this. How does this philistine warrant an invitation in the first place? Look at him!”* 

Adeline shot a look to a large man standing by the door who removed the ill-tempered man from the dining hall. She then turned her gaze to me and said, *“Please tell the attendant what dishes you wish to sample, you may join in the feast but to join our table you must first pass the trials.”* I sat alone at my table dining for the next couple of hours before being led to the rather posh guest suite. My carry-on bag sat next to the bed and there were fresh silk pajamas in my size on the dresser. After a shower and some reflection I laid down and drifted off to sleep. 

---

I woke to laughter and darkness. Robed figures in porcelain masks dragged me by my feet through a narrow stone corridor. The rough stone floor tore at my pajamas and scraped my skin bloody as I slid across it. I tried to struggle, but I couldn't shake my legs free, much less pull myself up off the stone floor. The narrow hallway widened to a large candlelit room with light brown stone walls and strange symbols carved into the rock. In the center of the room stood a rack with leather straps tied to the top and bottom I was stood up and tied as a masked figure emerged from the shadows and said, *“Welcome to the first trial of initiation. This is a test of willpower and endurance. This can end at anytime. Simply ask us to stop and you will be set free and sent home.”*

A small rubber mouth guard was shoved in my mouth and the masked figure stepped back. Hanging there on the rack I winced at the sight of the whip in the hands of a large figure I assumed to be Adeline's enforcer from the dining hall. The first crack of the whip against my back caused me to violently pull at my restraints. I bit down on the mouth guard a bit more each time the leather sliced into my back twenty lashes in he stopped and the masked figured returned saying, *""There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain. Why do you endure this pain?”* With the mouth guard in, I could only speak in vowels. 

It was pulled my mouth and a repeated, *“Pisha.”*

The mouth guard was put back and the man went back to his lashing. Ten more lashes and I was all but convinced by the cold throbbing pain that there was exposed bone. I could see blood pooling on the floor. Eventually the lashing stopped and the masked figure returned saying, *“To endure such pain for love is admirable, but this is not a romantic order. We are embody a proud tradition of esoteric study and discipline. It takes more than willpower and determination to advance in this study. Your wounds will be tended to and you will be returned to your room.""*

An hour of stitches and bandaging later I was led to my room. I sat up on the bed not wanting to lay on my back. In the darkness of the room and the pale glow the moonlight I could see a figure standing in the corned of the room. Pisha spoke up, *“I'm beyond flattered that you would do this to be near me, but it isn't necessary. Just give up, I'll leave with you.”* I responded flatly, *“You went through this for your own reasons, what kind of man would I be to reject a pain you lived through willingly?”* She walked forward and kissed me on the cheek before leaving. 

A few days of resting and healing later I was brought to a small room with metal chair. I was given a cup of a bitter tasting tea. An attendant brought in another chair and a few moments later Adeline entered and sat across from me, and the attendant tied my wrists to the arms of the chair. Adeline spoke up saying, *“You were just given a powerful hallucinogen. It will eat away at the walls in your mind and you will have no way of knowing what is real and what isn't. Your innermost thoughts will escape from your mouth and you'll be completely unable to hold anything back. I am going to show you some pictures and you are going to tell me what you think. It is here that we will come to know you as you really are in your heart of hearts.”*

It was about that moment that the walls began to melt and the words coming from Adeline's mouth echoed through the room on an infinite loop. It became in possible to focus on anything, Her facial features twisted and distorted as she spoke on and on about the pictures she was showing me. I lost all connection to the world around me. My mind drifted to my straight razor and I entertained the thought of bleeding the poison in my head through that sacred spot on my thigh. I drifted further and further away from myself only to be jerked back time and again when cold water was splashed in my face. 

Time lost all meaning as this interval became eternal. Violent images consumed my thoughts. Ancient soldiers marching with spears and shields converged on small villages killing everyone in sight. Women and children fled in terror as soldiers chased them down and did unspeakable things. I tried to look away but it was everywhere in my field of vision. The scenes changed but the carnage remained constant. Around the time that I lost anything resembling awareness of myself I was crying out that it stop, that the inhuman violence was too much, that I didn't want to see one more unspeakable act. Then I faded into the carnage and became one with the ever-increasing violence as I lost myself to the torrent of blood washing through the towns and villages I saw in my mind's eye. 

I woke in the guest room an inordinate amount of time later with Pisha standing over me. She brought a damp cloth across my forehead as she looked in my eyes singing under her breath in a language I didn't recognize. She stopped for a moment and whispered in my ear, *“I'm so proud of you.”* I drifted back to sleep.

---


The next morning I was brought to Adeline's study. She sat at her desk and barely took notice of me as she said, *“Grab a book and read your third trial is tomorrow.”* I went for the huge tome she call The Book of Ouroboros. The thick tome was a leather bound book with thick yellowed pages printed in an old typeset. 

A printed engraving on the first page showed a slender woman standing with a sword over a caricature of a Shah. The title at the bottom read, *“The Lady Is The Victor.”* I read the story of Parisa, the youngest daughter of a Persian Merchant in the late Zand Dynasty. Her father punished her as a young girl by tossing her in a fire. She spent the next ten years in waiting for a suitor, but each would learn of her disfigurement and break off the betrothal. She was nineteen years of age with the oldest son of the general of the Shah's army took her as a wife. He was a cruel man and a vicious drunk nearly twice her age. One night while he slept she poisoned his wine. The next morning as he drew from the bottle he began to convulse. 

She was tried and found guilty of the murder of her husband and sentenced to death. In the dungeons she was subjected to all manner of unspeakable act by the guards before being sent to the chopping block. It was cloudy on the day of her execution. Battered and bruised, she led to the chopping block where the executioner sharpened his blade. Just as the blade made contact with her neck, a bolt of lightning struck the blade and Parisa disappeared in the flash. 

---


The next morning I was led to a chamber where Adeline stood at the foot of a throne. A veiled figure sat on the ornate chair and Adeline bowed before her. One by one, each member of the order filed through and knelt before the throne. I was brought to the throne and pushed to my knees. Adeline stood over me with a sword saying, *“It would be better for you to run on this sword than enter this order with fear in your heart.”* She kissed the sword and presented it to the woman on the throne. 

The woman stood and revealed herself to be Pisha. Pisha put the sword to my throat and said, *“In this incarnation I am Pisha Maxwell. I have also been known as Parisa Al-Fath and Lady Marie Lizet. Twice you found me when I was looking for one to stand by my side. You have shown great character and strength. It is for this reason and the connection we share that I believe you to be Azir Al-Fahad, my dead lover reborn. I live eternal, like the jellyfish you mentioned when we first met. In each lifetime I regress to a child like state only to grow again into my position as Priestess.”*

She removed the sword from my throat and continued, *“Adeline was the first of my converts. A transfusion of my blood and a sufficient electric shock and her body reverted as mine had so many times before. Each apprentice and neonate serves in hopes of my gift. You on the other hand simply endured the trials for a chance at another night in my presence. What say you, of my offer to break the cycle of death and rebirth as I offer you my gift?”*

Now, I don't know what exactly went through my mind before I said this, but there was a deep feeling of betrayal as she revealed this to me. I fell for a woman that didn't exist. Pisha the apprentice was a lie. I looked up in defiance and said, *“Pisha the apprentice held my love and devotion. I do not know the woman in front of me.”* 

The sword returned to my throat. 

Pisha said in a stern tone, *“You fought for a vulnerable young girl, and thus you are worthy of a queen. Why do you seem so distraught at this revelation?”*

I cleared my throat and then put a finger to the blade pushing it away as I stood up. I turned my back to her and started pacing as I ranted, *“I don't know what kind of sick game you're playing but I made myself vulnerable to you. I gave myself to you. But I didn't. I gave myself to a lie. And now you're talking about immortality and conversions. Fuck that. I hated being a kid. All this time you've been saying that I'm free to leave at anytime. Well, I'm out. If I ever see Pisha the Apprentice again I'll give her my love, but this is ten kinds of bullshit.”*

Pisha shrieked and two men grabbed me at the shoulders and dragged me to an antechamber of the main hall where I was strapped to a chair. All manner of tubes and needles were inserted into my arms and chest. I struggled as best I could, but it was to no avail. Two pads were brought towards my face and past my field of vision to my temples and with a sharp pain, I passed out. 

---


I woke at home and in my own bed. I don't even remember flying back. I called the human resources office to inform them that I was back from my extended vacation and asked if my position was still available. Over the next few weeks I fell back into the routine of working nights listening to calls and spending my down time searching the internet. Only now instead of searching for clues of otherworldly origin I became with The Temple of Ouroboros. 

A few weeks of research returned very little if any results. It was only when discussing my experiences in a deep web chat room for paranormal discussion that someone sent me a private message that read, *“I knew you were a scrub. You couldn't of been worthy of the gift.”* I replied, *“You're that smug asshole that kicked out aren't you?”* He replied, *“The name is Kenneth.”* I typed out a response, *“Actually, I refused the gift and after a scene from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest with electric shock and all manner of needles I woke at home in my bed.”
*
Kenneth responded, *“Bullshit, there's no way she gave you the gift. Pisha was my beloved, how could you have been worthy. I was supposed to be the reincarnation of Azir Al-Fahad.”* I replied, *“Yeah, she sold me that line too. I've been considering going to the doctor and getting some tests done to see what they shot me up with. I've had a wicked headache since I've been back and I can't seem to sleep comfortably.”*

Kenneth sent me one last message, *“It's not fair. Why do you get to live forever?""*

---


I got an email from Pisha216@hell(dot)com last night. It simply read, *“Should you ever change your mind, your place is by my side.”*

 I added the address to my block list. It's been a crazy past few months. I met the most amazing girl only to find out she was some insane cult leader. I had the most amazingly intimate night of my life and then endured the kind of torture that leaves men broken and rambling. All in all I'd say it evened out. 

The major improvement in my life as a result of this is that I haven't felt the urge to cut myself since I've been back. In fact, I feel more alive that I have before. I remember reading somewhere about people surviving tragedies and seizing life by the horns afterward. I like to think that's what's going on here. Heck, prior to this whole ordeal I was starting to get laugh lines on my face and gray hairs in my beard, but both are gone. All the stress in my old life seems meaningless when looking back at those damned trials. 

The only thing that has me concerned lately is the how thirsty I get sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I've lost nearly ten pounds and my skin is tightening up wonderfully, but sometimes I'll drink a gallon of water at a time and still feel thirsty. I talked to my doctor about it and he told me to take it easy on the hydration and gave me a pill that makes it a little more tolerable. I'll miss the Pisha I fell for and curse the one who tricked me. Maybe one day I'll decide to look her crazy ass up. 

Until then, I feel great. It's like I'm getting younger every day.

I was told that we were going to get paid by the end of the summer, but then he told us that we'd have to sign deferred payments. On our agreement, he said that he would pay us by February 9th, 2018. It's been more than a month since then, and now he's telling me that he plans on getting the money by summer. 

How should I navigate asking him to get paid (since he owes me money) without jeopardizing a good letter of recommendation? 

Should I allow him to wait until summer if he pays me with interest (I don't need the money now)? If so, what amount of interest should I negotiate?

Should I get a formal signed agreement of the number of hours I worked? I never got a signed copy of the amount and don't want to get screwed.

All in all, I just wanted to say that the CEO is a really nice guy so I can't imagine him screwing me over on purpose, but I'm starting to feel more and more uncomfortable. Thanks for the advice!

85njce,19,2018-03-19,"Worked full-time for 2 years as a 'Software Developer Intern', was I exploited?",joyoyoyoyoyo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85njce/worked_fulltime_for_2_years_as_a_software/,"**History/Context**:
I worked fulltime at a company where I developed backend applications for data mining in business intelligence. I get the impression that my job title—Software Developer Intern—contradicts the amount of work that I put in. 

I worked full-time at this startup, and I had a compensation of $12.50/hr (average local Software Engineering salary was $90k). When I asked for a raise, a year in, I got it bumped from $12.50/hr to $15/hr. As a first-generation student and person of color from LA, I definitely took up the chance to sign the contract with this hourly wage (at the time, I hadn't had prior internships, and I was a 3rd year undergraduate studying Computer Engineering at a UC). Anything above minimum wage had the impression that I was making bank.

**The current situation:**
So basically for the past 7 months, I have been applying for work in the bay area (non-local), along with working on DS+ALGs review on the side. When I speak with recruiters and hiring managers, I sometimes get the impression that many of them see my job title as 'Software Developer Intern', and they may neglect the fact that I worked alongside the 'Software - Data Engineering' team, to the point where I was no longer supervised, and I managed some of my own projects.

I really hate to be judged with low competence, and I know I'm stupid a.f., considering everything everyone knows. I just want to ask...
*Was I exploited? And is there a way I can tailor my resume to improve any misunderstandings? I'm not sure if it's my resume, candidate scoring algorithms on the resume, or the way I am pitching myself?* At this point, I just want work. 😢 I commute 6 hours from East LA to the bay area, and I sleep in my car when I have on-sites. I just want work, and I'm doing my best not to devalue my work or work a shorter median salary."

I'm an older student (28) with management experience and 6 months of engineering internship experience where I am currently working.

I go to school in the city where I grew up, and I really don't want to stay here. I've been here my whole life and have never really liked it here, and part of the reason I elected to go back to school as an older student was because I felt an engineering degree would afford me the opportunity to relocate somewhere I feel more ""at home"".

I keep seeing posts where people list their stats: 20 applications, 9 interviews, 3 offers, etc. I've probably applied to a hundred jobs since New Years and other than generic rejection emails, I've heard nothing back. I've had my resume looked over by several people at our engineering career center, my GPA is solid (3.4 cumulative, 3.8 major), I have relevant engineering experience as well as extensive leadership and past work experience. I can't figure out why I'm not hearing anything back from any of the companies I apply to. I even have a cover letter template that I modify for each specific job position which compares their requirements with my experience and skill-set. Basically, I feel like I'm doing everything right on paper, but getting zero results.

Has anyone here had any luck with specifically seeking jobs out-of-state from where they attend school/live? I'm in the Midwest but hope to move to the Pacific Northwest or Southwest (Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City are my top choices, as well as their surrounding areas). These are my top choices, but I've applied to many other locations as well.

My current internship made me a full-time offer before the semester started, but not only do I not want to stay where I am, I don't find the industry or work I currently do particularly interesting, and it seems like a niche industry that would be difficult to break out of if I spent a few years there. They understand this and have implied they'd be willing to keep me on in my current capacity until I find something more permanent, which is a comfort (I have bills to pay- living with my parents ""until I find a job"" isn't an option for me), but I'd really like to land something permanent well before graduation. In general, I feel confident that if I can get in front of a person, I interview and present myself well, but I can't seem to get through the applicant screening process for whatever reason.

Did anyone here go through something similar? If so, any insight about how to stand out as an out-of-state applicant is much appreciated."
85o0yr,3,2018-03-19,Accounting and statistics double major a good idea?,gsferris,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/85o0yr/accounting_and_statistics_double_major_a_good_idea/,"I'm a sophomore accounting student with a 3.9 GPA. The accounting program at my school requires you to get a master's and take the CPA exam. I'm also considering getting a bachelor of science in statistics in addition to the accounting master's.

I don't think I want to be an accountant necessarily. However, I'm interested in business and accounting is said to be ""the language of business,"" and it's the most competitive business program at my university, so I think I'll stick with this degree, especially since I've already sunk some time into it. I don't really know what I wanna do after I graduate though, and statistics seems really useful, especially with big data becoming increasingly important. I'm in my second stats class and not only is the material useful, but I find it interesting.

I spoke with the stats advisor and it seems that I'll be able to graduate at the same time as I was expecting as long as I take classes over the summer. She also told me that there are some computer programming requirements within the statistics degree, another super useful field that I'm interested in; I've taken an intro computer science course and liked it.

So, with all this context, does anyone have some advice for me about whether I should pursue the double major or not? I couldn't find any similar situations with my online searches, so hopefully someone here can help. Here are some other questions I have:

Will employers think the two fields are incompatible/not useful together?

Will taking classes every summer make it difficult to find internships?

I would be doing an ""applied track"" for stats, meaning I won't get as much exposure to calculus or other general math courses, and more focus is on specific stats courses. Should this factor in to my decision at all?

Another option I've considered is a minor in computer science. A major is pretty much out of the question for my situation, but would a minor in CS be better than the major in stats? I'm sure CS would be more desirable to employers, but does the ""minor vs major"" difference give stats the edge?


Any and all advice would be appreciated."

I am only a sophomore and the position itself looks way out of my head. Ok so I kinda lied, I don't really have an interview, yet. I gotta schedule it for it next week but It is guaranteed that I will have one, and it will be over the phone. Now the part that makes me really anxious and I am kinda shaking just thinking about is that, one it is a phone interview and second, I do not even think I am ready to interview?

I read up on the company and the intern position, and it says I will not be doing much there but still, its my second year in college, I barely passed my first java course and am on to my second. I am still confusing syntax pretty hard and overall, I don't know how to program. On top of that, I am not confident at all, I talk low and my english is dead horrible. I forget my words, and I barely am able to proceed onto my next sentence when I am talking to someone I don't know. That's where I am even more nervous, I read that it will be 2 or 3 people on the phone, and I can already imagine myself getting stuck on their behavioral questions.

Even if it turns out to be one person, I will be walking around with my heart racing. If they even ask me simple basic java questions, I am confident I won't even be able to answer them. I was applying for the heck of it since I know my resume is horrible and it has nothing interesting on it so I am even more curious as to how i even got this opportunity. I am just assuming, it is one of those, everyone gets a chance or just cause I have met the minimum requirements, I don't even know.

How can I mentally prepare myself to anyone who can help me. I don't think I am ready for any programming questions, and I am to nervous to even do ""Explain me what you would do in x situation"", such behavioral questions stump me because I am like, I am really never in these situations, or I can't think of it at that moment. I am sorry, I am more venting at this point than anything. What should I do."

I was Chemical Engineering, but that ended last summer after getting fucked over by my Mo Heat professor. My first two years I did not try hard. Was fine getting C's left and right. Partially due to myself not putting the effort, and some due to severe untreated ADD/ADHD. I made my first D sophomore year. That was purely my fault. He was a great professor, I just didn't put the effort. My second D was last summer in MoHeat, when a professor deliberately failed a third of the class because he ""just didn't think we knew the material well enough"" despite passing the class (which was determined by his syllabus). A group of us fought and fought, went to the head of the Chem. E department (was basically told ""tough shit""), then we went to the Vice-President/Provost's office, then was bounced to the main Engineering department, then bounced to our advisors. Advisors were a big help, but failed. That same summer, I got my first F. Really nice way to end my summer after all the Chem E problem. (Summer Semester was 8 weeks, and I took two 4 week classes). I know 4 week classes aren't ideal, but I had no choice for my then Chem E degree. The professor that gave me an F was a hard ass. The class was Diff Eq, and he was known to be horrible. Didn't curve the exams, even though averages were in the 40s and 50s. After that my friend and I both switched to Computer Engineering and here I am.

&amp;nbsp;

I got my 3rd and hopefully final D last semester. It was a hard class (Digital Signals and Filtering) with a professor who didn't teach well, but was an amazing researcher. I'm retaking it this semester and I'm doing extremely well. The professor that is teaching it is much clearer.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sorry I spent so much time explaining myself, but I feel like it should provide some insight. I'm getting treated for my ADHD now, by taking Adderall (MY PRESCRIPTION :P). Upside, It has been helping me focus and given me motivation. Downside, it makes me incredibly anxious. This is why I am here.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - I fucked around my early years and separately got fucked over by some professors these past 2 and a half years. My GPA has gone to shit. 

EDIT 2: Listen, I'm not completely blaming my professors. I have acknowledged that I fucked around and acknowledge that some is my fault. 3 out of 4 of the classes I failed had bad professors. Not just bullshit that was said by students, but known by graduates. I went in these classes knowing they were bad, but didn't have a choice because it was the only class offered. From what I learned from replies, both here and my inbox, is to ""work the system."" If professor is horrendous, I gotta make it work. Even if that means going to a different professor for help, or studying a different textbook, or learning HOW to take the exams (instead of just taking the exams). This is what makes the student successful. Regardless if the exam average was a 40 and the professor refused to curve.

&amp;nbsp;

My GPA is currently 2.38. I've been looking at jobs online, just to see what could be out there when I graduate in 2-3 years. Then I started seeing how many positions require a GPA of 3.0 and above. I, of course, start panicking and texted my girlfriend about this. She then said I needed to beef up my resume with volunteering and internships. When I looked at internship positions, I saw more 3.0 GPA requirements. 
&amp;nbsp;
What should I do? Do companies really have a bird's eye level of focus on GPA. Are they a little lenient if you're able to prove to them that you would be a reliable person during the interview. How will I be able to get an internship, if I suck so badly. I don't even know if I want advice anymore, but just somebody out there to tell me that they made it and everything is going to be okay.

I am currently a junior in college in upstate New York. I’ve been a long time reader of no sleep but have never had anything interesting enough to post about until this weekend... I live in a house that was built in the 1920s. It’s 6 bedrooms, and was clearly a beautiful house in its prime but has fallen into dilapidation since being overrun with drunk college students (myself included, I’ll admit) but I can admire what once was. The floors creak, the house is often shifting and making weird noises and don’t even get my started on the dark abyss that is the basement. This past Friday night commenced spring break for my college and I was excited to head home and spend some time with my boyfriend. I arrived back I my home town which is about an hour from my school when I realized I had left my laptop (a big no no as my internship is completely online). I was frustrated and convinced my boyfriend to head back to my college house for the night as we would have it to ourselves. I thought it would be a nice relaxing night with my boyfriend but I was obviously wrong as you could tell from this being on no sleep. We arrived back at the house around 8pm and ordered pizza to eat as we binge watched jersey shore while hitting a bong like the stereotypical students we are. Life was great until we heard a bottle crash to the floor in the kitchen. Now, by this point I was high as a bird and convinced someone was in the house. My boyfriend took the more adult approach and investigated the kitchen. When he returned he explained the bottle must have just fallen off the counter.... which is weird considering it was behind the sink on a flat surface. We continued the show and tried to relax again. About 20 minutes after the bottle broke we heard water flowing from my bedroom. I went in and found the shower had been turned on. I am the only one with access to the bathroom in my room and neither my boyfriend nor I had touched the shower since arriving back at the house. I brushed it off as just being a careless mistake I must have made earlier, although in the back of my mind I KNEW I had shut the shower off completely that morning. For  a couple hours we experienced no weird instances after that. As midnight approached though some weird shit started up again. As mentioned earlier, the floors are extremely creaky in this house. We heard creaking commence outside the door of my bedroom and continue towards the living room. I noticed it first, it sounded like a full grown man was walking on the floor towards us but we could see nothing. As this is happening, the tapestry we had on the wall falls. At this point I’m ready to book it because what the fuck? Im not going to be the dumb bitch murdered in a haunted house but my boyfriend convinces me it has to be coincidences and the house is extremely old so I begin to believe him, albeit wearily. We ended up falling asleep sometime around 1 am in my bedroom. An hour later I’m awoken by a screeching noise. I’m talking nails on a chalkboard screeching noise. I shoot up in bed (my bf could sleep through ANYTHING so I’m not surprised when he doesn’t stir) my bedroom happens to have the laundry room off of it so I hung a curtain to separate it from where my bed sits. The curtain had been left open when i fell asleep so when I sat up in bed I was staring directly into the laundry room. I blinked my eyes to adjust to the darkness of my room and as I did I noticed a figure swaying in the room. My eyes widened and I felt my body grow rigid with fear. I grasped for my boyfriend and felt only blankets as I stared at the figure sway slowly to the left and right. As my vision adjusted I noticed that the figure was hanging from something... at this point I screamed and even my boyfriend couldn’t sleep through that.

First of all, I apologize if this is not the correct place to post this.

I'm currently a CS/ECE student and current junior in college thinking about possibly transitioning to trading. I'm looking to apply to High-Frequency Trading (HFT) companies and other firms like Citadel, Jane Street, Two Sigma for possibly Algorithmic Trading next year as a New Grad. How competitive is my resume?

I was lucky enough to land a Big 4 internship in tech this upcoming summer. Not sure if recruiters will notice, but half of my work experience and awards is stuff in high school. I know for Software Engineering companies you don't have to put your GPA, but I'm not sure if you have to put it on for the trading companies that I'm applying to or if they care about GPA. I have a pretty shit GPA ~3.3/3.4.

I'm not sure if being a Software Engineer is right for me so I'm also trying to look into the finance (specifically algo trading) field as I have always liked mathematics and computer science. I'm new to this field so I'm not really sure what they expect in applicants.

Cheers.

My boss has been picking at me, trying to find out if I want to stay as a full time employee after I graduate. Every time he asks, I say yes, because I don’t have any other job offers up to this point.

The thing is, I really don’t enjoy the work. It’s doable, and I’d do it for the right price, but there’s a lot of things about the job that I don’t enjoy.

If I do get offered the job, should I take it? I have nothing else so far, but I’m looking. 

If I get another opportunity somewhere else before I get an offer here, how would I inform them of this without completely burning that bridge?

And what if the salary they offer me is too low?

TL;DR: Current internship will probably offer me a full time job. I don’t wanna work there ideally, but if I have nothing else I will. I’ve been telling them I do want to stay there. What if they offer me low pay? What if I find another opportunity before they offer me a job?"

I also put them out at a different time, so let me know if you like to get them before you go to work or later in the day.

In regards to the audio quality, I keep experimenting and this seems to be the best of my abilities at this point. I'm still learning, and I'm open to feedback/criticism that is positive or negative equally.

The episodes:

Podcast Episode 013: Dr. Brandon Frenz of Cyro Biotechnology
Episode 013 can be found on my website, itunes, and Stitcher.

Brandon got his bachelors degree in biochemistry from Portland State University where he conducted research on mitochondria with Keith Garlid. Additionally, he got an internship sponsored by the SENS foundation in the lab of Henrich Jasper at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging where he modeled the effects of individual  tissue aging on the rest of the body using fruit flies. He received his PhD at the University of Washington in the Biochemistry department. His advisory was Frank DiMaio and in the DiMaio lab where he developed a novel sampling strategy for de novo modeling of protein structures using sparse cryo electron microscopy data. Basically, he is smart and he has studied a lot of different topics.

He has since started working at Cyrus biotechnology in 2015 shortly after the company spun out of the Institute for Protein Design at UW (of which the DiMaio lab is part).  The goal of the company is to bring the powerful tools for protein structure prediction and design found in Rosetta to industry users in an easy to use fashion with back end cloud compute.

In this podcast he answers a lot of questions on the potential of protein engineering, how to be an evil scientist as seen in spy kids (or The novel the isle of doctor moreau) to create interesting organisms, where the field is going, and how each of us can help push the research forward.

Podcast Episode 014: Bertrand Janin Chief Technical officer at Truveris
Episode 014 can be found of my website, itunes, and Stitcher. Also, pretty much anywhere that podcasts are found, such as Google Play Bertrand Janin Is the CTO at Truveris where he he has helped build their team from just himself to over 80 people.  He was originally inspired to get into programming from his love of games, and slowly built up his skills in coding and managing to the point where he is now a successful CTO. He hopes to one day hike the Appalachian mountains and believes he is immortal, and since I cannot disprove the latter without going to jail, we will have to take him at his word on that! We have a fun conversation that I'm sure you all are going to love! Let me know your thoughts.

Truveris is a company that helps people save money and time with their Prescription drugs. As an example of the savings : people have spoken to them about how they have saved enough to pay rent. For anyone lucky enough to not have to deal with prescriptions, that's a big deal. They can get expensive fast!

They have Office 365, Delivery Controller, PVS, DC, etc all that typical stuff. They are a machine shop and the boss has his nephew as their intern, and he is so out of place in that environment it's negatively affecting their business. He has full access to all of the servers and any time there's an issue with anything, he goes in and starts rebooting random devices (2PM DC reboot anyone?) and has actually corrupted multiple PVD's to the point where we are rebuilding their entire environment (plus upgrades). He has some issues with his ego and likes to remind us that ""My boss thinks I'm doing a great job"" and gets incredibly defensive when we tell him to please do not reboot production servers without notifying us first at least. He also likes to uninstall the Solidworks licensing server to install his own version and suddenly everyone's Solidworks stops working. He demands that every time we VPN in or whatever into their environment that we do a remote screen sharing session, but the more he thinks he knows the more he goes in and ends up damaging something else. We insist on support contracts but ""he was handling it"" which meant no working/usable backups for up to 5 months.

So all this aside, how do you deal with a situation like this? I respect his desire to learn more, but he seriously needs to be hands off of this production environment as it is not for playing around and needs to stick to desktops first. I've tried to speak to them both (nephew and owner/boss) in terms like ""make sure you give us a call first so that we can look into it"", putting it very lightly that they shouldn't touch anything but the phone calls usually go in the form of a panicked call from him about ""I did something and now nobody can work fix it now!"". It's getting really old, plus with this new environment being installed we would really like to just keep this an ""intern free zone""."

I am a sophomore CS student at a small liberal arts school (not one of the crazy cool elite ones, just your average mid-level school). I am preparing for the process of finding internships and jobs for the summer after my junior year, and am faced with the daunting task of tossing resume, GitHub, and portfolio out there into the software dev blender. I am quite apprehensive about the process and am looking for guidance.

I know that a GitHub is crucial for displaying one's abilities as a programmer. I also know that it is a great space to show projects and contributions to open source. However, I am curious what the typical college student has on their GitHub. 

Is it common to have data structure implementations? Does it reflect poorly on me if I have half-baked projects that are still in the works on my account? Should the entire thing be more like a portfolio or a messy space to develop projects? Should I have two accounts -- one where I put up things that are done and polished which I send to possible employers and another where I put the riff-raff? 

As I'm sure you can see from the mess of questions above, I am in quite a tizzy over this whole thing, and any input would be much appreciated :-)"

On the other hand, I think more unique ECs like, say, making comics, designing a webtoon, making a botanical garden, writing an e-book on something like Arabian traditions, are wayyy cooler. If two applicants to, say, Yale, had identical profiles, with the exception of their ECs: 1- summer internship at Goldman Sachs and 2- having published a series of e-books on persian culture, which applicant is likely to be more impressive to the Admissions Officers?

Crap in pay, crap in training, you name it. In a selection of many jobs, these jobs are the most unbalanced by far because they possess very few redeeming qualities.

The reason these crap jobs exist is because these students don't know better and  don't have any other options. I want to give them more options.

There are things that many students do not know that they should, to serve as good judgment for applying to their first job out of college. For some, they discover a lot of warning and surprises from Reddit or similar places to this sub. But most people won't be getting that information. They will go into the real world very blind. Perhaps a junior level course on career development would help? Such a class will teach them about how to accurately set a business value to themselves (so they don't get ripped off on pay), job negotiation and how to identify red flags and pitfalls from job descriptions.

""hi i am with &lt;company&gt; and i see your in ECE! Well we got a few positions for you if you are..."" *reads resume and sees that im a sophomore* ""nm. We dont have anything for you but you can go on out website and search...""

The smaller companies may seem a little lack luster at first but they are more active in terms of different projects that they do. They will tell you EVERYTHING about what they do if you ask. And they communicate with many other companies which could be good if you wanna get your name out there. 

the more questions you ask, the more interested in you they will be, might give you their personal contacts, more likely to get some offers.

I thought the big private companies would be the best to look for but they seem to be the worst (from what i experienced). Not really interested in you, dont ask for resumes and just make you look at their website, only like you when you are interested in their products. They all left a bad taste in my mouth.

""We dont have a lot of ECE positions but we got IT (:"".... Yea i got a slightly alarming amount of those responses...

Company A called me with an offer, then immediately emailed me a written offer. They told me I had a week to respond, although the offer letter itself says 14 days. (Should I play stupid and follow the 14 days deadline?)

Meanwhile, Company B gave me a verbal offer and said I had ""time"" to think about the offer. HR was very kind on the phone and told me about the details in full (stipend, timing, pay, location, even offered to fly me out) They told me to take my time since it was a major decision and to call/email them if I was looking to accept the position. I emailed them on Friday asking for a written offer, but haven't received anything. I figure they do not want to waste time writing up a letter for someone to reject it, but the lack of a written offer in my hand concerns me.

When I was in high school in the early 2000s, I needed a summer job. A family friend was a lawyer at a large law firm (~1000 employees worldwide, ~600 in the office I was in), and told me about his law firm's intern program. I applied and got it. The other interns were college students and did law firm stuff. I was a computer nerd (among other kinds of nerd), so I interned in the IT department. I ended up doing this for three summers.

Initially I had a desk in the storage room and just did stuff internally in the department, like reimaging PCs that came in when a user got a new one or sorting through and organizing the mountains of old hardware in the storage room. When it became clear I wasn't a complete idiot, the help desk techs started sending me out when they had simple tickets that needed hands-on attention. Eventually I got a desk and a phone in the main help desk area and started answering calls. In retrospect, I got lucky, and the IT manager and help desk techs were all great, and it was a very positive experience.

Now, as I said, this was the early 2000s, so home PCs were common but not universal. Some of the lawyers were young or just interested and were competent computer users, but a whole bunch of them were old guys who went through school when typing was something that women did on typewriters and had absolutely no computer experience beyond having one plopped down on their desk at work. A lot of these guys used actual dictaphones to dictate documents and correspondence to their secretaries, and had their secretaries print out any and all documents and emails so they didn't have to read them on a screen. (This was also the era when Blackberries were on their own network and were basically pagers that sent and received emails. I spent a LOT of time dealing with Blackberries.)

One piece of necessary background information: when people moved offices (a frequent event: the firm was on multiple floors of a building and one or the other of the floors was always being renovated), facilities moved all the furniture, but IT moved the computers. This was generally done over the weekend to minimize disruption for the attorneys.

So anyway, one Monday morning, I answer the help desk phone, and there is an irate lawyer on the other end.

&gt;**$me:** Hello, this is the help desk, how can I help you?

&gt;**$angryLawyer:** When you moved my computer to my new office, you broke it!

&gt;**$me:** What seems to be the problem?

&gt;**$angryLawyer:** It won't turn on!

&gt;**$me:** Have you made sure everything is plugged in?

&gt;**$angryLawyer:** Of course! No matter how many times I push the power button, nothing happens!

I don't have anything going on, so I generate a ticket and tell $angryLawyer I'll head over to take a look.

I arrive at $angryLawyer's new office.

&gt;**$angryLawyer:** See? It won't turn on. *$angryLawyer repeatedly hits the power button... on his monitor.*

$angryLawyer had had a computer in his office for about three years... and had never once turned it off or had to turn it on.

I managed to explain the problem without falling down on the floor laughing, $angryLawyer had the good grace to be embarrassed and apologetic, and we went our separate ways."

85vvcu,6,2018-03-20,The Himalayan Thorny Orchid,QueenMacabre,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/85vvcu/the_himalayan_thorny_orchid/,"Any botanist would kill for a plant as rare as Himalayan Thorny Orchid, or at least that’s what the rumpled looking man in the dark suit assured the new curator of the Littleton Arboretum. Amy, a recent college grad, intently studied the plant, as if it could provide her with the answers to all her questions. The truth was that she had no idea what she was doing, and even less of an idea of what a Himalayan Thorny Orchid was.

Dr. Henry Green had been the previous head of the Littleton Arboretum. Amy had found herself suddenly promoted from intern to curator when the usually punctual Dr. Green had failed to reappear at work one morning. He’d been missing for a week, forcing the recent graduate to continue on with the daily routine of Arboretum. That included accepting and cataloging new plant samples.

Though it was unusual to receive plant donations in person, it was not so out of the norm as to evoke any suspicions in the girl. Amy was forced to accept the plant as it was thrust into her hands by the man in the suit. He seemed in a hurry to depart, and Amy was happy to oblige - he reeked of alcohol. She moved to set the plant down on her desk and turned to retrieve the cataloging paperwork. There were some questions to be asked in regards to the plant, and since Amy had never even heard of a Himalayan Thorny Orchid, she was determined to ask them.

Unfortunately, the man had other plans, as he was halfway out the door by the time she turned back around. Calling after the man yielded no response, so Amy resigned herself to an afternoon of research.

A quick Google search of “Himalayan Thorny Orchid” revealed no relevant results. Amy tried searching just for Himalayan Orchids, but the proffered image results yielded no matches. In fact, she was unable to locate any orchids that featured thorns.

The plant itself had the body of any other common orchid, a lean stem with flat ovoid leaves, but it seemed taller than it ought to be, measuring in at around two feet. Its discriminating feature was its absurdly long, and wickedly sharp purple thorns, which littered the stem of the plant.

The sleek inkiness of the thorns was so alluring that Amy found herself reaching out to touch one spindly beauty. She stroked the smooth curve of the thorn, noticing that the surface almost seemed wet to the touch. As she began to move her hand up and away, Amy felt a sudden sharp jab as the point of another thorn slid deep into the skin at the top of her hand.

With a cry, she pulled the foreign object from her body. The thorn had managed to penetrate a vein, and the wound produced a sizeable amount of blood. She trailed crimson drops as she made her way down the hall to the bathroom. They had some first aid supplies stocked there, and she hoped to find a bandage good enough to stem the bleeding.

She only made it a dozen steps when an odd heaviness began to overtake her. Her mouth had gone suddenly dry, and her head felt as if it were stuffed with cotton. Her limbs seem to transform into concrete slabs, and under their increased weight, she slowly sank to the floor. Her heartbeat slowed and then raced as if to catch back up.

Amy lay on her back on the tiled floor of the hallway. Her head was turned toward the end of the corridor, and her eyelids were only parted a fraction, but she still had enough faculties to hear the light tap of footsteps coming up behind her.

When next she came to she was being placed on a metal table. As the person placed her on the cold surface, her head flopped limply to the side. Through her parted lids she could just make out a figure on the metal slab across from hers. A hand, which bore a gaudy ruby signet ring on its pinky dangled down in lifeless fashion.

It was a hand she could recognize even in her semiconscious state. She had seen it tending to the Arboretum’s plants enough times to identify its owner - Dr. Green. Given the sallow pallor of his skin and the presence of the gaping cavity where his chest once was, Amy was confident her colleague had met an untimely death.

A set of hands grasped Amy’s head, placing it within a foam holding block. Now facing upwards, she was able to look into the eyes of her assailer. Though they were hidden behind a pair of large spectacles, the glass could not diminish the apparent glee that shown in their depths.

I am the owner of those spectacles. As I introduced myself to the girl on the table, so I will do the same for you. You may refer to me as Dr. Albert Adolf von Reuss. As a former member of the American Society of Plant Biologists (or the ASPB), it may come as no surprise that I hold multiple degrees in biology, genetics, and botany.

My passion has always been the hybridization of plants; my life’s goal to breed plants no one would ever think to combine – Asteraceae with Rosaceae or Cucurbitaceae with Begoniaceae. The ASPB thought me unworthy of their ranks, and my desire to create these mythic hybrids was mistaken for madness.

As a result, I was forced to venture out of my own. It can be hard to find patrons to support you when they do not comprehend the genius of your work. I could not acquire typical means of financial support, so as with my plant hybrids, I discovered a new way to gain funds.

The Atropa Vanda Monogyna, or as I like to refer to it, the Himalayan Thorny Orchid, proved to be the source of my salvation. This remarkable creation of mine combined the best parts of the Himalayan Orchids, Nightshade plants, and common Hawthorns. The result of this unique crossbreeding was a sleek, delicate stem that conveyed beauty, and a shield of thorns that warned against the plant’s more sinister nature.

You see, the thorns of the Himalayan Thorny Orchid are coated in a thin layer of the toxin Atropine – a trait inherited from its Nightshade ancestor. When enough Atropine is introduced into the bloodstream of a person, a kind of full motor paralysis is induced. The beauty of the Atropa Vanda Monogyna is that it houses just enough toxin to cause a person to fall into a heavy stupor, but not enough to lead to asphyxia or death. If allowed, in mere hours the toxin wears off, leaving the victim feeling a bit groggy and nauseous.

The toxicity levels are key, as it is imperative that the person is kept inert, but alive. After all, how can a person expect to make a sale on the black market, if the organs they harvest aren’t fresh? But I digress.

I explained much the same to dear Amy, as I began to cut into her skin with the scalpel, but I don’t think she was listening. Her eyes held a far off, glazed look, and her mouth twitched just a bit, as I made my way toward her insides. Such a pity, really, no one appreciates all the effort I go through.

She managed a few slight moans and even a rogue tear, remarkable really, since the paralysis was in full swing. I shushed her, and offered her reassurances – none of her body would go to waste. Someone somewhere would be getting new organs, while a university would be getting a new skeleton for their biology department. Even her blood wouldn’t go to waste.

This last gift was already in the process of being used, for as the blood began to flow from Amy’s body, it ran in rivulets down the grooves in the table. The fluid was directed to a funnel, which hovered above the potted Himalayan Thorny Orchid. A soft plink, plink sounded as each drop of blood darkened the soil in the pot.

The orchid, having been well fed in recent weeks, was in the beginning stages of blooming. Its bud had opened enough to reveal a few petals, which were bright and shiny, and the deepest of reds."

So I'll be starting my first internship as a software engineer this summer, and the hiring manager said the dress code was casual (as in people wore jeans and a t-shirt). This seems pretty standard for tech jobs, but I'm not too keen on wearing jeans/longer pants during the summer since I'll be working in Chicago and it can get pretty hot. I'm a girl, and I feel like wearing shorts would be a little inappropriate since they can get to be too short. From other people's experiences, what do girls seem to wear? Skirts? Dresses? Or do they stick to jeans anyways? Thanks! "
85vy34,1,2018-03-20,Federal Pell Grant,lemonsnatcher,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/85vy34/federal_pell_grant/,"I recently received a summary of my financial aid offer for the 2018-2019 school year.

Compared to the previous 2017-2018 school year, I am receiving about $3000 less in Federal Pell Grant. This means I will have to pay that $3000 to cover the rest of my school's tuition.

This is due to how much I made during the summer of 2016 for an internship (my student Effective Family Contribution went up while my parents' EFC stayed the same).

Is there any way to increase my aid amount seeing how it was just a temporary summer internship?

85wgm3,4,2018-03-20,The Man In My Dreams,lucifers_booty_fur,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/85wgm3/the_man_in_my_dreams/,"My name is Anne. I’m 26 years old and I suffer from chronic insomnia. I haven’t gotten more than an hour of sleep per night since I was 14 years old. 
I’ve tried everything you can think of, and probably many more things that you can’t. Melatonin, weird ginger root cocktails, Benadryl, sleeping pills, rigorous exercise, supposedly ergonomic pillows – all of it just adds to my misery and makes my thinking even fuzzier, but none of it actually helps me sleep more. I had some tranquilizers which worked for my briefly, and that was one of the best weeks of my life. But even those quickly stopped working, and not one doctor has a clue as to why.

I’ve spent almost all of my money on specialists and research facilities to treat this problem, and now it feels like there’s nothing left for me to do but suffer. You’d think that my body would be used to it by now, but that just isn’t the case. I’m not just mentally at the end of my rope – my body is wearing down.
I’m 5’7” and only about 112 pounds. I have deep, dark bags under my eyes which are likely permanent. I get sick incredibly easily and I’ve had pneumonia three times in the past two years. I’ve had to start shaving my head because I’ve lost most of my hair. I haven’t had a period in about ten years, and doctors have told me that I’m infertile.

I’m rambling, and I’m sorry. The point is, I’m miserable, and I want things to be the way that they were when I was fourteen.  

See, when I first entered high school, I became fascinated with lucid dreaming. During the day, I was a nobody. I had no friends. C’s in every class. Teachers would routinely forget my name even after they had known me for months.  Life sucked. But in my dreams, I could be anyone. I could be the Flower Queen of Tulasia. I could be a superhero. I could be a beautiful, popular version of myself. 
I found that controlling my dreams was addicting, and I soon became good enough at it that it was like I was living two lives. I would look forward to going to sleep, because that’s when the *real* me was able to come out.
And for perhaps six months, I lived the most beautiful of lives in my dreams. I had everything I could have wanted. It was my home, and it was as real to me as the device you’re reading this story on.

In a way, the authenticity of my sleep life has remained constant. It still feels as though my sleeping hours are the real ones. But the happiness and joy associated with these dreams have long since passed.

I distinctly remember the particular adventure I was having when everything changed. I was walking through caves made of glistening crystal, with furry white butterflies fluttering above me and friendly, six-legged bunnies at my feet. The crystals gave off bluish glows and a faint tinkling sound, each of them uniquely beautiful and holding mysteries just waiting to be uncovered. 
I traveled deeper and deeper into the cave, and as I walked I began to feel a bit ill at ease. The feeling was a strange one – it’s like when you’re in the car and suddenly you realize that the radio has stopped playing, and there’s this strange stillness that you can’t help but notice.

For perhaps half an hour I couldn’t put my finger on it, though eventually of course I realized. The twinkling sounds had stopped. The butterflies above me had all vanished, and the rabbits seemed skittish. They began to whimper and squeal, and then I heard the echo of footsteps from behind me. The bunnies scattered, each running into a different corridor or passage within the cave, and I was left completely alone. 

The caves, which an hour ago had been a beautiful respite, now felt more like a sinister labyrinth. I was afraid, and in my fear it was like my control over the dream had vanished. Whereas before I could have simply willed the walls to melt away, or summoned a valiant creature to fight by my side, I could now do nothing but shiver in the still, nippy air as the sounds grew closer.

And then I saw him. It was simultaneously a man, and very clearly something inhuman. While it was bipedal and had the shape and size of a man, something was *off* about it. I couldn’t tell you exactly what. At times I’ve thought maybe its head was too large for its body, or its mouth moved slightly after the sounds started coming out of it. Or perhaps that its eyes were devoid of any emotion or intelligence. But the truth is that there was this indescribable ‘uncanny valley’ sort of feeling about it. 

As I stood there transfixed in my horror, trying to figure out exactly what about it made him so unsettling to me, he pointed at me and screamed a strange, inhuman scream and began to run toward me. It was like every nightmare where you’re being chased and all you can do is walk in slow motion. I turned, painfully slowly, and tried to flee. But it was in vain. He caught me, and shrieking sounds I’d never heard before, he hit my face again and again until I lost consciousness.

I woke up in a cold sweat, and deep down I knew that my wonderful dreamscape would never be the same. And it wasn’t. That was the last night that I ever got more than an hour of sleep.

I no longer have control over my dreams. They remain hyper-realistic. I can feel everything and have experienced torture too horrible to describe. Sometimes I’ll be tormented with a beautiful dream which turns sour, as did my first experience with this thing. Others, I’ll be in a horrifying place the moment I fall asleep. I’ve ‘woken’ to find myself in a slaughterhouse, an abandoned sanitorium, in hell itself. Always I’m being chased or hunted, and I’ve never won. I’ve never woken from a dream unless I’ve been tortured or beaten to death. And once I wake from them, I never fall back to sleep. I just can’t. The terror is too real.

I’ve explained all of this to every medical professional I could. The day before last Thanksgiving, my final hope of a medical explanation vanished when a dream specialist told me that he has no idea why I’m having these nightmares, why I’m not able to fall back to sleep, or why strong sleeping aids haven’t helped me.

Stripped of professional help, I started looking into other options. Metaphysical ones. I’ve never been a religious or spiritual person, but when every single medical possibility has been eliminated, sometimes you turn to these sources out of desperation. In my case, I suppose it was just something to do – chasing something is better than standing still, even if deep down you believe you’re just chasing the wind.

To my shock, though, I did find an answer. One which at the very least seemed to indicate that other people had suffered as I have. From what I could tell, people across multiple cultures, from almost every time period, have described a race of entities that haunted them in their sleep. In English, their name usually translates to something like Dream Dweller, Sleep Stealer, Night Haunter, etc. Granted, the idea that you’re visited in your sleep by demons or other evil spirits isn’t exactly groundbreaking or unheard. But the description of these particular spirits resonated with me. They are believed to live within your dreams and drive you out of them so that they can live there undisturbed. People tormented by these beings are universally described as being deprived of sleep until they either die or reach a point of madness and despair.

I felt a sort of numbness as I read more and more accounts of these spirits. Of people being driven loony, until they either snap and go on a killing spree, or end up being restrained and avoided, or even simply dying from exhaustion. It was a strange mix of helplessness and relief that I felt. Helplessness at the seeming certainty of my demise, and relief that somebody had finally offered me an explanation as to my predicament. But the story doesn’t end here. 

I spent hundreds of hours of searching for some solution to my problem. I talked with ‘experts’ on the paranormal who had nothing more to offer than the medical interns who uselessly took my temperature and asked me to fill out mental health questionnaires. I reached dead end after dead end on the internet. But eventually I found my silver bullet – a website which didn’t look like it’d been updated from the 90’s. It was a hastily designed promotional site for an obscure book on dreams, written by an author who has been almost universally derided as a crackpot. He simply went by the initials J.L.

His book is called “Dreams and Nightmares – What Our Ancestors Knew”. I’m currently holding one of only three copies that have ever been published, and it’s little more than a fat journal with hastily transcribed notes.
He describes much of what I’ve told you – the various cultures who have encountered these creatures, and the records of people suffering under them. But his work goes deeper. I thought it was ridiculous at first, but now I believe him.

It’s said that when you’re weak enough, the creature will begin to show its true nature to you, driving you completely insane and banishing you from sleep forever. You remember how I said that there was something – uncanny – about it, and how I couldn’t place it? I didn’t understand it at the time, or even as I was reading this book. But two weeks ago, it showed me. It lifted me off of my feet and looked me directly in the eye, then and it was as though something clicked into place. I understood why it looked so inhuman, and I’m more afraid than ever now. That night, I woke up after screaming myself hoarse.
Since that night, it’s revealed a little bit more to me in every dream, and I know that there’s very little left for me to see before I go crazy. I believe that the next time I go to sleep, it will fully reveal its true face to me, and I’ll never sleep again. 

There’s a single scrap of hope for me, and I’m holding onto it as tightly as I can. I’ve seen things that no human was supposed to see. I’ve drawn its face as it was revealed to me. It helps me, almost. As if drawing it gets it out of my head, if only for a moment. Like blowing your nose when you have a nasty cold.

I’m no artist, but even in the elementary representation I’ve managed, something about this picture is just – you don’t get over it easily. The final chapter of J.L.’s book about dreams is crux of my hope. It’s been said that if another person looks at a representation of this entity, it’s like they take a share of the burden, and the entity will jump from one person’s dreams to the other’s, the two of them suffering on alternate nights.  J.L. outlines a few instances where entire villages have exposed themselves to a depiction of it in order to save the sufferer from insanity.

The only catch is that the picture must be viewed willingly. And that brings me to why I’ve posted here, Reddit. I’m asking you – begging you – to allow me to share this with you. If just 20 of you agree, we’ll all have just 1 nightmare every few weeks, and I’ll be able to regain my health and body. If this is a good-sized post and a few hundred of you agree, then we’ll all just have one extra nightmare per year. 

I don’t know who else to talk to about this. I can’t ask my mother. I don’t have friends, and to be honest I wouldn’t want to subject them to this. 

I’ve snapped a photo of my drawing and uploaded it. There’s nothing more that I can say. You’d be saving my life and I’d owe you forever. If you do this, you’re an amazing person. I ask only that you think on it carefully, and decide quickly.

A Level design job opportunity has presented itself recently, where I live, and I've been considering applying for it. There aren't many games dev / design job opportunities where I live, so it's a rare opportunity.

Is there much leeway within a games company for a level designer to be able to move into a games programmer position, or would they be confined specifically to design positions? I have a degree in computer science and have a few months work experience as a games dev intern.

Long-term, I'd like to move out into development. Would taking a job in level design be a mistake? Would it limit my career opportunities in games / software development for the future?"

In the time since then, I applied to (company b), not even thinking I had a 1% chance. Well long story short I ended up getting an offer from that company too, which I accepted.

I intend on informing company A that I will be “reneging” on my offer, but I want to wait until I’m through the bureaucratic portion of the hiring process at company B (background check, employment verification, etc.) before I make that awkward phone call, just in case.

The reason I am making this post is because I am worried that during this overlap period the two could find out the other offer, and I will end up jobless after graduation. The employment verification specifically has me worried, as I put ""do not contact"" on my intern manager from company a, and provided pay stubs instead.

Would company B pull my offer if they found out I already accepted a position at company A, even though I prefer and intend to be at company B? Does anyone have any advice or experience with this type of situation?

85wrfp,3,2018-03-20,Internship dilemma...which course of action should I take?,prettyuncertain,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/85wrfp/internship_dilemmawhich_course_of_action_should_i/,"Hi everyone!

So I'm in a bit of a pickle in terms of what I should do about my internship this summer. Sorry for the wall of text...here's the situation:

I interned at a company (Company X) last summer. I didn't quite enjoy the work as it was a lot of desk work and not as much interaction with those we were working with as much as I wanted. I think the company knew, though, and tried to make it more interesting by allowing me to sit in on conference calls, meet with team members, access pretty important documents, etc. I really enjoyed the people and the culture, though. I got along with mostly everyone, and the company really welcomed me with open arms. I technically have an offer from them for this summer, because my supervisor reached out to me at the end of my internship (and between last summer and now) to let me know that they would love to have me back this summer. The nice thing about this internship was that it wasn't too far from home (so I could drive home every weekend if I wanted to), but still far enough where I had to live on my own and commute (adulting!)

That said, I'm not sure if I want to limit myself by staying with this company. I applied to about 10 other companies this week and have yet to hear back (it's only been about one or two days since I submitted my applications). The work sounds more interesting and engaging than what I did at Company X, which is why I'm drawn to these other internships. However, many of them are pretty far from home (6+ hours, some out-of-state). While I wouldn't necessarily mind the distance, it is pretty scary to think I wouldn't have that option of going home when I want to. Additionally, some of the internships are either unpaid or only part-time, whereas ideally I'd like a full-time, paid internship (which I would have at Company X).

Now...the dilemma. Company X posted an advertisement yesterday looking for interns this upcoming summer. I haven't yet followed up with the technical offer from them. I'm not sure what to do! I don't want to burn any bridges by contacting my previous supervisor, tentatively taking on the internship, but then later backtracking and declining the internship for another one.

Should I wait for these other companies to get back to me and move forward with that process in hopes that I'll land one of those internships? Or should I just play it safe and ensure that I even have an internship this summer by going back to Company X?

To recap:

Pros of Company X - I know I like the company/culture, it's a good distance from home, it's paid and full-time, could build my network and work there post-graduation

Cons of Company X - the work wasn't as exciting as I would have hoped

Pros of other internships - work seems more exciting, could expand my network

Cons of other internships - I may not even get them (leaving me with nothing for this summer!), I may not like the culture, I may not get along with the people, I may have to be super far from home, it may not be paid/full-time

Any advice on what I should do? After typing this out, it looks like the pros heavily outweigh the cons to go back to Company X...but I'm not sure. Any advice? What would you do? Thank you in advance for your insight!"

85yaz3,0,2018-03-20,Should I accept this internship offer?,jl9612,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85yaz3/should_i_accept_this_internship_offer/,"Hi all,

After months of interviewing and being rejected by companies, I've finally got an offer from a local startup for a front-end engineer internship. The interviewers seemed really nice over video chat and this company has a high review score on Glassdoor which tells me that they have a pretty great culture. I'm also very interested in learning and working with their tech stack.

I'm currently a sophomore in college. Although not doing an internship this summer wouldn't mean the end of the world for me, I'd really love to gain experience which could potentially help a lot in my job search during the next internship season. I also don't have any pressing financial issues, I have support from my parents even if I end up not having any internship or job this summer. 

With that said, there are a few concerns if I accept this offer:

1. The compensation from the recruiter's oral offer is a bit too humble compared to the average salary that software/frontend interns make in the Bay Area. Given that they're a startup, it's generally expected that startups would offer much higher compensations to attract good talent in this area known for uber-competitiveness in tech talent and recruitment (correct me if I'm wrong about the market these days). And I’ll have to relocate. They don't offer housing subsidies or any kind of benefits for interns. The only perk is catered lunch a few days per week.

2. Negotiation would be tricky because I don't currently have other offers on the table now. I could potentially try to negotiate for some benefits but from what the recruiter has told me the likelihood of getting anything out of a negotiation is extremely low (when I was on the phone with the recruiter and I brought up compensation/benefits, he sounded impatient and kept cutting me off and saying that they don't offer benefits to interns. I considered that as a red flag). 

3. This company only gave me until the end of this week to make a decision. Intern recruitment has just begun at many other companies and there will potentially be many more opportunities for me even at this time. In fact, I just got an email from Unity for a phone screen today. The catch-22 situation I'm trying to avoid now is: accepting this offer now, getting another offer with a more respectable company and much better package and regretting about this acceptance. 

TL;DR - I got an offer from a startup in the Bay Area (not local) but I felt the compensation is too low. Should I accept this offer or keep interviewing until the end?

Thanks!

P.S. Would I be better off doing an internship or taking classes and try to graduate early this summer?"

I know a lot of people who are trying to graduate early so they can start working early so instead of doing an internship in the summer they take classes. But then the issue comes when they graduate they have no work experience and they cannot get a job because entry level positions usually say 1 to 2 years work experience. I did 3 internships and I feel that I learned more from them than any class in college. What are you thoughts and do you think I am wrong? If you do please tell me why! Thank You.
85yicw,2,2018-03-20,Do I follow opportunity or passion?,ApatheticImprovement,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/85yicw/do_i_follow_opportunity_or_passion/,"Hey everyone.

I have a great opportunity. I can get an apprenticeship (internship might be the US term?) for a prestigious company doing software engineering. They would pay for my university degree (£9k/year or roughly $12.6k/year, for 4 years), but I'd have to do Computer Science. I'd receive training, and I'd be at uni 2 days a week while working 3 days a week. Then I'd have to fit studying at home on evenings and weekends, and I'm also doing my own small printing business. The pay starts at £15k/year ($21k) and by year 4 it is £25k/year ($35k). Nobody I know will be able to make this sort of money in my small town while attending uni, while being debt free. It's also a guaranteed job afterwards. I'm not sure if I'd like it, and I'm currently studying IT and it's okay. 

I do however have a passion for psychology and many related fields. I want to help others. I want to be a counsellor, perhaps an ADHD specialist. I want to look into pharmaceuticals and if I feel capable of doing so, pursue neuroscience. I want to research and read and write about it. I love talking about it, doing experiments, reading up on news and have done for years. It's the only thing I can confidently say I have a long-term interest in. From lifestyle to diet to happiness and motivation to sleep to learning to mental health - I love it all.

If I take the job, it will kickstart an amazing career opportunity. Software engineers will be in high demand and I can imagine working for this company would look forever impressive on my resume. I'll also get a lot of money and some invaluable skills. I have to study Computer Science with it though, and I'm not entirely sure it wouldn't be 4 years of regret and hell.

Do I accept the offer or do I pursue Psychology? My mind is mostly made up, but I want outside perspective. Thanks."

I was under the impression that I'd finally start coding and doing REAL projects and actually learning by having a mentor or something make sure I learned and understood what he/she was doing; I did not get that. The entire six months consisted of me doing basic web page performance test, data entry, and occasional ""strictly do this, but we will not explain why"" coding involving java script, which I did not learn anything from. Essentially, I learned what I didn't know, but did not learn how to do anything. I've been applying like crazy to all entry level/junior developer opportunities including places where other interns got hired to no avail. I'm now training to become a firefighter to at least have some kind of cash flow but I'm simply wondering if anyone else has had this kind of struggle before and what do you recommend I do to get out of it?

To show you how bad it is, there are 2 pre-requisites before taking the first useful programming class: A semester learning Microsoft office applications, then after that, a semester learning QBasic, and then finally, Intro to Java. So the students here are basically behind a year already in comparison to other schools.

Anyway, I have been studying on my own for a bit over 6 months, learning Python and web dev with nodejs and I feel that I may have the necessary skill by next year to intern. However, whenever I bring the topic of internships to my senile professors they always reply ""There is an internship class in your 4th year"" and this probably meant that I'm only going to get a semester worth of experience. The professors here are probably not aware of most jobs requiring 2 years of experience and stick to their decades-old curriculum.

Programmer jobs are very few in this island, and I feel that I need to move to another school to get an internship. There are probably some freelance web dev jobs available but I'm not sure if it's something I can put on a resume. What should I do, stick with this school for 4 years (cheap) or transfer to the states, hopefully with some jobs? "

I changed my major to food science (originally undecided) at the end of my sophomore year. Most of my summer breaks were spent taking classes in order to catch up and graduate on time, so I haven’t had any industry internships yet. I’ve been applying to both internships and full time jobs since the beginning of the school year; I’ve had some phone interviews for product development and technical sales, but otherwise I keep sending out applications, reviewing my resume/cover letter, and haven’t had any luck yet.

This year, I also wanted to get some more research experience, so I started working in one of my professor’s research lab for food microbiology, and I really love what I’ve learned so far. I asked my professor if my university offers research opportunities to students who have graduated, and he offered me an opportunity to intern at his lab for the summer and is also willing to pay a stipend to help with housing arrangements.

I’m super excited for the opportunity, since this is a lab that I am seriously considering to apply to for graduate school in the future; but I’m also really nervous about failing because my professor will use the internship to see if I fit as a potential graduate student; and I feel like I still have a lot to learn with the background material, since his research uses more biology and biochemistry lab techniques/concepts that my food science classes haven’t really gone over.

I also know for my major in particular, getting industry experience is really important, especially when it comes to finding full time jobs, and I’m honestly interested in every aspect of the field (e.g. product development, sensory, food safety, etc.). I’m also pretty sure my parents prefer me to go back home to find work in industry, so I’m wondering which one would be better to pursue?

Tl;dr: Undergrad food science student, and will be graduating in May. I’m currently applying to full time jobs and summer internships. My food microbiology professor also offered me a chance to work as a summer intern in his research lab, but I’m scared that I am going to fail and have a lot of catch up work to do if I want to make progress. Between the two options, which one would be better to continue pursuing?

I haven't decided my major because I have no clue what to do. I do know that political science really wasn't for me after taking some intro classes, and I'd really like to get into computer science somehow (maybe learning coding?). 

For now, the one thing I feel like I have to do is find a part time job or paid internship, at least SOMETHING since I haven't told my parents yet about this situation of me dropping classes. I'm working on my resume right now, but there's hardly anything on it except for my volunteer work in high school, one part time job at my dad's office as a courier, and my clubs from high school. 

I was thinking of applying to jobs at grocery stores since I don't really have a focus yet in college, but someone mentioned that even landing a job there would be difficult too.

The issue is my GPA.

I've struggled with clinical depression for a long time and have refused help due to... a few reasons, but recently I've finally started on the lexapro track, and I'm feeling significantly better. I'm going abroad for one of my two last semesters in college, but my GPA is... abysmal. Will I graduate? Absolutely.

But my GPA will be a C+, most likely, at best.

I'm really freaking out. I don't even know how the transition from college to professional career in CS works yet, no job searching has occurred, and I'm not doing an internship this summer (low GPA keeping me away from it, plus a few summer courses).

Can anyone offer me some advice in trying times? Anything would help a lot. I'm not reaching for job ideas or whatnot, I just want to hear about getting a job in this field, how much your GPA really affects it, and what going from college to a job feels like.

Before actually attending, however, after far more red flags than should have been necessary I spent about 5 seconds googling to find that the company is a fairly unscrupulous organization whose employees often feel taken advantage of. Basically it's an example of one of many mutations of a pyramid scheme/MLM company that lets it technically remain legal(apparently).

I also know that the Orlando area has great internships available and that UCF partners with companies like Lockheed Martin. I definitely want to do internships over the summer as soon as I can.

UF also apparently tried to eliminate their CS department a few years ago which is not a good sign as far as how seriously the university take it. I don’t know if UF would be the better choice though because they are ranked higher and have more general prestige.

866kef,2,2018-03-21,What is a reasonable weekly budget for a university student?,nottheexpert836,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/866kef/what_is_a_reasonable_weekly_budget_for_a/,"Hi all!

So I’m a University student in Quebec (relevant because our education is super cheap). I’ve recently realized that as much as I try to stick to a budget, or track my spending with something like a bullet journal, I always give up after a few days because those quick, “tap” credit/debit card purchases add up so fast. 

To resolve this and hold myself accountable, I want to start withdrawing cash at the beginning of each week and only using that. I don’t want to set an unattainable budget, though, and end up giving up after the first week. 

Relevant info: 

- I’m a full time student
- I work an internship that pays me about 700$/month
- I get a bursary of 400$/month during the school year
- My tuition and books are paid in full by my bursary
- I live at home
- I don’t have a car
- as of May I will be working at my internship full time, making about 2,500$/month

- My monthy expenses are:
        - 110$ (phone)
        - 70$ (gym)
        - 110$ (public transit pass)
        - 40$ (assorted: netflix, apple music, adobe, etc)

Total expenses: 330$/month
Total income: 1,100$/month

I am planning on moving out for the next school year, as I’ll be starting law school. At that point I also may not receive my bursary for monthy expenses nor tuition, so I really need to save right now. I expect my rent to be roughly 800$ all in, plus another 100$ in groceries (at least). 

So: what should my weekly limit be for food, drinks, activities, etc?

Thank you all so much!"

Does anyone know of any summer research positions available for someone in my position? It seems like everything offered CS wise that I could find is either 1) an REU for undergraduates, or 2) a position looking for PhD students. I can't apply to the former, and the latter I applied to a few but didn't have the background to be selected.

I would prefer to apply to something more structured. I know it is a bit late in the year for summer positions -- is my only option emailing professors to see if they have anything available?

I am especially interested in NLP work. If someone has some resources or leads I would appreciate it! I have been doing software engineering internships my past summers, but have decided to go the academic route this summer."

Back in my first year of college I approached a big pharma looking for CS kids to run their data (my degree is specifically in Data Science). I wasn't expecting much, said hi. Asked about the internship on the brochure and what the pharma does with CS when all of a sudden another recruiter interjects. She becomes very enthusiastic about wanting to hire me. ""Are you willing to hire a freshman?"" ""Oh yes we'd love to have talent early."" Goes on to talk about the opportunities and scholarship -- asked me to help out with the scholarship talk (which I thought was incredbily weird). Said I was a great addition to the team with my enthusiasm, was impressed with my resume and that I had a business card ready. Gave that all to them and never heard back. I found every way to get in contact with them again - unfortunately after awhile the receptionist became rude towards me when I called to ask for her. Always wondered why they promised so much and never got back to me. Anyone have any idea about why?"

I am currently a Masters Student, and i have two offers for my summer internship : one is PwC data scientist and the other is Goldman Sachs Tech intern. 

The point of contention basically is that my degree is entirely focused on ML. Goldman's tech role doesn't ensure me an ML oriented project, whereas, in PwC I know that I'll be working on a direct application of Machine Learning (NLP in particular). 

The next thing is the difference in compensation. PwC is offering me half of what Goldman is giving, without any relocation or housing. 

It'll be great if someone with experience could help me figure out the pros and cons of the two. 

Thanks!"
867lcr,2,2018-03-21,Class of 2022: College Selection Help for Pre-med Student,rodorbybod,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/867lcr/class_of_2022_college_selection_help_for_premed/,"Hey reddit! I'm having a hard time deciding between three choices: UT Dallas, UT Austin's CAP Program, and Baylor. I am looking to graduate with a BS degree in Biochemistry and I want to take an in-depth look at each school's biology, chemistry, and physics academics. I am pre-med and hope to achieve a 3.9+ GPA and a high MCAT score with the support of my professors and advisers. For the purpose of this post, I want to narrow my search down to three main points: Academics, Cost, and Social (this includes peers, professors, and advisers). The ideal school would be cheap, great science professors (well-educated &amp; friendly), small class sizes, higher female undergraduate ratio, ethnically diverse, good national reputation, non-religion affiliated, and LGBT friendly. I do not care about: location (but can affect cost if out of Texas), party/night life, close to home, school size.

- Baylor: 
* ACADEMICS: Great! Baylor is known for its excellent pre-health programs and advising. They have pre-health coursework that I am interested in. They also ensure pre-med undergraduates are exposed to internships, workshops, and more. 75% of students with a 3.3 science GPA or higher (and have gone through the committee process) are accepted into medical school. (1)
* COST: Expensive. I have received a $64,000 scholarship from this school. The predicted cost of attendance comes to $47,220 per school year.
* SOCIAL: Average undergrad class size is 27. 51.7% of classes have less than 20 students. Their undergraduate student body is approximately 60% female. Their students and faculty are the nicest people I have ever met on a college tour. This school is a private Christian school (I am non-religious) and requires religious classes and Chapel. Thus, the school does not allow LGBT clubs to be formed (I am part of the LGBT community). It is also predominantly white while minority ethnicities make up 34.4% (I am Chinese). I may be accepted into the Honors College or pre-health Living &amp; Learning Commons.

- UTD:
* ACADEMICS: Decent. Less pre-health advising compared to Baylor, but they do have the Health Professions Advising Center. 49% of “average” students (38% - percentage of students in that category) are admitted into medical school, while 90% of “strong” applicants (41%) are admitted. Many opportunities to participate in research (biomedical, engineering), “free science tutoring,” health professions preparation process (application reviews, practice interviews). Medical admission with advising: ~60%. Medical admission without advising: ~35%. 
* COST: Decent. $28,360 raw predicted cost of attendance. I am still awaiting scholarship responses. Possible $3,000 scholarship, very slight chance for full-tuition scholarship.
* SOCIAL: 43% female undergrads. Highly diverse: 30% Anglo, 23% Asian.  All professors in my science courses are well-educated (PhD) (2). According to informal student testimonies, most of them are non-exceptional but helpful. Lab professors are not memorable. UTD advising is said to be subpar because they are “pretty bad about following through so get everything in writing or email.” LGBT friendly. The school is pretty much a school of nerds. Everyone has a nerdy interest and I feel like I would fit in here. I do have some concerns about UTD’s lack of funds in certain programs like JAMP and UT-PACT. Applying to Pre-health LLC and I hope I will get a spot. Applying for Collegium V honors.
- UT's CAP:
* UT is the dream school for many. If I had been given freshman admission, I would have accepted immediately and not even bother researching other schools. Nobel peace prize awarded to professors and alumni, I expect their general science education would be top notch (I have not extensively researched this so correct me if I’m wrong.). “The total acceptance rate for Longhorn pre-med students for entry year 2015 was 54%. Average Cumulative GPA for Accepted Longhorns 3.73. Average MCAT score for Accepted Longhorns: 31.11.” (3) Excellent reputation nationally. I do not even need to go into the social aspect of this school.
* I could apply to any of their CAP schools and be automatically admitted. UTA, UTT, UTRGV, etc. I would first have to decide which CAP school is right for me.
* CAP only offers automatic admission to UT’s Liberal Arts College. I do not know if it will be more difficult or easier to get into their Natural Science College after completing CAP in comparison to regular application.
* I am sure I will be able to receive scholarships from the CAP schools but I do not expect any scholarships from UT. UT's cost of attendance is lower than UTD's.

Sorry for the long post, I felt like all this information needed to be included. I appreciate any additional information about each school’s pre-health programs. I could apply to other schools even this late in the application season. Just not sure what to do.

I have not cited statistics that are easy to find.

I joined so I can be able to pay for my CS degree but is highly encouraged here to get as much schooling done as possible while you are in the military because it is completely free (assuming you pass).

I only have so much time during the evening to take classes and learn programming at the same time but I do know I want to do both. My plan as of right now is to learn as much as I can while I am in the Air Force so I can atleast start applying for internships when I get out and use my gi bill as a civilian.

On an related note, some of my coworkers telling me not to separate until I finish my degree feels like a way to for them to keep me in until I have no choice to do 20 years. Which feels kind of cultish and is one of the reason why I want to get out as soon as possible. I just want to be prepared when that time comes."

I am just about to finish my freshman year as a ME student. I know that its really difficult to get any internships this early in my education, but i was offered a position from a former graduate from my university. He is starting a new robotics company and is looking for an intern. He said he would have me do a bit of solidworks drawings and try to learn a bit of the financial aspects of the company. Also, if i have the time, we will work together on building the business. However, this would have to be an unpaid internship at least until the business can make profits. I can choose my own hours and i only have to work a minimum of at least 5 hours a week. He said that he understands if i want to quit anytime, but he said that if i stayed until graduation and did a decent job, he would look into making me a partner. Right now, there is only one other employee who is also a former graduate.

I just dont know about this. It sounds good, but i know people here say to never take an unpaid internship.

Does this sound like a good opportunity?

868g5y,15,2018-03-21,UC Santa Cruz Waitlist Appeal Letter,loottery,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/868g5y/uc_santa_cruz_waitlist_appeal_letter/,"**I am sorry for everyone whom I told UC Santa Cruz does not allow Letters of Intent/appeals for waitlisted applicants. They do. /u/admissionsmom told me so, and when has she been wrong?**

I will definitely follow /u/admissionsmom's guide on how to write a good letter of intent.

However, I had a few questions:

* Can I attach recommendation letters to my email to them? If so, how many? (I have 3 I'd like to send). Their FAQ page (https://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/waitlist-student-faq.html) said nothing about not sending recommendation letters. According to this website: https://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/appeals.html#denyfrosh we can send recommendations with our letter of intent. However, I am not sure if it applies to only those who were straight out rejected or even those waitlisted like me. **I am sure my recommendation letters (I have 3 good ones) can really say a lot of good things about me and highlight my academic qualities. Especially since my GPA is on the lower end, my teachers can really highlight my improvement throughout the course of the school year and in general throughout high school. The letter of recommendation from my manager at my internship, on the other hand, will show my competence in my intended major - computer science/game design.**

* Would simply saying that UC Santa Cruz is my top choice, citing professors and courses I am interested in, as well as research opportunities I am interested in suffice? I will also say that I am looking for internship opportunities related to my major this summer. And of course, if they allow it, I will attach my recommendation letters. I might even attach a copy of my resume with online computer science course certificates. 


I am just really stressed out. UC Santa Cruz is my dream school and I **really** want to go there. While some of these questions may seem stupid, I'd rather be safe than sorry, because I'm basically in love with this university right now.

(P.S. for those of you in the same boat as me, I will make a poll after UC Berkeley decisions are out asking all the UC Santa Cruz acceptees if they will actually attend UCSC in the fall. While /r/a2c and college confidential isn't representative of the entire student body, at least it will help us calm our nerves a bit.)

Go Banana Slugs!

EDIT: Also, do I need to snail mail the appeal? 

According to this: https://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/appeals.html#denyfrosh

only appeals of denial and admissions cancellations can be emailed.

Everything else must be mailed. 

This is all so confusing, but I want to do it, because I **want** to go to UC Santa Cruz. Badly. Very badly.

Here is a breakdown of the differences that I typed up: https://i.imgur.com/WtntcB7.png

In summary, the main differences are that the newer model has a better GPU, screen, SSD and USB Type C x1, while the older model has a better CPU, RAM, battery, has a HDD and longer battery life, as well as being $90 cheaper.

I am leaning towards the older model (7567), but I was looking for some informed opinions on which one is better value for light to medium gaming (fortnite, overwatch, rocket league, etc) and working while at an internship abroad.

Thanks very much in advance for any input.

P.S I know laptop discussion is not common here but I have already posted in /r/SuggestALaptop and I havent gotten much feedback."

I may be only 17 an not in college yet, BUT I’m working on developing my 5 year plan and where I want to go with my career. For now, I applied for a program that matches stem students with internships and I decided to apply for finance roles. I’m hesitant on whether or not I’ll actually get it, but that’s beside my point. I don’t want to just be another minority woman they hire just to meet their quota. Granted, no matter what male dominated field I go into, I’ll run into a similar issue. But with finance, this is the frat guy career path as I like to call it. Meaning, if you’re a white male, you’re given all the luxury and advantages even if you’re mediocre or do the bare minimum.

So if anyone has advice or know of someone I can ask questions to to gain advice or insight, that would be great. I don’t want to put in so much hard work and time to be met with “easy” work. I want to know what I must do and how to prepare to fight my way to the top seeing that I have to put in double the work. Thanks in advance."

869f0e,592,2018-03-22,On the Shoulders of Giants,ThePinkWombat,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/869f0e/on_the_shoulders_of_giants/,"“Okay, kids, so who knows what the Humans are famous for?” Asked Darryl Hendricks, a tour guide at the Communium Institution’s *Human Spaceflight Museum at the Surface of Earth’s Moon*. The Communium Institution wasn’t known for giving its museums the most streamlined names. He looked around at all of the little alien faces while they thought real quick. One hand shot up in the air. “You in the back, uhh…” He squinted to see the nametag on the body connected to the hand. “...Joral? Did I pronounce that right?”


“*Actually*, it’s Jo*ral*, but that’s fine. Humans are famous for taking the longest to build a space elevator!” The kids laughed. Being a Human, Darryl felt a little insulted, although the little guy technically wasn’t wrong…


“Well, Jo*ral*, you’re not wrong… but do you know *why* it took us so long to build a space elevator?” Yup. Joral did. 


“Because your materials technology wasn’t advanced enough until right before you joined up with the Community!” Boy, was this kid really laying it on thick. Still, he technically wasn’t wrong. That being said, his species were the Trankar, and they were famous for their disapproval of the Humans being brought into the Community. His parents probably fed him all sorts of anti-Human propaganda.


“Once again, Joral, you’re not wrong. You’re just an asshole.” Said Darryl in a voice loud enough for the entire group to hear but quiet enough that his boss didn’t. Darryl knew that Human pop-culture had become a hit within the Community, and with that came Human insults, which were actually considered to be some of the most tame among the Community member-species, although they were still highly amusing. All of the kids except Joral got the reference and laughed. Most Trankar parents would never let their children watch Human media, let alone talk to a Human. The only reason Joral was here was because the school these kids were from was one of the Community’s boarding schools.


“Let me tell you the *whole* truth about Human space travel. So that we have more time, I am assuming all of you know basic physics?” The kids nodded ‘yes.’ “Okay well that takes a few thousand years of history off what we need to go over, then! So let’s start just after the end of what we called World War Two. We had recently developed nuclear weapons and the two most powerful countries, America and the Soviet Union, had entered an arms race. It had finally gotten to the point where the bombs themselves were pretty much as powerful as they could get with current technology.” The kids were mesmerized as they looked at all of the videos of nuclear tests on the screen behind them. Nuclear weapons weren’t unique to the Humans. In fact, all but one species had performed nuclear tests and three out of the twelve in the Community had used them in war.


There were a few facts that made Human nuclear weapons technology stand out, however. For one, Humans were the only species to have tested, and by extension fielded, megaton-yield devices. On top of that, while other member-species seemed to want to forget about this dark time in their respective histories, Humanity did the exact opposite and archived as much information about it as possible, including almost all of the test footage. Apparently, the concept of undocumented history repeating itself was unique to the Humans. 


This actually played out in the Humans’ favor when it came to their induction, as they had more advanced nuclear technology than the rest of the Community. The Trankar tried arguing that letting the Humans join the Community would only lead to the destruction of trillions of lives, even though the Humans hadn’t had operational nuclear weapons for years. The real reason, though, was that Human fusion technology would upset the near-monopoly the Trankar had on the energy generation sector.


“It had gotten to the point where our biggest issue had become the *delivery* of the weapons, as opposed to the weapons themselves. Enter, the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, or *ICBM* for short."" Darryl the Human pointed to a display case full of exact 1:64 scale models of the most famous ICBMs from both in front of and behind the Iron Curtain, like the *R-7*, *Minuteman*, *Topol*, *R-36*, *Titan II*, and *Peacekeeper*. The kids had their faces plastered up against the glass, trying to get a closer look at the intricate details of the models. Except Joral, who was looking from afar. He was still salty and didn’t want to give Darryl the Human the satisfaction of seeing him interested in Human history.


“Now, one thing you need to realize, kids, is that the Soviets and Americans were in fierce competition. Not only in weapons technology, but also in virtually everything else. Including space travel. The Soviets ended up putting an object in orbit first with a small satellite called *Sputnik*.” Darryl pointed up at a full-size model of *Sputnik* hanging from the ceiling, the glare of the Sun shining in through the window and reflecting off its silver body making it hard to look at. 


“That’s all? Our first satellite was much bigger than that.” Said Joral, trying to establish his dominance over the hourly-wage tour guide, who was only doing this because it was in the job description when he applied for an internship with the Communium Institution.


“I have a question for you, Joral. Why do you think we made the city of Clavius the Capital of the Solar System? Why not somewhere on Earth or Mars instead of the Moon? Wouldn’t that make more sense?”


“I bet your people are trying to hide something!” Said Joral, looking around to his classmates in search of support, only to fruitlessly return his gaze to Darryl’s face.


“Nope! You can go down and visit Earth any time you want, bud! We aren’t hiding anything.” There was a moment of silence as Darryl the Human waited for Joral’s next far-fetched response. “I’ll give you a hint,” Said Darryl as he squatted down to Joral’s eye level. “Take a look at these *quads*!” He exclaimed as he pulled his khaki shorts up above his thighs, showing off incredible muscle definition, along with a tattoo of the *Pioneer* plaque on one leg and a tattoo of the cover of the *Voyager* Golden Record on the other. Joral just stayed quiet instead of giving in to the tour guide’s commands, but eventually, he glanced down at the Human’s legs for a split second and then back up to re-establish eye-contact. He was secretly admiring what he could only assume was some sort of odd clan-identifying art on Darryl’s legs. 


The child contorted his face into a sassy ‘what the fuck are you talking about’ face.


“It’s the gravity, dude! The Community standard is only 1.49 meters per second per second! Do you think Humans evolved to have *hefty hams* such as *these* in this light gravity?” Darryl kept gesturing to his thighs. The gears in Joral’s head were starting to turn as he put it together.


Darryl saw that Joral was reaching for the rectangular outline in his pocket, likely a PDA. Humanity still found it slightly comical that the name for the little handheld devices everybody in the Community used translated roughly to ‘Personal Digital Assistant,’ or ‘PDA’ for short. Humans hadn’t used the term ‘PDA’ since the early years of the twenty-first century. The Humans, who had decided that they would be the only species in the Community to not use the PDA, still had their wide range of what they called ‘phones.’ The rest of the Community found *this* to be comical, as they were rarely, if ever, used as a telephone.


Joral’s facial expression remained resolutely stuck in the ‘what the fuck are you talking about’ position as he read *Communipedia's* article on the subject of Earth. 


*‘Earth is the home planet of the Human species and is notable for being the highest gravity home planet of any Community member-species by a factor of over three, with a mean surface gravity of 9.807 m/s2.’*


Joral was secretly a little impressed. It was no small wonder that Darryl the Human had such husky hocks for legs. Joral’s homeworld, Tiurmal, only had a mean surface gravity of 1.843 meters per second squared. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like to weigh over five times what he did at home! He would have to be able to exert a force of over four-hundred Newtons just to stand up!


The fact that the Humans had been able to build chemical rockets that could reach their planet’s escape velocity was actually pretty impressive. He looked up at Darryl the Human, who was still squatting in front of him. “And that, *my friend*, is why our first satellite was so small and why it took us so long to build a space elevator. We had to develop carbon nanotube technology before we could build one! If I’m not mistaken, wasn’t your species’ first elevator made of Kevlar?” Joral remained quiet. “Your species would have progressed just as slowly had you been dealt the same handicaps.” Joral felt as though he had been bested. The tour-guide had won this battle.


“Look, kid, I promise that if you just listen to what I show you on this tour with an open mind, you will find it pretty interesting!” Said Darryl in an excited, yet very parental tone. “I know that you have probably been told many things about my species, but I promise you that, while they may be true, they are not the whole truth.” Darryl the Human had bested him in a dominance battle, and he actually *might* have a point, so Joral decided to try and go along with the rest of the tour with an open mind. And with that, the group continued on for the next hour or so, making their way through countless exhibits.


Darryl addressed the entire group at the end of the tour. “Hey everybody, tell you what, why don’t you all go explore for a little bit. I’ll make sure to buzz your PDA’s when it’s time to meet back up.” With that, the group dispersed. Darryl’s hand reached out and grabbed Joral’s shoulder before he was able to walk away. The kid turned to look at the tour guide. “Not you, Joral,” he said in a calm voice. “I have something to show you.”


“What is it?” Joral asked. While he still had disdain for the Human, his curiosity cancelled out the negativity that would have been found in the tone of his voice.


“You’ll see. Follow me.” Darryl started walking without looking back at Joral. They went through a swipe-access door that opened up into a new section of the museum that was clearly still under construction. “Put this on. The addition is still under construction.” Said Darryl as he handed Joral a yellow hard hat that he took off a rack next to the door. He put one on his own head as well. 


The two kept walking for a minute or two until they came to a section of the addition that seemed to be more complete. At the end of the hall was an extremely large room with a few exhibits that weren’t yet finished, but were definitely getting there. One was what appeared to be a large, modular space station. Another was a flimsy silver and gold craft that looked to be a lander of some sort. There was even, for whatever reason, what appeared to be a small, primitive land vehicle that looked like it had been painted red at one point in its life. Now, most of the surfaces were bleached pink.


At one end of the room was a glass elevator protruding from a shaft in the ceiling. They walked up to it and the door automatically slid open, beckoning the duo to enter. Joral followed the Human inside, the door closing behind him. Darryl hit a button in the elevator labelled ‘*Giants’ Nest*’ and the elevator slowly started ascending. Joral looked up, watching the machinery in the elevator shaft fly by through the translucent ceiling as they ascended towards a bright opening at the top of the shaft.


“What you are about to see obviously isn’t open to the public yet. In fact, the construction of the exhibit was just finished about a week ago. I just thought you might find it to be pretty cool.” Joral wasn’t sure of what to think yet, so he just went along with it. The two didn’t speak for the remainder of the ride. 


Joral could feel the elevator slowing down. The elevator finally exited the opening at the end of the shaft, slowly rising up through the center of the floor of a gigantic, circular room with concrete walls and floors and a spiral staircase running around its circumference up to a glass ceiling that provided a view of the Earth directly overhead. The room had to be at least one-hundred and fifty meters in diameter, and equally large in height, if not a bit larger. The most prominent feature of the room, however, was what was stored in it.


“Welcome, Joral, to the *Giants’ Nest*.” Said a Human voice in the background as the two exited the elevator.


Joral was surrounded. By what looked like rockets. *Building-sized* rockets. Twelve of them arranged in a circle, each one bigger than the last. The rockets imposingly towered over him, instilling a deep sense of insignificance. He had seen full-scale models of the rockets his species had built before they built a space elevator. At the time, he thought they were gigantic. These utterly *dwarfed*  those. There was about three meters of space under each rocket for visitors to look up into the engines, even the tall Repondi species. Joral didn’t dare go under them. He knew they were just models incapable of flight, but what if… *what if*… He wasn’t going to risk it.


“What *is* this place?” Joral asked in an awestruck voice, not even trying to take his eyes away from the rockets.


“These are Humanity’s most significant launch vehicles. The ones that made the biggest impression on my species, for better or for worse. Built to full scale.” Joral didn’t respond. Instead, he kept looking around in absolute awe at the behemoths that surrounded him. 


""Remember earlier, when I was talking about ICBMs and mentioned one called the *R-7*?” Asked Darryl, to which Joral absentmindedly nodded as he stared up at the rockets. “Look over here.” Joral looked over and saw Darryl gesturing towards a familiar shape. One that he had seen before in the display case with the rest of the group. Just a hell of a lot bigger.


“I can show you around if you want. Teach you about each and every one of these rockets.” Joral eagerly looked over toward his Human counterpart and nodded, neglecting to change his facial expression from one of wonder.


Darryl showed his pupil around the *Giants’ Nest*, telling the kid about how the *R-7* and its derivatives, the *Sputnik*, *Vostok*, *Voskhod*, and *Soyuz*, is still the most reliable launch vehicle ever made by any Community member-species. About how the *Saturn V* first took Humans to the Moon and why the *N1*, its counterpart, never made it into space in its four test flights. About the successes of the *Space Shuttle* with the *Hubble Space Telescope* and the *International Space Station*, as well as the lessons learned the hard way after the losses of *Challenger* and *Columbia*. About how the *Energia-Buran* system was arguably a better version of the *Space Shuttle*, but was hindered by its lack of funding and the collapse of the Soviet Union. 


The two of them continued walking around the gigantic room, eventually making their way up to the upper catwalk via the spiral staircase around the wall. And still, Darryl continued teaching.


Teaching about the private sector's development of rapidly-reusable launch vehicles with Spacex’s *Falcon 9*. About how the world largely lost interest in space travel after the Cold War until the *Falcon Heavy* re-captured it when it put a car into orbit around the Sun. About the twenty-first century space race between the American *Space Launch System*, Chinese *Long March 9*, Russian *Soyuz 5*, and Spacex's *Big Fucking Rocket* to bring Humanity back to the Moon and to go beyond to Mars. About the demise of the rocket and how it was made obsolete by the Space Elevators built near the end of the twenty-first century. 


About how Humanity's legacy in the Cosmos was built upon the shoulders of giants.


Before either of them knew it, it was time to leave, a lasting impression being made on a once-critical mind. They descended from the upper catwalk, making two revolutions around the *Giants’ Nest*, giving Joral one final chance to admire the beautiful shapes of the *Space Shuttle* and the *Buran*, the precisely-machined titanium grid-fins that acted as a primary feature of the Spacex rockets, the massive Solid Rocket Boosters flanking the *Space Launch System* and *Long March 9*. 


They made one last lap around the room, this time walking underneath the rockets, despite the discomfort provided by having rocket engines pointed directly at you. They saw the *Big Fucking Rocket's* 31 full-flow staged combustion engines, the first of their kind to be used on an operational launch vehicle. They walked underneath the five humongous Rocketdyne F-1 engines on the bottom of the *Saturn V*, still the most powerful single-combustion chamber engines ever built. They made their way underneath the four RD-107's and one RD-108 that once lifted *Soyuz* into orbit, only ever failing twice out of over a thousand launches.


Finally, they made their way towards the center of the room, back to the glass elevator that patiently waited. As the elevator descended, the view through the hole at the top of the elevator shaft constricted, progressively hiding the twelve giants from view until all that could be seen anymore was Earth through the glass roof of the *Giants’ Nest*.


They walked out past the models of the *International Space Station* and the Lunar Excursion Module, past the once cherry-red Tesla Roadster that caught the imagination of a once-stagnant humanity. As they made their way through the area still under construction, all Joral could think about was how he was completely wrong about Humanity. He felt frustration towards his species for feeding him senseless propaganda. 


They exited the area still under construction through the swipe-access door and headed out into the main lobby of the museum where they met up with the rest of the group.


“Joral! Why are you wearing that funny-looking hat? It makes you look *goofy*!” Exclaimed one of the other kids. A few others looked over and laughed.


“Oh, shoot, Darryl, we forgot to take off our hard hats!” Said Joral, suddenly feeling a little self-conscious. Both of their minds had become so deeply invested in the *Giants' Nest* that they forgot they were even wearing the hard hats.


The Human responded, half laughing, ""It’s okay, bud. You can keep that one as a souvenir! I'll worry about replacing it."" He knelt down to Joral’s eye level, partially exposing the tattoos on his thighs. “Just remember what you learned about Humanity today.”


Darryl put Joral’s hard hat back on his head. It was at that point that Joral realized that he had made his first Human friend. 


“I never asked you, Darryl. What do those tattoos on your legs represent?”


“Hope.”


“For what?”


“What happened today, bud.”


And with that, Darryl Hendricks, the Human intern, acting tour-guide, stood up and walked over to his next group to introduce himself.

I just scored my first internship,bubuoink,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/869h3r/thanks_omscs_i_just_scored_my_first_internship/,"I applied to this program initially after finishing undergrad and having poor luck finding work with my (non-cs) degree.

I signed an offer for a well paid internship as a data scientist today.

Surprisingly, I got the impression that this program made me more interesting of a candidate to the firm compared to a traditional MS, as I would theoretically be available to continue working after the designated internship period without interrupting my studies.

We've got a great community, and I'm thankful this program exists! I hope other students in the beginning stages of their careers are also making strides.

I don't know too much about devops but I've heard some interesting things about it and would like to pursue it. To give some background, I have ~5 years of experience working in help desk at an MSP while attending community college. I've since then left the job to pursue my CS bachelors degree at UCI. In the meanwhile what can I do to prepare myself for interviews and preparing myself as a potential candidate?  I would like to land an internship  this summer as devops but 90% of the time I apply they don't respond . I purchased the Phoenix Project which I've heard many recommendations about the book. I will be reading it over spring break. Should I be focusing on building a portfolio on GitHub or learning about cloud infrastructures such as AWS or Azure? Or should I spend some time tinkering with Linux or teaching myself PowerShell? I don't know where to begin.  Any insight is appreciated."

Of course I've used most of these things for different projects in school, and even worked with .Net and Java in summer internships. 


But I can't see myself going into a job and just start coding. Like I have no experience at all with actually setting up a big software project, and for that matter, some positions people are interested in me for are consulting positions. How does this work? 


I don't know. I just feel like all these years in school and even my internships have given me nothing when it comes to actually working as a developer.


What are the thoughts of this sub when it comes to this? Like how you actually transition into your first time job where people actually expect you to know so much (it feels like at least) about the ""real world SWE"" instead of what I've done in school and internships."
86bg3i,9,2018-03-22,No internship after months of trying,potatochip01,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/86bg3i/no_internship_after_months_of_trying/,"I'm a Computer Engineering sophomore. I have been trying to get a summer internship in software dev or embedded systems stuff since last August. I have applied atleast a 100 positions (no joke), possibly more. I've had a few (5-6) interviews with big companies like Dell, Silicon Labs and Yext. But nothing has panned out so far. Last semester, I got only 2 interviews. But I was never super nervous about them. But for the ones I had in the spring, I would find it hard to form words! I would get really nervous and mess up on questions that I already knew the answer to. I would feel extreme pressure to do well on the interview and get the job so I would be safe for the summer. I have gotten a lot of feedback on my resume and I'm pretty sure it's in good shape.

 It's been really hard because all of my friends have really nice internships at huge companies in California. I have a good GPA. I am a good student. But one thing that could hurt my chances is my anxiety. I have always pretty confident with my technical abilities because I believe that I'm a good student. As a result of my inability to get an internship, I have developed anxiety and depression. I don't really have interest in anything anymore. I can't really remember a time when I didn't think about not having an internship. I don't want to go to class anymore. If I can't get a job now (even if I am technically qualified), how will I get one later in life? I am not able to maintain a healthy relationship with anyone I meet. The first thing that comes to mind when I see them is their internship and how they're gonna have a lot of fun in the summer. I don't really see them as people anymore. I rather see them as a physical form of the company they are working at. I know comparison is never healthy unless it motivates one to be better. But I cannot help it. I applied to so many positions. So I assumed I would land something. Since I don't have an internship for the summer, I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life. I know it's really dumb because not getting an internship your 2nd year isn't a big deal at all. But I feel like I did my best trying to find a position but things just didn't work out. I never believed in luck before. But now I guess I just have really bad luck. So I guess what I want to ask is: How do you not compare yourself to your peers and be secure about your abilities even when the world wants to make you feel bad about yourself? "

I'm currently taking CS1301 (pretty much cs 1 and Calc 1) and have no programming background other than some HTML (almost anyone can do HTML). In my classes, the students seem to know a lot of the material and occassionally mentions terms I have never heard of before. Because of this, I feel like an impostor or an outcast. I plan on taking a class in the summer (either calc 2 or physics 1). There's the background. But I wanted to ask what I should do and when would be the best time to do stuff like internships, job fairs, etc. since I've never been to those and I feel like I would only be a waste of space if I attended since I know close to nothing but Java basics. Any other advice, including those about the future, would be helpful as well. Sorry my grammar sucks.

I am sure that there are many, many lesser-known companies that offer more than excellent programs but, that being said, I think is a legitimate effort to list the ones that objectively open you more options for later.

I would start with the classic Facebook, Google, Amazon and such.... Possibly CERN? What about high-end institutions such as the UN and the EU? Do they offer something appealing for what Tech is concerned?"

I am considering teaching myself SQL and other programming languages like R, etc.  I also know how to use Tableau and some other analytical tools but that was one class I half-assed when I was studying in Hungary.

I am about to be cut off from my parents and I am pretty unsure what jobs to even look at with my current skillset.

86ccpx,29,2018-03-22,Elev-philiac,curewritewounds,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/86ccpx/elevphiliac/,"Leaving the office holiday party was always an adventure. People would drunkenly weave back to their desks, grope for keys and wallets, then hobble their way over chairs and each other to the elevators. We’d crowd as many of us as we could into any given car, exhaling enough alcohol into the metal box to give the unfortunate DD at least a contact drunk. We would laugh or cry, sing or shout, pressing into each other the whole ride down. When the doors would open on the ground floor we’d slosh into the lobby like the spirits in our aching guts, and all this was just the prelude.


Illicit workplace romances are no secret. If you think where you work doesn’t have one, then you’re not looking hard enough. They sprout around the office throughout the year and this moment, just after the holiday party, they all bloom in some kind of boozy springtime. Some furtive glances between desks would turn to something more, though on the average they turned into something less. During my time here, there were whispers that some of these relations got ugly – but hey, as long we still get the job done during the 9 to 5, how serious could that be? Besides, with the job market being what it was, there’s something to be said about grinning and bearing it.


My own post-party escapade started on the ground floor. We had an intern join us at the start of our fourth quarter. I had heard she was nineteen, but I made sure never to verify that for myself. It's hard to claim plausible deniability when you know you’re handing drinks to a minor and not just doing a solid for someone who ‘probably just misplaced their wrist-band.’ When we got off the elevator she was barely hanging on me the way a wispy piece of clothing dangles on a clothesline. A few of the office girls tried to help her off me, but I waved them off.


“Smile betch!” she shouted as a tiny LED flashed in my eyes.


“Jeez. What’s that for?” I asked, as I watch her tap away on her phone.


“Ma frands!” she shouted again, dropping the phone into my hands. In the photo, you could see straight down the neckline of what probably passed as a dress in the colleges around town.


“Why don’t you text that to me?” I said as I typed in my phone number, making sure to press ‘send’ before handing it back.


“Yeah, whatever,” she said, not so much leaning on a wall as barely not sliding down it. I waited about a minute for the vibration of my phone that would tell me I had the photo and, more importantly, her number.


I waited a minute before realizing I had left the office one cell phone lighter than how I went in. “Fuck,” I spat. I spun on a heel and bounded back to the elevators. Another group of staffers spilled out of a car and into the lobby. Some of the younger ones picked up my date and carried her to the doors. “Fuck,” I groaned twice under my breath, the second time stretching until the doors closed. I got off at our floor and bolted for my desk. The motion sensor lights flickered slowly, like drunken eyelids fluttering over fluorescent bulbs. I’d get my phone, call her, find out where she was going, and then hook up with her there. My gut sank after I opened the last possible drawer at my desk and still couldn’t find my phone. I walked back to the conference/party room, the motion sensing lights coming on as I entered, and searched there too. I had no idea how long I was there for, but the cubicle area lights had gone off by the time I gave up. I walked in darkness back to the elevators. This time, I guess, the lights were too tired to come on a second time for me. I’d blown it. Netflix and chill had turned into YouTube and just me.


I pressed the down button for the elevator and watched the inner doors rise through the centimeter crack in the outer ones. They split faster than I expected, nearly blinding me in fluorescent light. When my eyes adjusted I looked down and saw my phone lying there, next to some booze probably left behind by someone else. How that might have fit after we had packed the car, I had no idea. Had this even been the car I took earlier? I turned my phone over as the doors shut behind me. I checked my alerts and my messages, nothing. I knew I had sent a text to myself from her phone. There was no way I was too drunk to mess that up. I paced myself, I made sure of that. Sometimes reception died between floors. That was probably it. That had to be it.


I pressed the ground floor button. I’d run outside, get reception, get the text, make the call, and save my night. This is what I thought as I heard the cables that moved the car go quiet and then stop. I pressed the ground floor button again and again, maybe a dozen times, before pressing all the others. Nothing. I flipped the call button and braced myself for an alarm. Silence. I searched the elevator for a service number. I found it almost completely scratched out, not that it would have mattered as the ‘No Reception’ alert told me I was in one of those dead zones between floors. Which floors, I could not tell you, as the LED board had decided to stop telling me where I was.


I leaned on and then slid down the elevator wall. I reached for a cup by the forgotten booze, a half-empty carton of juice, and some plastic bottle vodka – then I waited for someone to pick me up. I probably should have set my phone to airplane mode or something, as the pointless searching for signal and service quickly drained what battery I had. When my phone died all I had left were my thoughts and the liquor. If I timed things right, I’d run out of both at the same time. There’s a kind of grey area where your brain is still deciding if it wants to be party to what your body is doing. I got my brain to that point pretty quick and then drowned it in angry swigs of cheap vodka.


All I remembered next was through a lens of alcohol. I felt something slither against my leg. At least I think I did. I kicked at it, and whatever it was left me alone for a moment. After a bit I felt it again, firm and weirdly warm, pressing into the small of my back. “Fuck off!” I yelled as I flailed like a rag doll, knocking it away. I peeled open my eyes to the light of dim, red emergency bulbs. I looked around for a rat or whatever it was that kept trying to nest in the warmest parts of me. I didn’t so much search the elevator as knock into things until I gave up. Crumpling back into a corner, my eyes drifted up to the ceiling and a gap between tiles that almost looked like a zipper. Something dark seemed to poke through it, and the harder I tried to focus on it in the crimson lights, the fuzzier it became. Then, like a fist made of shadows, it hit me. And it hit me again, and again. I raised a hand, to cover the heat spreading across my face, and felt the pull of binds over that hand and then the other one. What could only be hoses and tubes spilled through the split in the ceiling, wriggling and writhing over to me, grasping with every loop at every limb. I pulled and they became tighter. I took in breath to scream, and they wound around my neck until all that squeezed through was a pathetic wheeze. As I cried, it dragged a greased cable over my face and smeared my tears across my cheek. More and more cords spilled into the elevator until I was drowning in the foul smelling plastic that seemed to swallow the flashing red lights. Then I could taste it as inch after inch of filthy cable filled my mouth and wriggled down my throat.


I woke coughing and retching in full fluorescent light, driving fists into my gut at the command of some survival instinct. With the relief that only comes through vomit, the next thing I felt was cold. My whole body ached. Every joint I bent sparked fresh pain. My mouth was sticky and my throat was raw. Every time I breathed I could feel the fruity film of booze, and other things on my tongue, thicken. It seemed the harder I tried to force saliva into it, the worse it became. I found my jacket on the floor beside me. Balled up in a corner were my pants, shirt, and everything else. How hard was I trying to sleep? I turned, as if on reflex, to the ceiling, searching for the split that spilled. Instead, all I found, nestled in a corner was a small hole with a red LED on the other side. The blinking red light didn’t pulse but instead seemed to wink at me in an off pattern. It might have said, “Oh, you’re still here,” in Morse code for all I knew. When I looked at the LED board, I saw the letter G was lit. I got into my clothes despite every pain receptor in my body going on rapid fire. I had barely finished mis-buttoning my shirt when the doors split open and I felt a draft from the well ushering me out. I grabbed my shoes and stepped into a puddle of half-digested mush. I limped into the lobby and out the front door, wincing with every step. With my phone dead, I hailed a cab and after a few passed me and my aching arm, one let me in.


“Where to sweetie?” the cabbie asked. I gave her my address and she took off. I put a hand over my eyes to block out the morning rays that were like nails of light being hammered into my sockets. The sound of automatic locks going off could have been a hammer meeting an anvil.


“Rough night Mister Handsome?” Every word she said pounded on my eardrums. I peeked through my fingers to see her eyes settling one me instead of the road. I’m no Hemsworth, but I take care of myself. I might have been flattered if I was in any kind of mood for that. Seeing her eyes drift down, I fixed my pants and re-buttoned my shirt to stop half-exposing my midsection. This seemed to disappoint her and she shrugged massive shoulders. I almost spat some words back, but glancing over the barrier I saw a mass of muscle and bone almost crumpled behind the steering wheel; if she wanted, she could have stretched her legs, broken her seat, and pinned me back there.


So instead I said, “Yeah,” and tried to look down and away. I supposed she took the hint because the rest of the ride was spent in merciful silence. This made the sensation of my heart shoving blood through my liver just barely bearable. When we got to my apartment, I swiped my card and waited for her to unlock the doors.


“How about a smile, sweetie?” She said more than asked, looking at me through her mirror.


“Excuse me?”


“C’mon, such a handsome face is wasted pouting.”


I slid my fingertips over the lock, trying to find some purchase on the tab that receded completely in the door. “Are you kidding me? Let me out.”


“Nah-ah-ah,” she scolded me – Scolded. Me. She wagged a black gloved finger from the other side of the barrier, flicking something on among the aching darkness in head. I spotted the cab company phone number and pulled up my phone to dial when I remembered it was dead. “C’mon,” she cooed at me like I was a puppy, “Just one smile.” Four black shapes curled over the barrier and her black turtleneck started to twist.


I don’t know if something kicked in or something else didn’t, but I felt the sudden curve of my lips and saw the reflection of the cabby’s gaze. I heard the click of the door unlocking and leaped out of the car. As it peeled away I brought my phone up to get the plate number and nearly threw it into the pavement when I realized, again, that the battery was dead. I limped up the stairs to my apartment, my body struggling with every step. In the full-length mirror that faced my front door I saw myself, hammered, hung-over, and wrecked in more ways than one. There were long, red welts that ran across my face and more that seemed to wrap around my wrists and arms. When I touched them, it felt like lighting a fire on my skin. I hobbled to the bathroom and plugged my phone in. I flipped on vanity lights, which flashed on like a half-dozen suns, and vomited again. Mixed with the hummus and pita chips, clear and dark liquor, were dark flakes that I struggled to focus on before washing the lot of it down the drain. I crumpled onto my bath mat, picking at some black residue under my nails. When I had the strength, I brushed my teeth and more black flakes fell out of my mouth. I spent the rest of the day dealing with the hangover phenomenon of my entire digestive system working in reverse. I wrote a colorfully worded e-mail to maintenance about getting their ‘god damned retards’ to fix their ‘fucking death machines.’


When I went back to work a week later, I caught myself frozen in front of the elevator well. I watched the four sets of doors coming and going with any number of men and women at any given time. Where everyone let themselves be swallowed and spit-up by the elevators with blind trust, I found eyes flickering among the four illuminated doors, my subconscious seizing control from the rest of me until I knew which of these cars trapped me that night. It wasn’t until I saw a large group of people come through the front doors that I willed myself to pack into a car with them. I maneuvered myself into the middle, keeping as far away from the walls as I could, even as the car continued to fill. I even kept myself turned away from the door at an angle where the elevator camera wouldn’t catch my reflection. Floor by floor people got off, the number of bodies between me and the elevator shrinking with the opening and the closing of the doors. At last it was just two: me and a woman who worked a couple floors below me.


I could feel my body twitching, either from unconscious nerves or something my body was doing to accommodate the aches that still wracked me. I could see that she saw from the way she stole side-glances at me the whole ride, the frequency of glances grew the fewer other passengers there were. I wanted to apologize. I wasn’t starring at her. I starred past her to the only angle where the camera might still see me. I didn’t want the elevator to see me. I couldn’t let it. I felt my hands clench into clammy fists as we approached her floor. I’d ask her to stay. I’d beg. Just ride a couple more floors with me. When the doors opened on her floor, I grabbed at her.


“Stay away, you fucking creep!” She yelled. I could feel my eyes turn to saucers the moment her head moved and I saw the red, flickering light in the corner, blinking with the timbre of laughter. She slapped my hands away and shoved me into the back of the car. I heard the sliding of metal on metal and watched a ceiling panel fall open, dropping thick rubber cables onto me. In an instant I was tangled. I clambered for the door, clawing through tubes and cords. There was a moment of elation when I slipped my fingers through the door. I filled my lungs to shout when the doors slammed shut. My shout transformed into a scream. I heard the gears whirl around me and felt the undeniable sensation that something was pulling me through the door. I felt air whipping over my fingers. I could already feel the sensation of my hand grinding against the elevator shaft, my fingertips being ground down into stumps. I screamed and screamed, clawing at the door with my free hand until they burst open and I fell upon my co-workers who looked on with concern. I scrambled out of the elevator, turning as I felt the doors clamp on my ankle, screaming again as I fell. I saw through the elevator doors as they stuttered apart – no cables dangled, no loose ceiling panel swung, just a normal elevator with a recessed camera that blinked right at me as the doors closed again and hut.


I grasped at my foot, pulling down the sock to reveal a fresh, wide, red welt that already ached – a welt that matched one on my hand and all the others from the night of the holiday party. I hobbled to my desk, trying to pretend like everything was normal, that my outburst hadn’t happened, that today was just a normal day. I picked out flecks of black rubber from under my nails.


Word did not start spreading that day only because word had already been out. Some fragments of footage of naked body in the elevator were already making their rounds and must have been in every e-mail inbox of every other person in the building, likely courtesy of whomever was at the other end of the e-mail I sent to maintenance.


“Why not just call for help? Jeez,” was one of the kinder exchanges I heard around me. “He was drunk and just kept drinking, what did he expect?” “I don’t understand why he was alone in the first place.” “He’s only got himself to blame, really.”


“I heard he blew chunks in the elevator.”


“Oh gross. Which one?”


“Did you see his ass though?”


“Where would you put him on the crazy-hot scale?”


Even the intern got in on it, “Should have just left his phone and come home with me. I wouldn’t have let this happen to him.”


“Seriously, just get your phone in the morning. Or get a replacement. Phone insurance is like nothing.”


I managed to track down most of the footage that was circulating. I’d need to get help tracking down who sent it, but I didn’t want any more humiliation than I was already getting. I rode the elevator down that night, surrounded by people who seemed to keep away from me as much as I kept away from the car walls. When I got home I stitched all the videos together into a six-hour film of my drunken episode.


I watched myself pick up my phone from the floor and the doors close as soon as I’m inside. I watched myself pour cocktail after cocktail until I’m pouring the remnants of the vodka into the juice, chugging it until my head simply rocks and then stops rocking. Then there are three and a half hours of sometimes swirling static. This is followed by me huddling naked into a corner, balling my clothes into a pathetic mattress, pulling my jacket over me not so much for warmth as hiding from the camera. I see myself heaving as the jacket rises and falls like tidal waves until it goes still and my body splays out across the floor.


This is not so upsetting as what I know I can see in half distorted flashes in the three and half hours of swirling static. In the noise I see myself screaming. I catch glimpses of thick cables dropping through the ceiling panels, grasping and binding me, immobilizing my shrieking, flailing body as yet more fall through and wrap over and over me, squeezing and covering and prodding every inch of me. It happens over and over again until all I am is shivering flesh.


I rode the elevator again the next day, shivering as the recessed red light winked at me.  


I ride it again the day after. On late nights and early mornings, when I have to ride alone, I hear the gears turning different. I try not to look at the ceiling panels that rattle apart above me. I tell myself that the cables creeping at my feet aren’t there and that the tightening feeling around my body isn’t happening. My coworkers call me, “Elev-philiac,” when they think I can’t hear. I tell myself that nothing is wrong and everything is fine. I grin and bear it. I need this job."

I work for a small non profit where we hire interns and train them with the goal of them learning and obtaining basic IT literacy. I was tasked with using our training material budget.

Most of the things the interns are expected to learn are covered in  the A+ exam, and for that I'm purchasing the Mike Meyers book. For the remaining budget I want to use it for other certification training, general IT and computer literacy.

Here's my shopping list as of now:

* 
CompTIA A+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Ninth Edition (Exams 220-901 &amp; 220-902) by Mike Meyers
* 
CompTIA Network+ N10-007 Exam Cram (6th Edition) by Emmett Dulaney
* 
CompTIA Linux+ Powered by Linux Professional Institute Study Guide: Exam LX0-103 and Exam LX0-104 by Christine Bresnahan
* COMPTIA SECURITY+ ALL-IN-ONE EXAM GUIDE, FIFTH EDITION
* 
CCNA Routing and Switching Complete Study Guide: Exam 100-105, Exam 200-105, Exam 200-125 by Todd Lammle
* 
Network Warrior: Everything You Need to Know That Wasn't on the CCNA Exam by Gary A. Donahue
* 
Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold
* 
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners by Al Sweigart

This covers about 1/3 of our budget so I'm looking for more items to buy.

Any recommendations for books on general IT literacy, certification books, and maybe programming and general computer literacy(maybe Microsoft Office training) books would be welcome.

Thanks

Like I have a bunch of places I consider good but they all have pros and cons I have no idea what to do lol. 

I'm struggling to decide between UofToronto, CarletonU, UOttawa, and even Waterloo for CS/Software Engineering (where available). 

Ottawa/Carleton are full rides plus I'll be living with my parents. They have a decent coop system (I know Ottawa has the 2nd best after Waterloo, that being said the gap between the two coop systems are huge). Ottawa is a decent city although I'm not too big of a fan. Most of my friends and classmates are going to Ottawa, that's not necessarily that great of a thing. Prestige/brand name is in-existent but the coop experience makes up for it to an extent. I would graduate with profit and 1-2 years of experience. Carleton is prolly the easiest in the list although Ottawa is still a bit easier than UofT = higher GPA.

UofT. It's a nice city and decent university, but it has no co-op equivalent, it's expensive, and has this thing called POSt (you're not in your major until second year, and for CS you need to maintain a 4.0 in two classes that have a C+ average). If you don't make POSt you have to switch majors or leave the university. It's also the hardest uni and I care about GPA since I'm trying to make grad school potentially. Also,  I would graduate in debt as I would be paying ~25k/yr CAD and I'd have to find my own internships. 

Waterloo (Double Degree BBA w/Laurier) is really depressing, has a shitty atmosphere, and feels like I would be in prison for 5 years. Waterloo has an excellent coop program (best in world) with tons of awesome companies from Google to Snapchat, Goldman to Chase and so forth. Oh and thing is it's also the furthest away from my parents and I don't know any friends going there (and the kids there are a lot more on the antisocial/nerdy side than any other uni) Shout out to /r/uwaterloo tho lul. It's the most expensive, although I would graduate debt-free bc of coop and 2 years of experience.

I ruled out Queens but I'm struggling with the rest lol... I just really want to make the right decision ya know. what do

Advice needed on how best to reach out to employer.,professor_Rad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/86fhz7/internship_limbo_advice_needed_on_how_best_to/,"Hi everyone, been lurking for a long time and finally have a question of my own to ask.

So currently I'm a junior CS major at a private university. Last summer I interned at a relatively large company doing CS work with some robotics and a bit of mechanical/electrical engineering. After the ""formal internship"" ended, they decided to keep me on since I went to school locally. I kept my laptop and badge and was able to work remotely to finish up some documentation. I'm still employed but haven't filled out a time sheet in a long time and haven't stayed too much in contact (the occasional happy holidays here and there), and figured that if anyone needed something from me they'd reach out. 

At the end of my internship, my manager indicated that they'd be interested in bringing me back for this summer. So, this year I've been applying to other places (just to stay in practice and to see if anything better came up) and I got a couple offers but have since turned them down because they weren't quite as good as my previous place of work. I had an awesome experience and loved the company culture and my team so I've been pretty much set on going back. 

I reached out to my manager and supervisors about 2 weeks ago regarding coming back (since now is the time to be securing something) and they told me to send them my resume and I did. I haven't heard back yet and am a little worried as summer is getting closer and I don't have anything locked down (which is probably a mistake on my part). I don't want to seem like I'm nagging them, especially with how busy they are, by emailing them again so soon. I'd likely be placed on a different team (which I'm fine with) but there's also a chance I would go back to the old project because I was basically the expert on it. However, my manager has since been put in a different organization within the company so I'm not really sure how that affects my situation.  

I feel like right now is a good time to send a follow up email regarding my resume, but I'm not 100% certain on the wording. I was wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation as me or might have any bits of advice for me regarding what to do. I've just been getting more and more nervous lately (perhaps for no reason) and would love to get a trajectory on what I should do. Lemme know if I can provide any more information.

I've gotten lucky and have been offered a Control's Co-Op position with a good company. This Co-Op works with alternating semesters, one working full time and the following going to school full time. It would require me to do 3 cycles. At first I was ecstatic and wanted to accept the position but after speaking with my advisers I don't feel so certain anymore.

My advisers told me that while getting hands on experience is important it is also important to keep in mind the amount of money you give up and most importantly the amount of career progress you would be loosing. In my situation the amount of money I would be loosing is around 30k. An entry level Controls engineer in the area I live in makes around 60k and I would be making 30k from the Co-Op, so a difference of 30k. 

If I take the Co-Op I would also be loosing a years worth of engineering experience, assuming I get a job at graduation. My advisers have assured me that it is currently the best market to get an engineering a job and that I shouldn't worry about not finding a job at graduation. Is this true, how good is the current engineering market?

I'm already on a 5 year graduation plan so adding on another year makes me nervous. Rather than graduating Spring 2019 I would graduate Spring 2020. To remedy this one of my advisers has suggested that I work the position throughout the summer and see how I fell at the end. If I feel that the experience I'm gaining is worth it stay on board, if not ask for a part time position so I could continue taking classes. This would only set me back a summer and seems more reasonable to me. Have any of you done this before? What was your experience like?

My main question is how valuable is a 3 cycle Co-Op position worth? Would it be worth losing half a years worth of an engineering salary and the career progress lost by postponing graduation by a year? "

Back to school, or continue to learn online?",Treephonic,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/86fwb6/30_year_old_starting_new_career_back_to_school_or/,"I'm 30 years old and want to transition into a career as a software developer. 

I would very much appreciate some advise from those in the industry as this is a huge decision in my life!

I live in Lancaster, Pa (small but vibrant city, 1.5 hours from Philadelphia). I dropped out of college almost 10 years ago. I was originally a business major, switched to English, studied abroad, and, although my grades were always solid, I generally lacked direction. Since I dropped out I've been working with my father in a small family business. We do restoration work on hardwood floors. It's generally pretty rewarding as we do a lot of specialty work - I enjoy the craftsmanship aspect of it- but I'm ready to move on and start a different career. A very different career!

My career change path started with the idea of becoming a Front-end Web Developer, honestly just because I had built a couple websites before in high school, I run our company website (through Squarespace) and it seemed like the most accessible/logical tech career. I started the freecodecamp front-end certification program and enjoyed it. However, a few weeks in to fcc I started to learn more about the career options and I learned of a very intriguing course: CS50.

At this point I'm about half way through CS50 and I love it. I'm reading books about code, and I think about programming all the time. I believe that writing code is what I want to do. So how do I make this into a career?

I have a good friend who has graciously offered to be my mentor. He is a few years older than me (mid 30s) and is self-taught. He began programing in his mid 20s, got an internship, flipped that into a job, and has worked his way up to taking a good job in California (and then Seattle) and working for multiple major (household name) tech companies. He is a Senior Engineer with lots of responsibilities and a great salary. He thinks that I should finish CS50 and then start learning Java (just his choice out of the big languages). Once I have learned the basics of Java, he will start giving me projects to work on, and walk me through scaling up my skillset so that I can land a low-level job or an internship. (His connections could possibly play a roll in my ability to land my first gig, but I'm afraid to count on that completely.) He thinks that the key is to get a job as soon as possible because thats where I will really learn the things that matter. (And start making money!) He thinks school is good, but that it is not necessary for me and will add time and cost to the process. 

That all sounds great, but part of me feels like maybe I should get a CS degree. I live ~5 minutes from the University that I left 10 years ago. I already applied (it was free as a re-entry student) and I have been accepted into the Computer Science program for the fall of 2018. My arguments for going to school are that it will boost my confidence in my CS abilities and that a degree will probably make it easier to land a job. The obvious downside is shelling out a good bit of money while also making very little money for ~2 years...

Financial and life concerns: I own a home. My mortgage is small (~650 a month) and I am nearing the end of a long list of improvements that I've been making over the course of the 6 years that I've been here. I think the house is pretty solid, but obviously there can always be surprise expenses. I live with my girlfriend (long term relationship, assume stable), who is about a year ahead of me on this career change/going back to school thing (she's studying graphic design). She will be graduating spring 2019. I am very confident in her ability to land a job quickly after graduation as she is very talented and has some local connections. She does work part time and makes pretty good money in tips. I'm sure that we could pay the bills for a year or so if we were both in school and working part time, but it would be a big lifestyle change... I do have ~13k in savings as a potential buffer for this time. No car payment... no kids... but we do have 2 dogs.

edit: Even if I don't go back to school, I will probably be quitting my current job and picking up something part time so that I can focus more on programming. My current job takes a lot out of me and I want to accelerate the process of landing a programming job by dedicating more time to my studies.

TL;DR
With the goal starting a career in software... Should I go back to school to get a CS degree (~2 years because of previous schooling), or should I just keep studying online, reading books, and following the advice of my mentor in hopes of landing an internship or low-level position more quickly? "

Should i begin looking for a new place to work, or wait and see if it gets better?",gwillicoder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/86g3j1/burning_out_and_drowning_at_new_job_should_i/,"Some background on me. I have 3.5 years of a physics degree completed and im about 3 semesters away from a CS degree. I had been working 2 jobs to support me and my wife while trying to take night classes to finish my degree, but i started to do very poorly in my classes and couldn't keep up with the homework with all of the hours i was working.

I ended up accepting a position as a software engineer / data scientist (they dont seem to really know what they want me to be) at a local company with the plans to slowly finish my CS degree with night classes while i worked and gained experience.

I have had internships at startups in my area, but i've never had any sort of mentorship or even worked a position where i wasn't the person that was 'most expert' with CS/programming (which is very unfortunate).

Part of my interview requirements was that i would receive mentoring from this company while i worked there. My first day I wasn't given any sort of onboarding i was just thrown onto a project in a language i didnt know, so i began to teach myself Java and write unit tests for the code base (as well as i could understand what was supposed to be happening).

Less than 2 weeks later i was given a consulting project for a large industrial company in town where i would be the only developer and i was alone at this company developing a product for them. The project requirements seemed reasonable but i kept missing deadlines because i was working with an industry specific software that i was having to interface with and it was causing massive problems. I was super limited in the types of technologies i could use (i couldnt even pull data from a database i had to use this weird java app and a jython console inside the app that im not really even supposed to have access to).

I've been working 70+ hour weeks every week for the last month and im so close to being burnt out. I feel like im drowning and I cant make these deadlines. I'm not juggling finishing this other project with starting a new project that is real time analysis of sound files using deep learning (i actually love my new project and im quite comfortable with the area and its the type of work i really expected to do when i got hired).

I understand that i can't keep missing deadlines in industry as a consultant and Im literally doing everything i can to just put in the effort to force deadlines, but I honestly feel like I've been left out to dry.

**TL;DR** Working 70+ hour weeks, 0 mentorship or guidance. I was promised i'd be working with others and would receive mentorship or at least a learning experience. First job that isn't an internship and is in the field, and i haven't finished my CS degree yet. Wife is pregnant so i dont think i have a chance to finish my degree without doing it while i work. No paid overtime and i dont think im getting PTO for my overtime either. I've only been since Jan 3rd so i think its way to early to jump ship. 

Does anyone have any thoughts?"

I am a high school senior who has recently got admitted to UCLA for Applied Math. UCLA is amazing in so many aspects, however,  I am not able to find enough information about internship experience + job placement. I have a variety of questions:

1) How easy is it to switch to the other majors within the Math department?(Math-Econ, Math of Computation, etc)?
2) How many first-year students get internships/jobs for the summer, and where do they work? Are there career fairs for math majors only, and do most opportunities overlap with engineering? Are there any data science consulting clubs or interest clubs, and do UCLA students intern at data science companies?
3) Is the math department research heavy?
4) Are there any BS+MS programs that UCLA offers for math majors?"

People involved:
&gt;$Me: myself ofc

&gt;$BSB: Big Shot boss. Obnoxious man who has never been told 'No'. Probably been surrounded by yes men his whole life. Think of Malcolm McDowell always in a nasty mood.

&gt;$MI: Male intern

&gt;$FI: Female intern

A couple of months ago we got a call from an office reporting email and calendar sync issues.

I enter the office and can only see the $FI there. Her second day on the job, she does not know any of the passwords on the email accounts (a dozen accounts) and needs help in resetting them. All the accounts still work on the $BSB's PC. But $FI needs to add some email accounts on her phone and cannot figure out how to reset the passwords. They also need a couple of accounts removed in Outlook from the $BSB's PC (they no longer use those accounts).

First things first, I remove the accounts $FI tells me they no longer use. Then I take a look at the accounts she wants the passwords reset. All the accounts are from their custom domain, they have a mail server from their hosting provider. I tell $FI I will need the server details to reset the passwords. $FI tells me only the $BSB knows this stuff and will be here soon. Meanwhile I share and add the google calendar they wanted on all their tablets, phones and PC's.

While we wait for $BSB, $MI drops by (fresh graduate). Apparently $MI and the $BSB arrived to the office together. $BSB is downstairs getting coffee and will be there soon. $MI tells me this is his second day as well. It is an unpaid internship that he plans to do for a couple of months. Tells me it will be good for him because $BSB is a Big Shot in their profession.

$BSB comes in and I ask him details of their hosting provider. He tells me I have to speak with their IT guy. Puzzled I ask why they needed us if they have an IT guy. Tells me the IT guy lives in another city so he can't do this stuff (have they never heard of teamviewer?). He gives me the phone number of their IT guy.

I call their IT guy and am taking down details of their hosting provider but because $BSB is being loud and screaming at $FI &amp; $MI I can't hear what he is saying. I step out of the office and close the door.

Suddenly $BSB steps out and shrugs (more like makes the gesture asking 'what are you doing'). I shrug back. He opens the door signs that I need to go in. I go in and he keeps glaring at me. I am on the phone so I keep ignoring him. Suddenly he grabs my hand holding the phone and pulls it away from my ears. I am confused at what he wants


&gt;$BSB: Don't you think that is rude?

&gt;$Me: huh?

&gt;$BSB: Talking with my employee about me and my company in a private conversation?

&gt;$Me: What?

&gt;$BSB: Put it on the speakerphone so we all can listen

Stunned I complied and put it on the speakerphone. His IT guy tells me he will just mail the $BSB the details (he must have repeated himself several times already). The mail arrives. I reset their passwords and leave.

Go home and am uneasy the whole time. Keep thinking that was f#$%ing rude. Yanking my hand and ordering me to turn the speakerphone on.

At work the next day and boss tells me they called as I hadn't solved all their problems. Go back and $FI &amp; $MI are panicking, no sign of $BSB. After I removed the unused accounts from outlook his whole address book was wiped. Okay, so the address book was saved on one of the unused accounts then. Ask if they have the address book on any of the other PC's. They have it on an Ipad. I am exporting all the contacts when suddenly

&gt;$MI: I apologize on his behalf. 

&gt;Me: For what?

&gt;$MI: He's gonna be here any moment and he is super pissed.

&gt;$Me: So?

&gt;$MI: He may scream and call you names, but he's a good guy.

&gt;$Me: Not today mate, you may be his intern I am not. I am in no mood today.

$BSB enters the office and we have a glorious shouting match. He blames me for removing his address book and I tell him that was what was requested off me, to remove the unused accounts. Then he switches to shouting at $FI and $MI because it must have been their fault for asking me to remove the unused accounts. 

$MI takes the screaming sheepishly for a while then suddenly goes

$MI: This is not worth it. This is not gonna work out. I quit

$MI walks out leaving everyone in shock. $BSB asks if I will still fix his address book. I say yes. Had already exported them to a single file, only needed importing. Imported the address book and left.

I am nearing completion of my undergrad degree in Electrical/Computer engineering but am currently at an internship. I find the job very boring and could not stand doing this or any of the actual engineers' jobs any longer than the internship. My worry is that all jobs are like this, just different variations of boring.

What makes me excited is learning new theories, new topics, new things, specifically in science/philosophy, really just anything that changes the way I see the world or amazes me. I actually already got a chem/biology degree as a pre-med student but immediately continued on to engineering because I thought engineering would fulfill my desire to continue learning cool things and thinking deeply/problem solving for the rest of my life. I love engineering in school, but the job descriptions I can get upon graduating sound like they would make me depressed the rest of my life (quality, testing, repetitive and non-innovative kind of task-based work).

My question is, do you think graduate school will give me what I want upon graduation or am I just avoiding the inevitable boring industry? MS or PHD, I don't know, but I will probably only get into an MS anyways without undergrad research experience. I am not really worried about being accepted to an MS program because I have excellent grades, I work hard in school and have a genuine interest in new knowledge.

I just want to hear how actual grad students, preferably from science or engineering, feel about the type of work you do, if it is intellectually stimulating and exciting to learn in grad school, or if the jobs you got after graduation are any more interesting than you get with a BS."

So I got to work, I researched and created a Proof of concept using Microsoft bot framework and LUIS back when it was still in preview and my company really liked it. 

They then wanted me to integrate it with their existing apps so I did, I worked hard to make it work to a certain degree, everyone is happy. Then they wanted some additional functionality. I was able to first part of the functionality but the second one was having trouble. So I talked to my manager and he told me to take some time to figure it out, well I did but it is a complex piece of functionality and it was causing a lot of bugs. I tried to explain to manager what's going on and why I am unable to make clear estimates on what I am doing. But he constantly keeps pushing me to try and beat the deadlines, sometimes he even asks unreasonable things like reports on what I need to do. He doesn't even do anything with the reports. He compares me to the other developers, but the other developers are contractors from another company. I am a college student and I get paid like $15/HR and I don't even work full-time! 

I'm not even sure how I should bring up the pay situation because I feel like I'm getting underpaid for the amount of work that I am doing, which includes trying to work with other departments to get my requests through, dealing with people not replying to emails, also being the only one working on this particular project. There is a massive amount of work that needs to be done on putting these functionalities to production especially after they expanded my app to integrate with others , also making my manager understand the importance of training models and best practices is difficult, since I myself don't even know them well, I just taught myself and looked them up online. On top of that I don't really have anyone to go to for my issues I have to scour forums and ask a bunch of questions on GitHub. The other developers are nice and try to help but they don't have that much time to teach me stuff. Just yesterday my project manager asked me what I was planning for next week's work hours, I told him I need to ask someone from Microsoft questions regarding the infrastructure of our app and he asked for a detailed report on what I was going to ask by today knowing full well I asked for today off to study for tests.

PLUS my Job title is ""TEMP"". I don't even get a title for the work that I am doing which is equivelant to the other developers. 

I'm not sure what kind of questions to ask, I'm really overwhelmed, especially with college, all my upper level cs classes are super hard, dealing with all the stress and studying is really having a negative impact on me. I really need this job to put myself through school. My parents aren't able to support me at all, I pay for myself 100% including living costs. 

I am trying to apply elsewhere but they are just trying to take interns and I have been rejected by a few. I am still trying to see if I can find another place that will work.
Any advice is appreciated."

One of my friends died early this year. Like a really random death. And when I say random, I still don't fully understand why he died. It wasn't a car accident. Apparently, his heart just stopped. Out of nowhere. And in our small town, no doctor could pump it. And that's it. By the time they transferred him to a bigger city ( took 7 hours ), he just died.

He was a smart CS kid, about to graduate, with a couple of internships under his belt. It really saddens me to think that he spent 22 years of his life preparing to live a life he never had. He's always wanted to leave Canada and live in SF. It was his dream.

After nights of crying I guess I just decided that I'd go to SF for him. Now, I am just an average Business/Math student, I don't have a single idea how to program. This was in January.

I skipped almost all my classes, trying to learn how to program. I learned C, then JavaScirpt, then React and Node.js. I was on CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp all day. I grinded Leetcode non-stop. Built 4 projects. I applied to over 400 internships in SF, and got at most 4 phone screen, and bombed the only tech interview I had. I understand, I wasn't a good enough but I was learning very fast. 

Until now I think I probably applied to over 700 jobs. Still no more than 10 phone screens (for SF internships). However, I guess my effort wasn't vain as I got some good offers within my area, passing their technical interview with ease. But I really, really just want to go to SF. It's for him, but also for me. I have put so much effort, neglecting social life, sleep, and school. And although I think I came pretty far, it just wasn't enough :(

I am so desperate. I am at this point where I don't even know if I should keep trying to get an internship in SF. I understand it is the hardest thing ever, and time is tickling, almost no company's hiring interns anymore. I don't know if I should just give up, and just make the best of what I have (I.E take the offer in my area). 

Thanks so much for staying with me until now, and reading the rant. It is late at night, and I miss him so much :/ life's a bitch.

86jbf9,4,2018-03-23,All I feel is anger,mathguy23,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/86jbf9/all_i_feel_is_anger/,"I am constantly angry, frustrated, and resentful. I like very few things in life except for working on what I am passionate about. Work is control, work is structure, work is routine and discipline. What happens however, when the things you work so hard to attain are destroyed because of factors out of your control? By factors, I mean the ones that shaped you, the ones that define you , the ones that have made you who you are. I cant remember if I started pursuing math because I love it or because I was trying to prove a point. That point being the following; I do not need anyone or anything, I am my own guidance, my own ebb and flow,  my own change. I make the improvements on myself, no one else can do that for me. I am my own push, no one else. Outside help is and will always be unnecessary.

I was diagnosed with adhd at age 3, told that I would only get but so far in lifeand put into special education classes at the hand of my parents until I graduated high-school. My parents never cared about my passions, just that I was getting homework done and getting good grades. At the end of the day, what I cared about mattered very little if it wasnt art, religion or music. In fact, I was interested in science and engineering of any kind, but that was never on their radar it seemed. 

I resent that diagnosis, I have resented it and fought it for my entire life. It changed nothing. Fighting these mistakes, these factors that were not in my control, didnt change anything. If anything, continuing in what I currently do only brings to light how it further affected my life. And now, reading these symptoms of adhd, I face the horrid thought of my parents having made the right diagnosis. I hate having to think of it as being even a possibility. I worked hard to improve, I made work my life. I care little about anything else in life, whether it be travel, friends, family and romantic relationships. I see any of that as giving up, especially romance. Relationships, in my opinion, are what you strive for when you run out of ways to improve yourself by yourself. When you feel like you cant stand the thought of a life alone, when you get tired of pushing yourself and want someone else's help. I see romance as complete and utter weakness. I see friends and family a distraction, and a threat respectively. A threat in the sense that they will derail you with ""Family issues"", or someone dies and your left to pick up the pieces or deal with whatever aftermath comes after one of your parents or family members either dies or begins to suffer from terminal illness. 

I have failed in community college, transferring to uni with a 2.86 (or 2.73, not sure), and have failed in uni, only getting worse in classes upon arrival, suffering one drop out semester, and getting a 2.69 overall. I was recently told I was not going to be able to get into, nor afford graduate school, the former of which I already knew but am still processing. I've done everything I felt like I could do. I sought help, as much as I hated it, I did research, even interdisciplinary, I tried to take a break, as much as I hated that, and all of it changed nothing. 

Losing this is losing everything. 

If I had to describe suffering, it would be being presented all the opportunities in the world, but being taught only the bare basics, and being pushed away from passions, pushed to do easier, more reachable things, to be grounded when your mind wants to fly, feeling chained down by the very part of your body that is supposed to free you. 

Like feeling mute with a working voice.

I do not want to face the fact that everything told to me at 3 was correct, but I already am. All I am able to feel for myself is an incredible amount of anger, resentment, rage, frustration. I worked my hardest. I lost sleep over this. I went down every avenue presented to me and every avenue I thought possible to pursue. I was turned away by everything, REU's, internships, professors whom I wanted to do research with. I try harder in class than anyone else. I say so because I see 90% of my classmates in a certain room, and everyone talks about how easy or hard a certain test was, whereas for me that test or anything was either hard or impossible. I have been left with nothing. This was control and discipline for me. This was the only thing I can say I ever found any modicum of happiness in. If this is truly gone then all I am left with is my thoughts, ideas, and anger. I don't know if I can blame myself for not trying hard enough, for potentially having an undiagnosed mental deficit attributing to my failure as a kid and as an early adult, my parents for ruining my education, for not giving me a chance to be a regular kid in regular classes and struggle and maybe come to the decision to say, ""hey, maybe I do need help"". Now I struggle to even think the thought, but that is on me I guess. 

Even if I do have adhd, I've done everything I could think of to control myself. Math was all I ever needed. It keeps me balanced, controlled, less-impulsive. I'm losing that now, I am losing my control factor, my motivation, my happiness. The only thing left is medication, and I refuse to go through the rest of my life having to take a pill to take the edge off, whatever the ""edge"" is.

I'm out of options, and extremely angry.

Basically, I'm a CS student who wants to get a job / internship as a front-end (not 100% sure on that one yet) junior dev. I gave myself time until October since that's when the third semester begins. I've already enrolled on a JS course on Udemy (I'm at async programming atm) and know basics of HTML and CSS.  
As for the free time, I can manage to set aside 3 hours a day on weekdays and 4-6hrs on weekends. That's not the 100% of what I could put in, but there are other interesting things to learn, and besides, I don't want to burn out. I work on weeknds, too, so purchasing best learning resources is not a problem. Last week of June through September 1st is holidays, i.e. nothing but coding, and the whole September I'm gonna be working nearly all days and come home probably too tired for anything, but I think I'll manage to sneak in those 30-60 minutes a day so I don't get rusty. Of course - life is life, so not everything will go as planned. But even if you take 80% of that time, it adds up to 600+ hours in total. That's quite a lot if you ask me!  
I'm not new to programming though I'm not an intermediate either. I know the basic concepts, have some problem-solving skills, been studying algorithms recently etc. So, my focus would be on making projects and getting internalizing core concepts of languages and frameworks. I'm sometimes a slow learner when it comes to that. I like to become really, really familiar with something before I can speak about it with confidence.  
So, what do you think, is it achievable? Looking side by side at the calendar and skills that are in demand, it seems to me that I'm overtestimating myself, but then again, it's hard to tell for me tbh. I'd really appreciate your opinions."

I want to be writing code and I hardly do any except for the occasional shell script. Here is the dilemma. I have been at this position for 9 or 10 months, I’m not even eligible for transferring to a new role at the company for another year. I’ve been strongly considering leaving for a new job, but given my lack of experience I would likely have to take a 10k salary reduction as a result. What do I do here? What is more important? Gaining that additional year of experience doing what I want to be doing and struggling to make ends meet?

I'm a third year university student currently doing a part-time internship. I'm doing test engineering and applying to software engineering internships for the summer. 

I finally heard back from somewhere and they want me to send ""a brief code sample (with a short description) of something you worked on that you thought was interesting"". The web dev projects I've done outside of school are not interesting. But at work I've been in charge of making a correlation test program for one of our products, and now it's being used to test thousands of parts overseas. It's a cool feeling and I think would make a good talking point to answer their question.

But, is there anything bad about showing a snippet of code that's being used at my company right now? As in, is it something I'm not allowed to do or will look badly on me? 
Thanks

As of right now I have a 3.22 and I will probably graduate in the range of 3.1-3.2 because of depression.

I have had depression for 8 years now and it never got so bad until recently. I've hit rock bottom and finally admitting it and will try to get help. 

Never the less the damage has been done. I spent my sophomore year and my junior year just coasting by and doing my best while suffering with this illness. Next year will be my last year and I know it isn't looking good for me. When I graduate I will have a rather mediocre GPA and a piece of paper that says B.S. in Finance.

So is this the end of the world for me? I honestly don't even know what I want to do.

I am lost, depressed and the last 8 years have been a blur to be honest...

I have some work experience, but nothing compared to what finance people have. They have internships with big corporate banks. I, on the other hand have done some office assistant work, counseling work and work in my hobbies.

So I guess is this it for me? I mean this is rather sad, I went from someone who was an overachiever in life to someone gradually barely surviving and just trying my best everyday. I use to know what I want, now I am not certain anymore.

What I do know is that I am a unique person. I am good at heart and I fight everyday to keep going and I will fight to make it.

Anyways, thanks for reading if anyone even read this. Tell me what you think, Thanks!

P.S. I guess the only good thing is I will be graduating in 4 years and that I am only 21 as of now, but yeah life is hard and it is beating me up. "

Thank you for taking the time to read my post td:lr is at the bottom. I just got an offer from a software company for my first internship. I accepted this offer because they are offering me the position for my whole summer (16 weeks). I'll refer to this as company A. Most other companies said they are not able to change the dates for various reasons. 

Company A only gave me about one day to respond to their offer so I accepted considering my other offers would not extend past 12 weeks. Then today I got an offer from Company B. 

Company A - Pros:
  *I already accepted their offer
  *Their name recognition is better than Company B
Company A - Cons:
*I cannot take the train their so I would spend a lot of time sitting 
 in traffic
*The pay is less than Company B

Company B - Pros:
*More money
*I could take the train so at least I could use my commuting time 
to be productive.
Company B - Cons:
*The name is less recognizable
*I would have to reneg on the offer I accepted

Both positions to be a SDET

**td;lr** Is it worth it to reneg on an offer at a more well known company that I just accepted for more money and a better commute at a less known company?"

86lygp,0,2018-03-23,Questions About Deciding Between Multiple Great Internships (Atlanta),Squeakerade,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/86lygp/questions_about_deciding_between_multiple_great/,"Hey guys, I'm a long-time lurker and first-time poster here. Sorry for the massive wall of text. I read the FAQ here on how to decide between 2 jobs, however I still have more questions.

&amp;nbsp;

I have 2 main companies I'm interested in working for, both are in Payroll/HR management areas. One company has already extended an offer and would be a summer internship paying WAY more than I expected at $25/hr, which is a lot in my area. The other company would be a 3 semester long co-op, I haven't gotten the offer from them yet however I'm expecting it to be close to the other company or at least negotiable to that point. 

Both of these companies are /roughly/ the same as far as the FAQ goes; They'd both be interesting to work at, I liked both companies about the same, the commute is awful (but it's Atlanta so I'm SOL with any company), benefits at least for interns are the same, etc... The one I have the offer for is a bit more established but I'm not sure how much that matters. My career advisor also pointed out that whichever one I choose if I don't like it I can most likely easily apply after I finish my degree at the other since I'll have experience in a company that's so similar.

&amp;nbsp;

I also have 2 other companies really interested in me.

One of them is so interested that I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. My recruiter said she's incredibly impressed by my resume and will be pushing my name at the meeting they'll be having next week to decide what interns to hire. I have a feeling this is just a tactic to string me along, but I don't know. The one thing is that their Glassdoor reviews all say that they underpay heavily and comparing salaries to the other companies I'd agree. She also quoted me at $8/hr less than the other company and has said it's non-negotiable. I'm pretty sure I'm turning them down but I guess I still want any opinion I can get on this one. If she's really as interested in me as it seems then I feel like I might fit really well there?

As for the last company, I really can't tell where I stand. The interview process went REALLY well, it was a semi-group interview where there were multiple of us there but we had one-on-ones with different people in the company. I think they really liked me because I actually stayed late talking to some of the senior devs. They're a mobile development company and from what I can tell they START roughly $20k more than the payroll companies (Mobile I guess??). I haven't gotten a response from them yet but I'm kind of expecting one. My only concern with them is honestly, they were a little too laid back. They had the kind of open-office ""we have nerf guns and play Foosball a lot"" feeling. Which... Sure that would be fun but I don't know if that's the best environment to intern in? I'm definitely still considering them, but I feel like a laid-back but more conservative team like the 2 payroll companies would be a better learning environment?

86mhz5,34,2018-03-23,"After very careful reflection over many months I have decided with certainty and clarity that suicide is what I want. For me, this reality is simply not worth living in. I'm going this afternoon.",nolamore,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/86mhz5/after_very_careful_reflection_over_many_months_i/,"I remember when I was about five years old and first encountered the idea of dying. It terrified me, the world was so beautiful and full of life and things to do, I was full of wonder and potential. The idea of growing up, making friends and getting a good job with a loving wife and vacations seemed inevitable and exciting. Neither of my parents went to college and they had a fairly nice little house with a garden and a car. 

The world is not like that. The world is brutal and dark, full of corruption and inequality and ultimately lonely. Adults are not the wise and just people I imagined as a child. Most are ignorant and all are selfish to some degree, often to an extreme. 

You don't have anyone. Not *really*. Ok- perhaps you have your mother, or your father if you are lucky. I don't have experience of that myself but I can imagine there is, for some, a biological bond that affords them that unconditional luxury. But your wife? Your husband? Your best friend? You can put everything you have into a relationship and be left out of nowhere if they happen to 'change'. Everyone thinks 'no, not *my* wife', 'not *my* husband' but I've seen it happen a thousand times. The sweetest people have got up and abandoned their spouses when they didn't do anything wrong.

And heaven-forbid you stray from the expected path. Whether it be through illness, unforeseen family crisis or rebellion. Get sick and can't work for a couple of years after college? Congratulations, no employer will want to know you when you get better because they could just hire someone who wasn't as unfortunate! 

Here's the reality of the world. 

My mom was murdered when I was 11 by a group of thugs who stole her purse. My dad became a rage-fuelled alcoholic who was not fit to be around children and ultimately ended up abusing me on a daily basis. He refuses to acknowledge this. I can't be around him in public because he's loud and obnoxious and an embarrassing overt racist and homophobe who will take any opportunity to humiliate me. 

I have anxiety and ptsd from my childhood. I have attempted to overcome this with medical help for many years. It can only work to a degree and meeting new people is a horrible struggle. I can read books at home for days and learn a thousand interesting things but I can never think of what to say when in a conversation with someone I don't know extremely well. 

While I was getting to this stage of 'health', trying all kinds of medications and therapies, I had to take a year out before college, one year out during college and a year out after college to focus on my health. College took all of my efforts to complete but I achieved that with a decent grade in a fairly useless course where I studied a bit of everything, the only redeeming feature is that it happened to be at an Ivy League school.

The sweetest, kindest, most level headed girl I've ever met who constantly told me how lucky she felt to have me and how she couldn't wait to get married, a girl who convinced me to travel the world with her instead of get internships during summer vacations, got a *mortgage* with me and made me a part of her family just ended things without a second thought, without a discussion or an argument, moving straight onto the next boyfriend, a guy 7 years older than me who is infinitely richer and more successful. She won't even hug me now because that would be 'cheating' on her new guy. A week after we broke up her boyfriend came to our apartment- *MY* home that I am paying for and refused to leave. I have never been in a fight in my life but watching someone I put so many years into disrespect me so much put me over the edge and I pushed him out of my front door. They then filed a police report so I have been charged with assaulting someone.. it is like a joke, there is zero compassion on this cold planet. 

I am working as a waiter to pay my rent and barely able to put food into my mouth in terms of groceries so eat leftovers in the restaurant to not go to bed starving. She was the only thing I had that made me really happy. The only person who could stop my panic attacks reliably. 

I have a couple of friends who can distract me for a while and make me laugh, but that's what they are. Distractions. Spending time with them doesn't fulfil me like spending time with her did, although I am grateful to have them and would be there through thick and thin if they needed me, which honestly they don't. 

I've travelled the world. I've been to an Ivy League school. I've given a relationship 100% of my energy only to have it collapse. And now I'm left with few friends and a hellish time making them, incredibly lonely at home, struggling to feed myself and pay the bills in a crappy job working alongside 17 year olds who think I'm joking and refuse to believe me when I tell them where I studied like I'm a delusional psycho. 

I went out to the park this afternoon and looked at the leaves and the insects and the birds, I thought about the countries I've seen and all the things that should fill me with wonder. It just doesn't cut it anymore. The reality of the world I have found myself in is not a kind or forgiving one. "
86ms4o,14,2018-03-23,"What's the difference between experiencing the aftermath of trauma, and experiencing PTSD?",xoyoxoyo,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/86ms4o/whats_the_difference_between_experiencing_the/,"**TW: Rape, sexual violence, suicide, suicide ideation, self harm**

TL;DR: I went through a series of extremely traumatic experiences all one after the other and now have some weird feelings and habits. You can either read all of the post and answer the question at the end, or if you don't have time answer this question:

*what is the difference between PTSD, and recovering 'normally' from trauma?*

When I was 15 I began to feel depressed. I self harmed. One particularly bad episode I got a toothbrush holder (one of those you travel with so barely even sharp) and rubbed it against my skin so hard that at least to or three layers came off. Five years later I still have a scar.

I hid it from my family initially but by the time I was about to turn 17 it became so severe that I was completely suicidal. Fortunately I was also selfless and knew I could never do that to my parents. My plan was to wait until they died and then kill myself, but in the mean time I'd walk by roads and daydream about jumping in front of cars. They were nice but would always end in my Mum finding out and that's when I'd cry. I used to cry a lot, randomly too. I probably spent 5 times as much time crying as I did happy over that year. It got to the stage where hiding it wasn't possible anymore and I genuinely believed I was going to kill myself at some point so I sought help.

At the time it felt long but looking back I recovered quite quickly, especially after I began taking antidepressants (April). In the summer I was still ill but considerably better, and I noticed that my twin sister was ill. It became my mission to get her into some sort of counselling. My parents were in denial. And then the second worst thing happened to me.

It was August at this point and I was on a camping trip with my friends from sixth form. On the first night my best friend sexually assaulted me. I was in shock so I was slow to react. When I got home I talked it through with some friends and they confirmed it was assault. I didn't leave my bed for two days crying. I could feel his hands on my breasts (not figuratively, but actually). I felt so sick. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he was my best friend and in love with me. I felt guilty about the heart ache I imagined him feeling when he found out what he did. I decided to try and be nice about it even though I had such mixed emotions - anger, sadness, guilt, heartbreak. I private messaged him and he was very dismissive and sure of himself. Totally different to how I imagined. And it made me doubt myself. I decided to talk to my school about it so they could put us in separate classes, and if they could gently ask him to avoid me at lunch and stuff.

They passed what I said onto him and he got so angry. He didn't avoid me like I'd requested, we weren't put in separate classes. My sister got so angry at his behaviour that she messaged him asking why he was sitting with me when we said not to. She tried to get him to see how lucky he was we didn't go to the police. He replied something I never even expected. He'd told everyone his version of events. They all backed him. All my best friends. This was particularly surprising because I'd tried to talk to them and they clearly didn't want to engage with me. I felt so betrayed. He borderline threatened us with legal action. It felt like I was being assaulted all over again. I had no idea how anyone could be so cruel.

School was a different story after that. I hated everyone apart from one or two people. I had daily anxiety attacks, that became weekly after a little, and then biweekly. I was completely disengaged but pretended to like people to get shit from them. I used to stir shit and spread rumours about my friends (the ones who backed him) for fun. But every day I'd see him. And I'd feel his hands on me. And I'd listen to him laugh and joke along with people like nothing was going on. And it was horrible.

My twin sister was getting more ill every day. Finally I got my parents to arrange counselling, but we're quite poor so we had to rely on the NHS. We were approaching 18 now so she had to go through the adult services which are shit. She tried, went to appointments, but they did nothing to help her. In April, three weeks after we turned 18 she tried to kill herself at school. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me. It's not particularly a sad day for her but obviously at the time she was going through a lot of upset in general. I was the one who phoned for an ambulance. It isn't like TV where they come straight away. I was sat for two hours with her waiting not knowing whether she'd die before they got there, and trying to stay strong in case she did die, because I didn't want her last image to be me crying.

After my sister's suicide attempt things were looking okay(ish). As in I still hated school but was beginning to make new friends and one of my old ones apologised to me. But there were weekly meltdowns from me or my sister - me because of a series of things like my assailant being accepted to the same world leading university as me (so I couldn't not go), and her because she was mentally ill and experiencing the same trauma as me. One particularly bad time I got sat next to my assailant during an A Level exam after specifically asking not to be. I had to leave the exam hall and the exams officer basically blamed me. I felt more alone than I can convey after this.

Once I left school (with 5A*s which was a fucking miracle after all of this) I did an internship in London. But you have to understand, I was a changed person. I didn't care if I lived or died because everything bad that could happen to someone already happened to me. I went on a night out in London (where I was doing an internship), and got with two different guys (at separate times) - not sex but not just kissing either. The second one raped me. This was my virginity.

Because of my previous experience I knew that I wanted to report it to the police. It made me feel better in the short term but there were downfalls too. Reporting was an exhausting process. I didn't exactly feel trauma, more an overwhelming sense of failure. ""How did my life end up here?"" My suicidal thoughts came back. Every time I got onto the train to go to work I'd imagine jumping in front of it. But I was more resilient. There were less emotions and they were easier to deal with.

University started. Things calmed down a lot (how could they not?) but they were still crazy when I think back. I was obsessed with sex and was getting with people left right and centre. I was caring for my sister, who was at her mental low point during the first term. I was drinking almost daily. I was living the most hedonistic lifestyle and was proud. But it led to so many messed up situations. Guys used my body for sexual pleasure. I felt more and more degraded every time I brought a guy back home. A couple of experiences I had were arguably assault (one many would say I was too drunk to consent, another the guy tried to intimidate me into having sex with him but I stood my ground and said no. That said that night he fingered me whilst I lay completely still. I purposefully let it happen so I consented but I wonder if he knew that. It was after I'd said no to other stuff.) i don't consider myself assaulted during these so just don't think about them or consider them assault, but it should give you an idea of the worth I put on my body.

I was in CBT for the rape at this point but it got cut off due to admin reasons. I realised I had to get better otherwise I could ruin my life. I started studying more. I was still a depressed mess, but I was getting better at it.

I got a 2:1 overall in first year which is okay. During the first term of second year, still completely obsessed with sex but this time not having any, I joined Sex Addicts Anonymous. The meetings helped but I realised I wasn't a real addict and what I had was a result of trauma and sexual assault, so I left. It's the end of second term now. This term I've been really stable and my friends are all completely normal, well-grounded people, but there are weird things I experience:

1. When I was having sexual relations with people, I couldn't have sex. I'm naturally tight and if penetration was attempted I'd close up even more and it'd be so painful
2. Sometimes during kissing someone and stuff like that I'll start crying randomly. Once I even panicked and pushed someone off me, crying, and they'd done nothing wrong.
3. I feel emotionally detached from people. Like I find their pain funny, and I honestly don't care about them unless I know them, and even then for around half of them it only extends as far as ""How can they help me?""
4. When I see my assailant I get severe anxiety
5. I'm not speaking to my sister now
6. I think back to my past and feel overwhelmed
7. And now the most prominent: I feel like I am undercover. Like I'm not actually a normal person and am living a lie. I feel so desperate to lead a normal life that I'm copying what those who are healthy around me do, but I feel like it's only a matter of time before I go back to the way I was.

So far I'm trying to wait that feeling out, to not focus on the bad things, to embrace the lack of emotions, and to leave the sex stuff until I find a boyfriend.

I can't tell if this is just an adjustment period. I feel like my feelings are normal for someone who has been through what I have. But equally, it's been a long time since all of the major trauma and it has gotten better but I'm not completely over it. Counselling isn't an option so please don't suggest that, but I will be seeing a doctor and me and my twin sister will be getting a form of relationship counselling for twins so we can hopefully address *some* of this stuff there.

These are all no-brainers, but as a flighty-art guy I had to put myself through mental boot camp the first semester to make sure I actually did these things.  My first semester back I was at a point, halfway through semester, where I didn't think I could do it.  I was in over my head and was on the cusp of giving up.  I went to my head of my department to talk to him about it, and he asked me where I was having trouble.  He personally talked to me a little about these areas, and pointed me towards resources that could help.  I started spending more time with my classmates, studying with them, learning from them.  By the end of the semester I was no longer drowning in the deep end.

Internships:
They are important, obviously, but I see too many younger/inexperienced people making mistakes with trying to get them.  Of course, we all want an internship in our chosen field, but that is the wrong way to look at this.  An internship is work experience- plain and simple.  Having any work experience is good.  Don't only go for the best, go for literally everything.  Sell yourself!  GPA only matters so much, and soft skills are just as important.  Be confident, be comfortable, present an affable demeanor, and you will be picked ahead of ""better candidates"" who act closed off and nervous.  If you can't get the internship that you want, just get AN internship.  Next year, that experience will pay off when going through applications again.

Careers: 
I may have been late to the game choosing my path, but many of my friends went the traditional route and have had over a decade of experience working as an engineer.  The thing I've found interesting is that ONLY ONE person I know actually got a job in the field that their degree was in.  Everyone else I know got a degree in X Engineering but got a job doing Y Engineering.  This is because that an engineering degree, more than any other degree (in my opinion), is simply a certificate saying ""I Can Handle It"" or ""I Can Be Trained.""  No job is going to expect you to walk in and build their plant from the ground up.  No one is going to ask you to immediately show off a comprehensive FE-level skill set.  In fact, you will never use at least 90% of your college education ever again.  You are forced to learn it to prove that you can, then you are allowed to forget it.  Whatever job you do end up getting will simply train you for the specific role that they want you to do.  People love hiring engineers because we are taught a certain way of thinking.  We are given an insurmountable amount of work, attached to concepts that are mind-bending, and just told to hang in there.  The people that graduate, no matter the GPA, are the ones that didn't give up.  This shows to whoever hires you that they can throw you into something, and you will be able to figure it out, because that's what you've been doing for 4-5 years.

The Rest of Your Life:  Why do you want to be an engineer?  Is it just for money?  The challenge?  Do you want to travel?  Do you want stability?  Are there hobbies that you love that you can't imagine not having time for?  Think about these things, and plan accordingly.  Engineers can make a lot of money, but usually there is a trade off.  Yes, you can make 100K starting at an oil company, but you could be working 70+ hour weeks, and you might be travelling very often.  Or you could start at a ma and pa paper mill for 45-50K, work 40 hours, and have all the time in the world for your family/friends/hobbies.  What is it all worth to you?  These questions should have an answer before you enter the workforce, not while you are applying for jobs.

The ""3 Year Rule:""  Whatever job you take, be prepared to work for three years.  After three years, shop yourself around.  Why?  For people with low GPAs, you will probably not get the top tier-position you want right out of college.  But, guess what, you will get a job.  Work that job for three years, then apply for any job under the sun.  No one will ask to see your transcript.  No one will care.  All that will matter is your work experience and how well you interview. Technically, even one year experience is enough for companies to stop asking for your transcript, but leaving a company after only one year never looks good.  You may not start in the job you want, but you can get there.  Even if you don't, the way to get raises is not to show loyalty to your company.  The way you get raises is to show your value.  If you get a substantial offer for a job, go to your current boss and ask him/her to match it.  If he can, and you want to stay, then it is a win-win.  If he/she can't, then YOU MUST leave (otherwise your bluff will be remembered and will taint you for future promotions).  But the bright side is you will be leaving for a job that has offered you more money.  Be prepared to stay at that job for at least three more years then repeat.  Three years is the minimum standard for staying at a company without looking like a ""high turnover"" prospect, it's also enough time to not make you look like an ass.  If you constantly go to your boss about matching other offers, they will consider you to have one foot out the door and their future recommendation will not be very good to you.  Don't do it ever year or every two, but three is just about right.  I feel like people have a problem doing this.  We think it's a betrayal of some kind, but it isn't.  It's the way the world works.

Salary Negotiations:  This one is simple.  Never offer information first.  If you apply for a job, and they ask how much you want to make, or how much you made at a previous position, you say, ""What is the pay range for the position?""  Then you can negotiate.  They want you tell them a number so that they can immediately haggle down, or just barely offer more, not knowing that their boss will probably give them a bonus later for getting you to work for so little.  Be reasonable, but be firm.  Know your own worth, fight to make a little more than you think you should, and know when to settle on a number.

A caveat to this which is anecdotal- I know a guy who was offered a job at a chemical plant in a rural area of Louisiana.  The money they offered him wasn't bad, but it wasn't quite what he wanted.  They were not allowed to offer him more, but they really wanted him for the job.  The guy was an avid fisherman, and came up with a special agreement.  He loved to fish in tournaments, and wanted a little extra time to prepare for weekend tournament if possible.  They couldn't offer him more money, but they agreed on a specific number of extra half-days he could take every year in order to leave at noon on a Friday and make it to his fishing tournament locations to scout the lake the day before the tournaments started.  The plant didn't have to offer him more money, but he got to have something important to him in the deal that was worth getting less money.  Feel free to think outside of the box when it comes to salary negotiation.


TLDR:  Soft skills are extremely important, sell yourself, don't give up, don't pigeon-hole yourself, and don't be afraid to settle for something now that will help you get what you want later.  You have a long career ahead of you, and there are many paths to getting there.  I am taking one of the most non-traditional paths out there, but my years in corporate bureaucracy have shown me that the game isn't the way a lot of 20-somethings think it is.  If you've gotten to the interview, you've already won.  You just have to be the most charming motherfucker in the world, and they WILL hire you. Good luck everybody!"

I have a ton of schoolwork this semester but have been neglecting it somewhat in favor of personal pursuits/internship applications and practice. I have gotten a couple of responses and interviews however most of them have ended up being dead ends. I'm burnt out and discouraged and don't really feel like doing my schoolwork because I feel like I'm really not getting any validation for it.  I feel great when I get a response from a company but I feel like I've staked a lot of my emotional wellbeing in getting an internship/how I perform in interviews. And seeing as I haven't been faring that well in that respect I'm doubly discouraged. I love to program/learn about cs and I've been working hard but maybe not working smart. Sorry if this post seems a bit disjointed but I don't quite know how to articulate how I feel. Anyway, I guess my question is at this point should I just focus on school and abandon the internship search (I'm almost positive I can get an internship for next summer)? Or should I try to strike a balance (although that's what I've been trying and it hasn't been going super well)?

I know all the benefits of doing an internship, but honestly I would STRONGLY prefer to avoid having to do one. I want to transition from my full-time job to another full-time job.

I live in a decent tech market but I'd be a bit uncomfortable quitting my job to take on a three-month internship with no guarantee I'd be employed at the end. I’m geographically constrained at the moment so I can’t broaden my job search radius very much. My hope is that my personal projects and activities like hackathons would help me to land a full time job in my area, without necessarily having to do an internship. That being said, I am applying to some internships, and will consider one if the right opportunity arises.  Perhaps I just need to accept that I will have to be jobless for a few months. 

Of course I realize that switching careers has inherent and unavoidable risks, I'm just trying to strategize and manage my risk. Anyone have any words of wisdom? Is anyone in my position now? Has anyone been in my position before? What did you do?

I can't say that I have had the same experience. Somebody said that it is either:

* your resume

or


* you are not searching widely enough

How does one get a good resume review? Also, how wide must the search radius be? I am totally open to relocating at this point, but would prefer to be in California if I can. 

Also, is age a factor? I don't want to jump any conclusions about ageism and what not. I feel like some of you guys are probably much savvier about job search than me. That's why you are landing job after job. Just suggest some pointers on how to get a good resume review done. That is Part One. We can do Part Two and Part Three later.

(1) Update: I have been really getting into Data Science. I would love to work in that area... Python, Java, I don't care. I love NumPy, Pandas, data wrangling, modeling, deployment, everything.... 


(2) Second update: All the stuff under ""Second Update"" is supposed to be meant in humor, but I don't know if the humor is going to come across.

&lt;second_update&gt;
I particularly like Pythonic code. Python's libraries are pretty awesome too... I divide my development experience into two parts: the pre-Python years and the post-Python months.... I realize that all the years before Python, I was living a lie... Python programming is what coding is supposed to be like...You can either like Python or say it is the best language ever. Or you can be wrong. Super wrong. It is your choice ;-)

&lt;/second_update&gt;

(3) Third update: Please note that everything I said about Python up there under ""Second Update"" was meant to be in humor. Poe's Law of the Internet applies. Please note that everything I said up there is so obviously extreme that I was hoping nobody would mistake it for the real thing. Don't read that bit literally. I know that I am going to get a lot of flak for saying that. Let me start a new thread someplace for people who want to argue about that. I don't know if it will work, but it will help keep this thread clean.

(4) Fourth Update: @ASecretDragoon brought up an important point. I am not really very specialized. I am willing to work on just about anything Data Science. I have also picked up a lot of background in Java programming. I would love to pick up a job doing Spring / Struts or some other Java framework. e.g. Hadoop. (Learning Hadoop was a lot of fun. I would recommend everyone to learn a bit of Hadoop.)

(5) Fifth update: Talking to you guys was super helpful. After thinking about this a bit, I now see what so many other people are doing. Mostly, it seems to be: (a) trying to get internships in the area of choice; (b) learning the new technologies really, really well; and (c) going through the interview process. 

I realize that my best strategy is the following:
(i) I should just double down on my existing certifications and my existing knowledge.
(ii) Look for Database Administrator jobs too (maybe even Hadoop administrator jobs)

I have extensive experience with databases. And I love working around data. Why not just do that?

(6) Sixth update: @RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS - as far as I have seen, the prep work for Google / Facebook is not that different from prep work for the smaller companies. I would even go so far as to say that, for me, it was pretty much exactly the same. I don't even find the Google Interviews harder. My biggest problem is that the interviewers talk too much during my coding interview, and it is very difficult to code when someone is trying to get you to code things just this way. If only I could have a ""Pause button"" on the interviewer.

(7) Seventh update: I have designed a new programming language called Desi Java / Desi Python. It has the following new keywords:

- beg_pardon_q
- what_you_opine_q
- can_you_please_be_quieting_I_be_coding__q (also, quiet_time_now_please__q )
- timepass

https://www.google.com/search?q=indian+english+%22beg+pardon%22+%22what+you+opine%3F%22&amp;rlz=1CAACAJ_enUS789US789&amp;oq=indian+english+%22beg+pardon%22+%22what+you+opine%3F%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.8912j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8

You can insert these keywords anywhere in your code. It is equivalent to Python's pass in terms of semantics. It means you want the interviewer to :

- repeat what he or she said
- ask him or her for an opinion
- ask him or her to be quiet
- continue doing what he or she is doing. Equivalent to pass, but more fun. 

I will share my code on GitHub.

(8) Eighth update: 

Technical specifications: 

* Desi Java/ Desi Python is a version of Java/Python where the precompiler strips out certain keywords.
* These keywords are a part of the language, however. They can be used by the programmer any time and any where they feel like using them.
* Any lines containing the keywords are also stripped out.

Note: 
(1) It is not an exact equivalent to Python's ""pass"". All the keywords are stripped out in the precompilation phase. In fact, the entire line of code is simply deleted.

(9) Ninth update:

TL;DR -

* I have designed a new system for interviews based on my Google Foo Bar Challenge experience. 
* The major advantage that the Google Foo Bar Challenge interface offers is that it does not keep yakking at you - while you are coding.
* I believe I have future proofed my post-Google Foo Bar Challenge interviewing experience (at ALL companies) as a result.

Summers drawing close and the only internship that seemed to display any sort of interest in me is this QA position at a bank with about ~800 Glassdoor reviews. From the previous phone interview I got the idea that I almost definitely won't be writing much code (he pointed out the languages I put on my resume and hinted towards them not going to be used). It seemed like I would be doing something similar to helping a team out with the SDLC of certain projects/tasks up to the design stage.

My original plan for a no internship summer was just to study and make another project, but I know with all that free time I am going to spend a significant portion of it sleeping/YouTube/League honestly. People talk a lot of shit about QA, but I am a freshman so I can't really be picky, so I am a unsure about what to do.

86tx9a,75,2018-03-24,I got a job offer! They seem very enthused and offered more than they initially quoted. Should I still make a counter offer? Are they playing mind games?,inkysquares,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/86tx9a/i_got_a_job_offer_they_seem_very_enthused_and/,"I interviewed for a large company this past week and found out yesterday that they want to offer me the job. Great! I'm thrilled! I am curious however if the recruiter for this position is being genuine or using some type of strategy to prevent a counter offer.

During the interview the hiring manager mentioned at one point that he had some interns who were killing it right now who were also applying for this position. I left the interview feeling kind of bummed and like I didn't have a shot after he said that. This definitely made me want the job more and made it seem much more sought after or valuable.

The next day comes around and I have a follow up with the recruiter. She says stuff about how ""I was wondering if you got the same warm fuzzy feelings from us that we got from you"" and some other compliments. Says the salary range is between 45 and 50 for this position. I tell her that I make about that much now, but I work like 70 hours to do so and this job would be 40 hours per week. She also says they could possibly help with relocation but it's unlikely. She said I can expect to receive an offer by the end of the day on Wednesday.

I didn't hear back from her again until Friday. She calls me and says, ""Well, unfortunately you're only one of the top 5 candidates that we've interviewed in the last 10 years"" in a joking voice. Says the hiring manager is usually very stern and reserved but he is very excited to have me work there. She then gives a verbal offer of 58k with 1k as a relocation signing bonus. She says, ""We're offering this much more because we really want you and don't want you to even have to think about it before saying yes.""

I told her I would have an answer for her on Monday.

Now I'm thrilled for this position and will absolutely say yes. I'm curious if all of what she is saying is genuine though or if they do this routine with all of their candidates so that they get excited about more pay and don't even bother counter offering. An ""under sell, over deliver"" type thing. 

I don't need this job as I'm comfortable where I am, but I think I have a lot more potential for career growth here and the pay will now be higher. Would you accept or would you counter offer?"

86ve8t,26,2018-03-24,"If you are planning to major in a Computer Science related field, the ranking of your university doesn’t matter as much as you think",Corgi727,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/86ve8t/if_you_are_planning_to_major_in_a_computer/,"However, I will suggest that location matters. 

Background: I’m currently a Junior computer science major at a regional San Francisco Bay Area University who transferred from a top 20 university in the Midwest. I do not regret this decision one bit. 

Like many people in this sub, I believed that attending a top 20 university was the epitome of success, however, once you actually get to University, you will find out that a lot more goes into whether or not you will become successful. I found that the school I was attending wasn’t the best fit for me despite its prestige. If you were rejected from top 20 universities and the UCs or don’t think you will get in, that is okay! You do not need to attend these schools to do well in CS. In fact, most of what factors into your success in CS is: research, side projects, and internships. Mainly internships.

Obviously, attending top universities will help you get internships with a top school on your resume, but even if you don’t, attending a school nearby a large number of tech companies (such as the Bay Area, Seattle, Austin, etc) will still help you. Companies will recruit from universities close by to them even though they’re not necessarily prestigious just because it costs them very little to visit them. My school had companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Adobe at job fairs just because we were in the Bay Area. I’ve interned at Fortune 100 companies and my friends have interned at Google and Apple.  

So, if you’re a junior in high school right now and are interested in CS, go ahead and apply to top schools like MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, etc. but DEFINITELY also apply to regional universities near tech hubs like San Jose State, Santa Clara,  San Francisco State, etc. and attend those schools if you don’t get in to the top choices.  If you are a senior interested in CS getting rejected from your top choices, but did get into regional universities near tech hubs, definitely go to them if you can! CS is a field less emphasized on prestige but more on what you can actually do. Just work hard and hustle while in college and you will be fine.

I have now been admitted to my program :)

Hello, I am kind of standing on my last leg here in terms of life. I need somebody to talk to about it. Some background: I went to a small high school in southern Illinois. I was the only black man in my graduating class of 180. I went to this school from kindergarten to senior year, so I knew nothing else. My sisters, on the other hand, did know something else. They left for a selective boarding school, after only a few years of attending the school that I graduated from. While in school, I, obviously, received some of the slight discrimination all black people face, but I did not realize how much it had affected me until later on. Both of my sisters, who graduated from their more diverse boarding schools, were admitted to ivies, think Harvard, Yale, Princeton. I, however, did not even want to go to college. (This was in 2016, and I knew nothing of Reddit's r/a2c, r/act or r/sat.) I wanted to be a rapper. I feel ashamed for even typing it, but it is truth. I even set up a performance, by myself, and performed solo in front of my entire high school of 800 students. I was successful, but I put all my energy into things like that instead of focusing on my grades. Now, it is really biting me in the ass. I, eventually, did go to college, but to a very insignificant one. I was not focused, anyway, because of rap, and did poorly. After the first semester, I withdrew. What led me to withdraw was, finally, realizing I was fucking up big time. I am not black by the American terms but am more so of African descent: an African born in America. None of what my classmates expected of me was what I even knew of: sagging pants, doing drugs, talking ghetto and, most importantly, rapping. I say this to say, in my time off, I realized I had been kind of brainwashed. As a result, I tried to save my self. I retook my ACT (26 from a 22), browsed academic subreddits constantly and found a university program that I really thought I was cut out for. I spent almost a year preparing. (I even went to Africa to find myself!) This is how the program is supposed to work: you get admitted to the program and with this admission you are considered as a student at the big university (you can put it on your resume, use it for internships, join any registered student organizations, use the big university's facilities etc..), even though you will be taking your first two years at the nearby community college. As long as you keep a decent GPA, after the two years, you are guaranteed matriculation to the major of your choice at the big accredited university, without the hassle of applying for a transfer. The standards for the program are significantly lower than the normal qualifications to the big university's engineering college—where I applied to. I thought, since the program's mission is to bring under represented minorities to the school, I would be a shoe in, but no. I was denied. I just want to die. I did alright in high school, not amazing—due to me wanting to rap. But it is the reason I got denied. Words cannot describe how much pain and tireless efforts I endured to gain acceptance to this program. I feel like a total failure. Not to my parents or friends, but to myself! I had this concrete plan to get my degree, go to France for my masters, become a French citizen and maybe start a family there, so my children would not have to experience non-inclusion and race related issues I did here. Irrational, yes. But it was something I would fight for. Now, I feel like I am on a sinking ship. I feel like I am being punished for a crime I did not commit. I have the opportunity to speak with the creator of the program on Wednesday, but I am afraid she will want me to switch my major, which is not an option—I must be an engineering major to be a good candidate for my France master.

I am usually quiet, and think about my decisions to its end, but receiving my denial has broken me. I never post to Reddit, let alone ask for help, but this may be the help I need to calm down. Any constructive comment helps. I am Catholic and do not want to kill myself, but I am desperate to permanently escape my pain. Thank you.

P.S. I called the hotline but they hung up on me :("

I'm currently in my third year of school, doing general engineering, and by general, I really mean just that, I study Physics as well as Maths (In addition to Financial Mathematics, that I took up in a semester abroad earlier this year) and Computer Science. Given that I'm in France, I still have two years to go for my engineering degree (5 years), and I'm specializing in financial engineering starting next year.

I've recently had a presentation for a double diploma I could get in my fifth year, a master's degree in private equity, venture capital and entrepreneurship at UIC Barcelona. 

This was a bit of an eye opening moment. I realised that although doing quantitative analysis would've been interesting (I would've taken a quantitative finance Master's degree then) , or even specializing in blockchain technology which is a subject that I am passionate about, Private Equity/Venture Capital would allow me to make use of my engineering background all the while being able to work ""in"" different fields.

I am very curious, and somewhat an extrovert, so I feel like that would be something that would fit me.

I would like to know, first of all, what you guys think about the path I'm thinking of pursuing. And if I choose to do so, what types of internships to do the next two years, so a 5 month internship next year and another 6 month internship during the year after that in the context of the double diploma.

I searched for posts from people in a similar situation as me but couldn't find much useful information. I'm really at a loss regarding my situation and would appreciate any help from experienced people or people who have been in a similar situation

tl;dr: company I work for seems to have great people and cares about the employees but I don't think I will gain any valuable software development experience

Some background about me: I studied computer science at a fairly reputable university in Canada (I'm in Canada if that makes a difference). I never had any professional or internship experience and got 2 interviews in the months of job searching I did after I graduated. Needless to say, I was very excited when I got an offer from a company that had great reviews when I researched it.

The problem is the role: my job consists of transforming things on a paper to things on the web. The problem with that platform is that it's bad and utilizes JScript and very basic html tags. Lots of copy pasting is also involved. I was under the impression that I will be working with JavaScript and HTML (that was mentioned in the job posting) and the reason I took the job was so I can learn about web technologies and grow as a software programmer. But this place, hard coding is actually encouraged for the sake of accuracy. Right now, I feel like I would not gain any development experience. Granted, I just started but the small amount of coding I do is trivial (I learnt more about JS when I was studying for interviews) and I do not see myself growing as a programmer based on what my more senior colleagues do and tell me. I'm also worried I'll develop bad coding habits.

Now, the company is very open (been told by senior people and the CEO himself) and I was told that the company welcomes employee opinions and values employee growth. (I hope this isn't a trap or anything as I read that is what company tends to say on some posts) I've been thinking that I should talk to my manager about growth. The people here really seems to be friendly and open but this is my first job experience so I'm not sure if there is any underlying do's and don'ts at a company. I can always take the risk because I don't see myself losing anything at this point.

My question is if my manager does not give me the impression that I can grow at this company, how long should I stay? When should I start looking elsewhere? Do I keep the job until I find a new job? And what can I do in the meantime?

Based on my job searching experience so far, work experience is very very important but how important is work experience if the work I do is like this? After thinking about it for a bit, a plan that I came up with is learn languages and do side projects in my free time (after work because this is a fairly fast paced place and I don't think I will have free time on the job). This will require a great amount of motivation. At the same time, I do think staying for a bit will let me gain some real world experience. Thoughts? Suggestions?"

I keep reading that you should apply to 20 jobs a day, but due to my class standing I have only been able to apply for 3 in total.

So yeah, obviously most master's students should just go get full time positions since (most of us, I assume) have night classes.

My school as a program where if you have a bachelor's in an unrelated field (for me, social sciences/humanities) you can do the pre-reqs and do the remaining master's classes and finish with a master's. The master's classes always have ~5 grad students and ~25 undergrads so you might as well.

I love my school, the program, and what I'm learning. I'm just not sure what exactly to do for work experience before graduating.

I had an internship while doing undergrad prereqs but now my class standing is 'master's student' and most internships are for undergrads. I tried to get a full time job and when the companies looked at my resume and school situation they said I would not be qualified for a full time job and should instead seek an internship.

...but I'm barred from most internships since I'm a grad student!

I found ~3 internships where I could apply, which I did, and got rejected from 1 a week later. The second, the one I want, I applied 3 weeks ago and haven't heard back. I talked to this company at our career fair, dropped off my resume, and applied online. They said they won't reply if someone is rejected so I don't know how to proceed from here. The third I am going to apply today.

What do I do if I can't get an internship? I just feel so weird that ~6 years after switching careers I might graduate with a master's but one very general IT internship. If I can't get one this summer then I want to do the OSCP/maybe OSCE so I can say I did SOMETHING and since I've been wanting to do those, but I'm worried I won't be able to get a job when I graduate.

So what should I do? Should I reach out to that second company even if they said they won't respond to reject? If I don't get an internship this summer (my last summer) will that damn me for looking for a full time job a year from now? 

I've been meeting with our CS department's career counselor and she said it would be tough to find something but there were a few who take a very limited number of grad students. I am going to meet with her again also."

While I did get accepted to other UCs, UCD is the only school where I am guaranteed a CS major (others put me as undeclared). It was never my first choice, but after hearing some good things about CS there, I may just up end going here to pursue my degree.
I have a few questions about CS at UCD:
1) Have you or do you know anyone who really regrets going to UCD for CS? I'm not talking about those who drop out because it's too difficult, because that's understandable and in my case, I've been programming for years and plan to really work hard in college for my CS degree. I'm talking about if the quality of education for CS there is poor/is difficult to get internships and or jobs after going there.
2) On the subject of internships, how hard is it to get a CS internship? Do recruiters look favorably/unfavorably at UC Davis students or does school name really not matter? Finally, is it rare for freshman to land an internship during the summer?
3) I've heard that once you need to take upper division courses, you sometimes get stuck on a waitlist. How often is this true, and is it burdensome?
4) For those who did obtain a CS degree at Davis, any extra advice/tips/answers would be greatly appreciated."

I will be applying to schools in the fall so I cannot speak to if my academic and professional record will qualify me for T25 or not, but being realistic, I have to say my credentials are only average or slightly above average.  Without going into it too much I have a 3.3 GPA from a respected public university, 310 GRE, and 5 years experience as senior associate at an advertising agency servicing a Fortune 50 client.  

My credentials fit the range of most class profiles in the latter half of the T50 schools, but I don't see these impressing anybody when I am competing against the likes of Google and Facebook employees for a limited number of spots.  I am okay with that and have worked my ass off to get to where I am and get the grades I did but am now feeling at a loss about my future prospects.  It’s a fact that not all of us can go to a T25 and the reason for choosing from these schools is that you are paying for the network.  I know for a fact two employees who left my company in the past year to go to nearby Zicklin – now ranked #55 – and instantly started paid internships at an S&amp;P 100 component finance/insurance firm.  Sounds like a pretty good network to me for being outside the T50?   

The “strategy” work I do at my current job is mainly allocating pre determined budgets and campaign implementation.  I am tired of doing this and am having a difficult time leveraging what I do to move into a new area in my field and need the MBA to open up a new network and opportunities.  I see a lot of T50 schools that seem like great fits for me but I’ve become inundated with pleas that it isn’t worth it.  I have reached my peak of languishing in the position I am currently at a loss.  

Do I imagine myself working at Google or Goldman Sachs coming out of my MBA?  No.  Yet I feel I am interpreting this must go T25 situation fairly inaccurately.  

If anyone can impart some wisdom from experience I would greatly appreciate it.

He's looking for SWE roles, and he wants to know which companies would be most receptive to hiring someone with his background.

He is kind of new to programming, but he has been grinding LeetCode for a little while, and we have been working on some small projects together for our GitHub's. He had one internship before, but it didn't have anything to do with software engineering.

I suggested that he focus his applications on new grad SWE roles at huge tech companies like the Big N, as well as quantitative trading firms. I figured that companies like this might be interested in his unique background, and they have deep pockets, so they wouldn't mind teaching him about engineering from the ground up.

Since he graduated from his program a few months back he has:

1)     Phone interviewed with a very competitive AI/ML company, who noted that they would have preferred if he had a stronger background in computational geometry (?) and systems
 
2)     Phone interviewed with a notable prop trading firm, but although he applied for the SWE role, they interviewed him for a trading role. He had a bit of an off day, and it didn't end up working out

Apart from that he's been having some trouble getting interviews. Should he be applying to different sorts of companies? Should he apply for internships? Or should he consider going back to school or participating in a bootcamp?

The other two are a little too costly, and I was waitlisted/declined by the rest but it doesn't matter to me. Background information on athe questions are below the three main questions are below them.

I want to know which would be the best for me based on a few select criteria: 

1) What is the best option for someone hoping to be a Mechanical Engineer? Also, which is the best bang for the buck? 

2) Which is the best place to be if I am someone who is really social, or need to be around other people to be happy? I'm not much of a party-goer but I can get crazy if the opportunity arises. Usually, I'm just a quiet guy who enjoys the company of close friends.

3) If I intend to move out of the University living spaces and into possibly cheaper locations in other parts of the city, which location would offer the cheapest yet best housing?




Here's some background information:

I'm a pretty social guy, I moved to the US from another country and I kinda need human interaction to stay happy. My first year and a half here weren't the best. That's why I'm not too keen on going to FIT and Mercer given that I'd have to start making friends from the very beginning as none of my current friends are going there. UCF is an enormous school and I do like Orlando; however, I don't want to write Melbourne and Macon off just because I'm not familiar with the areas.


I'm going for a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I know FIT and UCF offer great internships due to their locations, so I've been leaning towards them a little more than the other. FIT and Mercer would provide smaller class sizes which would be a plus, but in all honesty I don't care for it much. 

Now, I want to touch on finances a little. I didn't get any scholarships from UCF, but I did for the other two. After financial aid and scholarships, my annual costs for the FIT, UCF, and Mercer add up to be around $18000, $15000, and $21000 respectively. This is excluding loans which would reduce it by around $5000, and me working part-time. Fortunately, my parents will be paying for the bulk of the cost.  

What do you all think?

My stats are good- I got a 1470 on the PSAT this year, and Friday I was shocked to see that my SAT score from March 10 was 1550. Currently I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA, took no APs freshman year, but this year am taking APWH and AP Calc BC. 

Freshman year I realized that although I may be smart, I wasn't doing anything as far as ECs. So I decided to do XC, and started running over the summer. (My PR this season is 22:33) I do long distance track now as well. (5:55 1600m PR) Sometime along this process I developed the goal of getting a sub 17 5K, mainly for the app. I figured that because I was late on this whole extracurricular thing, I didn't have much chance to be club president, so 'I'd just put the work in for running.

The problem is with a ""class"" I want to take next year. See, the county runs an internship program for high school students, where 2 days a week they work at an internship from 2-5 PM. It's in a field chosen by the student. (Mine being Computer Science) 

Obviously this would make being on varsity sports impossible, because practice is 5 days a week. So I have to choose between sports and an internship. Keep in mind that if I do choose the internship/drop sports, that would open up opportunities for other ECs (I'm interested in Math team, partly because it's good practice for the AMC, which I'm trying to advance to at least the AIME, and am planning on studying for it over the summer. Also Academic Team.) Another thing is it gives me more time (on the other 3 days 7th period is free+ no longer spending 2 hours practicing), which is especially needed as my schedule junior year is tough: 
*AP Physics, AP Lang (2 hard APs) 
*AP Comp Sci, APUSH (2 easy APs, APWH so far has been very easy) 
*Internship (if don't do the internship I'll either do AP Latin or AP Psych
*and to continue math I have to Dual Enroll at Georgia Tech(That's why I took the SAT)
...and a little extra free time couldn't hurt

So what is better, sports, or doing things that show you're interested in your major? Which would look better on a college app? 
Any other thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post. To anyone who took the time to read all of this, bravo and thank you.


**TL;DR:** Sophomore shooting for top colleges(1550 SAT, 4.0 GPA rn), is doing alright in XC &amp; Track currently with aspirations of great times for dat application, but has opportunity to take an internship (counts as class) after school in my field of interest, must choose between sports/internship+ability to do other ECs. Internship+other ECs show interest in major.

* probably should have tried harder for an internship 

**Demographic and other info:**

**Other Stuff on my app that might have helped:**

* I took all of the AP Sciences offered at my school (Bio, Chem, Physics C Mech, and APES. 
* I was in a 3 year engineering program at my school where we learned how to operate machines, 3D modeling with Solidwoks, drafting with Autocad, and 3D printing.
* I tried to show that I wasn't slacking off my taking 7 AP's (Calc AB, APES, Bio, Physics, Gov, Econ, Lit) even though I was definitely slacking off in them. Most colleges don't see your senior year grades until after you are accepted, they just see what you're taking. That doesn't mean to get C's cause you can still get rescinded for that but it doesn't mean you need to have all A's.

Good luck and if you have any questions on applying to these schools or want me to elaborate on something let me know :)

I noticed that you have to be of the type who are over excited and with lot of energy all the time to make it an “awesome” experience here. There are some clubs that I tried to join and literally failed in all of them.  Your luck on that depends on if you are of the type club members are. 

Most of the traumatizing comes from academic life. It doesn’t matter if profs care about you or not, the system itself is depression-brooding. Constantly you have to run after assignments and exams. And even worse the pressure to be an all-rounder: get the academic game strong so that you can get to a good grad school and also don’t forget to get some extracurriculars under your belt so that employees get attracted. O and the most important thing, get a summer internship so that you actually get a job after graduation! And to get a summer internship you must have done some “personal” projects! Just crazy!!

87644m,1,2018-03-25,I'm most likely leaving university to pursue my dream of being a cosmetologist. It's painful. How do I know what is right?,col0rlesslife,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/87644m/im_most_likely_leaving_university_to_pursue_my/,"tldr; 21 yo F junior in university, miserable and will be unable to work upon graduation without attending law school or getting a masters. Dream has always been cosmo school and working with hair, but didn't pursue because I was afraid people would look down on me. Should I quit and get my license and be happy, or continue college depressed and jobless?

Hi, Reddit. This is going to be semi-long, so apologies.
I am a 21 year old female. I started community college in 2014 and in 2016 transferred to my ""dream"" university to obtain a degree in pre-law, as my experience volunteering for campaigns during the election year really inspired me. My first several semesters were amazing! I joined the honors college, made the Dean's list, became semi-active in my political party's club and while the stress of working and attending a difficult program, I was inspired. However, my dream has always been to work with hair. My grandmother is a cosmetologist, and you could argue I've been apprenticing with her since I was five. Despite my grandmother making much more money than my grandfather (I remember her buying a Mercedes with cash, ""just cause"", and still having plenty of savings. Upper middle class, basically), when I wanted to attend after graduating high school early, I was told that I was ""too smart not to attend college."" I had no idea what I wanted to get a degree in, hence the decision to attend community college until I figured it out. Throughout my entire college career, I've worked as a waitress and an assistant manager at a beauty supply company. I've done my own hair and literally every single one of my friends and family member's since I was probably thirteen. It comes naturally to me, I love it, and I am good at it. 
Fast forward to now: I failed my first class last semester. I was going through a lot of depression and anxiety in general, but I also feel that it stemmed from being burnt out, and realizing there was literally NO way that I'd be able to get a job upon graduation without having to attend graduate school or go to law school. I've been lucky enough to have my father assist me with my tuition, but would pay my own way through anything else. This semester I've had to drop down to a mere three classes from my usual six because I cry every day and worry 24/7, causing me to not be able to sleep. (I'm with a therapist and she's great, we're working on this.) I had an advising appointment last week and my advisor spent the entire session basically telling me that if I had no plans to take the GRE/LSAT, anything outside of an unpaid internship or a minimum-wage data entry position would be impossible to obtain. Now I know that I should have already known this, but my plan was that I would take the paralegal exam after graduation. This is apparently no longer an option unless I wanted to attend community college AGAIN across the state due to accrediting issues. Throughout this entire experience, I have always planned to obtain my cosmetology license in order to have something to do on the side to save up for law school or grad school.
I called my dad devastated and told him I was now planning to immediately attend Paul Mitchell or Aveda upon graduating because I wanted to be independent- I'm sick of asking everyone for help. I don't want to burden him past my graduation after everything he's done for me. I was very nervous; I basically only did this to make him proud and now I feel like I've failed him.
My father's response shocked me. He told me he'd been thinking after I styled his girlfriend's hair last week that I'd be so good in this field and that most importantly, I would be happy. Shockingly, he suggested that I quit my university and immediately go to cosmo school- he even asked me to please let him fund this so that I can start my life. I responded that I didn't want the past three years of my hard work and his money to go to waste, and he told me that it wasn't a waste, I could always go back later in life, and that he'd rather it be three years than four. I think my family can tell how depressed I've been over school, but this shocked me. We talked for hours about this (a rarity) and he is practically begging me to apply to Paul Mitchell and start as soon as possible. I am a second semester junior; I still need 45 hours to graduate, (roughly a year and a half.) He told me I could either be graduating then, with no job and unhappy, or I could be working in a salon doing what I love and making a very livable wage. 
I'm so conflicted; he left this decision up to me, but I've been so sick all day. I felt like a weight was lifted off of me when he brought this up to me, because I had never even considered this as an option. My mind operates on a ""I MUST finish school or I am a failure, I MUST get this degree I cannot and will not use without four to six more years of school or I am a disappointment and no one will ever be proud"" agenda and I'm afraid to try this and be happy. I get excited imagining this, but want to think it through. I've weighed all the pros and cons and I feel like pursuing hair would be the best option for me. Can I please have your thoughts?"
87675e,4,2018-03-25,"I feel lost; like I need to restart my life, but I don't know how",elchido2012,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/87675e/i_feel_lost_like_i_need_to_restart_my_life_but_i/,"My story is pretty convoluted so this may get long, apologies in advance, but thank you as well to anyone who is willing to read it.

I am a 2016 graduate of UC Berkeley with a BA in Integrative Biology (focused on wildlife biology/ecology). I chose this field thinking job opportunities would be pretty plentiful upon graduating, so I didn't think anything of it. Meanwhile, I slacked off when it came to studying, and I often skipped lectures that I didn't think were essential. Because of this, I did not cultivate a ton of relationships with professors or mentors, nor did I earn top grades (much of my transcript consists of low Bs and Cs...). I shot myself in the foot, I know...

However, I did participate in an internship in the summer of 2014, doing scuba research as an undergraduate research assistant on octopuses in Southern California. This was an amazing experience, as I loved diving and the work was fantastic. Unfortunately, this also coincided with the onset of bad panic attacks, so I cut my internship short out of fear that something would happen to me on a dive. To this day, I still haven't dived more than a few times since due to that same fear.

In any case, the graduate candidate I worked for allowed me to continue as a lab assistant through the school year as she finished her work. After a year, though, we fell out of touch, and now I feel awkward about reaching out to her for help. That was the only internship I did while I was in school, and I feel as though it were a waste.

Cut to senior year, 2015-2016. I managed to land a summer job right after graduating as a lab assistant for an entomological research group. I held this job for 3 months before finding another opportunity, but I was friendly with my boss and I still feel like I can reach out to him, at least better than the grad student I interned for.

The job I held after this was for the USDA in the San Francisco Bay Area, also doing entomological research as a lab technician. While working there, I became well established as our lab's greenhouse manager, and I even helped to train interns and other technicians on the research methods and maintenance protocols, while also serving as a field assistant for our data collection trips. I was generally regarded as a hard worker, but I struggled to really form a solid relationship with my boss. He was very nice to me, but I am somewhat of a nervous employee so I act very subservient to my employers (which is probably not a good thing).

Due to a failing relationship and a feeling of desperation, like I **didn't know what the hell I was doing with my life**, I left my job, my girlfriend of 2.5 years, and all of my friends behind in California to move to South Florida to be with my family. My idea was to save money while working for about a year (or maybe two) and then move out when I had a solid rainy day fund, something I couldn't do in San Francisco with the cost of living there, and the fact that I constantly spent money with my girlfriend and our friends (who made much more than me, I should add, so it was hard to keep up...).

Long story short, I realize I had assumed to much when I thought I could easily find a job in my field of expertise (lab tech/wildlife bio research) once I made it here. But it turns out, I am **really bad at applying for jobs, selling myself, and staying motivated**, not to mention the place where I live (Jupiter, FL) is sort of a dead zone, but maybe that's just an excuse. I left in August, attempted to find work for about a month in my field, but settled for... working at Whole Foods in the deli department because they would hire me... which, after earning a degree from a prestigious university, is definitely not what I expected to be doing at this point.

So, my question is: How do I get my life back on track? I left what was pretty much my whole life back in California, and now I feel so lost, even helpless. I don't really know what I want to do anymore, whether it's lab research or going back to school or whatever, especially because my retail job is physically draining and leaves me too exhausted to be motivated at the end of the day. Not to mention, rejection after rejection from jobs that seem promising are very demoralizing, and make me feel like I can't achieve anything. I'm sure this sounds like quite a sob story, and it isn't meant to be. I just am wondering if anyone has gone through something similar and found a way to turn it around. I have no goals for myself other than trying to get out of this town and on to a major metropolitan area where maybe I will have better luck finding work, but I don't know how to get there (and I also feel dumb because I... was already in one).

If you have read all of that and can provide any advice to a complete stranger, you have my deepest gratitude. I know it was a lot, and was rather confusing so please let me know if I can provide any extrapolation. Thank you to those who read 'til the end.

**TL;DR: Graduated from a top university in a STEM field, with some internship and work experience, but I quit a decent job and left my life behind to start fresh. Now I feel like I've made a mistake in trying to restart my life, and that I've created a dead end for myself rather than an opportunity due to my impulse to leave. Any advice for someone with my knowledge, skills, and experience to try and turn this situation around?**"
876aay,1,2018-03-26,UF or UCF?,haleywinters,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/876aay/uf_or_ucf/,"I've been accepted into both UCF and UF. UCF has offered me the provost scholarship ($30,000) and I was accepted into the Burnett Honors College while UF hasn't offered me anything. I also have bright futures, so my tuition would be paid for in full for both universities. However, the only issue would be paying for housing, food, etc. I'm trying to weigh my pros and cons, but there's several for both.

I know UF is the more established and higher ranked school, which is why I'm currently leaning towards UF. It's mainly for academic reasons since I'm planning to major in science and go for medical school because their program is significantly better than UCF's. And if it wasn't a financial reason, UF would be my choice hands down. However, the scholarship for UCF is definitely pulling me in because it means I basically have a full-ride with everything paid for. I visited both colleges and I love the feel of UCF a lot more than UF's college town atmosphere. But I can definitely tolerate UF because I'm open for a new experience and if it'll get me where I want to be, then I'm all in. My sister also attends UF, but on a full ride because she's a National Merit Finalist, so it would be a bonus if we went to the same college.

Basically, I was wondering if I would regret turning down $30k in the future just because UF has the larger recognition and more opportunities/connections for internships, jobs offers, etc. I know UCF has opportunities mainly in Orlando, but UF has multiple internships and opportunities for their students over the summer all over FL or even out of state.

But, theoretically, let's say I do good at either schools. Would it be worth it to accumulate debt at UF for undergrad or have none at UCF? Would my chances at getting into medical schools be lowered if I attend UCF?

Thank you !!"

I'm currently in college for firefighting/ems (Bachelors degree), and living in the not so great state of Illinois. I'm graduating next year and have my internship during the spring semester and i'm still looking for my internship location. Originally, I was going to stay in Illinois, but decided that with the lack of nature and ridiculous population (I live in Chicagoland) that I just can't see myself being happy here.

Basically, i'm going to list the types of thing i'm looking for, or what's important to me and i'm hoping some of you might have some insight on what states might be worth looking into, or even getting down to certain cities or towns that you know of.

To start, my major is basically dictating where I live to a certain extent. I have to be in a somewhat populated area so that I can find a job relating to my degree. This isn't to say that I want to live in a big city, because I don't, but populated suburbs are a must due to the fact that fire departments and EMS services don't hire very regularly, and I have to have different options. I typically lean more conservative on most financial things, and i'm pretty moderate on social things. I'm really looking for a state where I can get back to nature, as well as having a house with some land eventually. I love the North woods, mountains, lakes, and forest in general (I don't need all of these in the same place to be happy). Fishing is a massive hobby for me (Lakes and Rivers where I can eat what I catch without mutating from the pollution is a major plus), as is growing my own food to a certain extent (Just your basic vegetables and such, Knocking out desert states as well). I don't mind snow and winters as i've dealt with it all my life, but I absolutely hate hate hate high humidity... I suppose I could deal with it as long as I was able to go camping, and fishing on my weekends without getting attacked by a water moccasin, and had a lot of other things lined up regarding employment and things to do, etc..etc... On top of all of this, i'm also a single 19 year old with no family or friends in any other states. I'd at least like to go to a place where I have the option of meeting friendly new people, and having the potential to find relationships and night life within an hour driving distance. I could realistically probably be comfortable with home prices (With at least 2+ acres minimum) in the low 300k range.

I know I can't get everything, and obviously I've made a ton of demands for this new state, but all in all i'm really interested in seeing what states you guys recommend, even if it doesn't have everything listed here. I've already done a lot of research and was originally thinking Minnesota up until today when I learned that St. Paul-Minneapolis has some of the worse crime in the country ranking above Chicago in most cases (Can anyone weigh in regarding whether or not St. Paul-Minneapolis and its suburbs within half an hour are really that dangerous?). Thanks in advance for anyone who took the time to read through that mess! Anything helps!

Edit - I should also include that I'm ridiculously tired of the Illinois landscape! Please, no states that are completely flat grasslands and farm fields. "
8773jt,2,2018-03-26,Incubator internship advice?,2ndDeriv,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8773jt/incubator_internship_advice/,"Hi, I'm in my second semester of CS. I've been interning at a small VC fund for a year. Last spring I was about to finish my BBA in Finance and was accepted to a grad program to do an MS in Finance. My plan was to work as an analyst at a larger venture fund after the Masters, and try to build a career in Finance. A couple weeks before graduating, I decided I wanted to get on the other side of the tech and do a second bachelors in CS rather than the Masters in Finance. I should graduate by the end of next year, but haven't yet had a CS-related internship. 

This summer, I have the option to work at a small incubator with 5 or 6 startups in industrial robotics, security, advertising/marketing, and AI/ML consulting. I would be there and could do projects and learn from the people in the incubator. I would technically be working for the Incubator and get paid on 'contract basis' for projects I would do for the companies. Problem is, I've never worked on large-scale projects before and I don't really know what to expect.

What advice do you have for me to best prepare for this? I am taking Networking, Operating Systems, Data Structres/Algorithms and a Cybersecurity class this semester. I do well on all my programming projects in school, but don't do much other than mess around with my dotfiles and practice interview problems outside of class. Or should I not do this and try to find a more 'traditional' internship. 

Also, I was wondering if my Finance degree and VC internship may help with my programming career? Or how would you recommend me best leverage this experience, if at all? 

tl;dr Can do an internship at an Incubator this summer. Don't know what to expect/how to prepare. Also should I do this?"

Seeing what the internet thinks I should work on in the mean time, and if my target schools are reasonable. 

**Background**

**Work Experience:** 

5 years at matriculation, all with the same F500 petrochemicals company in the engineering development/rotational program as a Process Engineer. I’ll have had rotations working at a small midwestern polymers manufacturing plant, a world-scale refinery in Houston, and (speculating here) a role in refinery optimization on the business/trading side. 

Most recently I’ve identified and implemented capital improvements to my responsible operating unit that have increased its annual EBITDA by 15%. 

I will most likely be promoted a total of 2-3 times by matriculation, which is fairly standard for the engineering roles at the company I work for. I’ve had either “successful,” or “frequently exceeds expectations” ratings during my yearly performance reviews. I’ll probably be making $115-120k by the time I’m ready to apply (currently make 100k), which isn’t something that I’d be willing to give up doing a full-time MBA. 

I also started and currently operate a qualified joint venture along with my wife as a side business in the Creative/Design space. She’s the creative force, and I do management, accounting, and taxes. It is a profitable business, and gross sales are projected at $50k this year. Not sure how relevant this is to an adcom. 

**Extra Curriculars:** 

Team lead for educational outreach at the plant I’m working in, which is part of the community outreach committee. I organize other engineers and perform science demonstrations, activities, Q&amp;A sessions, and career guidance sessions for local elementary, middle, and high school students. I also actively plan and participate in the other community outreach initiatives sponsored by the committee. 

BB/BS – will have been a big for 3 years at matriculation, and am planning on continuing this service work for a long time. 

D1 XC/T&amp;F captain my senior year in college; 3-time Academic All-America, 4-time Academic All Big Ten, 3-time All-Region Team, 3-time All Big Ten Team, have been a part of 5 Big Ten Champion teams, and 4 trips to National meets with 3 top-10 team finishes. 

**Undergrad School/Major:** 

Big Ten University ranked in the top-50 Nationally, top-15 in Engineering, and in the top-5 for my major, Chemical Engineering. 

**Other Education:** 

I’ll be finishing up an M.S. in Industrial Systems Engineering (Data Analytics/Financial Systems concentration) at a Big Ten University ranked in the top-10 Nationally for engineering graduate programs this spring. Did this part-time over 2 years while working. I’m writing my thesis now, which should turn into 1-2 publications in the financial engineering or econometrics space later this year (after graduation).    

**Race/nationality/sex:** White/American/Male

**Stats**

**GMAT Score:** 

Took the GRE in 2016, 168Q/156V (converts to 50Q/33V/700 GMAT +/- whatever regression error exists). Since the GRE score will still be good when I apply, I’m not really interested in retaking it or taking the GMAT, though I never studied for verbal reasoning... 

**GPA:** 

3.35 undergraduate

3.71 graduate

**MBA Info**

**Goal of MBA:** 

Leap from individual contributor to management and beyond. I’ve had extensive experience with soft-influence, leading small teams of engineers that are not my direct reports, and mentoring interns. I get great satisfaction in developing others, and creating a vision that leads to team success. Many of the engineers and technicians I work with have positive comments on my leadership style, and see me as a natural leader. My current company generally requires 10 or more years’ experience before moving engineers into management, and I’d like to buck the trend. Ultimately I see myself managing a business segment at the VP/EVP level of my company or a company very similar to it. 

**Target Schools:** Kellogg PT, Booth PT

**Others I'm considering:** Ross PT, McCombs PT, Tepper PT

I'm moving to America(NYC) from Ireland in May to start a 12 month graduate visa programme. I finished university in May 2017 after completing a 3 year social science degree and 1 year computer science diploma from the same university. This was essentially the first 1.5-2 years of a 4 year CS degree in 1 year. The university would be well regarded globally. Understandably its a big change but I've always had an interest in technology growing up.

Since September of 2017 I've worked as a front end developer at a government organisation and will continue to work here up until May before the move. I have learned a ton in that time and while I don't know/understand everything I am very confident in my ability to be able to learn anything I encounter. I have really become addicted to learning on my own outside this full time job. I'm currently reading YDKJS &amp; doing a big React course on Udemy.

I have also built 2 websites on a freelance basis since December.

When I get to the states, I will be looking for primarily an internship or ideally a junior position on the front end initially (would like to work towards full stack). 

I want to hit the ground running so I just have a few questions / concerns: 

* Will not having completed a 4 year CS degree really hold me back? 
* Is there anything extra I should be learning in order to get an edge i.e (soft skills, graphic design, simple back end stuff that everyone should know)
* Should I apply to every job even if I don't have the full requirements (i.e 4 year CS degree)
* Just general advice?

I have a github with repositories, personal site, linkedin and all that as well. I can link those if people feel like checking them out to get a better idea of my skill level.

Alright so yesterday I had an interview with company X. It was the second interview, they asked a few questions and presented me with problems to tackle.

The first problem was solvable, I got really close to the answer but ended being helped by the two interviewers. The second problem was not a solvable one, it was a problem they were tackling and, from what I understood, they wanted to see my thought process more than get an answer. 

Anyway, I was told that congratulations the job is mine. They would be sending me an offer soon.

I swear I have this feeling that I know nothing, the feeling that says I won't do any good at the job if I take it.

Some background:

I'm currently a software QA engineer (software tester/software process guru etc.) in embedded systems at a manufacturing company and a part time MS student in Electrical Engineering. I went to undergrad for Bioengineering, graduated and started as a software QA engineer practically the next day back in spring 2016. It's been almost two years since I graduated and worked as a software QA engineer, and I'm bored out of my mind with software testing. For the first year it was enough of a challenge to learn how the device worked in order to do the testing, but now I know how it works so there's not enough challenge in it anymore. That's why last year, when I started to realize I was having trouble finding a challenge and growing at work, I asked for tuition reimbursement to go back to grad school for a MS in Electrical Engineering. I love science, challenging problems, and design projects so grad school has been very rewarding so far. I have two years left of part time studying to do, but I want to make some gains in the workplace.

The opportunity currently being presented to me:

There are a few electrical engineers at work I'm comfortable reaching out to, because they've said, ""if there's anything I can do to help you on your hardware path, please let me know."" I need to leverage this economically while also showing them how grateful I am that they even bothered to offer their help.

My idea:

My idea to leverage their help, challenge myself in the workplace, and set myself up to transition over to an electrical engineering role is to ask for a part time unpaid internship or a project on top of my full time job software testing.


I'm writing here to find out if anyone else has found themselves in a similar position and how they were able to leverage help offered by engineers in their desired department.


I deeply appreciate any feedback on my idea, my post, or anything else.

I would appreciate any help!

School A:

- In my home state

- Already offered a research assistant position and know what I would be working on/which professor I would be working with

- Thesis option

- Cheaper cost of living; therefore, more of a value for the stipend I would be getting

- Not as high of a ranking in terms of the program itself

- Not in or near a major metropolitan area; therefore potentially fewer opportunities both during and after school

- Would probably enjoy living here more in regard to people I already know in this town

School B:

- One of the top I/O programs in the country

- 30 min away from a major metropolitan area, lots of opportunities for paid internships and jobs after graduation

- Multiple resources on campus to gain I/O experience

- Involves doing a thesis, internship, and comprehensive exams

- Not yet offered a grad assistantship, but they state a majority of I/O students receive one

- Only a partial tuition waiver

- Higher cost of living, so with the same amount of stipend as School A, I would still probably have to take out loans

- Would probably enjoy living here more in regard to things to do while not in school

Again, any help is appreciated!"

I’m looking for some advice,

I currently have an offer for a small startup company that deals with bitcoins. I’ve done some research and it seems like they have been running for a year but is still very small.

I’m wondering what interning at a small startup is like and if it is worth it? Or should I pursue a more established company? If anyone has done an internship at a small startup before, do you regret it?

For some background, I am a second year comp eng student with no intern experience but I do have some projects. 

I appreciate any advice, thank you."

few weeks ago I accepted a application for a spontaneous
 2 weeks internship / practical training.
So my job is to show the guy everything within two weeks what I do in a webdesigner job.
The goal is that the guy know if he leave the school if he want to work as a webdesigner or if this is not the right job.

First my idea was to let the guy learn from websites how to use html, javascript and css.
Then now my idea was to make it as cool as possible so that he can take away something he created and show it to his classmates.
For example now I searched on hackster.io for cool projects he could do and I will help him.

But I dont know...
The guy dont know anything about developing or webdesign. (except using Gimp :D)
So maybe I should start using AntMe with him first.

I dont know.

Maybe you have cool ideas to invite a new guy in my developer / webdesign world?


Background information:
In Germany the students must make a internship/practical training in the 8th class for 2 weeks to check if they like their job later.
They should decide there if they want to apply later for this position or searching something else they like.
At the end of this 2 weeks they must make a presentation about the job and practical training/internship for the other classmates so that the others can see if they like this or not.
They are usually in the age of 15.

Maybe you can help, maybe not.

But thanks in Advance for any cool ideas ^^"
87alms,3,2018-03-26,Junior Web Developer vs Quality Assurance Analyst,228quest,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87alms/junior_web_developer_vs_quality_assurance_analyst/,"So I'm going to be interviewed for a summer intern position (Through Co-op). I am currently a first year Computer Science major. One company is interviewing me for two positions.

Junior Web Developer and Quality Assurance Analyst

My question is, I assume I will be asked something along the lines of ""which job do you think is a better fit for you?""

Which one should I choose? The thing is, I'm thinking of saying Junior Web dev because it's an actual development job while the QA analyst seems to have very minimal to do with development.

The whole point of me getting an internship is to get work experience that will help me get other jobs in the future in Comp Sci. I'm afraid that QA analyst may not be seen as a real development job and therefore won't be able to be applied as well as Junior Web dev.

I personally don't like web development however, I do think it is a good skill to have and will be beneficial in the future. I have experience in QA and would have to say that it's it a ""better fit"" for myself. Even with this, I can't necessarily say I like QA either but, it is a better fit."

From the start, I felt insanely unqualified due to my lack of experience and high feelings of inadequacy, but I tried really hard to perform well. However, I don't feel like I've accomplished much in the 5 months I've been here and I can tell my bosses aren't very satisfied with my work. Just now I overheard one of them make a comment about how someone else's work was much better than my own. I'm convinced they're going to fire me soon.

Now, I'm actually supposed to go on an internship this summer via my school program, so I already have another job lined up. I was planning on staying at my current job for as long as possible and giving my two weeks notice on April 13 (in a little over 2 weeks), but I don't know if I can make it until then. I'm scared they're going to fire me before I can quit, and I'm worried about (1) how that's going to reflect on my employment history and (2) mostly the psychological damage being fired will do to me. I was fired from my first ever job when I was 17 and although I was not at fault in that scenario (I think the manager just really disliked me for no reason), it left a scar. 

Also, I'm going to give my two weeks notice as courtesy but I'm pretty sure they're just going to let me go right away as my role isn't particularly crucial to the company.

Im going to be doing my first full time internship  starting this summer. I’ve only had one part time internship before. The most I learned was the process of a project, what web technologies to use, how to use GitHub, code coverage, continuous integration etc.. and test cases, I wrote a lot of test cases.

I mainly worked with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. My new internship coming up will work primarily with those two. I’m not really confident in the whole MVC model, but I’m comfortable in JavaScript and the Ruby language. 

The technical interview wasn’t too difficult, asked an AWS question and two JavaScript questions which I only got 1 partially right. But yet I still got the offer. 

The company is pretty big and has its own internship program so I’m assuming I don’t need to be an expert in the field before entering.

But I’m curious, were you an expert or close when you entered your first internship?

These writings contain true accounts of the unusual and often highly-classified medical conditions experienced by astronauts during and after their space missions. Following the defunding of the clandestine medical program after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the majority of these accounts were left, forgotten, on tape drives in a NASA storage facility. In 2016, a former intern, whose job was to clean out one of these facilities, discovered them. Two years later, he is ready to release what he found.

Thus far, the following reports have been released: [A Dentist’s Discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7ttlyc/the_secret_doctors_of_nasa_a_dentists_discovery/?st=jf8f7v6o&amp;sh=f47f5a77), [A Psychologist's Suicide](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7u2d7g/the_secret_doctors_of_nasa_a_psychologists_suicide/?st=jf8f1qd6&amp;sh=21c57a59)

*Releaser’s note: This account is from a post-surgery oral memoir dictated by an unnamed surgeon to an anonymous NASA official. The background circumstances are unknown.*

**A Surgeon's Nightmare**

Look, I’d been awake for two straight days. You guys have been putting us through hell with all the injuries from the Hephaestus Project, so forgive me if my results weren’t as great as they could have been. But come the hell on - what do you expect when someone comes to me in that condition?

So you want to know what happened in my own words? Fine. But don’t get pissed when I call your practices into question.

The patient was admitted with significant injuries to his legs, torso, arms, and head. On the surface, they appeared to be lacerations, which was strange because their severity would have caused near-instantaneous exsanguination and they would’ve gone straight to the morgue, not to me. Closer inspection revealed the wounds had been sealed by intense cold, as if the patient had been frozen either while being injured or immediately after. He was still clinging to life.

If I had to speculate, which I know you want me to do, I’d guess the patient was injured and subsequently exposed to hard vacuum. How that could have happened is beyond my guess, as I know the patient was not, and never had been, an astronaut. But I guess that’s what Hephaestus is all about, right boss? We can put pieces together over here, you know. 

No, the god damn pun was not intended.

Anyway, as soon as I realized the cold was the only thing keeping the patient from bleeding out, it was a race against the clock to get him closed up.

Do I really have to tell this next part? You have the fucking videotape. 

Fine. FINE.

Drs. ____ and _________, as well as the assistants, packed the wounds. We used the portable scanners to check for internal injuries, and, of course, there were more than we could count. You guys knew that too, obviously. There was no saving this guy. Thanks for making us try, though. Seriously. It’s not like any of us will be seeing this in our nightmares for the rest of our lives.

No, I won’t calm down. This is bullshit. 

Yeah.

Yeah, I know about my wife. Just...just let me vent. Christ.

Jesus Christ.

So the patient flatlined and I called it. But then your boss, _________, said to keep working. Keep packing. Keep suturing. It felt like we were taxidermying the poor guy. 

You people are really sick, do you know that?

Dr. ____ was the first one to detect movement, presumably once the tissue had warmed up enough for the __ _____ __ to -- what word should I use, boss? Gestate? Hatch?

Ok, “become.” Whatever you want.

I’ll admit, as a surgeon, it was fascinating to see the filaments stretching across the wounds to close them up. Whatever you folks are planning to do with them might save a lot of lives in the future. Probably after I’m long gone, though.

What I don’t understand, though, is why you brought the patient to us when you knew this was going to happen. Did you need a sterile environment? Did you need witnesses with medical training? There’s no shortages of medical degrees around here. Hell, the patient was a doctor of biophysics. 

Here’s what I’d love to know from you: what did the medical assistants do to deserve what happened to them? They were kids, for Christ’s sake. Were they even twenty-five? 

Yeah, I know what they signed when they started. Jesus.

Okay, once the filaments had closed all but one of the wounds, they also sealed the orifices of the patient. The patient’s skin appeared to take on the characteristics of the filaments as well; reinforcing it, perhaps? Because what happened next would need more tensile strength than baseline flesh, I guess.

After the skin was reinforced, the filaments began to tighten. This had the effect of opening the remaining wound on the torso. 

Can I at least clean the blood off me before I finish this? No? Great. Thanks. You guys are really something else.

So everything tightened and the remaining wound gaped open until the patient, what -- inverted? Is there even a medical term for someone turning inside out? That sound, man. That wet, cracking sound...

We would’ve been out of there like a shot if your boss hadn’t locked the door to the operating theater. We just had to watch the patient - or whatever he was now - slapping and writing against the table.

Hephaestus is about point-to-point wormholes, right? Yeah no shit, I know you can’t confirm or deny it. I’m not retarded. Give me a little credit.

When your boss told me and doctors ____ and _________ to step back and have the assistants conduct a physical examination, I knew they were done for. I knew. I’ve worked here long enough, __________. 

“Never get attached,” is your motto, right? Must be easy for you, since no one wants to get to know you. Fuck you. Seriously. Those girls deserved better.

Yes, I know I have to fucking report what happened. I just want you to know that I’m saying “fuck you” and the “you” is referring to you. You. What are you gonna do, fire me? Ha. No, I know, that’s not your style. I’m sure I’ll wake up on the other side of that wormhole you “can’t confirm or deny” tomorrow morning. Whatever, man.

The inverted patient stopped moving when the assistants began the physical examination. They took its temperature, they drew blood, and they sampled whatever that yellow mucus was. It seemed to be going fine until they were asked to do a biopsy of one of the mucus ducts.

________ , and yes,  I’m going to use her damn name because she’s a person, no matter how much you viewed her and __________ as commodities, made the first incision and was instantly enveloped by a membrane extruded by the duct she’d tried to cut. It was semitransparent; we could all see inside.

Another membrane wrapped around __________, and before our eyes, they were compressed. If any sound can overtake the patient’s inversion in the race for the most disturbing noise I’ve ever heard, that sound will do it.

Once ________ and __________ were compressed into shapes roughly the size of a beachball, a small hole opened in each membrane to let out the blood and other bodily fluids. It shot across the room, all over me and the other doctors. Which you can plainly see from the state of my clothing you said I couldn’t change until we were done with this b*llshit.

After the liquid was released, the compression resumed until they were small enough to get sucked into the patient’s body. And they were. Then you let me and the other doctors out.

Yes, that was it. You know that was it. You were watching the whole fucking time next to your boss. Jesus.

Good. Fine. Yeah, [fuck you, too.](https://unsettlingstories.com)

I am in a bit of a situation. I really want to go to UCSD (dream school), however I got in undeclared. I applied for Comp Sci. there and tbh I don't know much about computer programming and everything, but it sounds pretty interesting. I'm also willing to start picking up the easier languages. 

Now, I also applied to UCI and got in for CSE. I am now forced to choose between the two and I want to find a good reason to go to UCSD in terms of actually having a paying job or many internship opportunities in IT companies. 

I was looking around and saw the new Data Science major. It seems like there are many CSE courses in it and specializations in AI which is pretty cool. 

Link: http://dsc.ucsd.edu/node/7

I was thinking of maybe doing this major and adding Comp. Sci as a minor. But I don't know if it is difficult to minor in Comp Sci. Will I even have priority to take those classes? Just confused on the whole minoring thing. Also I know it is difficult to say, because there are other factors like internships and project involvement, but do you think that I would be competitive with Comp. Sci and other engineering majors in the job market? 

Thanks!

Elijah looked at the planet’s surface through the monitors on Voyager’s command deck. “It’s beautiful.”

The planet was similar in size to Earth, but seemed to have more land than water. The landing site the scions had selected was a clearing in an enormous temperate forest, with a climate that might resemble the Pacific Northwest of North America, or perhaps some portions of the British Isles. 

The forest at their destination wasn’t the familiar dark green colour like those on Earth, however. Most of the trees were in bloom, like Japanese cherry blossoms. The pink petals were so numerous that one could almost view the planet’s prevailing winds with the pink flower bits acting as visual particles, like in some sort of weather model simulation.  

Gabriel  (the French Chosen) called naming rights, and the system’s name was anglicized as Roseus. Since it was the second planet in the star system, it was deemed Roseus II.  Naming rights hadn’t actually been a *thing* so to speak, but the man’s enthusiasm was enough that everyone had chosen to support his choice.  

“Ninety percent Earth’s gravity,” observed Isabella, reading the text off one of the screens, which had briefly flashed Portuguese upon her turning her gaze to it. “Guess it’s a bit too heavy for the Ke Tee and Mraa.”

“We’ll be there with you in spirit,” said Toh/.  “But, if there are any intelligent life forms there...” he waddled towards Elijah, his expression hopeful. “Call them savages for me?”

“I’m not doing that,” replied the man firmly, despite Toh/ probably having been joking. He, like many of the Chosen, was on-edge after what had happened on their previous away mission. “Alright, screens say we’re boarding the shuttles in twenty minutes. Let’s hope the locals are friendly.”

“Doesn’t matter if they are or not,” replied the Cuban Chosen, a man Raul, “we should all bring weapons.”

“Agreed,” replied Sarah. “We should all be *heavily* armed. Anyone mature enough to hold a weapon gets one. Those of you who may or may not be mildly incompetent,” she said, briefly eying Arjun, “will still at least get melee weapons.”

The French Chosen, gave a Cheshire grin. “Can we choose any weapons from the armoury we want? Let’s say... first come, first serve?”

The woman frowned. “Uh... sure?”

***********
++++++++++
**********

“What the fuck,” said Arjun in the cargo bay of Voyager, “I love French people now.”

Gabriel had what could be described as a heavy weighted daisychain of grenades of various types. “She said *any weapon*, dude. Why not grenades?”

“It’s a great idea,” concurred Arjun. ”Gotta go with a theme! Alright, my theme will be...” he briefly pondered his options in regards to melee weapons, “hunting knives!”

“I hate this,” said Sarah, plainly. “I hate this so much. Why the hell are there even grenades in the armoury? That’s just...” she shook her head. “Alright, y’all are going in a different shuttle than the rest of us.”

“When you say ‘y’all’,” said Jim, the Australian-New Zealander Chosen, who was also examining the selection of weapons, “are you including any of the somewhat immature people who made ludicrous weapons choices?”

“**Yes.**”

A look of excitement went across Arjun’s face. “Jim. Boomerangs!” He began rifling through the armoury, as if sure there must be some boomerangs there *somewhere.* 

“Mate, I’ve never thrown a boomerang.”

Arjun looked over his shoulder at the man in mock incredulity. “Yes you have.”

“No, I haven’t.  Also, in Australia we actually call them hardwood-airfoil-runabout-sticks. If you go to Straya asking about boomerangs people won’t know what you’re talking about.”

“... Do they really call them that?”

 “Yeah, mate. Amazingly, it’s an aboriginal word that sounds exactly like an English language description.”

Elijah was only half-paying attention to the conversation, debating arming himself. Maybe just a hunting knife and a side arm? He’d never carried a handgun before, but a long gun just felt so... aggressive. Chances are that nothing would happen, anyways. Scott had assured him a hundred times over that this away mission didn’t involve anything dangerous.

He took inventory of what supplies they’d receive that time. Generally it was similar from away mission to away mission, but not always. Usually they had standard survival fare (binoculars, a compass, water purification tablets, some vegan food replacement powder that could be combined with water to form emergency rations) as well as extras pertaining to that mission (trinkets to exchange with the locals, rebreather masks, sunscreen, swim wear, etc). 

This time it was the standard equipment, similar to when they went to Planet Groth, although without the rebreather masks. The trinkets this time included what looked like assorted shiny baubles and delicate, tiny chains of jewellery. Neat. 

************

As they descended to the planet’s surface onboard a shuttlecraft, Sarah gripped Elijah’s hand, and then rested her head on his shoulder. 

Looking down the length of the vessel, he saw Kra sitting next to RohYan, the ZidChaMa man they tried encouraging her to get together with. They weren’t showing affection in ways many humans would, but sitting that close to one another was evidence that they had grown closer. At one point, Kra’s camouflage reflex activated in fear due to the turbulence, and RohYan gripped her hand supportively. 

Well, that was cute. Wasn’t it? Then why did he feel a twinge of something negative when he saw it? 
Oh well; he wouldn't dwell on it.

The shuttle landed at the clearing in the forest after a descent that seemed a bit quicker than normal. The landing site was perfectly circular, and seemed devoid of any large plant life.

How odd. There wasn’t so much as a bush in a two hundred metre diameter around the shuttle craft, and the ground seemed to consist of a spongy material covered in the light pink flower petals. 

They disembarked, and Elijah put his binoculars to his face, scanning the tree line. The petals from the trees were beautiful, falling with a sort of grace that he thought was profoundly beautiful. It was as if it were slowly raining flowers.

There was that eerie silence, too. Like when heavy snow was falling and everything was quieter. He could hear some [birds] calling in the distance, but not more than that. In addition, their view was somewhat obstructed.

“It can’t be like this all the time, can it?” Jim had picked up a handful of the flower bits, inspecting them. “No way an ecosystem could sustain the energy needed to produce this many flower blossoms regularly.”

“It’s most likely seasonal,” suggested one of the Myriads. “Where should we explore first, friends?”

“I reckon we should just keep straight ahead,” said Sarah. “And *don’t* split up.”

“Ohhh, so *now* we’re savvy of horror movie tropes?” Arjun sighed. “Of course everyone pays attention when the American representative says it. Typical.”

They moved en masse towards the forest, and Elijah found himself having to shake flower petals out of his hair every once in awhile. They got spooked when a large deer analogue bolted in front of them, but he was happy to notice that no one had freaked out and fired off shots (or threw grenades... or boomerangs) in response. 

After a few more minutes of walking, a chipper voice spoke to them. It seemed muffled slightly, and somehow distant. “Salutations, visitors!” 

They were all caught off-guard, and some of the more jumpy ZidChaMa had raised their weapons while simultaneously camouflaging. A few of the more on-edge humans did the same – well, without the camouflage.

“Hello...? Who are you?” Sarah had said it without using a translation device, meaning her words came out in plain English and would sound like gobbledegook to anyone who didn't speak the language and was without a translation chip in their head.

Elijah raised the cylindrical, cheese-grater lookalike translation unit to the front of his mouth before speaking. “Hello. Where are you?” His voice was translated by the device into the noises a song bird might make.

“In the canopy, my dear adventurers!” The happy sounding, feminine voice was coming from above them.

The man looked upwards, seeing a creature that looked a bit like a raven, but one which was lichen green. It looked like a corvid mixed with a parrot, but more of the former than the latter. Its feathers were accented with pastel blue on the wings, and it wore adornments. The creature was wearing nut shells and flower blossoms in strings around her neck, and draped across her wings looked to be tiny silver chains.

Wait, did these creatures have metal working!? That would be a first, considering that the other non-Chosen species they’d come across had lacked that ability. 

“Hello,” said Jim through a translation cylinder, “we’re from a long ways away and have come to meet new people. Care to talk?”

“Oh yes!” The alien woman flew down to meet them, and once on the ground Elijah could see that she truly was only about fifty centimetres in length. She was essentially just a moss-green raven, although he supposed her head was a bit larger, and her beak curved differently and looked quite powerful. “My name is Tee-yah.” It sounded like song bird chirping, and so that was the closest Elijah would be able to transcript the name. 

The vocalizations weren’t like the chirping and squawks of a Ke Tee – those sounded more like dolphin-like whistles and squeaks compared to the canary style singing this woman was making.

“Hello, Tee-yah. My name’s Jim, this is Elijah, and Kra, and....” Jim trailed off when he realized he couldn’t possibly introduce everyone. “Well, there are a *lot* of us.”

“You called us adventurers before we introduced ourselves,” noted Cecil. “You are very astute.” 

“Thank you for the compliment!” Almost everything Tee-yah said sounded incredibly energetic and happy to a degree that almost seemed to indicate childlike naivety, or perhaps just amicable exuberance. “But it was more than deduction. I’ve met plenty of your people before!” She bobbed up and down excitedly, and Elijah wished some Ke Tee were here to see examples of convergent evolution that they could identify with. “Plenty of humans and Myriads and ZidChaMa and sometimes Mraa. Three waves of them! Quite nice people.”

Wait. What!?

*Meanwhile, on Earth...*

Zhang looked at the raw data Rick had shown him. He wasn’t allowed to record it or relay it back to headquarters in any way, but he was more than capable of double-checking it himself. Based on NSA data, four United States citizens were taken: one from Texas, another from New York, one from California, and another from Florida. And not just taken, but they'd seemed to have dropped off the map completely. Well, this was interesting. “Just what I thought. It’s the same in China. Four nationals gone.”

Rick groaned. “And you didn’t think of sharing that? We thought it was one or two, max.” 

“It was only confirmed recently. Honestly, I thought American surveillance tech was more advanced than ours.”  Zhang looked out at the hotel room’s window, wondering if they should have closed the blinds. Or would that look more suspicious? They were probably always being watched, regardless. “I was hoping you’d be able to tell me something I *didn’t* know. But, as a sign of trust... check into each person’s political beliefs. Probably a lot easier to do here than in China.” There was a trend amongst his countrymen of being apolitical, publically. Not like in America where one proudly and openly presented their political viewpoints all over whatever social media they could get their hands on. “I have a hunch that each one will be a different place on the political spectrum.”

“Okay, so someone’s abducted a delightfully diverse group of people from...” Rick eyed the list. “Forty countries. I’m less interested in their criteria for selection and more about *how* they did it.”

“Look at the country list,” pointed out Zhang. “All the major players are there. Who possibly would have the resources to do this? Ignoring the ‘why' and the 'how' and focusing on the 'who' for now.""

“An outside party,” mumbled Rick. “But who?”

“I think we have to think a bit bigger than usual, friend.”

“Bigger? Like...?”

“Like....” Zhang pointed upwards with a finger, briefly darting his eyes upwards. “And I don’t mean the honeymooners in the suite above us.”

“Just to be clear... are you saying it was God, or aliens?”

The man shrugged. “Probably aliens.”

“*Probably* aliens?” Rick didn’t look amused. “What are you basing this on!?”

“Do you have any other logical explanation?”

“Your theory isn’t logical in the slightest.”

“We’ve exhausted all other ideas. Technology we don’t know about that doesn’t come from any of the forty countries whose citizens were kidnapped -- or any other country, for that matter! It has to be something extraterrestrial.” 

“That’s *ridiculous.*”

It *did* sound ridiculous, Zhang knew, but they were all out of options.
“You’re familiar with Occam’s razor, aren’t you? The simplest answer is generally the most correct one.”

“That is a vast oversimplification of the law of parsimony, Zhang.” 

The Chinese agent paused briefly, as if to think. In actuality, he was letting the idea sink into his partner’s brain.  “Do you have any alternative explanation?”

Rick looked back at the list of countries with missing citizens whose disappearances fit the pattern. “Maybe it was... North Korea?”

“Pffft! They *wish* they were able to accomplish this.” Zhang poured himself some more American-made whiskey. 
 “During the Cold War,” began Zhang, “both the Soviets and the United States spent small fortunes investigating parapsychology and the paranormal. Your government is willing to believe in extrasensory perception and remote viewing, but you won’t at all consider the idea that visitors from another planet have visited us? I’m not talking about little green men here, Rick.”

Rick cupped his face in his hands. “Jesus Christ. We’ve spent weeks and weeks doing this, and the most we’ve got is that aliens did it?” He looked up at Zhang. “What am I supposed to tell my boss!?”

“I’ll tell him for you. I wouldn’t want the FBI’s best intern to be demoted.”

“Junior level special agent, *not* an intern.” The big vein on one of his temples that only showed up when he was stressed had returned. “We need to get more evidence. I don’t care if it adds to your theory, or takes away from it.”

Zhang thought for a moment. “Hmm. N.A.S.A?”

“All their data is public. An amateur astronomy scanning the images would’ve seen something suspicious by now, if your alien guess was correct.”

“People aren’t going to find something they aren’t looking for,” replied Zhang.

“Look... we’ve gone over all the surveillance data. We haven’t found anything. So unless your imaginary aliens tampered with the satellite data—“

“Who’s to say they couldn’t? Maybe for one of these aliens, such a feat would be incredibly easy?”

“We’ll be god damn laughing stocks if we say this to our respective supervisors, Zhang.”

“Aren’t the radiation signatures enough?” The man sipped his drink. “We’ll just say it’s the most likely explanation. It’s either that or magic.”

Rick didn’t answer, holding his face in his hands. Weeks of trying to gather evidence had only led to a conclusion that he couldn’t present to those who assigned him to the task. He’d probably hoped a nice promotion would come out of this.

“You know what?” Zhang put a hand on his partner’s shoulder. “Rick, let me explain everything to your bosses. I’ll make a slideshow on my laptop.”

The FBI agent looked up at him, incredulous. “A slideshow on your laptop. That’s your solution.”

“Yeah. Just like... fifteen or twenty minutes long. Maybe thirty if I include some videos.”

“I’m going to fucking lose my job,” he said in barely a whisper. Then, at a normal volume, “okay, whatever. Make your slideshow.”

*Back on Roseus II...*

Elijah sat cross-legged across from his new ethnographic informant, trying to tune out the chattering of hundreds of other individuals of the species who were in the canopy above them.

Normally the Chosen would have been brought back to the peoples’ village to open up official communication channels. Indeed, they had been led there, but the issue was that these creatures lived in nest-like structures built in the trees, ones far too small and far too flimsy for human or ZidChaMa visitors. Myriads could *technically* enter the nests outside of their vehicles, but then they wouldn’t be able to communicate, and they also looked too much like food for some of the younger locals to resist.

 The Rosean architecture made sense: why would avian analogues the size of large crows have buildings anywhere else but the forest’s canopy? Sure, some birds *did* make nests on the ground, but not when they could fly and the forest floor was dangerous. There weren’t even bridges connecting their tree houses together, considering that flight was their primary method of transportation. It wasn’t like with the Ke Tee where their (relatively) large mass meant that their dwellings had to be something solid and weight-bearing. 

Team Gamma was the one doing most of the interaction beneath the village in a small clearing. Having no structures on the ground meant that the forest floor was reserved entirely for low-growing plants which formed the beings’ gardens. They were plants that bore fruit and nuts, and took up most of the space beneath the locals' homes. So the Chosen were sat in an area that was free of plants. 

At first, Elijah assumed that the empty space was because they were letting the area go fallow: letting no plants grow there so the soil would be replenished for the next year. To his surprise, this tribe of people had no *word* for fallow, which he supposed meant that there was no schema for this in their language. 

Elijah *did* briefly wonder how farming in the middle of the forest worked. How did those crops ever get enough sunlight? Agriculture was done in fields for many reasons, one of which was because sunlight was one of the main resources needed to grow plants. Maybe the chlorophyll analogue plantlife on Roseus II used was just hyper-efficient? Or maybe it was something about the soil? He would ask the locals, but seeing as they had no concept of scientific empiricism it was doubtful they’d have an answer.

The Northern People of the Emerald Feather (they only had a name for their tribe, not for their species as a whole, as was the norm – Elijah and the rest of team Gamma agreed the species would be called the Roseans, as per the name of their planet) were surprisingly human, despite their different anatomy. 

“So, you’re saying that you’ve met with Chosen species *three times* before?” asked Elijah.

“We have,” confirmed Tee-yah. “You people are so very nice!” She was wearing a new piece of adornment, from Elijah’s supply bag, a silvery chain that went across her back. Tee-yah had put it on with the help of a friend, one with whom she communicated with such nonverbal proficiency that Elijah wondered if body language played a large role for them, like for the Mraa. 

“Do you know what places on Earth the humans came from?” he asked.
 
The woman gave a parrot-like shift in body weight from foot to foot. “I do not, unfortunately.”

He nodded. “That’s alright.” 

Were there Chosen from other countries on Earth? Or maybe others from the already selected nations? 

“Thank you again for hosting us during your holiday,” added Elijah. It was some sort of celebration of the blooming of a genus of fruit tree which was endemic to much of the planet. The fruit produced resembled red, spiky apples. “The blossoms really are beautiful. Like pink snowflakes. Or pastel rain.”

“Truly gorgeous, is it not?” The woman gave a content-looking flutter of her wings. “What’s your home like?”

Elijah took out his phone, preparing to show her some pictures he downloaded beforehand for just this purpose. “Like this...”

*Back on Earth...*

Zhang wrapped up his presentation, one that had been made with great thought and care on his laptop and then projected onto the screen of a small amphitheatre-style room in an FBI regional office from a cinema-quality projector. “And that, my esteemed audience, is where we believe the missing citizens are.”

The lights were turned on, and the FBI agent sitting at one of the smooth, faux-wood tables in the room looked at him, stoically. He ranked high above Rick, being at the highest level of security classification. There were a handful of others in the room as well, and the conference room looked quite empty due to its size “Well, that didn’t go where I expected, but...” he gave a little shake of his head. “You were *very* convincing, agent Zhang. Good work.”

Rick looked at Zhang, gobsmacked, raising his hands as if to say ‘what the fuck, really?’. He had surely believed he’d lose his job as a result of the whole ordeal.

“I agree,” said an agent from the CIA. Members of the intelligence community from across the U.S. were there. “It was very persuasive. I wouldn’t even entertain such a possibility before I came into work this morning, but now...” he put his hand to his chin in thought. “We should talk to the Ministry of State Security,” he said, referring to the government agency to which Zhang belonged. “We need to form an intergovernmental council on this.”

“Or agency,” suggested Zhang in a tone that was only half-joking. “Of top security clearance.”

“We’ll see,” said the high-ranking FBI agent, sternly. “It all depends.” Then he added, a bit crestfallen, “we should talk to the Russians, too.”

They filed out of the room, exchanging handshakes with Zhang and Rick.
 
The high ranking FBI agent clapped a hand on Rick’s shoulder. “Agent Simmons, I just wanted to say that you performed excellently as agent Zhang’s entourage and observer.” Maybe he thought ‘handler’ sounded condescending. “I’ll put in a word for your promotion.”

Rick smiled for the first time since Zhang had met the man. “Thank you, sir.” 

“And if we *do* create an intergovernmental agency, you’ll be my first suggestion as an American representative, considering you’re already privy to information which is now top secret, and you have shown utmost capability.”

“Yes sir. Of course, sir. Thank you.” He was standing almost at attention, hinting at his military background.

On the way to the airport, both men felt triumphant.

 “We did it, Rick. We may not have found them, but at least we know that we don’t have the capacity to do that. We made history.”

“We did,” agreed Rick. “And I really hope that creation of a new agency won’t just be dust in the wind.”

“Agreed,” said Zhang. “It would be quite something. I wonder what our duties would be.”

“Paranormal investigation?” suggested the FBI agent with a small smirk.

“The word paranormal implies a lack of legitimacy. I like to think that we’ll be the clandestine vanguard against the unknown.”

Rick rolled his eyes. “Clandestine vanguard? Christ, are you a poet, too?”

“As you know, I’m a man of many talents,” said Zhang with a shrug. “As I’ve said, you should learn to branch out and learn other things. Hyper-specialization is over rated.” He looked him in the eye. “Again, be a Renaissance man.” They were pulling up to the airport.

“It’s been a pleasure working with you,” said Rick, in Mandarin, extending his hand for a shake.

“And with you. I have a feeling we’ll meet again, my friend. Maybe you’ll come to China sometime?”

“FBI only deals with internal affairs, Jian.” It was the first time he’d used the other man’s first name. 

“Yes, but maybe you’ll be working for something more international in the near future. See you around, Rick.”

*On Roseus II...*

Sarah felt a bit jilted not being allowed into Team Gamma’s little ethnographic get together. Team Alpha had been pushed to the periphery of the village to ‘keep watch.’ There wasn’t that much room in the Rosean village, and it *did* make sense to let the anthropologists do their work... but still.

Letting her mind wander somewhat, she realized something she'd have only half-noticed if she were busy.

The forest was so dense. *Far* too dense for the high energy using crops the Roseans were growing. She was far from being a xenobiologist, but it looked like they were growing things equivalent to ground nuts and fruit bushes. Those would *never* be able to grow in the middle of a forest with a dense canopy. 

She'd much rather do some investigating to quench her sense of curiosity rather than 'keeping watch.' It was *probably* nothing, but she had an instinctual sense of something being off. She couldn't quite articulate it in words. 
The woman approached one of the crops and got on her hands and knees, digging gently at the base.  She ignored one of the male ZidChaMa (was it LoKuh? They all looked alike) looking at her butt while doing so; it was close to breeding season and maybe he couldn’t help it. 

“What are you doing?” he asked.

“Something’s not right here, and the answer ain't above ground.” After about a foot and a half of digging, she had revealed the upper parts of the plant’s roots, but nothing out of the ordinary. But the soil felt... warmer?

A Rosean fluttered onto a branch near her. His voice was translated as an older person’s, indicating that he was possibly an elder. His somewhat wilted, less colourful feathers confirmed his advanced age. “Please don’t do that, Miss! You might damage the plant.” 

Sarah cursed under her breath, pushing the small heap of extracted soil back into the hole before picking up her translation device. “Sorry, I just... do you know what’s underneath the plants?”

“No,” said the Rosean man. “How would I know that?”

“By digging?”

“What’s that?”

She sighed. “Never mind.” She stood back up, pretending as if finding nothing amiss. “I was just curious. We don’t have plants like this where I’m from.”

“Well, feel free to look, but please try not to touch,” said the Rosean man in an authoritative voice before flying off..

After a bit of standing around and confirming she wasn’t being watched, she decided this needed more investigating. “Come with me,” she whispered to LoKuh, and beginning to lead him back to the landing site. The lack of plants there meant that they’d have unencumbered digging.

 The ZidChaMa man’s cheeks turned bioluminescent indigo in joy, and the white splotches this was paired with indicated surprise or amazement. He had clearly gotten the wrong idea.

 Sarah leaned in close, speaking again in a whisper, unsure of how sharp the locals’ hearing was. “Don’t look at me like *that!* I want to go back to where we landed to check something out.” 

He gave a hand gesture of confirmation, equivalent to a nod, and began following her. His skin faded to a neutral colour as they got further and further from the rest, and the downpour of flower petals briefly intensified as a gust of wind knocked more from the trees.

 “I don’t think we should be away from the group,” he said, his camouflage reflex threatening to activate at any second. 

“We’ll be right back. I just need to check this out.” She ducked under a low hanging branch. “There’s something beneath the soil.”

“Like what?”  asked the slightly frightened ZidChaMa man, who was perhaps subconsciously acting more submissive to the woman than normal due to the time of year. Maybe his personality would’ve flipped the other way if she were male. The differences in gender norms between most ZidChaMa societies and human ones were confusing: their men were traditionally  the bulk of the military and police forces, but even though they were the ones expected to protect people, it seemed that when it came to courtship they – no time to think about that! There was a mystery afoot. 

“The soil got warmer as I dug. There’s something going on. How else do you explain how they can grow high energy plants in the middle of the forest?”

""Maybe it was just warmth created by decomposing plant matter?"" LoKuh stepped over a branch. ""You know, from micro organisms?""

They got to the landing site. Sarah got on her knees, beginning to scrape the layer of flower blossoms off. Beneath it was layers of dead leaves, carpet-like plants, and a bit of soil. 

And beneath that was a frictionless, enameled, ceramic-like floor, with gold trimming. She saw why there wasn’t anything growing there besides low-lying plants and [mosses]. Their roots would never be able to penetrate it. “Oh shit.” 

They must’ve been all over the planet. Maybe their presence hinted at some ancient, arcane power source that the life on the world had co-evolved with, to use for their own needs. That had to have been the source of the heat, and the rhizomes of the plants were most likely using it to supplement their energy from the sun. 

“What...” the ZidChaMa man hovered over her, either staring at her cleavage or what she’d just discovered (or both). “What is it?”

“Magistrate ruins.”

I have received a little bit of advice already and I want to see what you think.

I have a bachelor of arts in theology, but I know Java and C#. I teach OOP concepts and programming for use in game development to 10-12 graders, and I have a Microsoft software development cert. I worked an internship over the summer where I wrote integration software and did some asp.net web development. I even have a YouTube channel where I've been uploading programming lessons for my classes.

In light of all this, I think I have the skills and abilities to make the jump, but I am concerned that I won't be considered for work because I don't have a degree in CS.
So my question is: should I go back and get an AS or BS in CS, or can I realistically get a job with what I have done this far?

Thanks in advance for your help."
87c8nc,147,2018-03-26,Advice from a College Junior PT 2,jasonfn,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/87c8nc/advice_from_a_college_junior_pt_2/,"Hi Y'all,

Out of popular demand I am going to do my best to give a few more tips to you all. First I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has commented or DM'd me. The response has been super positive and a little overwhelming to be honest but I am doing my best to work through everyone's responses and trying to get back to everyone! I'm seeing a lot of people with very similar questions so I've decided to put the answers to them in here instead as well.

TIPS FOR INTROVERTS/SHY PEOPLE TO BE SOCIAL:
I hate to break this to you guys but I don't have a magic formula where if you do XYZ you will have more friends than you can count, become an Instagram influencer, and make everyone else jealous of how damn cool you are (except buy a doorstop. I've had a bunch of DMs with people agreeing with me who are already in college. Please buy one). If I did you'd probably see a weird ad on the side of your screen saying ""Do this one WEIRD TRICK..."". 

What I can tell you is that in general people are attracted to three main qualities in people, which are confidence, positivity, and fun and if you can boost and outwardly project these traits it'll become a lot easier to make great connections with people for all things (friendship, dating, business, you get it).

CONFIDENCE: I thought I'd start here firs because being confident really helps the other two as well. The most important thing is just being willing to say ""this is who I am"" with every action and believe it. In college, you are going to be surrounded by a bunch of people who are exactly in your shoes, they don't know anyone, they are trying to make friends, etc. If you are able to exert some sort of confidence and stability, others will naturally gravitate towards that because it seems like you have your shit together and thats extremely comforting to them.

HOW TO BE CONFIDENT: Everyone has different things that inspire confidence in them. You need to figure that out for yourself. For me, I personally give myself a pep talk each morning, usually accompanied by some loud trap music (because lets be real, no one is more confident in their actions than Migos or Future). Looking good also makes me feel more confident, so I try my hardest to dress in things that make me look good and try to hit the gym regularly. If any of these things sound like they might work for you please give it a try. In terms of discovering your own confidence, I recommend going public places by yourself and learning how to be alone in a place full of strangers. For me, I've always enjoyed doing this at museums or hiking. This doesn't mean don't talk while you are there, if you are hiking and you see someone with a cute ass dog, pet the dog and talk to them about the dog if you feel inclined.

As far as exuding confidence there are some tricks you can use. Walk upright, straight backed and tall, chest out. This makes it seem like you know exactly where you are going and you are going there with purpose. When you meet someone for the first time firm handshake and try to extend your arm before theirs, it'll make it seem like you are controlling this interaction. Same thing in the future too, although maybe you switch it up with a hug/bro hug, do it with purpose.

POSITIVITY: This one is shockingly straight forward. Just try and smile. When you wake up in the morning, remind yourself to start smiling immediately. Try to find the good in everything. When someone asks you ""what's up?"" or ""how are you?"" say something like ""I'm great/fantastic"" or even ""morning started out a little rough, but I'm super excited for X event later"". Thats it. Try to believe what you say. Do not push your feelings down though. If you feel sad or angry, you need to deal with those feelings, talk to a friend or a family member about it or if you have a coping mechanism like working out or writing in a journal, do that. Getting rid of those feelings in a timely manner will make you more positive too! Just don't let these minute social interactions be your way of expressing those feelings. You don't need to force someone else into dealing with your issues in the middle of class when you respond with ""I'm super angry"". There is a time and place for everything and if you are feeling super shitty just take the day off. Most classes don't even take attendance so if you need to do that once or twice during the semester, just do it.

FUN: This one should actually be called adventurous. Basically, it falls on the premise that people like people who are always doing cool and unique things. The easiest way to do this is to always say yes. This doesn't mean jump off a 30 foot building or take a bunch of hard drugs just because someone dared you to do it. Do not put yourself in physical danger. It does mean if your friend says ""let's go camping tomorrow"" and you don't have anything planned or if someone says you won't do a 360 off that jump just say yes. Don't let the fact that its last minute or a bit outside your comfort zone prevent you from having a good time.

There will always be more people in college. Say hi to as many as you can, you never know where you'll meet your best friends (I met one in a class, one from a fantasy football league, one at a tailgate, and one through a club). If you don't get along with someone, don't worry about it. Thats the beautiful part about college. It's basically a never ending supply of people. Don't be afraid to keep putting yourself out there and keep trying new things. 

HOW TO DEAL WITH HOMESICKNESS:
This is probably going to happen to 80% of you. Feeling homesick is really natural. Call your family, keep in touch with friends back home, even go back and visit for a day or two if its close. 

For me, its always been a mindset thing. Don't expect your college relationships to be the same as the ones back home. I love all my friends from college and a bunch of them are going to show up to my wedding some day but you can't erase the 18 years of history I have with my friends from home. The beautiful part is that just because a friendship is different doesn't make it worse. I actually enjoy going out to parties/bars with my college friends more than I do with my high school friends so just because you haven't found someone exactly like your best friend from home shouldn't discourage you. Every person is different and therefore every friendship will be different too. Remembering that always helped me when I felt homesick

PICKING CLASSES:
This is one of the most exciting parts about college. There are so many cool subjects to study and you have more freedom and flexibility with it than you ever did in high school. For me, I always try to strike a balance between three things, time/day of the class, my interest in the subject, and the quality of the professor. 

For time/day I really try not to have Friday class. Having a three day weekend every weekend is pretty incredible and gives you more time to socialize Thursday night and sleep/work Friday morning. Also, unless you really are a morning person, don't take 8am classes. Just because you did it in high school doesn't mean you can do it in college. 

Interest in a subject is obviously super important. If you are interested in what you are learning you are going to work harder and do better in that class. With that said, a horrible professor can make you hate a topic you love and a great professor can turn a topic you couldn't care less about into you changing your major to that subject. Use Rate My professor. Its very accurate.

JOB SEARCH/NETWORKING IN COLLEGE:
This is for internships and career path jobs only, not for part time work for a little extra spending cash. Your freshman year its going to be pretty difficult to intern somewhere just because very few places hire freshman interns, its just how it is. Good news is that no company will expect you to have an internship your freshman year so if you want to feel free to take that summer off if you want. When it does come time to find your first internship you should do it ideally sophomore year, although junior year is acceptable for some fields. The first internship is always the hardest to land because you have no real applicable experience so you really need to leverage your network, which brings me to my first point, networking!

Networking is pretty straight forward definitionally, its merely the act of meeting someone in order to obtain an upwards career trajectory. How you network can be a little complicated but you're in college which makes it 10 times easier because professionals love talking to college kids. First things first, make a LinkedIn. I know you don't have one so go do it and have a friend take a picture of you in a suit or applicable office-wear for your industry. Same with a resume. Go make one, there are a bunch of great templates online. Now that we have that out of the way, time to actually network. Almost all colleges have a career center which is a great place to start. Not only do they have job/internship postings there but they also host networking events with firms. These events usually consist of a presentation by the firm, some Q&amp;A, and finally an opportunity for you to go up, shake hands, and meet some of the people at the firm. Come with questions, asking them about themselves and their role is usually the easiest because people love talking about themselves. Finally, always get the business card so you have their email to send a follow up email no more than 24 hours after the event. Make sure you periodically keep in touch with them, maybe send an article that you think they haven't seen, ask them for advice. Bam, you've just networked.

Also, don't be afraid to ask your parents/friend's parents to make introductions. They often have a bunch of good contacts that you can use. Networking is the easiest way to get a job/internship always, because the employee you have connected with can forward your application to the top of the stack. 

When it comes time to interview, make sure you prep. Read up on the company and look up some interview guides online as well. There are a lot of questions that are super easy to answer if you have prepped but will make you want to cry if you haven't.

CONCLUSION:
Well that's all I've got for part 2. As always feel free to DM me. I'll try and get back to you in a timely fashion. Much love and good luck!

If you feel sad or angry, you need to deal with those feelings, talk to a friend or a family member about it or if you have a coping mechanism like working out or writing in a journal, do that. Getting rid of those feelings in a timely manner will make you more positive too! Just don't let these minute social interactions be your way of expressing those feelings. You don't need to force someone else into dealing with your issues in the middle of class when you respond with ""I'm super angry"". There is a time and place for everything and if you are feeling super shitty just take the day off. Most classes don't even take attendance so if you need to do that once or twice during the semester, just do it.

FUN: This one should actually be called adventurous. Basically, it falls on the premise that people like people who are always doing cool and unique things. The easiest way to do this is to always say yes. This doesn't mean jump off a 30 foot building or take a bunch of hard drugs just because someone dared you to do it. Do not put yourself in physical danger. It does mean if your friend says ""let's go camping tomorrow"" and you don't have anything planned or if someone says you won't do a 360 off that jump just say yes. Don't let the fact that its last minute or a bit outside your comfort zone prevent you from having a good time.

There will always be more people in college. Say hi to as many as you can, you never know where you'll meet your best friends (I met one in a class, one from a fantasy football league, one at a tailgate, and one through a club). If you don't get along with someone, don't worry about it. Thats the beautiful part about college. It's basically a never ending supply of people. Don't be afraid to keep putting yourself out there and keep trying new things.

HOW TO DEAL WITH HOMESICKNESS: This is probably going to happen to 80% of you. Feeling homesick is really natural. Call your family, keep in touch with friends back home, even go back and visit for a day or two if its close.

For me, its always been a mindset thing. Don't expect your college relationships to be the same as the ones back home. I love all my friends from college and a bunch of them are going to show up to my wedding some day but you can't erase the 18 years of history I have with my friends from home. The beautiful part is that just because a friendship is different doesn't make it worse. I actually enjoy going out to parties/bars with my college friends more than I do with my high school friends so just because you haven't found someone exactly like your best friend from home shouldn't discourage you. Every person is different and therefore every friendship will be different too. Remembering that always helped me when I felt homesick

PICKING CLASSES: This is one of the most exciting parts about college. There are so many cool subjects to study and you have more freedom and flexibility with it than you ever did in high school. For me, I always try to strike a balance between three things, time/day of the class, my interest in the subject, and the quality of the professor.

For time/day I really try not to have Friday class. Having a three day weekend every weekend is pretty incredible and gives you more time to socialize Thursday night and sleep/work Friday morning. Also, unless you really are a morning person, don't take 8am classes. Just because you did it in high school doesn't mean you can do it in college.

Interest in a subject is obviously super important. If you are interested in what you are learning you are going to work harder and do better in that class. With that said, a horrible professor can make you hate a topic you love and a great professor can turn a topic you couldn't care less about into you changing your major to that subject. Use Rate My professor. Its very accurate.

JOB SEARCH/NETWORKING IN COLLEGE: This is for internships and career path jobs only, not for part time work for a little extra spending cash. Your freshman year its going to be pretty difficult to intern somewhere just because very few places hire freshman interns, its just how it is. Good news is that no company will expect you to have an internship your freshman year so if you want to feel free to take that summer off if you want. When it does come time to find your first internship you should do it ideally sophomore year, although junior year is acceptable for some fields. The first internship is always the hardest to land because you have no real applicable experience so you really need to leverage your network, which brings me to my first point, networking!

Networking is pretty straight forward definitionally, its merely the act of meeting someone in order to obtain an upwards career trajectory. How you network can be a little complicated but you're in college which makes it 10 times easier because professionals love talking to college kids. First things first, make a LinkedIn. I know you don't have one so go do it and have a friend take a picture of you in a suit or applicable office-wear for your industry. Same with a resume. Go make one, there are a bunch of great templates online. Now that we have that out of the way, time to actually network. Almost all colleges have a career center which is a great place to start. Not only do they have job/internship postings there but they also host networking events with firms. These events usually consist of a presentation by the firm, some Q&amp;A, and finally an opportunity for you to go up, shake hands, and meet some of the people at the firm. Come with questions, asking them about themselves and their role is usually the easiest because people love talking about themselves. Finally, always get the business card so you have their email to send a follow up email no more than 24 hours after the event. Make sure you periodically keep in touch with them, maybe send an article that you think they haven't seen, ask them for advice. Bam, you've just networked.

Also, don't be afraid to ask your parents/friend's parents to make introductions. They often have a bunch of good contacts that you can use. Networking is the easiest way to get a job/internship always, because the employee you have connected with can forward your application to the top of the stack.

When it comes time to interview, make sure you prep. Read up on the company and look up some interview guides online as well. There are a lot of questions that are super easy to answer if you have prepped but will make you want to cry if you haven't.

CONCLUSION: Well that's all I've got for part 2. As always feel free to DM me. I'll try and get back to you in a timely fashion. Much love and good luck!"

I had to go on medical leave but due to the way my school is set up, I can't go back to school until next year (January 2019). I'm back at my parents house helping around the house but I've basically been on my ass this entire time doing nothing but wallowing in my self pity. 

I've been too scared to go to therapy and have been ""attempting"" to apply for internships. But my self esteem and confidence has been rock bottom so my searches have been going no where. It's been seven months. My parents finally told me they had enough and signed me up for therapy (starting next week). They told me that they love me and will do anything possible to get me back on my feet but I don't know what my next steps should be. 

My cousin faced a similar mental breakdown a few years ago and his parents gave him money to cover a two week cross country trip to help clear his mind. The trip really helped him restore his confidence. My parents have been pushing me to consider doing the same since his results were so drastically positive. 

As appealing as the option is, I don't know if it's the option for me. I've already wasted seven months doing jack. I don't know if me agreeing to go would me agreeing to waste more of my parents time when I could be actually landing an internship. I know the change in environment would do well for me. I just don't want to waste my parents time anymore. 

I was wondering if anyone else with an similar experience could offer me some advice. Do you have any suggestions on how I can start being productive? Should I take up my parents offer and consider traveling? Or should I focus all my energy looking for an internship? I don't want to feel like a waste of space anymore.

I have received an acceptance letter from the Washington Center (TWC), for temporarily living and working at an internship in Washington, D.C over this following summer. While this is an extraordinary career opportunity - in that I will receive 9 academic credits (6 of which will go toward my Political Science major; it is one of the institutes that Rutgers and the Political Science Department officially collaborate with) and live and work at an internship in Washington, D.C., I am rather bashful of what to expect from this program and quite intimidated by the costs of said summer program (the total costs are approximately $10k, holy shit). So, for those who have applied to TWC and done all of this before: How was your living and internship experience in Washington, D.C. Is navigating your way through Washington, D.C. all by yourself something that can easily be overcome? How was your situation in regards to paying for the summer program?

Was super excited about programming, and everything CS for the first 3 years. Have done 4 internships, published a couple of papers, took part in lots of coding contests, projects, etc. I was really interested in creating software; building something new. I really wanted to learn more CS, and had my mind set on studying further, since the beginning of college. 

In my 7th semester I guess something happened. 
I was doing a semester long research internship at this lab. It was related to ML. I was not really interested in ML before that, and thought maybe it was because I hadn't done too much work in that area. I was wrong :P I hated the internship, did really bad work, got a really bad grade (This counted towards my overall college GPA). Also, during the same time, my mental health wasn't really good (Still isn't too great). I don't know if it had something to do with the bad internship xP 

When I came out of it and the next sem started, I just didn't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like doing contests anymore, don't feel like building small cool software for fun, heck, I don't even feel like attending classes anymore. 

I got a couple of job offers in the 7th sem, so I'm probably going to take up one of those. I don't think I can get any other offer right now, because I'm so out of it, I probably won't even get past the screening rounds :P 

I thought maybe it's just a phase, and I'll eventually get back my interest, but it's been almost 5 or 6 months like this, and I'm almost out of college! 

Would appreciate any advice!

87e9su,1,2018-03-26,"Ended the relationship, but still am in touch with her",lucasseba,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/87e9su/ended_the_relationship_but_still_am_in_touch_with/,"Hi Reddit, first of all let me introduce myself. I am 23 years old, going to law college and doing internship.

Let’s get to the situation. I met a girl in late december and since then we talked everyday, almost all day long for over 3 months (not a long time but I’ve never managed to mantain a relationship with someone for more than 2 months). Since the beggining we would meet every single weekend, hang out and make out as any normal couple would do, but we agreed that we weren’t going to have a serious relationship, which may confuse some people.

She was in an abusive relationship before and that was the problem for her getting serious with me, and she isn’t actually over it. I must say that we never had any serious fight or anything, so it was a pretty nice run, I have to admit.

Even though we agreed on not having a serious relationship, the only thing we didn’t actually have was the lable. Everything else was just like any other relationship, I supose.

So let’s get to the actual advice I’m looking for.

Last friday I’ve decided to end the relationship since she wasn’t ready for anything serious and we were already having something she wasn’t ready for. We talked and she agreed on it. I said I’d block her from social media since it makes endings a bit harder, she wasn’t very happy about it but agreed on it.

Yesterday she freaked out because I was sad about the situation and she felt guilty for everything, I went to her place and we ended up sleeping together, I know, big mistake.

The thing is I don’t really want to delete her from my life. I don’t have any resentment over her and we even talked about trying again when she’s ready, but we know we can’t keep seeing each other since it will definitely end up with us continuing doing the same things we’ve been doing.

My question is: how should I deal with this? We still talk daily, play some games together and interact in social media, but I’m afraid this can end up bad for at least one of us.

Obs.: sorry for any mistaked I’ve made, english is not my first language and I’m at class at the moment."

GPA is below a 3.0, which now means any potential internships, tutor positions, or employers will just chuck my resume to the trash.

I worked my butt off to try and keep it above a 3.0, but no matter how much I study or how much effort I put in, it didn't change a thing. I think that was the last straw for me.

I came back from work went to my room and then a hour later decided to throw my trash outside in the dumpster
I did it...and then I went to sleep. 
I woke up to yelling and what sounded like a mob of people outside my door. I opened it and literally everyone told me to go back to my room. So I thought maybe someone had passed away.
But the noise continued for 15 mins so I went downstairs to see what the problem was. .... Someone had keyed my neighbor  car..AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ME. And when I went downstairs they all decided to leave. All 5 people. Naturally I just went to my room... and then about 5mins later I get a knock on my door and its the nursing room students...Long story short they think I oiled the stairs too in which the elderly couple almost fell...and they said if i don't leave then the rest of them will be leaving...so my response was...okay you guys can leave and get out of my room. 
Now why does this couple have a high affinity of hatred towards me
1. I'm from America...and live there...and I'm doing Medschool in India and I have about 3 months left
2. I don't speak formal proper punjabi and they correct me every chance I get.
3. I've caught them going into my room when they thought i was not there. 
4. They said my mother...who was here for like a day talked crap about them with a bunch of people..and called her dishonest. 
5. When i asked any questions regarding the meter for electricity...i got yelled at and threatened that i would be evicted. 
These are the ones i can remember properly.
I get that I am an NRI and a lot of us do not have a good reputation but I got into several universities back home, a job, and also never had issues with authorities. 
I understand I am not from here, but that does not mean I should be treated any differently.

87f1k2,1,2018-03-26,Thoughts on this web design major?,jordannabanana,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87f1k2/thoughts_on_this_web_design_major/,"I got accepted to Purdue - a top computer science school - but not for computer science, but **this**: https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/web-programming-and-design

Some people I spoke to said the major was a ***joke***.

Only my family is supportive of it.

What do you guys think? Will I be missing out on any opportunities with this degree as opposed to a standard CS degree? I want to do front-end web design and graphics design and all that stuff, and this major directly correlates with that. It's like a match made in heaven in terms of what I'll be studying.

But according to other people (besides family and parents' friends), this major won't cut it for job stability in the future. Someone said I won't be studying data structures which is apparently essential for job interviews. Others said that web design can be self-taught and I'm better off majoring in something which actually gives a degree value.

What do you guys think? I am also setting my sights on other schools (waitlisted at UC Santa Cruz and have a good chance at getting into Cal Poly Pomona, both of which have respectable CS programs as far as I've heard... UC Santa Cruz has a top 10 game design program too) but would like some more opinions on this Purdue major.

Transferring to CS at Purdue will be tough. The minimum prereq requirements aren't that tough, but the competition to get in will be tough and space will be limited. That is the problem. 

So let me know what your thoughts on this major are. is it worth it for me to go to Purdue (and potentially end up graduating with a web design degree and CS minor over a CS major) assuming I get acceptances from UC santa Cruz and Cal Poly or other schools of similar prestige from my home state of California? Purdue is overall ranked higher, but then again, the major I got into was web design (which I like but may not be the best for my future), and I have no guarantee of transferring into a CS major.

If I get no other offers from my state of California, i'll head out to Purdue. I also got into UT dallas for software engineering but don't want to go there (don't ask). 


Thanks! 

Also, I appreciate y'alls help last year when I was looking for a CS internship. I found one which i loved, had a great time, made some cash (although under the table), learned a lot, contributed to lots of projects, and made loads of memories.

Regardless, feeling kind of stuck but ready to get out of the rut. Any and all help is greatly appreciated! Some additional info: sitting for CFA L2 in June, planning on finishing rest of CPA exam sections by end of 2018. (not just being lazy sitting on my ass unemployed).

The thing is I'm in my last class for c++ since my college only offers 2 in total. Next step for my degree is taking other languages that last only 1 semester. I feel like thats not alot of exposure and during the summer I think it would make more sense to practice coding and learn c++ and even branch out to other languages because how can i get a programming job if I dont learn programming more in-depth. I personally dont think i will have the time or energy to do both work a full time internship and then teach my self programming. Plus I already had an I.T job for around a year so I feel like i dont have to rush to get anything on my resume. But I'm wondering what people with experience think. Take the paid summer internship or focus on programming.

I have 3 options in my mind:

&amp;nbsp;

1\. I have one project that I'm currently working on, it's a program to help translators in its labour, I have developed it in Electron+React.js, and I have the UI completely arranged but it lacks some of the features, I could implement the features that I miss harcoding them, as if it was a demo and show that.

Pros: It's developed in react and show my knowlegde about the tech, it's complex good (in my opinion), and its the thing I have been working on for the past months so I can explain more about the design decisions, furthermore I have enabled ESlint so the code is not as ugly as the others

Cons: It's not finished, and maybe React hides that I have a strong knowledge of JS (strong for an internship, I know I have a lot of things to learn I'm not one of those guys that thinks he is a god)

&amp;nbsp;


2\. I have a React Native app of a social network I implemented with a friend, It's finished and ready to show, I has also a complete server so it shows I can make api calls within React and also that I can work on backend with Node+Express

Pros: It's finished and shows enough skill I think, also it shows that I can work with other people and I could explain some challenges with the teamwork and how we solve them

Cons: It's not web, I mean React Native is very similar to React but it's not the same, they could not like that is a mobile app, I fully know the app but maybe I would need to revise my friend's code, the code is not very good because we had tight deadlines

&amp;nbsp;


3\. I have some pure javascript projects that I have developed a long time ago, they show that I can do medium things in html+css+js, the problem is that they are small projects and I don't think they make the cut, mostly codepen projects.

Pros: I didn't use any framework and the code is tidy and clean

Cons: maybe is not enough, and i have made them a long time ago so I should review them

&amp;nbsp;

So I don't know what should I do, I think the best option is the first one, but as it's my first interview I ask you what you would do?, if you were a recruiter what would impress you the most?"
87iyna,5,2018-03-27,"Free Post-Bacc CS Degree, or Coding Bootcamp?",NoDistractionz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87iyna/free_postbacc_cs_degree_or_coding_bootcamp/,"Hi y'all,

I've followed this sub for quite some time and have been very intrigued on the advice provided. A little background on me, then the questions:

I am 24, graduated from university in 2016 with a BS in Business Administration w/ a Finance focus and have been working for a Broker/Dealer in the PNW ever since graduation. I've always been intrigued to learn more about Computer Science as it is something that always has interested me. After picking up a few small projects at my current job that required me to learn more about SQL, Oracle and RegEx, this confirmed my interest and hunger to delve deeper into the realm of CS. 

Now for my current situation. I recently put my two weeks in at my current job in order to do something I've wanted to do my whole life: travel. I will be gone for a few months pursuing things I simply have not had the time to with the intensive aspects of my job. 

Scenario 1: My supervisor at my current job really wants me to come back, and will do anything it takes in order for this to happen. This is a great opportunity in case I am unable to find employment after traveling. In addition to this, my supervisor has expressed that the company would be willing to pay for any post-bacc or Masters program that I have an interest in - for example, a CS post-bacc. This comes with the typical 2-3 years of being tied to the company, too. This scenario brings up a few concerns if I am to pursue a post-bacc in CS, being: I am not sure I would want to be stuck at the current company for this long, as there is not much growth outside of my current role; if I end up pursuing a post-bacc, I already know that I will be able to apply what I learn at my company, but I feel as if without actual tech or CS related internships that I will not be able to really use my skill set or learn what is needed to succeed.

Scenario 2: After travels I have an interest in moving to Seattle. I've always loved Seattle and have a good community of family and friends there, as well as the enticing aspect of the job market. If I do this, I want to look into coding bootcamps that might be able to push me in the right direction. This scenario brings up a few concerns: I have seen various posts on this sub that shame bootcamps, and make them out as something that won't get you too far; I am not sure how to balance paying for a boot camp with having used a lot of funds on traveling and not having a solid job when I come backl; I want to minimize debt as I am currently in debt from my previous bachelor's degree.

Overall, if I am to go the post-bacc route through my current employer, I fear that I won't be able to utilize internships or co-ops to really flourish and dig into the learning aspects of hands-on learning with others in the field; however, this option is free to me with the caveat of being stuck at my company for a few years. A bootcamp seems like a quicker route into the industry, but I am not sure that web-dev is where I want to take myself as that's what many of the bootcamps focus on. 

Certain questions: 

1. For those that have taken a post-bacc in CS, how much did it cost you and how long does it typically take?
2. Would it be worth it to get a post-bacc and work for a company that is not heavily tech focused? Additionally, would it mostly hurt me in the long run by not having experience with internships and co-ops where you are learning with others in the same field of interest?
3. For those that have gone the bootcamp route, did you feel competitive enough when landing a job? What are good ways to continue learning after the bootcamp (I understand MOOCs are a good start)?
4. Do you think pursuing a post-bacc over a bootcamp out of my own wallet would be beneficial if I am not interested in staying with my current employer? 
5. I know that self learning is an option, but that only does so much: what are other scenarios to learning more CS that aren't very expensive?
6. My current role allowed me to work with data consistently (this is where a lot of my interest lies in general). Are data science bootcamps worth it?


I appreciate the advice and help in advance. Let me know if I need to elaborate on anything. Thanks y'all!"

So I am a sophomore computer science (B.S.) student attending a pretty reputable state university. I'm working my way to become a data scientist in the future. I have two offers lined up for me for the summer and I honestly do not know which one to go for as I can see myself doing either one.

1) Internship at a Medium-Sized Company
I landed a Research &amp; Development Intern position at a medium-sized data compliance company 8 hours from home. I did some research on Glassdoor and read some reviews and looked at their company policies and case studies and they're pretty legit. The following would apply:

* $18/hr, 40 hours a week for 12 weeks
* Located in a pretty nice city
* Good reviews and experiences from people who worked there
* I would be required to find my own housing and housing in the area is pretty expensive
* I would also be required to find my own food as well 

2) Summer REU at a University
I landed an extremely selective NSF REU at a state university 9 hours from home. I would be doing research in software testing, machine learning, and conducting research on analytics.

* $5000 stipend for 10 weeks
* $500 travel reimbursement
* Free housing
* Free food
* 9 other students participating in program from around the country

Honestly I do not know which one to pick, they both sound equally as good and beneficial to my future in computer science and I'm equally as torn so I've opened the floor up to the Internet since I want an opinion from others as well. Any people who have been/are in the same boat and that can talk about pros/cons of each and what they enjoyed from each one can please share what they have to say that would be awesome! Thank you :)"

I got a certificate in computer literacy along the way too. My mom is nagging me to get an internship and everyone keeps asking me ""What are you doing after graduation?"" and I am just freaking out because a 5 day per week 9 to 5 job sounds like a life not worth living to me.

Here is a little background about me and what I have been up to thus far: I worked retail for 5 years, quitting this past summer to focus on my dog walking business I started durng my freshman year of college. I LOVE dogs, but I know it's tough to make good money outside of being a vet, and blood makes me queasy. I have a knack for computer science, and it is actually what I wanted to major in, but due to bad guidance my freshman year of college, and lack of money I ended up in business with a certificate in computer literacy. (The guidance office figured since I was a girl that I wasn't really talking about wanting to be in the nitty gritty computer stuff, just a tier 1 help desk operator. I ended up unknowingly taking a whole semesters worth of classes that counted nothing towards a major in IT). I took one IT class, and the professor was a woman who LOVED me haha. She was furious when she found out what guidance had done and said to me, and urged me to suck it up and take an extra year of college to take the classes missed, because my passion was clear. I regret not doing so looking back. Also, turns out that my exact situation happened to multiple other women in her class too, unfortunately. What I do right now to make money, and something I would love to make a job from is streaming video games. I am affiliated with Twitch, and would love to get partnered, but I am well aware of how far fetched that is.

So I guess what I need advice on is, where I should go from here? I would love to work in gaming/ twitch, but I know that is unlikely. Is it impossible for me to aim for an internship with an IT company without an IT degree? I don't know how to make a happy life with my business degree..."
87jqyw,0,2018-03-27,"Graduating in December, when should I start applying?",hahadatboi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87jqyw/graduating_in_december_when_should_i_start/,"Just some background, I'm a senior graduating in December with a CS degree. I have no real experience in industry doing proper software engineering (however I've worked IT jobs in the past).

I've already started applying to jobs for when I graduate, but I've pretty much been rejected from all of them within a couple of days. I think this has to do with not having any proper experience in the field. However, I managed to land a proper software engineering internship at a fairly large and reputable company for this summer, which I listed on my resume as ""upcoming software engineering internship for summer 2018 at company X"". So I started thinking maybe the best route is to wait until after the internship and then start applying for jobs, so that I can list what I did and what my responsibilities were. But I also feel like that's cutting it too close. Not really sure if I should just keep applying now even if I get rejected or if I should wait. Any thoughts on this? Any feedback would be appreciated."

87k9s0,1,2018-03-27,What should I expect from this internship? (according to what they told me to learn),sheldonzy,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/87k9s0/what_should_i_expect_from_this_internship/,"Hi, I'm a 2nd year CS student, and I got a 3 month internship in a startup company (as a part of some project my college is running). The internship is unpaid (I get class credit instead). 

The startup is a financial services firm that models and predicts the stock market. I said in the interview that I did some courses (Coursera) in ML, and did some projects in data manipulation and analysis, and it seemed like they liked me (probably because of the genuine interest in the field).

I'm not quite sure what they expect me to do/know. What they told me to learn (if I want to join a serious project): RL course by David Silver, DL Andrew Ng courses Coursera, some ML courses, Python and the pandas framework.
An example of a project (as they told me), is a RL model that forecasts the best option (sell/buy stock) using their current algorithm.
For example, I get as an input all the forecasts of the stocks (of previous years), and build a model that chooses what stock should the client buy today (building a portfolio based on previous data). Using Keras and some Tensorflow.

The internship is in a few months, so I'm still studying the material slowly (CS student after all). 

What do you think I'll do there?

My (uneducated) guess is most of what I'll do is clean the data (therefore pandas), and use 'simple' scripts to get the predictions, and then pass them the results. Like I'm automating some kind of an easy task for them (which is great, and really calms me down)"

Unfortunately, due to the increasing competitiveness of the college admissions process, I see many students here immensely frustrated with the results of the UC admissions this year and I wanted to raise some awareness for an unconventional path that I took.

A year ago I applied to 9 schools with a 4.04 UC GPA and 32 ACT as a CS major. My EC’s were pretty strong and my test scores were okay, however my GPA was definitely a weak point due to complacency and lack of effort sophomore year. After writing essays, submitting test scores, and finishing applications, I anticipated the decisions from the 9 schools I applied to for the remainder of senior year. (UCI, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, and Cal Poly as match/reaches, and SDSU, UNR, SJSU, and Cal Poly Pomona as safeties).

For months I lived in a state of being sure I would get into at least one of my match/reach schools, while also knowing that it wouldn’t happen. A majority of my friends believed I would get into at least one of the UC’s or Cal Poly, but when decisions started to roll in, I found myself waitlisted or rejected from all 5 of the schools I really wanted to attend. I had decent options at the other 4 schools but as the weeks grew thin and decision time came closer, I found myself not really wanting to attend any of them. This left me with Community College as my last option.

There has always been negative stigma towards community college, and I’m going to take a different perspective from most of the people advising community college as an option. I agree with it! Attending CC classes proved to be one of the most frustrating and boring educational experiences of my career. A majority of the GE classes were a joke, the counselors didn’t know what they were doing, and the students around me never put any effort into their work.  After following the courses of my friends attending prestigious universities, I really started to notice the gap in the challenging content and learning opportunities that the classes give you. Of course there are exceptions to all of this, but overall, attending community college just felt unpleasant.

However, with all of those issues aside, I still believe Community College can be a fantastic opportunity due to letting students transfer to schools they would otherwise not have been able to attend. Especially in California! I came into a CC with credit from 10 AP exams, and after an early meeting with the only good counselor at my CC I learned I was able to transfer to UCI (my top choice) with a TAG for CS in just one year. I also was fortunate enough to have an internship that would let me save money and build my resume while living at home. And then after 9 months, last week I took home a W and I’m extremely excited to attend a great school that turned me down last year.

Overall, I think there is a decent amount of you that are facing the same decision I had last year. The question I think everyone should ask themselves is what will put you in the best position for the rest of your life. Attending a Community College is the harder choice, but when it is over, you will not regret it. Be confident in your decisions, because the truth is none of us have all of the answers to make the right choice. I encourage all of you facing rejection or money concerns to explore the CC route, especially the ones that have been hoarding AP credit over the last 4 years. I hope my unconventional perspective helps you make a decision.

TLDR: I was so upset UCI gave me an L that I went to a CC and forced them to accept me this year."

I am a computer science student and was hired as a software engineer intern at a government controlled organisation.

I was contracted for three months to work a new project, which I was the only one working on. 
Now since my contract is coming to and end at the end of the month, they offered me an extension and which I willing to accept it under one condition.

Since my project expanded into something way more extensive than I intended from the start, 
I would like to retain full copyright to the piece of work (For future use/Portfolio).

I asked my employer if he would sign such an agreement for all the work I've done, and will be doing if I extend the internship, as long I grant the organisation full rights to use the software as they please (something like MIT License). I got a verbal agreement and was told to put in into writing as they will be signing it.

Now this is the part where I am struggling, I have never formulated a legal document and have no idea how to go about doing so.

Is there any templates that I could use for such a contract (already did some online research but couldn't find anything that would fit in my scenario) or will I have to talk to a lawyer for them to create this document?

I have no issue with paying a lawyer, the only problem is my extension contract would start on the 1st of April and I don't really want to sign the extension before the aforementioned document is signed. So it's a bit time sensitive, not sure if I have the time to contact a real lawyer.


Thank you all in advance!

I'm considering adding *another* semester abroad, but with that I'd have to postpone graduation a semester. Is this a terrible idea? How difficult is it to find a job if you graduate in December? Would graduating late be looked at unfavorably?

But I don't do any of that stuff. I've never wanted to code in my free time. I don't think I ever will. It's not that I don't find coding interesting, I do, but I get enough of it as is. My classes and interview prep give me well more than my fair share of CS-related stuff, and 40+ hours a week of work during my internships was the same. I have a lot of things I enjoy outside of CS, and it's soul-crushing to imagine giving those up so I had more time to code stuff. Yet so many of these companies expect their applicants to have *multiple* functioning, implemented projects that they've built for no reason besides the intrinsic joy of building shit.

87nn7z,42,2018-03-27,What if..,BigJoeyV,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/87nn7z/what_if/,"What if? 

Ever find yourself thinking about those two words? What and if. Two words, two syllables, six letters. Yes, just two little insignificant words. With the power to change everything. 

I personally think about those two words a lot. I've got a lot of situations in my life that I wonder what could've happened if they went the other way. If I choose door number one instead of door number two or even the occasional door number three. What if I would've stayed in school and kept on trucking until I got the journalism degree? The one I so desperately coveted as a wide eyed, 18-year-old college freshman. Instead I ended up dropping out my senior year to take that job as the shipping manager for my brother-in-law's suddenly booming manufacturing company. 

What if I hadn't been in a hurry that stiflingly humid summer afternoon and took the back roads instead of the interstate? Would I have still been side swiped by a semi and spent three days in the hospital? 

What if I would've given in to that rage, that sense of vengeance that I felt, that a lot of us felt really, and joined the military after September 11 like I wanted to? Would it have been an outlet for my repressed anger? Might I see frontline combat, and could it have altered the man I would become? Would I even still be walking this earth right now?

I allow these questions along with a myriad of others to flash briefly through my mind every now and again, but they never linger and are rarely given a second thought in that instance. Most of the decisions in my life I'm either comfortable with, or I've just come to accept. There's only one that haunts me anymore. 

The one that starts and ends with you.

That fall, over twenty-one years ago now, feels like it could've been yesterday. There we were, teetering between the ends of our teenage years and becoming what folks like to call young adults. Old enough to go to war but not old enough to buy a beer at the dingy bar in the square of our little, middle of nowhere town. We'd met three months before, when the girl I was dating introduced us while fate allowed our paths to cross at that tiny, independent grocery store just outside of town. The two of you had been casual friends in high school, but hadn’t seen one another since graduation. At least not until you’d checked us out just before the store was set to close for the night. 

Through the wonders of small talk, we learned that you were working there to help pay your way through school, and the store was looking for more help. As life would have it, it wouldn't be long till I was unloading trucks and stocking shelves at the same Hometown establishment on the same nights and weekends. It was a perfect job, freeing me up to attend classes at a local community college. Being among the last few people left in the store after closing most nights, it didn't take long for you and I to strike up a friendship. 

It started out innocently enough as we would chat while you were counting out your cash drawer in the back, and I was re-stacking pallets with boxes that had not made it out to the store shelves that day. Next thing you know, we were sitting around in the parking lot, talking and laughing long after having locked the grocery store doors. Hell, we even saw the sun come up a couple of mornings. 

Fast friends indeed.

But it didn't end there. With my girlfriend away at college, six hundred miles west, my free time was just that. Free. Before you know it, we were hanging out outside of work too. Grabbing cups of coffee at the all-night diner a few towns over, playing putt-putt golf on warm autumn afternoons, and sometimes even going Dutch on a movie if we both happened to have the same night off. More than anything though, we spent so many hours, so many nights just driving around in my car listening to the radio and talking. About anything and everything, while the minutes and the hours just slipped away. 

That's how we found the hill after all, on just another one of those nights of just driving aimlessly around the back roads we’d travel so frequently. The hill was really nothing more than a side street that was supposed to lead to a new development on the outskirts of town, cresting a ridge of the highest peak around for miles. I guess the money for the development fell through, because all that ever got done was the paving of the road and a little court up on top of that hill. Cruising around one evening, listening to the local country station you caught a shimmering green street sign for that road out of the corner of your eye and suggested we take a left and see where it would lead. Always looking to see what was around the next bend, I happily obliged.

It was amazing when we got to the top. If we looked to the north you could see our entire little town lit up, from one end to the other. We could make out every street, every building, all of it from that peak. Tall trees, hanging on to what was left of their leaves surrounded us, illuminated by the glow of the moon and thousands of distant stars. 

The scene was perfect. 

I imagine that's why we ended up there so many nights, sitting on the trunk of my old car with the windows rolled down and the radio on, just staring out at the sites and talking. It's that spot, that ideal, little, quiet part of our world that still creeps into my memories and drives me to pondering, agonizing over those two simple little words. 

What if? 

It all goes back to one late October night, the air cold and the wind soft, barely rustling the slowly changing leaves in the surrounding forest.. In the background, Deana Carter's ""Strawberry Wine"" played softly through the automobile’s speakers. I recall the harvest Moon brightly illuminating the fields, the trees and the town below us. I can remember the way the night glow fell softly on your face, your short blond hair, your pale skin and the deep emerald green of your eyes. I can remember looking into those eyes and feeling something I don't know that I’d ever felt before. Feeling as though I’d finally found a piece of me that was missing.

In that moment, I forgot everything else. I forgot we were supposed to just be friends, I forgot we were coworkers, I forgot I had a girlfriend several hundred miles away. The only thing I knew was the moment, and sharing it with you. 

What started as a knot in my throat slowly twisted into a fluttering in my chest before igniting and burning through me with the heat of a raging wildfire. I wanted to kiss you so badly. I needed to kiss you. I needed to reach for you, to know if you were feeling it too. I mustered my courage and turned towards you, ready to sink or swim. I leaned in your direction, locking on your eyes until the waves of uncertainty crashed against me and began to douse my fire. 

What if you felt different? What if I scared you away? What if this ruined our friendship, this relationship I so deeply treasured? 

I pulled back instantly. I never made my move and I’ve regretted it every day since. 

The night would continue pleasantly enough, like so many others we’d spent on that hill. But as soon as I had taken you back to your car, the question crept in. 

What if?

Two days later you would meet the man that would become your husband. Within fifteen months my girlfriend would leave me for someone she’d met during an internship. Within two years you'd be married. And every day since I’d wonder what if. 

What if I kissed you that night? Would you have felt the same, and would our relationship have moved to the next level? What would our wedding of been like? Would our children look like me, or like you? 

What if I kissed you that night, would we still have gone our separate ways? Would you still have married a man that laid his hands on you? More than once blackening your eyes? What if I kissed you that night, would you have turned so sheepishly away from me when our path’s crossed one lonely Saturday night in a crowded Wal-mart? Would you have acted as though we’d never been friends? Would you have turned to me for help that night, searching for a light in the darkness of an abusive relationship?

What if I kissed you that night? Would he still have thrown you down the steps, breaking your neck and ending your life before you even turned thirty? 

What if I had kissed you that night? Would I have spent seven months tracking him down after he dodged a murder conviction on a technicality? Would I have learned his every move, every hangout and every routine with only vengeance on my mind? Would I have found him alone in a parking garage, three sheets to the wind as he left that club in the city? Would I have still beaten him to death with a crowbar because of what he did to you?

What if I had kissed you that night, would I still be sitting in this prison cell in year seven of a life sentence, with nothing put a pen and notepad to remind me of you? 

What I wouldn't give to go back to that night so many years ago and find out the answers to these questions. To finally have resolution to the unknown that haunts my dreams every night as I lay on this cold hard cot, and stare endlessly at the steel bars and the concrete walls. No matter how many ways I look at it, no matter how many twists and turns I try to unravel, everything in my life seems to come back to that one moment and that one question. 

Still tonight, I find myself pondering a different scenario, though it all falls back to the same question. 

What if? 

What if, the next time I'm in the exercise yard, I can manage to get a gun away from one of the rookie prison guards and start shooting it into the air? Will they fire on me? Will they shoot to kill? Can I get them to put enough slugs in my chest that I can finally leave this place, leave this world and reunite with you on the other side? 

What if?

I'm American, but my home university is abroad which is why my summer break period is so different. My hometown is outside of Philly but commuting is not an option as I don't have a car or drivers license and the traffic is likely horrendous.

Unfortunately this internship albeit a great experience opportunity it is unpaid, and i usually would spend my summers working to earn money for tuition and living expenses, so i'm coming from a really tight budget. 

Anyone willing to lend me their couch or floor just for two months? Or know of alternative options, local hostels, websites or online communities where I could look?

So as a college student I was lucky enough to get a very niche and interesting internship with an established startup in my area. I'm a CS major and this internship lined up with CS. The start was bumpy with me getting a lot more manual and menial tasks than expected and I considered quitting many times before they realized what I could actually do for the company and assigned me some basic coding tasks. It has been this way for well over a month now.

I personally very much dislike working there. The work is not invigorating at all. Since I am building and fixing code that was built up from months and years of other people's work, I always feel disconnected from my work and find it simply uninteresting. Despite this, my co-workers and bosses are all very understanding and normal people that I enjoy being around. They have taught me a lot the past couple of months and I really appreciate that.

Right now, they are understaffed and have been liking my work. I was supposed to only work until the end of the semester which is rapidly approaching and they have been continually hinting at having me on for the summer. I wouldn't mind too much if it was close but once I move back with my parents for the summer, I will be an hour drive one-way away from the work place.

I'm only considering working a little more just to have more time listed on my resume but I'm unsure. I do get paid but as an intern, it's not much at all. Is not enjoying your job just life? I'm very inexperienced with this stuff and would appreciate any advice.

I'm a junior at a top 50 CS school who switched majors this semester.

I've been searching for internships for the past few months but with my lack of experience, it's been difficult landing something substantial. The only offers I have so far are for an unpaid web dev position and as a summer instructor teaching coding to kids. I've had two internships in the past, one doing CRUD stuff for a bank, and one unrelated to CS. 

My plan right now is to take Algorithms in the summer while working one of these jobs, and grind the hell out of CTCI/Leetcode + side projects to prepare for interviews from more reputable companies in the fall.

My question is: should I be applying to internships or full-time during my senior year? I'm not sure if I should try to find a better internship before I graduate. I'm still on track to graduate on time, but I don't know if it's possible to garner the experience required for a full-time position within the next 6 months.

Any thoughts are appreciated, thanks so much!"

I have been looking for an internship for about 6 months, and I still can’t find one. I’ve had countless interviews but most of them didn’t lead anywhere, and a few times it felt like I was really close to getting accepted but in the end I didn’t. 

Today I received a message from my school telling me they didn’t hear from me in a while and asking about my internship. I also received a message from my parents, asking for an update on how things are going. 

The thing is, it’s now too late for me to find an internship, meaning I’m going to fail my semester and do it over next year. I don’t want to answer to any of those messages because if I do, I’m going to disappoint everyone around me.

87qp4s,20,2018-03-28,I’ve been marked.,NeridaUlfa,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/87qp4s/ive_been_marked/,"[Trigger Warning](#s “language” “death”)

I’m from a largish town, the kind of town where basically everyone local knows each other, but it’s also a college town.  It’s a largely Christian community, somewhere between where the Bible Belt ends and the Corn Belt begins.

When I was thirteen, I discovered the concept of Wicca, but lacking proper ways to educate myself at the time, I made some mistakes.  Inevitable, really.  Back then, I was a kid messing around and didn’t realize I was playing with fire.  I know better now.

There are only three important people to my story: Randy, Louise, and Dan.  

I knew Randy from birth.  We both had a Catholic upbringing, went to church (more like we were dragged) with our parents, went to Catholic School, the whole nine yards.  We’d have known each other anyway, though.  Before I was born, my parents eloped and my mom commuted to visit my dad from St. Louis.  Dad had rented half of a duplex; Randy’s mom had the other half.  She was not from town, and had some trouble adjusting, but my dad (being the caring old hippie that he is) brought her out of her shell and she became his close friend.  If memory serves, she met Randy’s dad around the time that my parents started dating.  She liked to joke that Randy and I were conceived in the same duplex, to Randy’s eternal disgust and chagrin.  Randy ended up being six months older than me and therefore a grade ahead, but we were always close.

When it came time for middle school, my parents chose to pull me out of the Catholic school and put me in the public school, where I mostly didn’t know anyone and was always the outsider.  Randy and I kind of drifted apart, being at different schools, and I met Louise at the beginning of seventh grade.  Louise was also interested in Wicca and shared my love of metal music, counterculture, and general rebellion.  She also came from a very strict religious upbringing, so to us, the taboo of witchcraft, even green, was absolutely fascinating.  We did not use our poor knowledge well.

It started with a Ouija board.  Simple, right?  Simple and seductive and stupid.

I grew up surrounded by the supernatural and the ideas of it; when I was six, a Cherokee medicine man friend of the family had come to smudge the house and hang protective bags over the doors.  There had been some trouble with an “unhappy presence” when my parents had bought the house before I was born, and throughout childhood my imaginary friends were never really imaginary.  It may have had something to do with the hospital that was practically across the street.  Neighbors had complained as well.  It closed down when the new hospital was opened in the early 90s and lays abandoned to this day, a crumbling four story brick pile, half-Victorian and half-modern.  My parents thought the problem was solved after the medicine man came, but they didn’t realize it was trapped rather than expelled, trapped in our basement.  I’ve always had a love of all things morbid and macabre, so it never bothered me to have something so...unhappy there.  I didn’t know any better.

Louise’s parents had rented a crap old house maybe 8 blocks from me, and when I went over for the first time I felt the same unhappiness in her house that was in mine.  She said things had been happening that she couldn’t explain, so I was super excited to try a spirit board.  Nothing to lose, right?  And it was fun, for a while.  Different presences came and went, nothing super exciting, until the entity we dubbed “Cale” started showing up, no doubt attracted by our naïveté.

“Cale” was different from the others.  He followed us from place to place, seemingly eager to communicate.  We always knew it was him, because he brought with him a smell like rotting garbage, which we called the “Cale Fart Effect,” as in “Cale, stop farting in my room!”  He didn’t mind our stupid name for him, or the jokes.  It was me he was after, you see.

That early winter, Louise had a birthday sleepover with me and a few other friends we’d managed to make.  We were eager to show off our impressive new talent with the spirit board, and our friends were just as eager to see.  Not long into the session, which had been marked by giggling and lit by candles, “Cale” showed up with the usual stench.  Then things get hazy for me.

I was told later that I started acting strangely.  Not speaking like myself.  Then I started crying and freaking out, yelling that my back hurt.  Apparently after that I passed out.

When I came back to myself, I was laying on my stomach on the bed and the others were deathly quiet, and had pulled up my shirt.  From shoulder to hips, I had six perfect scratch marks, three on each side.  From what I’ve been told, demon marking comes in three different ways: one mark, they’re showing interest.  Two marks, they want you.  Three, and they’ve staked their claim.  This demon marked me with both hands.

We all kind of went our separate ways after that night, mostly because the others were scared.  Louise moved not long after to another town, though we remain friends and partners-in-crime to this day.  Much more informed now, thankfully, and neither of us will ever touch a spirit board again, though we do practice the proper Wiccan way.

After Louise moved, things went relatively back to normal.  Then, the summer before ninth grade, I met Dan for the first time.

Dan was my then-boyfriend’s best friend, and so was always around.  We continued to be friends after the boyfriend and I broke up, even though he was two grades ahead.  I was just happy to have an upperclassman as a friend going into high school.  After how I’d been treated all through middle school, I was scared at the prospect of now having 800+ new people to torment me.  One good thing happened, though, and that came in the form of Randy gravitating back into my life.  The Catholic school did not continue past grade eight, so he was thrown into public school rather abruptly.  And he was always an odd duck, the kind of kid who thought dressing in drag and singing Britney Spears in the talent show the height of hilarity.  Eccentric was the best word for him.

That fall, Dan did something terrible.

He wasn’t the type you’d think would be into scary things.  He was a varsity wrestler and pretty popular because of both his looks and his jock status, but he was friends with us goth kids and played guitar like a madman.  His taste in music was good - in fact, that was why we became friends.  But Dan had a dark secret that fall, one he didn’t tell me until I was in my 20s and it was far too late.

Dan had gone out with friends to an old barn on someone’s property.  It was a general high school party until someone pulled out a spirit board.  Something that brought a horrible smell came to Dan that night, and offered him power.  In front of everyone there, he agreed.  They thought it was a joke until the barn was pulled down around them while Dan just laughed.  The price had been easy enough for him.  It didn’t want his soul, it wanted an agreement.  Dan could have all the power he wanted, and it got me.  Forever and for always.  That’s why Dan had laughed.  The only price he paid for the agreement was a mark like something I’d never seen: a full handprint, large and misshapen, on his left shoulder blade.  Not so much, really; it looked like a birth mark, although his mom told me later he never had it as a child or early teenager.

Dan changed after that, and I wrote it off.  High school, right?  Just another brick in the shithouse.  He graduated in 2004 and went away, anyway.  Did not stick around this town a minute longer than he had to.

The summer of 2003 had really opened my relationship with Randy back up.  We had taken driver’s ed that May, been driving partners (because really, who would have either of us?), and become inseparable again.  During the 2003-04 school year, Randy started becoming a little stranger than usual.  Change in behavior.  His mom had a chronic illness that had taken a debilitating turn, and with his father gone for work much of the time, Randy, an only child, was her primary caregiver and the only means of transportation she had.

People who had known Randy a while thought he was depressed.  He started self-harming and was hospitalized once during that school year.  All sad and scary to those that loved him, but it was those closest that realized something was seriously, truly wrong that went beyond adolescent depression.  They labeled him schizophrenic and shoved meds at him, but his friends thought he had some kind of second personality, one that he knew about and frequently talked to.  He had a name for it and everything, one that I dare not even type out because I believe it to be the being’s true name, and to name it summons it, I know that for a fact.  He would call it and it would take him over physically and mentally.  His whole demeanor would change when it was in charge.  I saw it many times, had conversations with it, even.  Randy told me I was the only person it liked, and the summer of 2004 I seemed to be the only person it wanted him to be around.

At the beginning of the summer, I had taken a job as a counselor at the Girl Scout camp I had attended for years.  I was deep in the heart of the Ozarks.  At the beginning of the six weeks, in training week, an older counselor had told me there was something bad in Unit 3.  Having been in that unit as a camper, I knew; had, in fact, accidentally been bringing it with me, though I didn’t know that at the time.  Still being the brave (read: stupid) teen at 16 that I had been at 13, of course I HAD to go and face it.  So I did.  There not being any girls yet, I couldn’t see the harm in poking the bear a little and having a good laugh later around the proverbial campfire.

Unit 3 and I had a history.  I always seemed to be in that unit from age 13 on.  Unit 3, Cabin 1.  As far as I’m aware, my groups were the only ones who experienced anything.  This counselor knew, because I had been her camper.  Movement through the drifts of dead leaves around the cabin at night, loud footsteps, and strange occurrences - like coming into the cabin at night and finding venomous snakes had found their slithery way into our luggage -  were common.  This counselor claimed to have seen the thing one night, or at least the shadow of it.  She claimed that from inside the cabin with the canvas flaps pulled over the screen windows, it looked like something large and hunched with ram-like horns, but outside there was only a wavering spot in the air, like you see over hot surfaces.  And a smell like garbage.

So I went one night, after the other counselors in my cabin were asleep, to Unit 3, Cabin 1 to confront it.  I felt it immediately as I stepped onto U3’s property.  I puffed up my chest like I knew everything in the world and told it to leave, and leave the campers alone that season.  Nothing happened to the girls, but plenty happened to me.  Unexplained bruises that looked like fingerprints all over my body, panic attacks, voices no one else could hear, a constant feeling of fatigue, and weird accidents - like falling asleep on a porch railing and falling 14 feet down onto rocks, being bitten by a wild mouse, and almost cutting my finger off in my car door and requiring a trip to the ER for stitches were only a few.  It got so bad that I was in the infirmary every day for something or another, to the point where the nurse would ask me, with exasperation, every time I walked in, “What did you do now, Elle?”

I managed to make it out of camp alive in July, and went home.  The first thing I did was stop by Randy’s house and invite him to go for a walk, as walks were the only way to sneak away and smoke cigarettes for us.  From that night we were practically attached at the hip, and both our mental states started to devolve.  I had been battling anxiety and depression from an early age, and he had that...thing...attached to him.  He told me early on that it had mostly left him alone, but it always seemed to be there with me, sliding across his face with a laugh.  One of his other friends had noted “[NAME] IS WINNING” scrawled on his arm when they met up somewhere.

That thing and death seemed to be all we talked about.  We had both developed eating disorders and I was down to around 90 pounds, and he encouraged me to continue losing weight as I wasn’t skinny enough yet.  And one night, sitting on the empty college campus, we talked about how we’d kill ourselves, if we decided to.  I was vague, he was precise.  He said he wanted to put a belt over the bathroom door and drop his weight so that he could watch himself in the mirror.  He said it had told him what to do.  We laughed like it was a joke.

Then came August.  I called him one evening to make sure we still had plans and to see what time he wanted me to pick him up.  He told me after I ate dinner.  I asked him if he wanted me to call first, and he said something I will never, ever forget.  He said, “I’ll be here, hanging around.”

I have never felt evil as clearly as I did when I got there.  Everything seemed darker, the air heavier, like trying to breathe through a wool blanket.  It was just like he said it would be: the belt in the bathroom.  Time seems so slowed down and syrupy when I try to remember, and it had a surreal quality I’d only experienced in dreams.  He’d been dead practically since I hung up the phone with him.  He’d been working over the last few days to convince his parents to go to the movies so they’d be gone.  They pulled up to police and EMS parked in the street and on the front lawn, and a crowd of gawking neighbors.  No one would tell them what happened, and I will never forgive those officers for that; they left an oddly-calm teenage girl to tell them their only son was dead.  Randy’s mom died a few years later, and his dad actually just remarried.  I’m happy for him.

After that night, my life spiraled out of control.  People steered clear of me at school, as I had developed the label of crazy in the aftermath of Randy’s suicide.  For good reason: the thing had decided to go to work on me, personally, now that it had destroyed the person who, for all intents and purposes, was my brother, the one person it would ruin me to lose.  I was consumed by guilt, and, fed by whispers constantly, I tried twice to end my life.  

But I didn’t.  In fact, I graduated top ten and went to college.  During an internship in the city, I ran into Dan, of all people.  We started dating, and after I got my degree I moved away from my small college town for the first time and in with him.  We got engaged.  Life seemed like it would be good.

Then he told me what he’d done.

I tried to put it out of my mind, but I couldn’t.  And I couldn’t be with someone who could offer me up like that, no hesitation, to something so truly evil and that had almost destroyed my life multiple times, and had succeeded in killing Randy.

That’s been years ago.  Long behind me.  This year will mark 14 years since my best friend lost his battle to the thing that hunted me.  I’m back in that town, living with my boyfriend and my young son, dog, cats, house, you name it.  The life.  Things have been up and down, but ultimately everything turned out okay.

At least, I thought it did.  I thought I was safe.

It’s back.  It’s come for me.  I hear it whispering in the night.

I’m so afraid.

I turn 22 this year, and 'real life' seems to be hitting me full force. I hope that you can give me some advice. 

**Academic Background:**

* 3 months away from completing B.Tech. in Computer Science from a Tier-II college. Average marks (absolute) is around 73%
* Internship 1: Created a 'lab automation system' for a reputed college. Essentially this removed the need for students to maintain physical lab notebooks
* Internship 2: Part of team which created an e-commerce app for a random robotics startup.
* Projects: Created a system for recommending entities based on a Twitter profile. Submitted (but not yet published) a paper on the topic to a Tier-2 journal.
* Strong interest in Machine Learning \ Data Analytics. But mainly self taught. I work well with Python + SciPy + Scikit
* Gave GATE this year (for M. Tech admissions) with rank around 2000 (not good enough - no reservation)

**Family Background**

* Upper middle class family
* Extremely smothering and orthodox parents who seem to care about nothing more than their money and how to recoup their 'investment' in me.

**With that done, here's the options I see before me, in decreasing order of preference:**

* Do MS abroad (but how to finance?)
* Give GATE again next year and do M.Tech here. (worth it?)
* Join a product based company (how)
* Join the campus placement job I got (Infosys, 3.5 LPA)

Since /r/india has people from such a wide variety of backgrounds, maybe someone can help? I kind of clutching at straws here! Thanks"

Should I disclose my (terrible) GPA on it if its not required?,completefool43,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/87sss6/a_company_is_asking_me_to_fill_out_a_second/,"So I applied online for this software dev. internship at a small company a few weeks ago. I felt fairly qualified for this internship in particular based on the job description (and no GPA requirement). It was a pretty standard online application too - just some personal details, school history, employment history, attach resume, etc.

So anyways, last week they invited me to come interview with them. After setting a date and time, they have asked me to fill out a second application ""in preparation for the interview"", this one to be filled out on paper by hand, to be scanned and sent back to them. Kinda unexpected, since a lot of this information they should already have from the first application, but whatever, not a big deal.

The form has marked some boxes required with an asterisk. One of the boxes NOT marked required is the GPA box. My GPA is pretty shitty - a 2.7. And even though the job posting didn't have any GPA required, I'm obviously hesitant to volunteer this information.

On one hand, I'm thinking about leaving it blank if its not required, and hope that its not a big concern to them and it will never come up. On the other, I feel like that might set off red flags and they will absolutely ask me about it, which is something I'd really rather not discuss at all in the interview.

I accepted the offer late October of last year and my original offer in the Princeton, NJ location. 

Earlier this week, they reached out to me about team placement and apparently the team I will be working with at the Princeton location will be on the consumer side of banking (I am thinking perhaps maybe app or website development); however, the bigger location of the same company has reached out to my recruiter, showing interest in my skillset. They would like me to come work at the NYC location for their global banking team. Other than my project placement, all other details of the offer remain the same. I will still be paid the same amount and given a ~3k stipend to help pay for housing. 

I am conflicted about which location I should go with, since my top location choice while applying for the internship was NYC. I'm from the west coast, so NYC seems like an amazing place to spend the summer but maybe I'm romanticizing it a bit. Princeton seems a little boring and harder to get around without a car, but it definitely will be cheaper to live in than the city. However, the project in Princeton sounds a lot more interesting to me than the one in NYC. 

I've already made a pros and cons list for each location, but I would like your opinion on the matter! **Should I pick NYC for its great location, but less interesting project or Princeton for its not-as-great location, but more interesting project? Which one would be better for my career and skill development?**

Thanks for your input!

87t7r4,319,2018-03-28,"Waitlisted? Read this guide by Novembrr, former UChicago/Berkeley Admissions Reader",novembrr,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/87t7r4/waitlisted_read_this_guide_by_novembrr_former/,"You don't need me to remind you that today is the day most students' dreams of attending an Ivy League institution will be crushed. But there will be many of you who are waitlisted to your dream university—whether that's an Ivy or another institution. Most people will tell you all hope is lost.

I'm not most people.

One of my students last year was accepted off the waitlist at Penn in *mid-June*, after his guidance counselor, family, and friends all told him to give up. I didn't, though—I said it was possible.

And it is.

In the last few years, my students have been accepted off the waitlist at Penn (obviously), Princeton, MIT, UChicago, Berkeley, UCLA, Swarthmore, Amherst, and more.

Read on for how they did it and how you can, too.

**First step**

Set aside your dream school for a second, gather your acceptances, and take a critical look at them. You have two options: 1) Submit a deposit to one of them by May 1, or 2) commit to taking a gap year if you aren’t accepted off the waitlist at your dream school. If you choose option 1, research the universities to which you’ve been accepted. Go to accepted student days; talk to current students; or scour the internet for insight into their departments, resources, and culture. You will not hear back from your waitlisted university until after May 1—when all students have to submit their deposits to their university of choice. Thus, you must deposit somewhere as well.

If you choose option 2, strategize what you are going to do during your year “off” to improve your chances of admission. A year off is a misnomer, for you really should utilize your extra free time to funnel all your energy into pursuing your intellectual interests, conducting research, getting a job or internship, volunteering, or pursuing a hobby (to improve your chances of admission next time).
If you decide to take a gap year, consider all your options. You might be able to deposit at a school, get approved to take a gap year, and apply to other universities in the meanwhile (with your original university as a fallback plan for next year if you don’t get into the school of your dreams). If you decide to take advantage of this strategy, read every line of the gap year agreement you sign, as most top universities prohibit students from holding their spot during a gap year  and  applying to other universities. You definitely don’t want to violate your contract and jeopardize your chances of admission across the board.

Let’s say you misjudged your reaches, targets, and safeties and didn’t get in  anywhere. You have two options: 1) Take that gap year, 2) go to community college before applying to transfer, or 3) apply to more schools. Yes, there are still schools which are accepting applications. Every year, the  National Association for College Admission Counseling puts out a list in early May of universities which would welcome your application. There are  tons  of schools to which you can apply, even at this late date. Consider sending out a few more applications to broaden your options for this fall.
And community college isn’t the worst option, either. In California, for example, last year the University of California Davis accepted 93% of transfer applicants from California community colleges. 93%! They have a program called Transfer Admission Guarantee where, if you receive a 3.3 GPA or higher and complete the required prerequisite classes, you are guaranteed transfer admission to UC Davis. And that GPA qualifies you for admission to *all* the UCs. Bump up your GPA just a bit higher and you have good chances at UC Berkeley and UCLA—not a bad route to get into some of the nation’s top universities! If you decide to go to community college close to home, check out the policies for transfer admission into your state’s flagship public university. In the meanwhile, do everything you can to get off the waitlist at your dream university...

**Research the university’s waitlist**
  
 The best source of insight into the university’s waitlist is its Common Data Set (their data on admissions and university processes). Use this [pretty comprehensive list](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/wiki/common_data_sets) of Common Data Sets to find your university’s data for the previous few years. Scroll down a few pages (or control + F “wait-list”) and you’ll see information on their waitlist—how many students were offered a spot on the waitlist, how many accepted that spot, how many were ultimately accepted, and whether they have a ranked waitlist. Not every university will candidly report this information but many do.
If the waitlist is ranked, there is next to nothing you can do to identify your rank on the list and little you can do to bump yourself higher on that list. If the waitlist isn’t ranked, however, admission is anyone’s game—and I’m going to tell you how to start playing.

**How to start**

Talk to your guidance counselor. Tell them you were waitlisted at your dream school and assess their relationship with that university; some counselors, but not all, will have a working relationship with different universities, and will feel comfortable calling the university on your behalf. Did a university representative visit your high school this past year? If so, it’s very possible that your guidance counselor  does  have a relationship with that university and can be a resource to you at this time.
Politely ask your guidance counselor to call or send an email to the admissions officer assigned to your region (or, if no admissions officer is assigned, the dean/director of admissions), reaffirming that their university is your top choice. Your counselor should also highlight your achievements or address any potential concerns an admissions officer may have had when evaluating your application (say, you had a low grade but neglected to tell universities that you were sick with mono that semester). Ask your counselor to seek feedback on your application, and whether or not there’s anything you can do to affirm your interest in the university and value you would bring to campus, if admitted. Sometimes, universities will provide candid feedback to guidance counselors that they won’t to students, if the student were to call instead.

Two years ago, one of my students was waitlisted to her dream university. I picked up the phone and gave that admissions office a call. They candidly told me that there were two issues with her application: she had selected a competitive major, and she had erroneously reported her GPA to be lower than what they had calculated. With GPA discrepancies, they said, they go with the lower GPA of the two—despite their higher calculation. I was surprised (that policy is inane, in my opinion), but knew what to tell her: “Email them, correcting your GPA, and mention your newfound interest in another major. Cite specific examples of your preparation for that major, and how you’ll explore it on their campus.” She was accepted off the waitlist a few weeks later.

This year, her little sister was waitlisted to  her  dream university. Again, I called that admissions office. They opened her file, said “Hmm, that’s strange. There’s a flag on her application requesting more information, but we never followed up with her. We’ll do so this afternoon.” I prepped her on what to say and, when the admissions office called, she provided the detailed insight into an issue they had with one of her qualifications. Then, she confirmed with them that they had all they needed to make a favorable decision on her application if space becomes available at their university come May.

Cross your fingers for my student, and see if your counselor can call on your behalf to your dream university.

**Start building your arsenal**

Talk with someone affiliated with the university—not to ask them if they can pull strings (well, unless they can... in which case, ask away) but to get to know the university better and drum up information with which to email your admissions officer.

I’ll give you an example. A few years ago, I worked with a student who had been waitlisted to the University of Chicago. Let’s call her Sarah. Sarah asked if I had any advice for her and I told her to contact the university’s Dean of Students and ask for an informational interview. “Do you really think the dean could get me off the waitlist?” she asked me.

“That’s not the goal of contacting the dean,” I told Sarah. “Your goal is to learn everything you can about the admissions committee’s criteria with which they make their decisions, the university’s values, and what qualities they seek to find in their incoming class.”

So, Sarah contacted the dean and the dean immediately responded: “I’m flattered by your request but terribly sorry—I don’t control admissions decisions.” Instead of being deterred, Sarah knew to tell the dean that all she hoped for was a brief conversation about student life. “I know you’re incredibly busy,” Sarah told the dean via email, “but I’d love only 10 minutes of your time. As Dean of Students, your insight is essential to me better understanding the UChicago student experience.”

The Dean acquiesced. In their brief phone call, Sarah asked the dean everything I had told her to ask. “What is the quintessential UChicago quality that every student possesses?” “How do UChicago students and the UChicago education stand out from rival programs?” “Is the admissions committee looking for certain qualities to build a diverse incoming class?” “What types of students does UChicago need more of?” etc.

Then, Sarah sought feedback on her own accomplishments. “When you said that UChicago students were really entrepreneurial, that resonated with me. In my spare time, I run a business that does XYZ. Do you think my skills in ABC could be furthered within the UChicago curricula?” Luckily, the dean responded by giving Sarah numerous examples of ways in which her entrepreneurial interests could be furthered at the university (which Sarah wrote down in her notebook for use later).

Sarah kept the conversation brief, thanked the dean profusely, and immediately drafted an email to the admissions office. In that email, she described her refreshing conversation with the dean and, using what the dean said about the university’s values, crafted a description of how Sarah’s own values aligned with the university’s. She further outlined how her interests perfectly matched the university’s offerings, and how her skill set was exactly what the committee sought in their incoming class. She was confident but never brash, complimentary of and knowledgeable about the program, and incredibly detailed in her correspondence.

She was accepted off the waitlist the very next day. And she is just one of many applicants who I’ve helped use this strategy to get off the waitlist at their dream university.

**Okay, but I don’t know any deans**

Sarah didn’t either. However, look at who you do know. If you had an alumni interview, contact them. If they liked you, they could be a valuable resource to you.

Dear [Name],

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the status of my application to Tufts. Unfortunately, I was waitlisted.

I found our conversation invaluable (thanks again!) and wanted to know if you have any advice for me moving forward. Do you recall anything that previous waitlisted applicants did to convey their love for Tufts and be accepted off the waitlist? Any advice for me in contacting my regional admissions office or updating my portal with new information?

Any and all advice you might have is welcome. I really value your time, and appreciate all that you do on behalf of Tufts as an alumna.

Sincerely, 

[Name]

If your parents have a LinkedIn account, ask them to log in. See if anyone in their network (even to a third degree) works at or attended your dream university.

Last year, one of my students’ moms went to school with a gentleman who now works as the director of career development at the student’s dream school. The mom hadn’t talked to the man in decades, but she sent him a LinkedIn message and he graciously agreed to talk with my student. Maybe, just maybe, you’ll strike gold on LinkedIn.

Let’s say you don’t strike gold on LinkedIn; let’s say your parents don’t have a LinkedIn or never even went to college. You don’t have a network to lean on and no connections whatsoever. That’s okay—create those connections.

You can contact a professor whose interests closely align with your own. For more information on contacting a professor, including detailed templates you can follow to craft an email, see my admissions guide “[Emailing Professors](https://www.helpwithapps.com/product-page/emailing-professors)”.

You can contact a student leader of a club you’d like to join (say, debate if you attended the Tournament of Champions), the PI of a lab whose research aligns with your own research (or, better yet, see if the PI of your lab knows anyone at your dream school and can make an introduction on your behalf), or an administrator of a career development center. Often, you can find their contact information (at the very least their name) on the department or club’s website. You can always utilize the university’s faculty or student directory—if accessible to the public—to locate their email address.
Then, do as Sarah and countless other students of mine have done: email them and ask for an informational interview.

If you strike out with one person, try again with another. If you’re polite enough, there’s got to be someone at the university willing to have a 10 minute phone call with you.
 
**Ask for an interview**

Let’s say you requested an interview but didn’t get one. It’s unlikely that the university will give you a formal alumni interview now, but you could always hustle to get one anyway. Google your closest metropolitan region, the name of the university, and either “alumni interviews” or, if that fails to bring up any results, “alumni club”. Just now, Googling “Harvard alumni interviews Chicago”, I found the name of the alumnus who coordinates all the alumni interviews for the Chicagoland area—and his email.

If you were successful in finding the alumnus/a who coordinates alumni interviews in your region, email them directly. If you didn’t find the exact person in charge, email the president of the regional club to inquire about being put in touch with that person.

Ask them if you can do an informal interview with them or one of their volunteers. If they accommodate your request, knock the socks off your interviewer and then, politely, ask them if they would be willing to send the university a letter of recommendation on your behalf.

**Ask for an additional letter of recommendation**

Speaking of letters of recommendation, if you have anyone else in your arsenal who could write a letter of recommendation for you, consider reaching out to them. Know any alumni of the university? They could be a great resource to you, as they can directly align your values with their alma mater’s values, and your skills with areas in which the university seeks to improve. If your alumni interviewer is enthusiastic in their response to your email, you could ask them to write a letter on your behalf, positively comparing you to other students they interviewed this year (“Of the 8 interviews I conducted this year and 40+ conducted over the past few years, Jorge is by far the most impressive for XYZ reasons”).

Any other teachers impressed with your prowess in the classroom? How about your principal, assistant principal, or someone on the school board? What about a local politician, business person, religious leader, mentor, research director, professor from a summer program, boss, etc.?

If you’re being recruited by any coaches or are in communication with any of the university’s club leaders, they might also be able to write a letter of recommendation on your behalf.

When selecting a recommender, focus on substance over fame; it’s all well and good to get your local Congressman or Congresswoman to write a letter of recommendation on your behalf, but if all they can say about you is “He is a fine young man who would surely benefit your institution,” find someone else who can really showcase the value you have to offer.

To get incredibly personalized letters of recommendation, first send your recommender a letter. For details on exactly what to send them to stand out in the application, read my admissions guide entitled “[Getting Great Letters of Recommendation](https://www.helpwithapps.com/product-page/getting-great-letters-of-recommendation)”.

**Consider your weakness(es)**

Clearly, the university liked your application; if they hadn’t, you would have been outright denied. But they liked other applications over yours, possibly due to some weakness in your application.
Now’s the time to consider what that weakness is. Maybe it’s obvious to you—you suffered from some bad grades second semester junior year, you don’t have sustained extracurricular involvement for multiple years, or you wrote your essay without much thought and attention to detail.
Let’s say you had weak grades first semester. You could specifically mention in your email to admissions your great grades this second semester, or provide context for your lower grades for the period in question (if you have a better excuse than you blew off your homework to play video games, of course). If you quit a sport mid-high school (and didn’t provide context for your decision), mention the injury you suffered from that sidelined your career, convey how you funneled your free time into another activity, and describe how you’ll get involved on their campus. Didn’t do anything extracurricularly at all? Perhaps you failed to mention that you babysit your younger siblings for long hours every day—mention that to admissions now. If all you did was come home from school and nap—and you think your weak extracurricular involvement was the reason for your waitlist decision—tell the admissions officers how you plan to get involved at their university.

Maybe your application’s weakness *isn’t* obvious. Reread your app or ask a trusted adult to do so. I also offer comprehensive review of applications with targeted strategies to get off the waitlist. If interested, you can [purchase my Waitlist Strategy Session here](https://www.helpwithapps.com/product-page).

When I look over applications, the issues are obvious. Often, I spot missed opportunities in students’ extracurricular activities list; last year, one of my waitlist review students wrote, under Varsity Swimming, “I swim”. She neglected to tell universities that she was captain of her team for two years in a row, and had led her team to win the first conference championships in school’s history. For another student, a competitive soccer player, his hours per week involvement looked low. Turns out he traveled hours each day across the state to practice, adding *tons* of additional hours per week commitment to his sport. Both these instances could—and did, once the students emailed admissions—change universities’ opinions of their accomplishments and potential future involvement on campus.
Other times, I’ll find missed opportunities with the essays, like students who neglect to write the optional essays (unfortunately, in the eyes of admissions officers, those essays aren’t really optional). Or they failed to explain a health or family issue that negatively impacted their grades one semester. All these things can be addressed in your attempts to get off the waitlist. You can write that optional essay and attach it to your email, get a letter of recommendation addressing the health or family issue that you overcame, providing context for a string of lower-than-usual grades, or clarify your extracurricular involvement.

If you applied to a competitive major—cough, computer science—and don’t really have the stats or experience to back it up, you can even choose to highlight another one of your academic interests in your email, and express your desire to attend under a new major. I have the enrollment by major information for most top universities and would be happy to work with you to pivot your major, highlight another academic strength, and get into the university come hell or high water.
I encourage you to reread your application and look for any issues that you can address. If you need my help, visit my website, HelpWithApps.com and purchase a [Waitlist Strategy Session](https://www.helpwithapps.com/product-page) with me.

**Compile a list of your latest accomplishments**

Since you applied (or you last corresponded with the university, if you sent them a letter of continued interest), has anything new happened in your life?
   
* You became a National Merit Finalist (or winner!)
* You qualified for a prestigious national competition (ISEF or Tournament of
Champions, for example)
* You placed (the higher the better) at a local, regional, or state competition
* Your sports team won within your conference, region, or state, or you were
named to the All-Region or All-State team
* You won a departmental or class award at school (English Student of the Year,
for example)
* Your research, writing, design or artwork was published or displayed
* You got a job or internship
* You were promoted or received a raise within your job, internship, or club
* You were named employee or student of the month
* You created something cool (an app, for example)
* You expanded your club (partnering with schools in your district, for example)
* You won a scholarship (not to a competing college but on behalf of some organization)
* You earned a lead role in a play
* You were named captain of your sports team
* You led a very successful fundraiser
* You made the local paper
* You advocated before the school board on an important issue
* You were the lead organizer of a peaceful protest
* You took on additional responsibility in your family to help overcome a hardship
(your grandma grew ill, so you take care of her every day after school, for
example)
* You achieved a significant personal milestone (losing 40 pounds, for example)
* You earned a certification (CPR, for example)
* You were named prom king or queen
* You leveled up in a sport (earning black belt, for example)
* You were named valedictorian or salutatorian
* You were invited to speak at graduation, a conference, or a cool event
* And more cool things!

Write a list of anything substantial that has happened to you since they last heard from you. If nothing cool has happened to you, don’t admit defeat. Have you learned something new that sparked your thirst for knowledge? Mention that.

See if any of your latest accomplishments or newfound knowledge can be connected to the university’s offerings. You don’t need to link every new thing you did to something you’ll do on their campus, but try to connect one or two things you mention to ways in which you’ll get involved on their campus. If you published your research, for example, mention how you want to get involved in a related lab on their campus or publish future findings in their university science journal. If you earned a conflict resolution certificate, mention how you want to become a resident advisor in one of their dorms or join a club that brings people from different backgrounds together to discuss contentious political issues. Be specific; mention the club’s name, the dorm’s name, the research lab in question, the professor under whom you wish to study, etc. Connect the dots for them regarding who you are today and who you will be on their campus, if they admit you off the waitlist.

**Do some soul searching**

How much do you love this university? If accepted off the waitlist, will you absolutely attend? If so, be sure to tell the university. Universities care about yield: how many students who they accept ultimately decide to matriculate. Thus, universities care about yield off the waitlist. They only want to offer spots to students they know will come. Do them a favor and tell them you will come if you really will.

Let’s say you’re trying your luck at multiple waitlists. You could tell each of them you’d attend if accepted off the waitlist, but that could also bite you in the butt. Let’s say the admissions officer at Wellesley goes to the wedding of two admissions officers from Barnard and Middlebury and everyone gets to talking about this great kid they think they’ll accept off the waitlist and, whoops, they’re all talking about YOU, who told each college they were your dream college and you’d “no lie, attend if accepted”. Don’t be that kid! You can always give strong, positive language—“I love [university] and would love to attend”, for example—without promising multiple universities you’ll attend.

Some universities offer gap years off the waitlist (Harvard calls it the “z list”). If you’ve heard rumors that the university offers acceptance to students who will take a gap year, consider whether *you’re*  willing to take a gap year to get into your dream university. I had a student waitlisted at UChicago who, in his email to admissions, said he’d be happy to take a gap year. That very same week, he was offered admission off the waitlist if he took a gap year. He took it, got an internship, gained real-world experience, and matriculated to UChicago a year later. He not only enjoyed the mental break of his gap year, but he also tells me he’s had greater success in earning internships in college because he has more experience on his resume than his peers. Win-win, I’d say.

Some schools offer guaranteed sophomore transfers (Cornell and Boston University, for example). If that’s something you’d be willing to consider, keep it in mind. Last year, Cornell took 75 students from the waitlist; Boston University, in contrast, only took 7. Maybe you’d like to hold out for a straight acceptance off the waitlist at Cornell but odds are you won’t be accepted off the waitlist at BU. If BU is your dream school, consider asking them for the guaranteed sophomore transfer option.

**Think creatively**

I’ve always said that my hypothetical pageant talent would be juggling a soccer ball while baking a cheesecake—but that’s really just a distraction from the fact that I have no “creative talents”. I cannot sing, I cannot draw, and my only B in my master’s program at Stanford was in videography, so it’s safe to say I cannot make any videos, either. But maybe you can.

If you, like me, lack creative talents, don’t force them. But if you are an expert videographer, can create cool animations, make beautiful artwork, or whip up entertaining raps, feel free to create something personalized for your dream university. Doing so could help endear you to admissions officers and help you to stand out from other waitlisted applicants.

But while I encourage you to think creatively, I don’t recommend you think *desperately*. Consider from an admissions officer’s perspective on what would be appropriate. Don’t send them anything edible, don’t draw a portrait of the admissions officer him/herself, and don’t stalk the admissions office. When I was a tour guide at UChicago, I remember our burliest admissions officer having to go down to shoo away a waitlisted student who had hovered for *weeks* within our office; I’m sure the student was just trying to win us over, but it did exactly the opposite. So, be enthusiastic, be creative, and be just persistent enough to be the squeaky wheel which gets the grease and not the squeaky wheel who gets banned from Harvard’s Office of Admissions.

**How to email your admissions officer**

Now that you’ve done some soul searching, spoken to your guidance counselor, asked for a new letter of recommendation, reflected on your weaknesses, identified recent accomplishments, and canceled your one-way ticket to visit (i.e. stalk) the admissions office, it’s time to contact admissions.

I recommend you contact them sometime in April—after you’ve received all your other decisions but before they receive final numbers regarding the size of their incoming class. It’s okay to be a squeaky wheel this spring and summer, so long as you’re a polite wheel, so go ahead and email them again in May. If you haven’t been accepted off the waitlist come June, but you haven’t been cut from it either, don’t be shy: the admissions gods don’t help those who don’t first help themselves.

Many universities list admissions officers by their region or territory (the part of the world in which they read applications and travel from school to school, recruiting potential new applicants). You might be able to find your regional admissions officer just by Googling the university’s name + “admissions officers by region”. If that doesn’t bring up any results, approach your high school guidance counselor to see if the regional admissions officer has visited your school in the past. If he or she has, your guidance counselor likely has the individual’s name and, if your guidance counselor is nice (and you ask politely), he or she will share that person’s email address with you, as well. Alternatively, some universities have an open-to-the-public faculty directory, in which you can enter the admissions officer’s name and find their contact information. Any students who work with me in the Waitlist Strategy Session will receive a list of the best people to email.

If you cannot find your regional admissions officer or the school doesn’t even have admissions officers assigned by region, search for the dean/director of admissions’ name and email address. Worse comes to worst, just find *anybody* who works in admissions (well, besides student workers and administrators) to send an email, or the general admissions email address if it is listed.

Keep in mind that some universities prefer to get updates from students via a portal, and some universities specify that they do not wish to be contacted at all. Look up the policies in your original waitlist letter or the university’s waitlist FAQs. Personally, I recommend emailing no matter the circumstances; chances of getting off the waitlist are pretty low across the board, so emailing when they tell students not to contact them is probably not going to diminish your chances of admission. But, hey, I’m a rule breaker (when it comes to college admissions; I’m the most rule-abiding citizen when it comes to other things). You do what you think is best in this regard.

**Template for emailing admissions officers**

Eager to get started? Here’s a bare-bones template for you so you can get an idea of what you should write.

Dear Admissions Officer [last name],

I know this is an incredibly busy time for your office, but I wanted to reach out to personally thank you for selecting me to be waitlisted to [university]. While being waitlisted might be a disappointment for some, it was a great honor for me, as [university] is my top choice and I would absolutely, without a doubt, attend if accepted.

[Here’s a good opportunity to mention your conversation with someone affiliated with the university and what you gained from that conversation. Subtly craft an image of your values aligning with the university’s values. Mention your accomplishments and connect those accomplishments to who you will be on their campus (what activities you’ll join, classes you’ll take, research you’ll conduct, etc.]
I know you are incredibly busy, and I greatly appreciate your time. I am very excited about the possibility that I may attend [university] in the future. If there is any way for me to attend—even by matriculating to [university] next year and not this fall—I would absolutely jump at the chance.

Sincerely,

[Your first and last name]

[Identifying information like the name of your school or your applicant ID number, if you were assigned one]

This template is only meant as a starting point for you. Please personalize the language so it sounds authentically you. I cannot tell you how many people have borrowed my language verbatim before sending me a “final version” for review. If you do so, I’ll make you go back and personalize your email, so please personalize it the first time around!

For subject lines, try to be creative; creative subject lines jump out to the reader in a cluttered email inbox. If you like to stick to the basics, you could always say something like, “An update from a waitlisted applicant.” Other ideas include: “[university name] is still my top choice!”, “How I plan to bring [new accomplishment] to [university name]”, etc.

**Examples**

Hopefully, you have all you need to write the best email of your life. However, if you need more examples, I have four awesome ones [available for purchase here](https://www.helpwithapps.com/product-page/getting-off-the-waitlist). That's also the link to download my entire admissions guide on getting off the waitlist, in case you want to save a copy.

**What not to do**

A director of admissions recently told me about an email they received from a waitlisted applicant. In the student’s initial application, he was a top contender for admission. Then they received the writeup from the student’s alumni interviewer, and the alumnus said the applicant was incredibly arrogant during the conversation. The student, no longer a top contender, was ultimately waitlisted but the director of admissions still thought the student could be admitted off the waitlist based on his excellent accomplishments... until he emailed the director. In his email, he was arrogant, citing reasons why he thought he was a better candidate for admission that his peers who were accepted. It was such a turn off that not only did the director of admissions tell me he would definitely *not* be admitted, but she said she was going to phone call the student’s guidance counselor to complain.

Don’t be that kid. Be the kid who stands out for all the right reasons. Be the kid for whom admissions officers advocate come time to take a couple kids from the waitlist. Be the kid whose admissions officer cannot wait to call to give them the good news.

I believe in your ability to get off the waitlist and get accepted to your dream university.

**Final words**

I am often inundated with PMs, asking for free advice, and unfortunately I cannot answer them all. Feel free to ask some brief questions, applicable to other students, down below and I'll try to respond to each person! If you need direct feedback on your letter or you're lost on where to start, chat with your parents about my [Waitlist Strategy Session](https://www.helpwithapps.com/product-page). No pressure to set up a meeting with me—I'll still love you either way. 

And if you use my advice and are accepted to the university of your dreams, please tell me! I love getting messages from students who share the good news. Shout out to one of you kids yesterday who PMed me that his mom kicked cancer's but *and* he was accepted to one of his dream schools. Made me and my cancer-surviving mom tear up. All you kids are great, and all you kids will be great no matter what university you attend. Years ago, I was denied to my dream school: Columbia. I had the second chance to apply to them for grad school, was accepted, and turned *them* down. I realized I didn't need a Columbia education to actualize my dreams. And you don't need an [insert dream university here] education to actualize yours, either. I'll definitely do my best to help you get in there, but don't despair whatever happens today.

Best of luck,

87tcoj,2,2018-03-28,Should I make the switch from Data Warehouse development to Java development?,GrossBanana,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/87tcoj/should_i_make_the_switch_from_data_warehouse/,"I am 27 years old based in the UK. I hold a 1st Class Hons in Computing Science during which time my main programming language was Java. During my degree I did a 15 month internship at an IT firm who deal with selling insurance. This internship involved core Java work with a little JUnit and front-end work. After my degree I came back to the same company and was placed into a Data Warehousing team using the Microsoft SQL stack which mainly involves me working with SSIS and SQL Server. I have been in this job for the last 3.5 years.

I did not know anything about ETL or DWH work before joining this team but I put in effort to try to bring my skills up to a reasonable level and got a couple of certifications. Recently I have been feeling more and more stagnant in the role and really questioning whether or not I enjoy this kind of work.

I have been looking for a new job for a few months now. Initially I started off looking for ETL/DWH roles but was finding that there weren’t that many and made me question the benefits of staying on this career path so I started looking at getting back into more development/Java type roles. 

I recently interviewed for a Java developer position at a consultancy company and got offered the job however it would involve taking a slight pay cut to what I’m currently on as my Java skills are still at a graduate level. I might find Java more interesting as there seems to be more creativity/diversity of work etc however I do enjoy working with data in some sense and analytics would be an area that would interest me in the future. I feel like I am at a crossroads in my career and unsure of which direction to take. 

Should I move away from DWH and essentially start over again as a Java dev? 
Am I likely to make as much money (or more) by sticking with Data Warehousing even though it may mean being bound to a specific toolset? 
What are the long term pros/cons of each and which is the better career choice?

TL;DR: 
Have some industry Java experience. 
Been a Data Warehouse developer for last 3.5 years. 
Should I make the switch back to Java for greater long term benefit?"

I would've rather gone straight cs , but my school only offers most classes one term of the year so I would've had to take an extra 2 terms , and I'd have been in college for 5 and a half years plus a summer  ($$$$). If I have all the cs core classes (data structes, algorithims, comp org, operating sytsems, etc) will I be ok? Or should I take the extra 6 months. I want to be a Java or c++ programmer, good with python flask as well. 

As far as the internship, I got one for the summer but I need to take 12 upper level math classes and a wiritng class so I doubt the internship will be possible. Will this hurt me going into the job market? My University has a class called ""internship"" with a data structures pre req. If I took this  in the winter next year would that possibly help? There's no information anywhere about what kind of internship this is, and I plan on asking as soon as break is over.

After my degree I came back to the same company and was placed into a Data Warehousing team using the Microsoft SQL stack which mainly involves me working with SSIS and SQL Server. I have been in this job for the last 3.5 years.

I did not know anything about ETL or DWH work before joining this team but I put in effort to try to bring my skills up to a reasonable level and got a couple of certifications. Recently I have been feeling more and more stagnant in the role and really questioning whether or not I enjoy this kind of work.

I have been looking for a new job for a few months now. Initially I started off looking for ETL/DWH roles but was finding that there weren’t that many and made me question the benefits of staying on this career path so I started looking at getting back into more development/Java type roles.

I recently interviewed for a Java developer position at a consultancy company and got offered the job however it would involve taking a slight pay cut to what I’m currently on as my Java skills are still at a graduate level. I might find Java more interesting as there seems to be more creativity/diversity of work etc however I do enjoy working with data in some sense and analytics would be an area that would interest me in the future. I feel like I am at a crossroads in my career and unsure of which direction to take.

Should I move away from DWH and essentially start over again as a Java dev? Am I likely to make as much money (or more) by sticking with Data Warehousing even though it may mean being bound to a specific toolset? What are the long term pros/cons of each and which is the better career choice?

I just finished an interview today with a company for an entry level position, I think I did pretty well. I could have answered a few questions better, but overall I think I did good enough. Now I was invited for a technical interview.

So for my technical portion, I am required to build a LAMP stack and present it to the team of engineers and the manager. I have looked up some videos, and it looks simple enough, but I want to go above and beyond. Is there anything else I can do/apply when building this LAMP stack that might wow the team?
Possible something security related, as this company primarily deals with InfoSec.

I have no professional experience in the field aside from my internship last semester, and I am REALLY looking forward to the job opportunity. In addition to this being my first IT job, this company seems to be a great place to work.

Thanks in advance fellow redditors, much love from the SoCal.

*Julia, Julia Andersson.*

“Thank you. Please introduce yourself.”

*I’m currently a sophomore majoring in nursing at Ma-*

“Riddleton University.”

*Yes, Riddleton University, pardon me.*

“Please understand contents of this interview should strictly avoid violating any privacy. Names beside your own should all be fabricated.”

*Yes, sorry about that… Should I start?*

“Go ahead.”

*Well, this happened a few weeks ago. I was interning at the Riddleton clinic as a lab assistant for some extra cash.* 

*Mr. –uh– Clay, Mr. Clay asked me to stay later that night to help him run a few experiments. Just to take some notes I should clarify. The lab is located in the basement of the clinic. The building’s not that big, I’m sure you’ve been there before, but for some reason that night we had an ER patient. It's not a rare sight; we get one or two a month but it's not that common either since there's a bigger hospital on the other side of town.*

*The lady that was rushed in was probably in her late sixties. I wasn't actually supposed to know, but Mr. Clay was the only doctor on duty that night and he asked me go take a look.*

*'For some additional practice' he had said.*

*We rushed to the second floor and the paramedics told Mr. Clay that the lady had suffered a severe stroke just before bed. We hooked her up to the EKG and the paramedics handed over the CT results. Mr. Clay got started on the tPA and I started to shuffle through the lady’s medical records.*

*Everything showed that the lady was very healthy except for mild high blood pressure. Mr. Clay wasn’t really bothered by that fact and just told me that age is a big factor in these things. After her conditions were stabilized, Mr. Clay told me to stay there and go down stairs for him if anything happened. I sat next to her bed, kind of out of place since I wasn’t even a nurse on duty at the time. There were two other nurses on shift at the time and they kind of just eyed me but didn’t say anything because I was with Mr. Clay.*

*After around half an hour or so of reading my magazines, I started to notice that the patient was exhibiting subtle irregular breathing. Her heartbeat was perfectly stable however but I still decided to run downstairs and ring for Mr. Clay. He followed me to the ICU immediately and the two other nurses arrived as well. Mr. Clay performed an abdominal check on her and started pouting.*

*‘It’s her back. Turn her over.’*

*With great effort, the four of us unhooked everything and flipped the lady on her stomach. Pulling over her gown, there was tumor on her lower back.*

*Now I promise I’m not even exaggerating. This thing was gigantic, it had veins stemming off the sides into her skin and it was pulsing periodically. It was purple in color but had a reddish tint at the stem of it. One of nurses wretched and the rest of us stared in absolute disbelief.*

*‘Julia, please tell front desk to phone for Dr. Jason.’ Mr. Clay told me urgently, still staring at her tumor.*

*I ran to the clinic clerk and told her to phone for Dr. Jason. After explaining the situation to him, Dr. Jason told me he was on his way and would be at the clinic as soon as possible. I rushed back to the ICU and saw that the patient was flipped back onto her back and everything was hooked back up.*

*‘Are we going to do anything about this?’ I asked.*

*‘We can’t. She’s unconscious and her son is currently out of town and is arriving tomorrow morning. There is no one to sign off for a surgery and even if there was, we’d still have to transport her to the main hospital.’ One of the nurses explained.*

*‘Julia, can you please take this sample and run the standard tests.’ Mr. Clay asked as he handed me a petri-dish.*

*I am no oncologist here, but I still took the sample and went back to the basement and ran it under the microscope. Okay, this might sound unbelievable, but the cells under the microscope were writhing. They were squirming and slowly becoming more and more clumped together the longer I looked. The ones at the edges of the giant conglomeration were turning gray – they were dying!*

*The purple cells were alive and I was sure of that. As I played around with the microscope, all of a sudden the clump of cells jumped onto my finger. I screamed my lungs off and thanked God I had latex gloves on. I pressed my finger on the petri-dish as hard as I could and yanked off the glove with my other hand. Then, I ran upstairs half hysteric.*

*Thankfully there was no one else at the clinic that night and I rushed straight to the ICU to tell Mr. Clay. When I arrived, it was already too late. The first thing I noticed was that the lady was displaced from her bed. Her legs were still on the bed but her torso was slumped off towards the ground and under her head was a growing pool of blood. Her eyes were still closed but the corner of her lips was foaming – she was dead.*

*Upon further examination, Mr. Clay was on the other side of the room, writhing in pain.*

*There was a purple mass attached to his left leg. The pants were corroded away and the tumor (I was not sure what it was at that point) had the same veins branching off as the lady did onto Mr. Clay’s legs. There was blood and lesion around the area where the flesh and tumor met and I screamed in horror. Mr. Clay was fighting the tumor off with a scalpel and yelling in pain at the same time. He looked up and saw me and yelled,*

*‘Julia leave! Close the door! HURRY!!’*

*The desperation in his voice made me snap out of my paralysis and I slammed the door and started sprinting down the hall. Around the corner I saw Dr. Jason walking hurriedly towards the ICU and ran up to him. I couldn’t even begin to form a sentence at that time with the snot and tears choking up my throat.
My face was red and I was gargling my sentences while struggling to breathe, Dr. Jason bent towards me and wiped the tears off my face.*

*‘Relax honey, just go home.’* 

*I nodded and swallowed, still hyperventilating. I ran out of the clinic to my car and drove straight back to my dorm. My roommate was doing homework at the time and when I barged in with my face red and tear streaks everywhere, she just assumed I had a break up.*

*I couldn’t even comprehend what had just happened; much less explain it to my roommate. I took out the codeine my roommate had stashed under her clothes before she could even protest and took a few big gulps.*

*I slept through the night without much trouble and woke up the next morning realizing I had forgotten my bag and phone at the clinic the night before. Driving back to the clinic, I was extremely hesitant to set foot in it. After waiting 15 minutes in my car, I stepped out and followed a man slowly into the building.*

*The clerk and the front desk saw me and immediately pulled out my bag and my phone.*

*‘Hey Julia, glad you came back for this.’ He smiled,*

*‘Hey...’ I answered suspiciously before taking my stuff, ‘Do you know what happened to Mr. Clay and Dr. Jason?’*

*‘Oh? The patient died from a stroke last night, they stayed to clean up.’ The clerk answered with a smile. I was getting freaked out at this point but decided not to push my luck. I took my stuff and hurried back towards my car. I called off all my classes that day and stayed home watching television.*

“Did Mr. Clay contact you anymore?”

*No, in fact I get paid biweekly for my internship but my check hasn’t arrived.*

“Did you attempt to contact anyone from that night after the fact?”

*No, no I have not. I told my friend – like best friend, she takes me seriously no matter what – about what happened and she told me to come to you.*

“And your friend’s name is…? Never mind, don’t speak. Tell me after this interview. Is there anything else you would like to tell me?”

*No, that’s about it.*

“Well then, interview number one is finished.”"

My degrees are in International Relations and French, and though I preferred studying IR, I've taken the first year out of college to go to France and teach English. While this is so far going swimmingly, I'm unsure about how I'll find a good job that interests me coming home for the summer, starting May. In September, I tentatively haul out for another country in which to teach English over again. 

Between graduating and leaving for France, I worked 2 different food service jobs (think a place that doesn't rhyme with Aristotle and a coffee chain that isn't Starbucks) for more than 60hrs/week to save money. Now most of those savings have been depleted while supplementing my below-minimum-wage salary here (which I don't regret) but I'm dreading having to work like that again, especially in food service. 

This apprehension is in no small part because of the comments I receive from my dad whenever I would talk to him, saying that I shouldn't work minimum wage jobs because I graduated with honors in two different degrees. I feel like I'm letting my parents down in a small way, but I also feel like I'm bashing my head against the wall while trying to get my foot in the door. 

Where I live is a pretty small town, and my state isn't exactly a bustling hub of international involvement anyway. I have a lot of experience teaching, but I don't want to go into that direction after my travels are finished, so I'd like to have at least an internship or temp job in IR if I can get something.

I feel like in this situation I'd have to relocate for a position (if I can even find one first), but I'm not sure I can afford it. Advice would be highly appreciated - in both finding relevant jobs/internships and how to make enough money without spending it all on potentially relocating so that I could save some up in a short time as well. I feel like this may not be feasible, but I reckon regardless it can't hurt to ask before resigning myself to overtime food prison again."

I, thankfully, managed to grab two internship offers.  Neither are from well known or prestigious companies.  Both of their compensations are similar.  The difference between the two is their distance and how much I feel like I'll learn.

Company 1 is not a tech company and is really far.  From Google maps, it looks like getting there will be 1 1/2 hours in traffic and coming home will be 2 1/2 hours for a total of 4 hours in traffic a day.  On a good day it might be 3.  Their interview was technical and they have an official internship program and I would be working on a mobile application project.  This company seems extremely traditional (clocking in at 8 and clocking out at 5 etc).

Company 2 is a tech company and is extremely close to me (about 10-15 minutes).  On top of that, I wouldn't even have to go to the office most of the time as all of the developers work from home.  On occasion, I would meet up with one of the senior developers who lives about 30-40 minutes from me (or we could meet at the office).  Their culture seems a lot more relaxed as well.

However, the interview wasn't technical at all.  It actually didn't even seem like an interview as the person I talked with seemed intent on hiring me if they could find work for me to do.  This may be because I was referred by one of the senior engineers.  They don't have an official internship program (as demonstrated by the fact that they're trying to find work for me to do) and the majority of the developers have been there for 9+ years.  The product is fairly old and they are just starting to move it into the cloud.

I feel that I would learn more with Company 1 but the potential 4 hours of driving is insane.  Company 2 seems a lot more relaxed and is a lot closer if I ever need to go into the office, but it seems like a place where people just go to retire and a place where I wouldn't learn much.

What do you guys think?"

But I've just kept quiet about it. I can't even begin to imagine what it would be like to talk about it. It took me days to make a post about it on reddit, and that got kinda buried and ignored... haha. Maybe it was too nihilistic.

I'm a 28-year-old undergrad student. I've battled with depression and mental illness for as long as I remember being alive. I've been in and out of medication for the past handful of years, and nothing has truly helped, or I guess I just didn't do it right. I've also seen a handful of counselors and psychologists, and I'm currently also seeing a psychiatrist. I have a cocktail of diagnoses under my belt nowadays... major depression, generalized anxiety, borderline personality disorder, PSTD, and ADHD.
The multitude of questions that come to my mind when I write all that shit down is overwhelming. What constitutes a mental illness anyway? What if these are misdiagnoses? What if I'm somehow just making it all up?

Sorry, I'm getting sidetracked.

My boyfriend of almost three years moved across the country from me over half a year ago. We get to see each other once in a blue moon, and every time it happens, afterwards I get thrown into a downward spiral of depression. I've been doing badly in school, well, even before he left.

He came to visit a couple weeks ago and I was not in a good place. I told him maybe I needed a break, I needed a change, maybe we should break up. I just dropped two classes which pushes my graduation date ever farther out and now it looks like I won't be done until 2019. That's another full year apart. After he left he messaged me saying he agrees, he needs a change too and that we should break up.

We've only spoken twice since then. And I'm still so confused.

I am constantly bombarded by the need to message him and talk to him, but at the same time frozen in place and unable to actually act on anything. I ask myself if I'm being selfish, if I want to reach out just because he understands me and could possibly help me feel better.

Well, this is not the only thing either. I just can't feel happy for anything. It's not like my life is a total disaster - right now, anyway. I'm sure doing enough to make sure it becomes a disaster soon.
I recently got accepted for an internship in the same city my (ex?) boyfriend lives, over the summer. They pay extremely well. I'm also due to get my citizenship this coming month, something I've been waiting for and fighting for for over a decade now.

But it does nothing for me. It doesn't make me happy. And I still want to kill myself.

I'm currently taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal) and Adderall. The adderall helps me feel slightly better during the day when I take it, but I'm still frozen. I can't do anything - not study, not read, not anything productive at all.

These mental illnesses aren't going to go away. Even if I feel better for a while, it's only a matter of time before they come back. I don't want to live like this...

What's the point of life if I can't enjoy anything anymore? Nothing brings me happiness. It's always just a constant struggle to suffer a little bit less than before.

I feel selfish, I feel guilty. I know there are a lot of people out there who have it so much worse than me. But I just don't want this anymore.

I've been browsing the internet for ways to kill myself painlessly and peacefully for the past few nights. I've come up with plans in my head for how I can set things up so my death causes the least amount of disturbances and annoyances to those around me. I've even looked up how to write a will and what are the important things I need to set up before I go.

But I still feel scared. I know it's just human nature. That pesky survival instinct getting in the way. I wish there was a way to get to a mental state so strong, that that survival instinct doesn't kick in. Or just somehow put myself to sleep and pass peacefully without feeling a thing.

I'm tired of feeling like this. I guess I just wanted to say that."

The job isn't too interesting for me, but I do like the people I work with. Upon my last employee review in fall, my supervisor told me they didn't know if they would have a position open for me upon graduation and to look for other jobs, and not to say no if I was offered something but was still waiting for an offer from them(A), I'll call them company A. So I have been applying for jobs ever since that moment trying to get into another company and have something lined up for graduation, not having much luck. I had an interview about a month ago at a bigger company (B) and was offered a position with a decent starting salary. This company is a lot bigger in my city(1000+ employees) than where I currently work (&lt;100). I accepted it immediately because this was the first offer I had and it's too the point where I was worried I would have nothing upon graduating because company A had never mentioned anything to me. I just lined up my start date for company B.

This week my supervisor came in and said they were opening up a position for me to apply to in a different area. I told him I had an offer at another company and already accepted it, but I would think about my options. The supervisor of that area came in shortly after him and asked me what my plans were post graduation, told me a spot was opening up in his area and he would like to keep me there. I then told him I had another offer at a different company I accepted. He said he wouldn't know anything for a couple weeks on what they could offer me or when the link to apply would be posted, but not to say no to the other company yet, just that he would like to keep me there. He said nothing is concrete yet though.

Just kind of asking for some thoughts on this situation? I would like to consider all my options, but I feel bad I have already accepted the Company B position. If company A offers me a lot more money should I decline company B after I've already accepted? Would this close the door for me to that company forever, even though I got hired for an entry-level position out of college?"

The only con about it is the major, which is Applied Mathematics, with a concentration in statistics. I would rather have a major that is more stats + cs rather than pure math + stats. Thats where UCR comes in. They have a Statistics major with a concentration in computational statistics which i feel would better prepare me for the data science field.

I'm transferring to a university as an AA degree transfer starting CS classes this summer.  I had my first meeting with my advisor and we worked out my schedule to have me graduate next fall (fall 2019), however, there are a few things I want to consider..

(1)  If I go about this schedule, I will have to take summer courses this and next summer and I am worried about not being able to get an internship then.

(2)  I'm worried about the sheer workload, I don't know what to expect taking 3-4 major courses + an elective each semester.  I do currently have about 9 months of experience in java/c# so I do have a little bit of extra programming background that will (hopefully) help.

(3)  If I decide maybe I should spread it out more, then I have the issue of my military GI bill expiring and I will then have to find other ways to pay my bills/tuition.  This is honestly my biggest concern and why I decided to go forward scheduling how I did.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated!

    I went to the Spring Engineering Career Fair last February and talked to one of the representative of Microsoft. He said intern for summer 2018 is full but he still took my resume anyway. And yesterday I just got this email from a Microsoft recruiter. It says

""....I’m writing now to request you to let me know if you are still looking for the right full time opportunity come August. If so, I would love to hear from you directly – you are eligible for recruitment by my team until one full year after graduation so you could absolutely re-apply. Likewise, if you end up going to grad school, you can let me know that as well and depending on your new grad date, we can have you apply for intern....""

I don't quite understand. In this situation, will I still need to go through the resume screening process or she will arrange an interview for me by the new recruiting season? I am concerned about this because according to my experience, I have never got any interviews by just applying online, I think my resume always went straight to the rubbish bin... So it would be great if I could skip the resume screening part.

Normally, in a career fair, after a few days they will tell you if you get an interview or not. But what happens in my situation typically?

Thanks!"

I have over a year of experience now combined from what I had before which was 7 months and now with the job I have over a year. I know that even at the official 1 year mark in June I will only have 1.7 years of experience but my heart is just not in this job. It’s actually turning into an unpaid internship, mostly because I really need the experience and this town has a bad job market. I used to get paid by government contract but that ran out months ago.

The guys I work with are great but I find myself very lonely on weekends because I live in a small area where most people are usually around the age of 40-60.  It’s mostly working in this small town and not having a lot of people close to my age is the issue which is 30 but 22-25 years is where “I am at” as they say. 

I believe we work so we can live. We work so we can enjoy ourselves and also obviously pay rent. But we don’t exist just to work. 

My parents just want me to have the best but this job just isn’t for me, again hate to be petty but it’s the town I live in that I really object to. It’s not my idea of where I want to be. I apply for big city work even in the same industry as I work in now because at least to me I get more from the big city version of my job because it pays for my ability to live in the bigger place.  

I feel stuck. I want to quit but my boss is a great person who took me on and would hate to shit on that. I don’t want to feel like I am being “just another entitled Millennial” who expects to job hop.  I want to work somewhere bigger because there’s more available there and I can make more friends my age or the age I feel. I am big into music and want to play in bands too, which big cities have more opportunities for.

Ended up only graduating a semester late (this past January), but started putting in applications around last September. However, I was having very little success, only getting past HR screens with companies that were doing on-campus recruiting at my school and not getting any interviews for companies I cold applied to through LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. So in what would have been my spring semester, I switched it up.

Since I was a recent grad, I was still able to go to all the networking events, career fairs, and meetups that the school hosted and I decided to fully focus on those. I went to one or two big ones during my last semester, but I didn't hunt for every single event big or small like I did the past 2 or 3 months. And, WOW, did it make a god damn difference. Suddenly, I was juggling multiple phone interviews and onsites like no other. And this is with no relevant software engineering internships, and a not great GPA (2.9). Finally got an offer from one of the onsites, with the onsites being of various difficulty (some had the leetcode style that this sub talks about everyday, some had nothing to do with it). I have to say none of these companies were big N or unicorns (although close in size) but in my situation, you couldn't be picky.

I know that if you go through many of the ""i can't get a job"" threads, many people already mention networking and going to career fairs. I just wanted to emphasize how much it helped me, and provide a real story with maybe a relevant background (no experience, low gpa) to give a real sense of how much it helps. So if you are struggling to get jobs from cold applying and you are still in school, GO TO YOUR CAREER FAIRS, INDUSTRY MEETUPS, NETWORKING EVENTS, ETC.!!!!!! If you are a recent grad within a year, I think most schools will let you still go to them, also.

Also, an addendum on NYC salary expectations. Please do not listen to anyone who says you need to have a 100k salary or live in poverty in NYC. First of all, this sub seems to live in a bubble in its salary expectations, maybe coming from not having any friends outside the CS world, or just plain never having set foot in NYC and just regurgitating what they heard here. There are thousands of non CS grads/non bankers that live in NYC that do not have an average salary anywhere CLOSE to the entry level salary of CS grads in NYC and they get by just fine, I know a few personally. Many places in downtown NYC, as well as Brooklyn, are very affordable. Any new grads trying to find jobs in NYC should keep that in mind."

Since it's hard to put the **$1.2 million** extra funding from PAC-SMH in context, here is my estimate of the Counselling Services department budget. If you know better numbers, please tell me. 

[2017 Ontario Sunshine list](https://www.sunshinelist.ca/) has 6 Counselling Services/Campus Wellness management staff

**Comments**

* total 2017 expected spend was about **$4.2 million** 
* the extra **$1.2m** in budget from PAC-SMH is about the same as what's paid to Counselling Services management of **$1m** including benefits
* almost half of this, or **$462,000** is for three manager' salaries plus benefits.
* Benefits can cost an employer between 25% and 40% of salary. I used 35% below in the ""Aggregate with Benefits"" column. That multiplies the straight salary by 135%.
* I urge UW to act transparently and release Counselling Services actual expenses paid for 2017, and its 2018 budget, and other amounts so we can all know how Mental Health money is spent
* Later I plan to estimate how many student hours each role sees in a year, to estimate what value we get by role.
* FTE = Full Time Equivalents

**Questions**

* Are we getting the best value?
* What is the current actual split of counsellors between social workers and psychologist staff?
* will the new **$1.2m** be prioritized to hire psychologists for the 4 lost in 2017?
* does such a small department need its own 50% of IT and web staff, or can it use UW IT and web services? 
* what is the cost/benefit/quality of care relationship for Residents and Interns, given their low cost?
* how much do managers contribute to our care?

It is with keen interest that I am submitting my application to Mr/Ms. ___ for this position at the ___ office located in ____ . I am an ambitious individual enrolled in my ___ year at ______ University and will graduate in May 2019 with an HBA ____ &amp; Accounting degree. This is an enticing opportunity that will allow me to utilize the knowledge and experience I have acquired through my undergrad and my 2 internships for the benefit of your organization. A brief synopsis of my qualifications and experience are as under:

**Accounting &amp; Technical Knowledge:** 

My internships as a Business Analyst at the ________ and _____ , along with my education, have developed my expertise and enhanced my knowledge of Canadian tax policies, financial reporting standards, investing, financial statements, and the financial planning process among much else. During my internships, I showcased my familiarity with Microsoft Excel and Access by successfully updating and maintaining the financial database for over 100 clients at the _____ and over 30,000 clients at _____ . During both internships I displayed my knack for customer interaction and built several strong customer relations, in large part due to the customer service skills that I cultivated during my time at fast food restaurant. 

Over the course of my studies, I have adeptly used numerous software such as STATA, Excel, PowerPoint, and Bloomberg for the analysis of various financial models. I have displayed my passion and aptitude for finance and accounting ever since high school. As part of a Business course in grade 12, I participated in _____ University's province-wide Stock Market Simulation. Each participant started with $100000 to invest. As result of numerous successful investments I ended with a portfolio value well over $4million, achieving 1st place all across Ontario and breaking the all-time Portfolio Value record ever set in the history of the competition. I received a letter of recognition for my outstanding performance and was offered a full-ride scholarship at _____ University's School of Business.

**Interpersonal Skills:** 

My interpersonal skills are strong and I am able to maintain my composure in stressful and sensitive situations. I understand client needs and always maintain positive relationships. I have developed and polished these skills through serving a wide array of customers/clients over the course of numerous, often very fast-paced, work environments, including at: _______ , _____ , _____ , and the _______ . Specifically, at fast food place I was routinely responsible for leading drive-thru service in one of the busiest locations in the city and ensuring customer satisfaction in a very fast paced work environment. At _______ , I routinely interacted with veterans suffering from various mental distresses and ensured they received the appropriate care and support every time. 

**Analytical/Problem Solving, Organizational and Team Work Skills:**

My education and work experiences have fostered my analytical thinking, reasoning, problem solving and decision making. At ____ , due to an outdated and unorganised directory, numerous tasks were far more time consuming than necessary. By my own initiative, I decided to work in collaboration with senior management and co-workers to update the directory. My technical proficiency and familiarity with Microsoft Excel and Access helped me develop a workbook that allowed everyone to work at a faster pace. I was appreciated for my initiative by both my coworkers and by management. 

In addition to my education and work experiences, I have a strong work ethic, passion for Accounting, and demonstrated analytical, research, interpersonal, and problem-solving skills. I am confident that these aforementioned skills, along with my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment will allow me to make a significant contribution to ___ this summer, and ideally, after graduation. 
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing this opportunity with the hiring panel.

Sincerely,

In U.S.. The internship would be to develop a software application for the company. I already work for this company in another subfield, am paid around minimum wage. This internship would be unpaid time, on a different topic, in which to work on an internship. However it would have the official ""intern"" title.

It is my ONLY offer. I will not get another that goes with my work and school schedule.

People are always saying that no internship on your rez is like the kiss of death. I have plenty of projects I can work on but was really planning for this internship to buff up my rez. (The only reason I am spelling this obnoxiously is due to the auto-filter) Am a sophomore btw.

I have been struggling with this for a few weeks now. I need that rez boost if I want to find a better job.

I know this question has probably been asked a million times but idk, I just need to talk to someone about this."
87zcnj,1,2018-03-29,GF has a job offer from a big and very well known company. Already has a job and unsure of what to do.,cesarmac,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/87zcnj/gf_has_a_job_offer_from_a_big_and_very_well_known/,"Hey guys I'm not exactly sure if this is the right sub to post this in. Anywho, so my and my GF are about to graduate college together and have luckily landed some form of employment with decent pay, while this is great for me it's actually AMAZING for her because she isn't a citizen and is currently here on a student visa getting a degree in engineering. She did amazing in school, so much so that after searching and applying at various companies more than a couple offered her positions within their engineering departments. 

Now here is the issue. One stipulation that she would bring up during the interview process was her need of sponsorship once she has officially graduated as she can only stay in the country for so long after graduating if no company sponsors her.  A few companies gave her ""verbal"" promises and she ended up accepting one of the offers and so is currently working as an intern with their intent to hire her full time once school is finished. This is a big company with a presence in many different countries and billions of dollars in revenue so she figured she has the best shot for sponsorship there. 

Fast forward to today. She receives a random call from another company... a big company, a very famous company, a company none of us even expected to call recent grads about job opportunities. This company tells her that they are looking for someone to take a one year contracted position out of state and are actively searching for grads with her degree (it's a specific type of engineering not taught to in within main stream fields like electrical or mechanical) and if she is interested to email her resume to them within the next 48 hours. This position could be extended beyond the year depending on how they feel she performs and so on and so forth. 

She's now torn. She would love to work for this company, hell I would love to work for this company but her biggest concern is the ""verbal"" promise of sponsorship from her current employer. She's done lots of research on weather employers trully come through with these promises and has only seen horrible stories of people working 2 years or so before being let go, being strung along with the promise of sponsorship the entire time. So she isn't sure if she should send in her resume and take an opportunity with this company (which would look great even if she wasn't kept on past that one year) or stick with what she currently has. Thoughts? 

Does anyone know of someone with work sponsorship or work visa? Any experience or insight would be helpful. "
8800o4,39,2018-03-29,"My company is ready to hire a Sr. Data Scientist, but we're not exactly sure what to look for in candidates.",cryptohan,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8800o4/my_company_is_ready_to_hire_a_sr_data_scientist/,"We are a digital assets / cryptocurrency research firm that have 3 divisions: algorithm trading, market research, and insights for institutions. Ideally, we would want someone with some experience in finance. The job listing (shortened) is the following:

&gt; Our servers are constantly collecting enormous amounts of cryptocurrency pricing and fundamental data. With the data that we collect, we are able to analyze exciting datasets that allow us to:
&gt; 
&gt; - Develop advanced in-house trading algorithms
&gt; - Publish cutting-edge research and industry insights
&gt; - Implement both new and traditional financial metrics to cryptoassets
&gt; 
&gt; We are pairing some of the industry’s most experienced traders with programming experts to present the world with unparalleled industry research. By implementing creative and unique research strategies, we will be able to dive and analyze patterns that other’s may have overlooked, providing our team with a strategic edge in predicting future market movements and creating unique, in-house valuation models for cryptoassets.

&gt; - Your main role is strategize and ""think outside the box"" to develop unique cryptoasset valuation models using live, historical, and projected future data
&gt; - You will be assisting our Data Science Intern in the projects that he is assigned
&gt; - You will be responsible for publishing ground-breaking insights and analytics that have never been done in the cryotoasset space.
&gt; - Your goal will be to become a leader not only in this company, but in the cryptoasset industry as a visionary for applying old and new metrics to cryptoassets
&gt; - You will lay out the groundwork for creating metrics and valuation models for cryptoassets for the inevitable time when the crypto market is no longer a speculative market.
&gt; - The aforementioned roles are very vague, because we need a candidate that will truly take initiative and decide how we can apply big data in a useful and insightful way to create valuable data for institutions and crypto-funds in this growing industry
&gt; 
&gt; **Does this excite you?**
&gt; 
&gt; I hope it does, because we are seeking experienced data scientists preferably with a strong background in finance that are ecstatic and enthusiastic about blockchain and cryptoassets as much as we are. The thought of publishing ground-breaking research and potentially being involved in the development of the future ""industry standard"" of a crypto-asset valuation model should be thrilling. If not, this job is not for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Salary:** will range from $85,000 to $140,000 DOE, and yearly bonuses are a possibility depending on the quality and impact of your work. We are currently a small funded start-up, so a possible promotion to an executive/director position with equity is not out of the question either.
&gt;
&gt; **Cover Letter**: 1) Explain what your current favorite project / cryptocurrency is and why; 2) What your favorite cryptoasset valuation model currently is and how you would improve it further (NVT, INET, VOLT, etc)?

Now for the questions:

1. Are the job responsibilities too vague?
2. What type of data scientists should we be looking for? Would hiring a PhD candidate make a huge difference? Or would candidates with less experience but more passion for the cryptoassets industry be a viable option?
3. Obviously, candidates would need to have experience with financial valuation models, but we also want them to be flexible in finding interesting bits of data, whether anomalies in valuations or correlations between price and other data that we're collecting (social media presence, number of followers, number of active developers and git commits), sentiment analysis, etc.). Is this too much to ask for? From my understanding, data scientists are often experienced in one or a couple of specialties (Statistician / Mathematician / Machine Learning Scientists / Actuarial Scientist). Please correct me if I'm wrong.
4. Are data scientists who we should be even looking for? If so, what type of experience should I be looking for in their resumes for the duties that are laid out in the job listing? 

Thanks in advance. Your inputs will be greatly appreciated. And feel free to PM me if you think you'd be a perfect fit for us and we can talk more (hope this isn't breaking any subreddit rules). 

P.S. There should be a hiring guide for companies (especially startups without a CDO yet) looking for Data Scientists ;)"
88019q,1,2018-03-29,Some questions about my resume,leaveAtTen,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/88019q/some_questions_about_my_resume/,"Hello,

I'm current a Sophmore studying computer science. I've applied for a few internships for this summer but got rejected from everywhere. I've since re-done my CV, and I'm hoping to get advice on what I could improve.

https://imgur.com/a/y8nK5

A few remarks and questions of my own:

1- (How) Should I write my predicted degree grade?

2- Should I write dates with full or abbreviated months like I did?

3- Is the second part of the ClearDesk description irrelevant or redundant given that the languages already appear in Skills?

4- The description for the internship experience seems very weak and easy to glance over without noticing much. Is that the case? How can I improve this?

5- For ClearDesk, we got the second to best grade. I'm not sure whether mentionning second is worst than not at all...

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“Nobody talks about entrepreneurship as survival, but that’s exactly what it is and what nurtures creative thinking.”  (Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop)  

&amp;nbsp;

I’ll walk you through the major business lessons that I think every entrepreneur needs to know to reach success. Ask me any questions along the way and I’ll do my best to answer them as honestly and insightfully as possible. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Before getting started, I’ll tell you a little bit about myself. Traveling has been a major part of my life for the past fifteen years. I have traveled to more than sixty countries and have lived in four, including the United States, Germany, Switzerland and South Korea. Over the past three years, I’ve traveled seven times around the world. To put in perspective, the past three years have brought me more than three quarters of the way from the Earth to the Moon!

&amp;nbsp;

My journey in the U.S. started nine years ago. I came from Germany as a medical intern to train in cardiology at Johns Hopkins, and eventually decided to stay and build my professional career here. Fast forward three years, I realized that clinical medicine was not my passion and it was time to branch out. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to change something, make people’s lives better, and have a larger impact than I could as a doctor seeing one patient at a time. Even though it took another few years to figure out how I would achieve this goal, I eventually came across entrepreneurship as the solution. Starting in 2012, I developed my ideas at the [Harvard Innovation Lab](https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/), bootstrapped until I was ready to join full-time, left my six-figure job as a consultant, and threw myself into the most insane life experience ever. 

&amp;nbsp;

Below you’ll find my progress as an entrepreneur over the past five years. I detail what each step looked like and, in addition, the pressing challenges that I needed to overcome at each stage. In speaking with hundreds of other entrepreneurs over the years, I found that these challenges are very common. I wrote them down because I believe they are key to consider when you develop your own startup.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Part 3 - Launching my first investment fund**


_______________________

**Part 1 - Building a global digital health company**

&amp;nbsp;

For the past 5+ years, my team and I built the first-of-its-kind global [digital concierge service](https://doctorinyourpocket.info/en/shopping/) called Doctor In Your Pocket. In short, it helps international travelers connect with a qualified and vetted medical doctor or dentist wherever they are on the globe, and at any time of the day. We have since launched our service in 180+ cities around the world. Below you’ll find some of the major business challenges and lessons that I’ve learned along the way. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Scale
Truth be told, and I’m sure most of you can relate or imagine this, I had no clue what I was doing when I started out with this company in late 2012. Although I had two “silent” co-founders, I ended up having to make all major decisions by myself. To start, I recognized the reality of scale: to assist American outbound travelers with trusted medical care around the globe, we needed a physical presence in (at minimum) the major tourist and business traveler destinations globally.

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you scale from 1 city to 180+ cities without draining your financial resources or having to rely on venture capital?
* How do you assure consistent quality of medical care as well as patient experience?
* How do you do all this in the fastest possible time?

&amp;nbsp;

#Sales 
One thing that medical school definitely never taught me was how to be an effective and convincing salesperson. As a result, I had to learn these skills the hard way. Back in 2013, I traveled to [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), [Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur), [Dubai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai) and [Abu Dhabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi), where I approached medical doctors in private practice, clinics, and hospitals to sign them up and onboard them to our service. Let me tell you, that it was the most humbling experience in my entire life. Despite my academic background, I wrestled daily with serious doubts concerning my ability to sell our product.  

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you get to overcome a series of NO’s? 
* How do you increase your conversion rate by selecting your leads?
* How do you cope with the emotional ups and downs of your daily sales efforts?

&amp;nbsp;

#Recruitment 
The success of your company, in terms of raising money, building a compelling product or service, and being competitive, is a direct result of finding the right founders and employees. I’ve had to learn a lot about the different strategies of interviewing people successfully. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you find the best talent for your company? 
* How do you convince the best talent to join your company when you can’t pay competitive salaries? 
* How do you overcome your own bias and objectivity in trusting likable people [(Halo effect)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect)? 

&amp;nbsp;

#Business Development 
In order for us to really scale the business from a revenue point of view, we had to build partnerships with global travel companies. Over time we successfully launched business partnerships with the likes of [HomeAway](https://www.homeaway.com/), [Hostelling International](https://www.hihostels.com/), and many more. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you identify the right person to speak with at large corporations? 
* How do you negotiate a contract that has meaningful key performance indicators to quickly grow your trial partnership? 
* How do you overcome the long sales cycles for corporate partnerships financially?

&amp;nbsp;

#Technology - (Web Development)
I’m a non-technical founder, making the early stages of the startup journey brutally difficult, especially since our core product is a technology-enabled service. As a result, it took many iterations and a lot of money to eventually build a sustainable team.

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you find a technical co-founder?
* How do you convince an A-player to join your company?
* How do you compensate for a lack of deep technical expertise as a non-technical co-founder?

&amp;nbsp;

#Fundraising 
Even though we never raised venture capital, there was still a need for angel and seed capital. This was especially important in the early stages before we generated revenue. As you can imagine, never having raised money before came with its own set of challenges. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do you identify serious investors? [(See blog post here)](https://medium.com/swlh/the-perfect-networking-equation-how-to-get-noticed-get-involved-and-get-your-foot-in-the-door-a1175120c59f)
* How do you communicate with investors after you’ve raised an investment?
* How do you distinguish between smart and dumb money? [(See blog post here)](https://medium.com/swlh/the-perfect-networking-equation-how-to-get-noticed-get-involved-and-get-your-foot-in-the-door-a1175120c59f)

&amp;nbsp;

I believe that the success of any company depends on the type of people, advisors, investors, and team members you meet along the way. I am very privileged to have met so many outstanding people throughout my still young entrepreneurial journey. Hence, I decided to give back to the global entrepreneurial community through my [Entrepreneurship Unplugged World Tour 2018](https://medium.com/swlh/world-tour-2018-ever-wondered-how-startups-differ-around-the-world-aca79c90a8d3) by visiting major startup hubs globally and offering workshops. See some of the most common questions that entrepreneurs come to me with below.

##*Challenges [(Read more here)](https://medium.com/@marcel.muenster/entrepreneurship-unplugged-7-things-to-master-in-order-to-kill-it-as-a-successful-startup-ee97f7852cac)*
* How do I pitch or tell the story for a company that has a vision but no product?
* How do I raise my first investment?
* How do I validate my product?

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 3 - Launching my first investment fund**

&amp;nbsp;

As part of my [Entrepreneurship Unplugged World Tour](https://medium.com/swlh/world-tour-2018-ever-wondered-how-startups-differ-around-the-world-aca79c90a8d3), I traveled to Dubai in early 2018 and mentored 34 companies in seven days. Every founder (and even the existing investment community) complained about the same obstacle: lack of early-stage funding. On my fourteen hour flight back to Boston, I couldn’t stop thinking about this problem. I know how critical and also how difficult the first funding can be in the life cycle of a promising company. As a result, I decided to take action and combat this problem head-on. I’m excited to announce that I have started working on a fund that will invest between **$10k to $50k** in **early-stage companies across multiple industries**. We’ll invest in companies in the Middle East as well as globally so long as they intend to do business in the region. 

&amp;nbsp;

##*Challenges*
* How do we find the best companies to invest in?
* How do we increase the chances of success of our funded companies?
* How do we convince our fund investors that we have the right recipe for an early stage fund? 

&amp;nbsp;

**PS:** Even though we haven’t launched the fund quite yet, please take this first public announcement as an invite to send me your deck or pitch your idea! Contact details are below. 

&amp;nbsp;

**PPS:** The fund is supposed to launch within the next three months (by June 2018).

8811cx,2,2018-03-29,Customer tried to trick me with a fake price tag,BrotherhoodOfThe5,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/8811cx/customer_tried_to_trick_me_with_a_fake_price_tag/,"I have an internship at a second hand store where I work the register when the store is open. I'm absolutely fine doing this now.

Occasionally people will rip off price tags or take price tags from other stuff to try to get a cheaper price. Usually it's on 1 item. It doesn't really bother me much. I either just let them have it at that price (possible price. If fake then the real price is very likely close so whatever) or I ask someone else for the price.

But a customer today did it with many items. Most were poetry close to the real price I think so I just let it go. Then a small carpet I actually said yeah this is not the correct price. He accepted the new price.

Then a big carpet. I work with carpets so when I saw the department number wasn't the number for carpets and that the price was a number I know I haven't put on any carpets this week I got mad.

I am normally very calm. Even if people are jerks. But a combination of the guy not being.. Assertive?(when I called him on the price for another item he was like oh ok"" and accepted the price I told him. Some customers will get mad like is this how you treat customers? Anyway a combination of that and the fact that carpets is the one thing I'm sure about so I wasn't afraid of calling him out and being wrong.

First of all even though peopled sometimes put the wrong department number on stuff I fucking never do. I always double check the week and department number before putting a price tag. Fucking always.

Second I know for a fucking fact I did not set that carpet at that price. I almost never remember what price I did set but I fucking know it wasn't that.

So even though I'm always calm I got mad. Though I didn't sound mad. At most slightly annoyed and kinda assertive.
""I work with carpets"" I said, really stressing the I. ""This is the wrong price"". Mother fucker.

I think this affected me like it did because it was multiple items, it was an item I was very familiar with and therefore more sure of myself, and I was unsure. Do I ask coworkers for help? Do I go to the back to help get a correct price for stuff? I guess I felt a bit flustered."
881c8r,2,2018-03-29,App development concerns,hiya19922,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/881c8r/app_development_concerns/,"Hello all, so i've undertaken an intership for a charity developing an app for them. I've had experience in developing web applications etc but with this app they want it to be cross-platformed and built using a framework (like phone gapp), i've never used a framework before but from what i've researched into it I could use a mixture of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP/node.js etc to build a cross-platformed app? Or will i will i have to use a more object orientated language like C# and iOS equivalent?

Furthermore, they have alot of crazy requests, i'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this. I've dealt with clients and bosses (on previous web dev internships) but their requests are normally pretty tamed. This company wants me to build an app, then hook it up to a well known health api and then also have the ability to transform raw data from the user to output charts to then also send that to health professionals and also potentially have a live chatroom set up so people can talk to one another and talk to a health professional.

The one issue that comes to my mind with this is security, i tried explaining this to them hoping they'd tone down their requests and highlight to them i have no experience in any of these issues but they want to go ahead and set up focus groups and that to discuss these ideas."

882g7j,12,2018-03-29,Waterloo (no co-op) vs Cal Poly SLO,1100H19,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/882g7j/waterloo_no_coop_vs_cal_poly_slo/,"Currently my top two choices are between Waterloo Computer Science without co-op and Cal Poly SLO Software Engineering. As a Canadian citizen, I would like some advice on choosing between the schools. My goal is to end up in California because that's where my family will be moving to (however, we started the green card process rather recently and I might be over 21 when they get it). I am willing to suffer a couple of years for my goal.

**Price:** Because Waterloo's CS tuition is crazy expensive for a Canadian school, Cal Poly will be only around 80k CAD or 60k USD more expensive overall (all four years included). While this isn't a small sum, I can still reasonably borrow this money from my parents without crippling debt. However, the price is definitely something to consider.

**Internships:** Unfortunately, I didn't get into Waterloo CS with co-op meaning that I won't have access to their big database of jobs. On the other hand, I can always find my own internships and just follow the co-op sequence (I have no idea how tough this will be though—from the students I've talked to, many did alright through applying outside of Waterloo's database). With Cal Poly, I'd have an F1 Visa which should give me authority to work in the US. Could that mean it will be easier to intern at companies that pay well and make up for the price difference?

**Student Life:** I haven't visited these schools yet (I will) but from what I've heard, Cal Poly wins hands down for both weather and things to do.

**Reputation and Networking:** From my research, Waterloo seems like a favourite of Silicon Valley employers but Cal Poly is right there in California.

Out of these factors, can anyone provide a professional experience since I'm just a high school student who has access to reddit. My other offers were UCSD data science, UCLA math of computation, Waterloo Math with co-op, u of t, and UBC. I'm not considering the UCs because they're 80k CAD a year and Waterloo is a better choice than other Canadian schools "

They're offering $44/hour with a $10k signing bonus and $5k annual bonus. I know it's lower than ""typical"" software engineering salaries in the bay area that account for the COL. 

I'm finishing school near LA and I've been interning at a medium-sized manufacturing company for a year (web-dev), which has promised to give me full time once I graduate, but they haven't actually given me a number yet (on average, it's typically $30-35/hr - they also give devs a budget to go to conferences each year). I can try to negotiate with my current internship with my offer and get them to match (not sure yet, though).

I'm pretty sure the ""higher"" salary would go straight to my rent, if anyone has experiences living near/commuting to Menlo Park I'd love to hear about it. I've seen posts on here about how expensive the bay area is from people making more than this offer, so I'm a little wary.

Then I got a call from one of the B4 offering me an internship this summer so I immediately prepared all my documents and applied for OPT (EAD). The problem is USCIS started processing my application on March 23rd. OPT processing time can take up to 90 days, and my international student adviser is currently telling me they will indeed take the full 90 days or even slightly longer right now.

Considering my internship start date is June 11th, the chances of my EAD coming out before that is slim to none. Most likely I will receive work authorization by late June, possibly early July.

I've talked with my recruiter and he said he will work with me on a one on one basis and it shouldn't be a problem, but didn't give any details of how it will play out.

Considering this is a 2 month internship program with scheduled training dates, etc. I'm afraid not starting on time or being 2-3 weeks late to start will disallow me to participate in this summer's program, which is absolutely crucial to my career (international students have A VERY difficult time landing positions). 

I mean at this time, there's nothing I can do but wait and hope everything works out (3 months of anxiety here I come). I'm just wondering if there is anyone from HR or a recruiter from this subreddit that could give me an idea of what is likely to happen. "

I'm interested in becoming a ""DevOps Engineer"" or ""Site Reliability Engineer"".

**About Me**

I'm a 28 year old male who lives within 45 miles of Los Angeles, with a bachelor's degree in computer science, and a master's degree in software engineering, along with 4.5 years of ""Internship"" experience (I had a paid federal job through the Pathways program while attending school) as a web developer, 6 months of IT experience and 1.5 years of experience as a ""Developer Support Analyst"".

* In school we focused mainly on C++ programming in a Linux Environment. 

* From my web development job I learned to build CRUD applications in PHP/HTML/CSS, as well write Java unit tests.

* From my IT job, I learned the basics of Microsoft system administration.

* From my ""Developer Support Analyst"" job, I learned how to troubleshoot and help other developers fix their applications in mostly C# and JavaScript. 

**What I've been Trying to Learn**

* AWS (through Udemy)

* Docker (on DigitalOcean VPS)

* Kubernetes

* Linux system administration

**My Dilemma**

I haven't been able to get anyone to respond to me when I apply for DevOps roles, even at the junior level. In fact, I have not been able to score an interview for any type of development opportunity. At first I thought my resume might be the problem, however, I had it reviewed by recruiters and through the resume subreddit. My fear is that people do not want to speak to me because of my current ""Developer Support Analyst"" title, which implies I do not do new development and am not an engineer. I am not sure how to make myself more marketable. 

**My Questions**

* Based on my current skills, how can I best orient myself to acquire a DevOps Engineer or SRE position?
* Would having an AWS certification open more doors for me?
* Is there any general advice or skill you guys can advise me to take up in order to land one of these roles?

**Thank You!**
I really appreciate all of your help, advice and guidance."

Right now I'm working as a business analyst for 3 years in a bank, and I really want to quit.

Here are some concerns I have:

Problem #1: I have no idea what I could do in gamedev since I’m not quite sure if business analysts are actually needed in this area. I know that several companies are looking for data analysts and I actually have masters degree in big data, but it was a while ago and I don’t quite remember anything except for general definitions and code languages’ names. Also I really can't lower my income and start as an intern. I'm open to learning new stuff tho.

Problem #2: I live in Russia and I doubt any employee outside of Russia would be interested in me if i’m not a developer lol. Meanwhile, Riot Games (my current dream) has 0 open vacancies in Russia. Do companies hire analysts from abroad if they don’t have resident permit?

Another option I’m looking for is working in tech support related area in gaming companies since I have some working experience as 2nd-3rd line support in the past. However, the same problems are relevant in this case (again).

Did anyone experience such transition?"

Not leaving California for transfer does make things easier, and good access for internships while in school. But I am concerned that where ever I graduate will limit first job opportunities to that region.

To clarify, I selected CMU's silicon valley campus when I applied, although in retrospect, I'm not sure if I made the best choice. Prices are roughly the same across all. Also, I'll be 20, so lifestyle is still important for me too.

Current thoughts:

CMU: Top school, but the SV campus is small (350 students), few facilities, campus life might seem quiet. Degree is same as standard CMU which is a top uni. I would have to learn to drive, cook, and make friends outside of university. All the students are grad students. Silicon valley companies are nearby and its common for students to get internships while doing school.

Cornell: Not as good as CMU, but still an Ivy. Could have a normal campus experience. Cornell Alumni connections strong.

USC: Very fun school, also great school, warm area.

Also, some of my friends told me that I shouldn't consider fun factor since grad school I'll be busy anyways. Thoughts?"

Out of interest, I have decided that I might want to go for graduate studies. This has inspired me to take the Mathematical Finance program with the hope of getting a Pure Math minor. I was doing this with the hope that I can also still give some time to focus for co-op.

The problem is:

1. I think my ambition here has made it very difficult for me to focus on co-op (and internships in general.) This probably means that I should drop out of co-op. Every now and then, I deeply fear that there is no reason for me to study in Waterloo if I am not in it for the co-op. I probably should have gone for a program - I am thinking of CS - that makes it easier for me to prepare for internships.

2. Despite my strong desire to do maths, I am not doing well at all. My first taste of the PMATH courses this term (and I am just taking 4 courses this term) did not go very well.

I feel like an idiot after all of this. Do any of you have ever experienced this kind of problem? Do anybody of you guys have any advice for me?

Edit: I guess I think didn't think this message through, either. I am going ask one more thing - do any of you have any experience with trying to get into academia from Waterloo in any of the maths program? Is it worth it when compared to co-op prospects? Should I have just spent my time on other universities?"
884fu8,3,2018-03-29,I need reasons to be alive.,i-am-nic,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/884fu8/i_need_reasons_to_be_alive/,"If you're one of the few to be reading this, thank you. I would give you a hug if I could. This is a post where I just ask you name a reason why you will live another day.

I'm 26, male, white and a foreigner. I've moved my life abroad to be with my wife, and after 4 years of trying to make it work, we're finally together after endless Whatsapp calls falling asleep on. 

I've been looking for work for 2 years and I've had 3 interviews for about 1000 applications. I have 3 degrees, two technical in humanitarian work, but I can't find a job. Anywhere. 

Obviously, I'm broke. I have no friends because I've been moving so often that even my old network has eroded. I've given everything to be with the woman I love that I left 'me' somewhere in history. I can't even afford to hangout with people on Meetup let alone pay for a transport ticket. 

I could serve coffee somewhere, or wash dishes in a kitchen for money for a living, but my whole life I've wanted to help people on an international level. I wanted to be a war correspondent to give a voice to the voiceless. Then I realised that journalists don't change the world, they just describe it (IMO, the most noble and necessary profession in the world right now). I then went to study conflict resolution and international policy. I just interned at the UN for 6 months in Geneva. Guess what? The world will always be fucked with war, famine and general disregard for the other. Being inside, they don't care, I could see. I could hear. I watched. They're all just fucking bureaucrats. 

And so my general care? I don't have any. Joy? I haven't been happy in two years, or since I graduated. 

Now my best beta to land a job are becoming fluent in a language I struggle with (I didn't know we'd get the visa the day before the deadline!), or learning programming languages like python or CSS, which is what I'm doing in my spare time. 

But what the fuck for? Only to be shunned because I'll be too old for being a programmer with no experience?  I'll likely be only fluent in two years before I can secure a ngo job. Even those that I qualify for, non-profit or private, how the fuck am I supposed to support myself if an entry-level job requires 3 years experience. WHY WONT YOU GIVE IT TO ME YOU DEPLORABLE FUCKS. 

So now what? I've wasted 8 years of my life travelling, studying, preparing myself to draft international policy to come to the end of a two year job searching period to not come close to an offer. 

My wife is the only thing in the world for me, and I know if I keep being this pathetic she'll leave me for some start-up jock. If I die, she's 25, she'll find another. She may never love again. She may kill herself in time afterwards. She may forget I existed by the time she turns 30. 

 I cannot afford to leave the flat. I'm a fucking deadweight. I'm lonely. I'm broke. I have no hope in international governance and the future security of our planet. I can't find jobs at call centres. Coffeeshops aren't even getting back to me. I can't land a job anywhere in the world where I yearned to help people. I don't have faith in people anymore. More so, i don't care anymore. I just don't. Countless fucking hours volunteering and unpaid internships for the world to say ""Fuck you"" to me. 

It's obvious I'm a useless piece of fucking shit and all I'm good for is cleaning the kitchen. If I die, the world will keep turning. My family will mourn, but will keep living their lives. My wife? The same.

My mom passed in January. She was my guardian. She wouldn't have been able to help me, but after a psilocybin journey I experienced last year, I realised that as her child, I am eternally with her. So this is where I want to be. Eternally with my creator in the infinite cosmos where the world can't hurt either of us again. 

So Reddit stranger? What are your reasons for being alive? What justifies your existence according to yourself?

I have none. My wife and family love me, but thats it. My family are in Africa, and my wife wants nothing to do with it. The world wants nothing from me, and me nothing from the world. Clearly I should just become ash and float into nature's cosmic order.

All I want to do is scream and hurt. This is constantly in my mind. I hate this fucking world. We're all just conscious soil so what the fuck is the point of continuing suffering if there is no need to suffer anymore? I could just end it. I could hop in front of a train, or jump off my building or cut my wrists when my wife is at work.

I believe it's the most noble thing for someone to kill themselves. There are too many people already. Humans as a species are grossly inhumane. We don't fucking care about anyone unless they're our family or friend. So why should you? What makes my life more significant than a child in Yemen, or a mother in DRC? I'm waiting...

I'll always be because it's not. I'm not the future, clearly the workplace has decided that. I'm not a parent, so I can't bring joy into the world. I can't offer anyone anything unless it's a hug. In other words, I don't belong here.

What is my reason to be alive?  I dont have one. 

My wife can move on. My family will die in 40 or so years. What is point of human consciousness? What have we got to be grateful for?

I don't know. I can think. I can move. I can be kind, courteous, willing, unselfish, and all the fucking sanctimonious adjectives you can think of, but the world doesn't give a flying fuck.

Unless you have a contact at an animal sanctuary where I can live my days, I don't see myself living out 2018.

I am a freshman (20) completing general education classes at community college (taking Chemistry and C++ this summer). I have not settled on where to transfer as I am still researching professors/faculty, universities, and miscellaneous details of this path. I know the top tech schools are out of reach so hopefully graduate school and a Ph.D could get me there to contribute. Therefore, I have some questions I did not find an answer for.

Some background:

My interests come from computer vision, graphics programming, and embedded devices. I enjoy facial/object detection [YOLO9000](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242), real-time operating systems/graphics/detection, machine learning for neural nets (CNNs) and digital image processing. I cannot stop thinking and looking up these concepts. Companies like Magic Leap with AR seems like something I'd like to do or the Face2Face research project. The new demo shrinking and enlarging objects fascinated me.

Questions:

With these, I am unsure if I should do a double major in CS/Math or Applied Math?

I'd like to contribute to research and possibly industry labs as I have had internships in the industry/college and did not enjoy it. It made me realize I'd like to do research on the exit interviews. I believe I'd like to go deeper and specialize in real-time detection or image/facial/object recognition. I now know I have to look for REUs, what can I do for contacting professors/companies? Read papers and conduct my own project this summer or contribute to open source? (I was thinking of picking up open source anyway for experience to be taken seriously) It would seem like a reach for a community college student to go for but I'd like to if feasible.

I am low-income but I would be interested in attending/volunteering CVPR. It would seem like a great experience and something to add to professors and college admissions. I even thought about starting an online club or something to keep talking about it since I cannot find a single person interested here.

My school does not have enough people interested in Linear Algebra (/r/graphicsprogramming and /u/csp256 bold this topic so I know it's crucial) to offer it, so I'd have to take it at a four-year. I am going to take trigonometry, calc I-III, diffeq, and physics...rigorous courses needed for transferring and the foundation.

I am unsure what else to do besides studying hard, reading papers, asking to be an RA, and continuing side/research projects. I'm reaching out to one of my professors to hopefully start a project or with a nearby university (we are big on robotics in this area apparently)

I hope this is a good place to ask this since I see this as my CS career more so than getting a degree and just getting a job (nothing wrong with that, I respect those who can because I can't). I'd like to focus on topic to be an expert and push it forward. I am sure this is something I want to do so I'd like to at least have some plan for school/experience.

If it helps, I've been working with openCV. Next up is tensorflow, Ng's courses, and setting up some ML since I do not have a lot of processing power (T460 Fedora distro, raspberry pi, and an old Windows 7 computer...which I may use for an image file server) to fill my free time. I was even thinking of doing basic graphics with Blender.

I started working at a lab in october of last year. I was so excited because I had been out of the science world for about two years (not by choice; I had worked for a pharmaceutical company that went under and I had to take the first job I could get, which was in tax management. ) After I accepted the position, my manager (the lab director) told me: ""If you get to a point where you are going to walk out, please do me a favor and just talk to me before you do so."" Of course, I knew this was odd but I didn't want to let it get to me. 

I had gotten a position in the mass spec department. The first week of the job ended up being pretty brutal. I was working with a coworker who had his Ph.d. He gave me a difficult time over everything that I did. Some examples: he told me I wasn't allowed to sit in the 'good chair.' When I was weighing acid on the scale, I was doing it too slow. He criticized me for taking notes and told me I was not to write anything down when he spoke. He also told me it was clear that I had absolutely no experience working in the medical field. This was completely untrue, as I had participated in paid internships in college and published research papers. In my interview, I was very clear about my prior experience and was upfront in admitting that I would need to learn the precise methods practiced in this particular lab. 
	When my manager asked me how everything was going, I told him that I did not believe that it was going well and I felt uncomfortable. When my manager spoke with my coworker, he immediately stated that I must be making everything up and that he refused to work with me. My manager told me that I should go back and just wait until things blew over. And so I did. But no one in the mass spec department would speak to me or even make eye contact with me. 

After this ordeal, my manager moved me to another department with a few twenty-something girls. Within a few months, these girls started spreading a few different rumors about me. 1.) I was sleeping with my boss (NOT true) 2.) I was doing school work during work hours (also NOT true) 3.) I was making more money than people who outranked me ( I don't know if this is true, but I never told anyone at the company how much I made). 

I spoke with my manager about the aforementioned rumors because I was really upset and because I didn't want any of the stupid office politics to impact my job. I was busting my butt, working 60 hour weeks...doing everything I good to be a good employee. 

So, the thing is, my bosses are not quite appropriate either...
About two months after I started, My manager asked me, point blank, if I had a specific mental disorder (I'd rather not say which one). And the truth is, I do.

I started working at a lab in october of last year. I was so excited because I had been out of the science world for about two years (not by choice; I had worked for a pharmaceutical company that went under and I had to take the first job I could get, which was in tax management. ) After I accepted the position, my manager (the lab director) told me: ""If you get to a point where you are going to walk out, please do me a favor and just talk to me before you do so."" Of course, I knew this was odd but I didn't want to let it get to me. 

I had gotten a position in the mass spec department. The first week of the job ended up being pretty brutal. I was working with a coworker who had his Ph.d. He gave me a difficult time over everything that I did. Some examples: he told me I wasn't allowed to sit in the 'good chair.' When I was weighing acid on the scale, I was doing it too slow. He criticized me for taking notes and told me I was not to write anything down when he spoke. He also told me it was clear that I had absolutely no experience working in the medical field. This was completely untrue, as I had participated in paid internships in college and published research papers. In my interview, I was very clear about my prior experience and was upfront in admitting that I would need to learn the precise methods practiced in this particular lab. 
	When my manager asked me how everything was going, I told him that I did not believe that it was going well and I felt uncomfortable. When my manager spoke with my coworker, he immediately stated that I must be making everything up and that he refused to work with me. My manager told me that I should go back and just wait until things blew over. And so I did. But no one in the mass spec department would speak to me or even make eye contact with me. 

After this ordeal, my manager moved me to another department with a few twenty-something girls. Within a few months, these girls started spreading a few different rumors about me. 1.) I was sleeping with my boss (NOT true) 2.) I was doing school work during work hours (also NOT true) 3.) I was making more money than people who outranked me ( I don't know if this is true, but I never told anyone at the company how much I made). 

I spoke with my manager about the aforementioned rumors because I was really upset and because I didn't want any of the stupid office politics to impact my job. I was busting my butt, working 60 hour weeks...doing everything I good to be a good employee. 

So, the thing is, my bosses are not quite appropriate either...
About two months after I started, My manager asked me, point blank, if I had a specific mental disorder (I'd rather not say which one). And the truth is, I do. I felt really awkward because I'm not typically open, especially about that, but I also felt obligated not to lie. So embarassingly, I admitted that I did.

I'd like to contribute to research and possibly industry labs as I have had internships in the industry/college and did not enjoy it. It made me realize I'd like to do research on the exit interviews. I believe I'd like to go deeper and specialize in real-time detection or image/facial/object recognition. I now know I have to look for REUs, what can I do for contacting professors/companies? Read papers and conduct my own project this summer or contribute to open source? (I was thinking of picking up open source anyway for experience to be taken seriously) It would seem like a reach for a community college student to go for but I'd like to if feasible.

I am low-income but I would be interested in attending/volunteering CVPR. It would seem like a great experience and something to add to professors and college admissions. I even thought about starting an online club or something to keep talking about it since I cannot find a single person interested here.

My school does not have enough people interested in Linear Algebra to offer it, so I'd have to take it at a four-year. I am going to take trigonometry, calc I-III, diffeq, and physics...rigorous courses needed for transferring and the foundation.

I am unsure what else to do besides studying hard, reading papers, asking to be an RA, and continuing side/research projects. I'm reaching out to one of my professors to hopefully start a project or with a nearby university (we are big on robotics in this area apparently)

I hope this is a good place to ask this since I see this as my CS career more so than getting a degree and just getting a job (nothing wrong with that, I respect those who can because I can't).

But that's not what colleges want. Now, I know I was probably accepted because Brown needed another poor Mexican, but then I thought, UCLA and Berkeley don't take race into account? So they must factor other things into their decisions, and I think those matter more. I posted this on College Confidential (i know) a bit ago, but I'll post it here, because I would've loved to see this. 

 I don't have a stellar SAT or GPA, so for that kid who’s lurking this thread, feeling intimidated by everyone’s stats.

Accepted: Berkeley as Regents Scholar (full ride) Yes I did get a LOR request. Letters and Science for Sociology. In-state. UCLA, Brown, UCSB, UCSC
Waitlisted: UCI, Oberlin, Wesleyan
Rejected: Amherst, Northwestern

SAT I (breakdown): 1370 superscore. 1350/1330. Math 690 English 680
ACT: Didn't take
SAT II: 660 Math II, US History 780
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 3.83, Weighted, 4.23

Yes, URM, Yes low income (like below the poverty line).

EC: Trevor Project Youth Ambassador Council (basically like an internship for a national LGBT non profit. It’s not meant for highschool students to fluff their application, its mostly a bunch of college students) 

I got into Trevor because I run a Youtube channel that has almost 100k subs on LGBT history and representation. Heavily edited and researched. Over 4 million views.

Musical Theatre Stuff - leads in school musicals, and I was a stage manager for one

Tenor Section Leader in school’s auditioned Vocal Ensemble, Secretary of Choir

Volunteer work at Democratic Party of Orange County. Some freelance work in videos, did some work with graduate students. Was a copywriter for my mom’s friend flyer distribution company. 


Awards: Questbridge College Prep Scholar and Finalist. Gates Semifinalist (this wasn’t on my app), PTSA District Winner for film, International Thespian Society, MACY Awards (Orange county high school theater awards not the store), California Scholarship Federation 

Essays: I don’t want to be a doofus, but I’m pretty damn good at writing, and I’m proud of it (conversely I suck at dancing). My teachers said they were some of the best essays they’ve ever read and this college counselor I have for low income students said they were pretty fantastic. I wrote a lot about being LGBT+, low income, race, my family. They weren’t sob stories. They were reflections, and some of them were funny. I wrote one on Taco Bell and how that fueled my love for sociology and race issues (I’m Mexican), another essay on how my mom steals toilet paper. It was all “risky” but it came out alright in the end. The essays are important. Anyone can get a good SAT but you really need to show you’re not just another robot.  

Advice you’ll hear all the time but actually listen to it: Don’t do stuff just to buffer your application. NHS doesn’t really look all that great. Building something you love does. I could’ve done NHS, or I could’ve done activism for the LGBT community through my videos and through the Trevor Project. Work your way around the system, not in it. Like, I'm not saying not doing NHS looks better than doing NHS. But doing something more meaningful is definitely better suited for your time. 

My other suggestion: DO QUESTBRIDGE (if you're low income). They have so many more essays and little questions that can help explain your situation. It's also cool because you can apply to multiple colleges for FREE. 

And also the biggest thing about this is: It's all luck. I think there's something to learn from my application. Yes, there's incredible power in ECs and essays, but also, it's mostly luck. It really depends on the school and what they're looking for that year. Some years they need more singers, some years they need more athletes. It's all a numbers game. If you get rejected, don't take it personally.

8870lu,2,2018-03-29,Returning To My Previous Internship For My Last?,zero2g,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8870lu/returning_to_my_previous_internship_for_my_last/,"Last summer I was given the opportunity to intern at an AI/hardware company for AI infrastructure. Currently I am interning at a ride sharing company but also under the AI infra team. This week, I attended my former company's convention and was able to see my previous team and manager. They are extremely glad to see me and are basicallly just asking ""When are you coming back?"".

I'll admit currently I am not happy with my current internship. My current manager had a 1:1 with me a few weeks ago to confirm that he will not be extending a return offer back to his team (But the hiring process is for the entire company) for the reason that he only wants senior level talent and he considers me to be too junior for his team. In all honesty, I also do not trust my current company's future, especially in their future for AI and deep learning and I defintely see their AI Infra as basically building to keep up rather than building to define.

This is where I am led to a hard decision with regards to where to go. For sure, I will not be returning back to my current company for a return internship this fall. I might give consideration if they extend a full time offer to me directly if they can find a fit for me on other team. My previous company though, I would really liek to believe that they want me back and there is an opportunity for me there for the same team I was on (I interned there twice in the past with outstanding reviews each time).

Currently, my decision is really going back to my old team at my former internship, or rather go out and explore for another company.

From the outside view, and especially with the culture of my school, it all basically says to go out and explore for another company but for me, here are the reasons that I rather not go out and explore and return back

* My previous company and team are full of industry leading talent, with my manager as the VP of AI Infra
* Most of the other companies I see that in a way operates at the same caliber only wants graduate students or I am not for certain I can make it, and it is very host matching dependent (FAIR, G brain, MS Research)
* Finding my last internship is exhausting, I rather have a more ""chill"" time in my senior year rather than spinning up to prepare for interviews and others
* I am hoping to convert into a full time offer after I finish this last internship, and hopefully I might start out as Eng2/IC2 rather than Eng1 because of my outstanding performance so far in my internships

Yet here are the other reasons where I should go out and explore

* I will not know what other opportunities that might exist out there
* It is my school culture to go out and explore other companies
* More possible and better salary negotiation if I have multiple offers
* I am not 100% sure that there is a return offer waiting for me... although I would like to believe that there is
* Basically I have given up on my oppotunity to work at a ""big 4/5/X"", but I say there is already enough prestige on my resume already with the teams and company names?

What do you think it's the best way for me to approach this? This fall is my last internship and basically that means I am going to aim for a full time offer. Should I return back to my previous employer or go back into the system?

TL;DR: Trying to commission back to active duty, but need a decent job in the interim, and a contingency plan if the commission doesn't pan out.

Backstory: I spent three years in the active duty Air Force as a medic, and transferred to the Reserves to finish my degree faster with the intention of commissioning back to active duty as an officer. The application process took longer than expected, and there is currently a 1.5-2 year waiting period between being selected as an officer candidate and being gainfully employed as an officer. I have also not even been selected yet, so I'm looking at probably 2020 before I'm back in as an officer. I will also be moving from the East coast of Central Florida, to Tampa before January 2019, as my wife will be attending school there. We can't move to Tampa until she finishes the classes she's taking over the summer (done in August).

I never liked being a medic, but I have always been interested in tech, so I decided to get my B.S. from Embry-Riddle with a major in Technical Management and a minor in Management of Information Systems. Unfortunately, I've realized this degree has left me woefully-unprepared for a career in tech, and most of my 9 years of work experience doesn't translate very well into the tech industry.

I was a manager at a fast food restaurant for about 4 years through high school and early college. Then I spent 3 years as a medic with the Air Force. Then I spent 2 years as a mechanic in the Reserves. The only tech job experience I have comes from working in my friend's computer repair shop for 3 months over a summer in high school. 

I've had coursework on network architecture, introductory programming, business analytics, data science, etc., but have not gained any practical experience in these fields. I've also dabbled in programming exercises from Lynda.com, but haven't done anything since last Fall. 

I feel like my resume mainly points towards lower-level managerial roles, and my degree caters directly to information systems in business management, but I'm struggling to find ANY jobs that are related that I'm even REMOTELY qualified for. Everywhere says Management Information Systems degrees are good for Database Admins, SysAdmins, Business Analysts, System Analysts, etc. However, every job posting for any of these roles requires years of experience in the tech industry, several additional tech certifications (A+, Network+, Security+, etc.), and other requirements that seem impossible to get without already having the job.

I've now applied for over 100 jobs, from manufacturing temp jobs, to sales, to business analyst and database admin and other tech roles, and I haven't gotten a single callback. I've even applied to and been rejected for a couple-dozen tech and non-tech internships in the area. I've got 9 years of work experience, over half of which is in the military, I'm graduating with a Bachelor's degree in May with a 4.0, and I can't even get an internship to work for free. 

Sorry for the long post, but I've been searching for jobs since last July, and I've only had one interview at a place that was owned by two veterans who just wanted to BS about the military. I'm starting to feel like I wasted all of my time and money getting this degree, and I feel like I'm going to be stuck waiting tables while I wait to commission in two years (if I get selected). 

I just need some advice. Do I abandon the search for tech jobs? Keep going to school for a Master's and use GI Bill for income? Change gears, and focus on programming? Should I even rely on commissioning as an officer?"

My preferred languages are Java and C#, and I also have experience with Jenkins. On a sidenote, I do have a second Bachelor's degree in Microbiology, with 2 years work experience associated. However, I would prefer to stick with the CS path. I am fluent in English but don't speak German or Dutch.

I've gone on exchange to Switzerland and largely enjoyed my time there. Ive also visited Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, and I'd like to go back to Europe for 2-5 years. That said, I do know it's extremely challenging for non-EUs to relocate to the EU for a junior level dev position due to visa sponsorship, competitiveness of the job market and lack of language skills.

A few options I'm considering: 
1) the jobseeker visa for Austria and/or searching for jobs while in Canada
2) finding something through the global talent program run by AIESEC. 
3) Working holiday visa and/or applying for the next cycle of Masters' programs.

I'm curious about people's experiences / thoughts about these strategies.
Does anyone have any experience with AIESEC global talent? The administrative fees are quite high, and I notice a lot of positions that don't restrict nationality use a type D visa. I'm not too clear on whether or not I am allowed to search for a longer-term position on that visa, and whether or not I will need to leave the country in between? 

Also, for getting documents legalized, do I have to visit the consulate/embassy of each of those respective countries? i.e. if I get my birth certificate legalized by the Austrian embassy, would the Netherlands accept that for their visa applications? 

For the working holiday visa, where can I find information about what types of employment are allowed? I've been having a hard time finding clear guidelines about this; for example, the Austrian Embassy of Ottawa states: 

""Participating Canadian citizens are allowed to have any job of their preference in Austria during a stay of up to twelve months. Exceptions only apply insofar as access restrictions to the job market or the field of education exist. Employers have to comply with the respective work’s pay and working conditions’ regulations, including social security.""

Does this mean that I can work a full time job (if I can find one!) as a junior developer there on a WHV or not?

I feel comfortable with most easys and can get maybe 20-30% of mediums, but am at this point hopeless with DP- thatll be a big focus for the summer.

Does anyone have any specific success story or plan that worked for them that I can base my planning on? How would you guys ramping it up and slowly getting better other than ""just grind questions""? That's the plan, but I'm looking to try something a little more focused.

Thanks for the input!"

I could do research under a professor at a highly ranked university (not the school I attend, and it's not an REU either), or I could do research with a big-4 company in a foreign country. I would working in my field of interest with both, and I do speak the native language of the foreign country. I feel like doing research at the university could be more helpful in terms of reference letters, networking, and course credit, but the research internship could be more structured, and spending the summer abroad would be an interesting experience. I feel like I would be pretty much equally happy at either one, and the difference in pay/ is not a major concern for me. As a current sophomore CS major interested in pursuing a PhD, which option would be better for me? Is one of them even a better option than the other? Thanks!"

If any of you have questions, don't hesitate to PM me or talk to me on the Discord server. :) I'm actually still waiting on Stanford, but that's unlikely anyway.


* * *


**Demographic**: Female from the Philippines

**Scores**: 33, 12W; 34, 12W (got the latter late -- sent both to almost all schools); 1380 SAT 24 Essay (LOL don't ask it was my first and I was nervous) 

**SAT II**: Didn't send any, only to MIT and Smith accidentally (low 700s in Physics and Math 2)

**Unweighted GPA**: 98/100

**Rank**: 1/~400 -- dropped to 9/~400 in midyear report (gap was like in the hundredths in our grades ok)

**Rigor**: My school *does not* offer AP classes, IB, or anything like that. This was one of my biggest weak points throughout the process--and our curriculum doesn't go that far either, so took regular Calc in senior year.



* * *



**Honors &amp; Awards**: 

* National excellence in science and technology award
* Several international, national, and regional robotics awards and engagements (FIRST, Asian competitions, Philippine Robotics competitions, events that I've spoken at, etc.)
* Several startup awards: Gold/silver at international competitions, gold at a startup challenge, published paper
* Valedictorian and consistent Top 10 Student
* Writing and activism (I clumped this together): Bill writer at national model congress, several pieces of published poetry
* Microsoft Imagine Cup National Winner -- sent in March update
* International education leadership awards -- sent in March update

* * *

**Extracurriculars**:

A lot of these were further elaborated and quantified in additional information. I used up nearly all 650 words of the additional info box, and still left out a good bunch of info, lol.

* **Founder and CEO of a national tech nonprofit**: over 250 members, reach of 15k, tons of events, members who've won international competitions under our training. We create CS materials, host workshops and events, host mentorship programs, and aim to make CS and technology education more equitable and accessible; most time-consuming activity, put like 16hrs/week. In my midyear update, we joined a huge conference and I had spoken at it, which likely helped a lot.
* **Robotics**: School robotics team head and member of national robotics team. Involved in delegations to competitions, organize camps, workshops, and regional to national competitions, and speak at competitions. Been doing this since early middle school!
* **Creative writing (*published &amp; self-published*)**: EIC of an online literary publication, art director of another pub, regular writer at a certain poetry pub. Have published poetry and nonfic pieces, a chapbook, and a novel in progress.
* **Startup Co-founder and developer**: UI/UX, development, an executive work. Pitch and consult investors, won international startup/tech awards, received funding under national donor, trained under an incubator, presented to presidential office
* **Technology internships**: In the summer, for a few companies
* **Student council**: Do multimedia and development work for the student body and school, organize several events
* **Activism**: Member of several activist groups, run an online media outlet for political news and facts, write editorials and op-eds.
* **Music**: Member and head of an indigenous music group, assist in practices and organize 2 annual concerts, perform in cultural events nationally. Quit senior year, done from the start of high school though.
* **Graphic design**: Freelance and do volunteer graphic design and web development work for several large events and groups around the country and internationally.
* **Worldbuilding (lol)**: Create wikis, websites, and write stories for my fantasy universe. :) Culmination of constructed language, my love of cartography, and a bunch of other weird things haha.

* * *

**Essays**: I'm a creative writer, so these were probably above average! My CA emphasized my perspective and cultural environment, intertwining it with my interests. I emphasized on my passion for technology and education throughout all of my applications. *If you want to read my essays, PM me!*

**Recommendations**: Counselor basically validated all my activities, had one from my research teacher and one from my English teacher (idek what was in them), and another recommendation when possible from my robotics coach. I did not submit a peer rec to Dartmouth.

**Major**: Computer Science or Science, Technology, Society (or anything like that) when available. English for Harvard and UChicago (idk why), CMS for MIT.

**Aid**: I can contribute about 20k!

* * *


**Schools**:

I applied to 21 schools in the process, a mix of ""safeties"", matches, and reaches. My criteria was purely based on fit, amount of financial aid that they give, and uh I honestly regret a lot on my list and would have changed a lot but oh well! All were RD!

This year I only applied to the few names that I know (Facebook, Google, Palantir, Bloomberg, Apple) but feel as if I'm missing out on a lot of opportunities because of my lack of an overview of all available internships.

The goal of this post to minimize the chance of losing out on a better internship (than the chosen one) because of not knowing about the better option.

I'm interested in internships at companies that will cover costs of (and help me with) relocating. They don't strictly have to be in Europe, I just want an internship without having to spend too much time on visas which is why I prefer staying in Europe.

What would your approach to finding such internships be?

What companies should I know about (do you know of any list of great companies offering such internships in Europe)?

Where should I look in order to get an overview of available options (I did search but couldn't find any useful overview)?"

Right now I'm working as a business analyst for 3 years in a bank, and I really want to quit.

Here are some concerns I have:

Problem #1: I have no idea what I could do in gamedev since I’m not quite sure if business analysts are actually needed in this area. I know that several companies are looking for data analysts and I actually have masters degree in big data, but it was a while ago and I don’t quite remember anything except for general definitions and code languages’ names. Also I really can't lower my income and start as an intern. I'm open to learning new stuff tho.

Problem #2: I live in Russia and I doubt any employee outside of Russia would be interested in me if i’m not a developer lol. Meanwhile, Riot Games (my current dream) has 0 open vacancies in Russia. Do companies hire analysts from abroad if they don’t have resident permit?

Another option I’m looking for is working in tech support related area in gaming companies since I have some working experience as 2nd-3rd line support in the past. However, the same problems are relevant in this case (again).

Did anyone experience such transition?"

I've been having a tough time lately and I can't see my life improving. I recently moved to NYC without any friends, and I'm totally alone here. I also didn't have any help moving, and coming from a small town without any experience driving in a city, it was terrifying having to haul all my stuff over with crazy city drivers. The first night, I ended up getting 2 parking tickets that I basically cannot afford to pay for because I'm balancing an unpaid internship with a part-time job that only pays $13 an hour. It just seems like one bad thing is happening after another, and I don't know how to make it stop. I'm only 20 years old and I understand that all these things are a natural part of adulting, but I'm very pessimistic and I don't know what I can do to be more happy. In addition, my parents are going through a whole list of issues with their relationship, and have relied on me since I was 11-12 years old. It's finally starting to catch up to me and stress me out, especially because I'm many hours away from home now. 

My anxiety has skyrocketed this year from everything that's happening, and is causing really bad insomnia which doesn't help. What can I do to be more optimistic at this point?"

Currently planning to go either the MS  -&gt; software engineering  or PhD -&gt; fintech route (leaning towards this). Live in the Northeast so I'd have to fly out to any one of them although Austin is a bit further. 

Here's what Im looking for: 

-	Cost: not rlly a issue since parents are covering it, although it may be good to save for grad school. 
-	Academics: I’d definitely like to take a wide variety of courses and be able to specialize. 
-	Social life: a healthy party scene without being too frat-dominated
-	Summer plans: an internship back in NYC since I can commute there daily. 

Here’s what I’ve gathered so far: 

UTA Turing: 

-	smaller class sizes 
-	easier to stand out to companies for internships 
-	honors itself doesn’t mean much bc many ppl drop out before thesis 
-	amazing tech scene 
-	lit social scene 
-	~$50k / yr

UMich LSA: 

-	extensive specialization w/ upper level tracks
-	most prestigious of the 3 so may help on wall street 
-	good alumni network 
-	easiest to double major in math 
-	lit social scene 
-	~$62k / yr

GaTech: 

-	extensive specialization w/ threads 
-	rigorous courseload 
-	meh social scene 
-	~$51k / yr

Right now I’m leaning towards UMich because it seems to be the best mix of everything although it is a bit more expensive. Does the difference in quality of life outweigh the cost? Would I be an idiot for picking it over the Turing Program at UT? Does undergraduate prestige mean anything when going into fintech? Thanks in advance, any input would be appreciated."

Now, without going too much into it, I've basically been depressed and have constantly thought about suicide over the past two years and have not been functioning properly (I stopped attending lectures pretty much after my first month in university and have had virtually no work ethic). As such, the only coding experience I have is what I've done for labs and I have never had any internships (I didn't even seek any out). 

I'm starting to get better, but am becoming worried about internships. My school offers a ""professional experience year"" for students after their third year (i.e. after my next year of school). So, currently, I'd be lucky to even get one, let alone a half decent one. So, I need advice on formulating a plan that will allow me to get the best possible internship under the circumstances. My GPA is currently 3.63 (could go up or down this semester), but I can certainly get it up third year (I think I have 4.0 potential). However, I know that grades don't matter that much in tech, so what else can I do this upcoming year?"
88d75l,3,2018-03-30,Considering dropping out. Is this a terrible idea?,bossycat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/88d75l/considering_dropping_out_is_this_a_terrible_idea/,"First some context:


I'm a junior in computer science at a upper-mid tier school, but my grades have been dropping and will be removed from the major next semester. My issue with school has less to do with the course content, but more with anxiety and other personal issues. I am confident in my ability to perform in the real world as I've had a successful co-op last year at a well known bay area company and am in the process of choosing my internship for this summer. Note that I DO want to eventually finish school, just maybe after a break or some maturing.

&amp;nbsp;

I know that in almost any case, if given the opportunity to obtain a degree, it's the best course of action. However, if that degree is not in computer science I'm not sure it is worth it. My counselor says the closest major I can switch to is Geographic Information Systems and I'll need to tack on 2 years to finish that degree. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some other things for consideration are that my scholarship ends with my removal from the program and I will have to start taking out loans (right now I have 0 debt and really don't want to rely on my parents). My work experience is in front end web development and I'm aiming for a full-stack position this summer so it may be relatively easy for me to find a job compared to other specialties. Also, from what I understand, even if I return to school after dropping out, I still won't be able to get into the CS major unless they change the requirements and if I switch schools I'll most likely have to start from scratch. 

&amp;nbsp;

So my two options are:

1) become a GIS major and then work after I graduate:  

Pros:  
- degree (in 2 years)  
- higher chance of landing a job  

Cons:  
- not cs degree  
- still may not graduate  
- debt   

2) Drop out and return to school in the future:

Pros:  
- break from school  
- get to start my career  

Cons:   
- may not be able to find a job  
- lower salary?  
- still probably can't have degree in cs  
- may have to start degree from scratch  

&amp;nbsp;

Even after listing out the pros and cons I don't have any clue which is the better choice. Part of me is leaning towards dropping out just to escape school, but my gut tells me I shouldn't make a decision on that. Does anyone have any advice to share?

I've cleaned my room in this apartment as best as possible every week since I came here two years ago, especially the bathroom.

Advantages: 
* You get your own bathroom/shower (kept it fresh as new)
* Warm shower with plenty of water
* Internet included (Ethernet cable, can set up WiFi if you wish) * All utilities included with rent
* Very reasonable rent amount
* Pool, gym, laundry, etc
* I have been spending $600-$700/month for two years on this apartment and groceries. That's what my monthly cost of living has been so far.
* Can write your room-mate preferences on a preference sheet and pick people that match your type (I picked quiet and studious. One of my roommates has become my bestfriend now)
* Every time I placed a call for fixing something that was broken, they did it within hours or the next day.
* Very cheap deposit 

Disadvantages:
* Up to three other roommates
* People above you may hop around and make noise once in a while
* No pets allowed
* The laundry is not in your unit, but in a common area

Here are my choices, also I am majoring in Computer Engineering.

UMich - $65k/yr

UW-Madison - $56k/yr

Purdue - $46k/yr

Stevens Ins of Tech - $51k/yr

Rutgers Honors - $21k/yr


I am from NJ, so Rutgers and Stevens are both in state for me. Also for Rutgers, I got into their honors program/college they have.

Obviously cost is a major concern for me which knock UMich (my dream school) and UW-Madison off the list. It sucks knowing that I got in to my dream school, but can't go because of the costs.


For Purdue and Stevens, they are a bit cheaper, but I'll still have to pay off loans.

UMich, UW-Mad, and Purdue are ranked extremely high for engineering. Stevens is a pretty good school, close to NYC, tons of internships, Co-OP is good. 

Rutgers is the cheapest, closest to home, but also the least known, least starting salary, and overall just an okay college compared to the others.


Any tips on what I should do?

Recommendations from APUSH &amp; AP English teachers were honestly prob both 10/10, adored both teachers &amp; they very clearly understood my passion, intellectual curiosity and belief in social justice. I'd like to think this was a strong point for my app. 

Essays were mostly about different aspects of writing/themes I find intriguing and embracing vulnerability through being bad at art!

Intended Major: I mostly put down English on the app (with History/International Relations/Sociology/etc as secondary interests) 
State (if domestic applicant): NY
Country (if international applicant):
School Type: Public (I was the only person accepted into Yale, Brown and Penn this year. I was the second admit ever to Yale, and maybe to Brown as well. We also had our first admit to Harvard yesterday &amp; a handful of acceptances from Cornell)
Ethnicity: White
Gender: Female
Income Bracket: Middle class
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): White Jewish girl from NYC lol nooo hooks

Reflection
Strengths: Obviously really deep creative writing spike (international ECs + national awards), GPA, ACT, AP scores, probably essays/teacher recommendations
Weaknesses: No hooks at all (my demographic is a dime a dozen), and little things (math/sci curriculum could’ve been harder -- no AP lab science/AP Calc BC; SAT II Math 2 was a little low)


General Comments: I did what I loved to the highest degree. It took getting my acceptances to be able to look back at my four years of hard work and realize that I was more competitive than I let myself believe I was.

88em1r,1,2018-03-30,REU vs Internship,philipjames11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/88em1r/reu_vs_internship/,"Hello!

Right now I am in a very interesting spot. I've recently been accepted to both an internship at Amazon, as well as to an REU. I've been very lucky to get both, but now I must choose. 

The goal is to ultimately go into a machine learning research type position, which will most likely require a PhD which in turn requires a master's. 

I know that REUs look good for grad school applications, but turning down Amazon is a very difficult dilemma due to the prestige it brings to the table. This makes it difficult to decide if an internship at a great company is better or worse than an REU, in the context of getting into grad school. 

Could anyone offer some input?"

*Analysis:*

Not sure if we're supposed to do one of these sections but I might as well try to figure out what went wrong. From the fact that I got deferred/waitlisted/accepted to certain schools I feel pretty confident that my LoRs were good and that my interviews went well. I'm pretty sure my stats/ECs are well above the minimum expectations of any of these schools. I think the only logical answers is that my essays are what screwed me and it doesn't really surprise me much. I guess what it comes down to is not knowing myself. For example, taking a look at Stanford's ""5 words to describe you"" question, I feel like that was one of the weakest things out of all my applications. As unhappy as I am with that answer, it took me weeks to come up with something I was happy submitting. The hardest part of all this for me was putting down who I am in words, and I guess the cause of that was that I wasn't really sure who I was. If you ask me why I stick out from any other CS applicant, that's a really tough question. If you ask me to answer without referencing CS at all it's very near impossible. I was happy with and confident in many of my essays, but I guess that wasn't enough to make me stand out from the 50 bajillion CS applicants. Or maybe there was some other red flag somewhere, but I find that unlikely. Whatever."

I was rejected from the first five, waitlisted from UVA, put in my second major for VT, and accepted into penn state, but it is too expensive.

My only options that I’d like are to get off the waitlist at UVA and go there, and/or appeal my decision at VT and try to get into my first choice major, engineering. However, if none of those work, im stuck at VT and have to start in a major im not interested in, and i dont even like VT a ton to begin with.

So if nothing works out, I wanted to take a gap year - maybe do volunteer work in africa, do an engineering internship overseas, train for a triathlon, the list goes on and i have so many ideas. I actually got so excited that I started to think itd be okay if i took a gap year, id have a second chance to apply to colleges as well.

Today, i tried to talk to my dad about it, and he just gives a straight up no, because he did it and regretted it, 30 years ago. I cant just not listen to him because hes paying for my tuition thankfully, but he just cant seem to agree with me at all. He tells me to trust my gut but at the same time wont let me choose a path? I dont want to go to VT for 5+ years because i need to switch my major and waste more money than we need to, and i dont even like the school that much :/

I don't really remember what I was thinking. Maybe I wanted to rip the band-aid off at once. Maybe I just love getting emotionally crushed. Either way, I sit here with 4 rejections and 2 waitlists that hit me in 3 minutes. I know because I filmed it.

However, I can't bring myself to care that much. Yes, it hurts. It sucks to know I won't be in sunny Palo Alto or experiencing the residential colleges at Yale or Rice. Instead, I'll almost certainly be staying up north at UW Madison, living with ice and snow and everything else I wanted to get away from.

But I look at all those months spent worrying and stressing and I think about how little they matter. We spend so little time applying to these schools. We wait until the last second to write our essays, and it's impossible to give every school the same level of detailed attention, but we put so much stock into what college we're going to.

It's impossible to put into words all the emotions I feel. Colleges don't know how hard it is for me to go to sleep after seeing everybody else out with friends. Colleges don't see how much work I put into to studying for that final. Colleges don't know how hard I fought to direct that play. College don't know the sacrifices I made.

All these colleges are getting is an airbrushed snapshot of our lives.

I would much rather be a great friend, son, and person than look good on paper.

If I had to point out one aspect of my application that caused my rejection, I'd say it was my lack of research. I didn't do robotics, or olympiad, or internships, or ISEF, or Regeneron, or anything. Instead I joined theatre and show choir.

I don't regret the choices I made. I found acceptance in the fine arts. When I look back at high school, I'm not going to think of math or coding or what I could've done. I'm going to remember 2am post-comp trips to Perkins, the hell that is tech week, and crying after making finals and finishing with the best performance of my life.

This past week, I've been preparing to cope. I lied to myself. It doesn't matter which school I go to. It doesn't matter that my parents and friends believed in me. It doesn't matter.

I think that over time, I came to believe myself. I don't want to prove colleges wrong. I want to prove myself right. I know that I did everything I could, and I wouldn't change a minute of it if I could. 

I'm going to go to UW Madison, and instead of wasting more than a single second feeling sorry for myself, I am going to live. I'm going to find a running partner and explore the city. I'm going to spend a fall afternoon in my hammock by the lake. I'm going to become friends with my roommate. I'm going to go into the honors program, make connection, and graduate in 3 years. I'm going to find a friend group, find someone I'd like to date, and show why people say college was the best time of their lives.

Maybe I wasn't cut out for an Ivy league, but it no longer matters. All I have to do is show why my path is the perfect one for me. I know that in 3 years, I'll look back and be grateful for what I have: an acceptance to a top, cheap public school, the same knowledge everyone else does, and no delusions of grandeur.

I hope to see some of you in grad school, where I can prove that I'm just as good.

And if you're planning on attending Madison, I can't wait to meet you! (Badgers are Hufflepuff, Hufflepuff is best house, red is the most attractive color, enough said)

Thank you for all the posts helping me to believe in myself, because eventually, I did."

I'm interested in things labwork related (like chem/bio) or programming related things, but the thing is, I have pretty little experience. I've gotten an A+ in bio and chem, but I'm not taking the AP courses for those two, and computer science, until next year (because of how I chose my classes). All my friends who have internships, either for law firms, politicians (representatives or senators, or labwork, either have connections, have had the school help them get into labs (like there's a program for that that's hard to get into that I didn't), or have self-experience (for example, they're in robotics, or maybe on model UN, etc.) I have no experience, and I'm self-teaching myself Java comp sci right now, although based on my schools curriculum, Bio and Chem are basically SAT-level classes in that they're considerably rigorous.


I know people will say to ""apply for everything you can,"" but I honestly don't think I can find any internships before this Summer because my lack of experience. **How do you find internships as an HS student without experience/connections?** I mean, my friends say it's easy because you're literally free labor for whomever you're interning for, but they have more extracurriculars related to that internship, and therefore, more experience.


Also, it's so hard to create a resume when you've done pretty little  (due to a few personal issues I'd rather not get into) during sophomore and freshman year, and now that I'm a junior I'm only starting to get into these things.


It doesn't help that it's already basically April and it's late, and my family probably won't be able to pay for an internship.


EDIT: All my friends who have internships have parents who work in a college/hospital/lab, spend several hours a week on an extracurricular, have extensive awards in a certain skill/talent, or have skipped multiple grades because of long-term interest in a topic (one of my friends skipped three years in math through self-studying, or as he calls it, ""studying the curriculum in three days because it's easy,"" and is going to teach in a college next year), and some who even got into that program I mentioned that helps you find labs, can't find labs. I'm seriously getting demoralized right now because I'm so incompetent compared to everyone else.


EDIT2: Also can you apply for internships for people who don't even request for one? Like some people said they just emailed professors or lab workers, so is that just like, searching up a hospital or lab and then emailing a certain researcher/lab worker there about stuff?"

**PREFERENCES:**

I’m hoping to major in Chemical Engineering or Chemistry &amp; possibly minor in English. 
I have a *slight* preference for colleges in California, though I'm open to any locations.

1) Band 

- Percussion section leader for school wind ensemble, member of band council, made the All-State honor band, co-founded the school’s first indoor winter percussion ensemble 

2) Red Cross 

- Co-president of school club, International Services committee member for the regional chapter, attended RC leadership camp last summer

3) Other stuff

- Ran two years of JV track &amp; field 
- Self-studying biology courses on edX and organic chemistry 
- Hobbies include practicing web design and writing poetry 
- Planning on attending a STEM program OR a research internship this summer

I transferred to Gatech on Spring 2017 and then I did so bad in my first semester because I went through financial issues which made me so depressed and not focused in my classes, Gatech dropped out my classes due to the nonpayment which was a trama for me. I went to bursar office to tell them I would try my best to get the money. After a month from the dropping out, I brought the classes back and It was already the beginning of April which I felt I lost all the hope to Pass even one class. I ended up with 2 F, 1 D and a B. My GPA became 1.00 which gave me literally a heart attack. I tried to register for the summer semester, but I could not because I could not afford that much money that they were asking for because obviously, I am paying out-of-state. Finally, the fall semester began and I could not pay the whole amount on time so the bursar office dropped my classes again. I told them to give me some extra time they did not accept. Anyway, they told me you need to come back next semester (spring 2018) to take classes again, but first you need to readmitted for GA-tech since you were away from Gatech for 2 consecutive terms ( summer and Fall), so I did the application and they did not accept me either for the spring semester because of my GPA was terrible of the one semester that I have attended. So, I took a spring semester off and I started an internship at a company. 
So, my question is what should I do to come back to Gatech, I only attended one semester and I feel it is not fair at all. 


The first and the only semester that I have attended was bad and I am not the only one who does badly in his or her first semester at gatech so I don't really know why they are not taking this as a consideration

I’m applying for internships and it makes me so insecure because I compare myself to others a lot. I go to a top university and have amazing friends that I love there, but going there makes me feel incompetent.

I worry that with a low gpa I will not be accepted into grad school and that I will have to go into the work force with a degree that I worry isn’t highly employable (political science). I just want to do better.

In addition, I have been home for break this past week and have been consumed with depressive moods mostly due to the friends I have here. Before I moved to college I didn’t realize that my friends at home treat me like garbage and walk all over me. They stomp all over my self esteem and take advantage of me. Being treated so poorly and being back in general fills me with anxiety and I feel completely lost and alone. I would love and appreciate any advice about how to deal with these feelings. They consume me when I come back home, and I want coming home to be relaxing and therapeutic. Especially coupled with worrying about getting a summer internship and my academic performance going forward, I have been thoroughly stressed out.

A few details:
1. I plan on majoring in sociology
2. I have been offered a 25k merit scholarship to ND and an invitation to apply to their honors program
3. Money is, fortunately, not an issue

Things that factor into my decision and what I've noticed:
1. College experience
I've heard that a lot of UC Berkeley students are depressed. On the other hand, I've seen that Notre Dame alumni give back a lot of money to the school, indicating a strong undergraduate experience.
2. Brand name:
I plan on moving back to my home country after graduation. I believe UCB is better known there.
3. Class sizes:
I'd prefer smaller classes, and while I notice at Berkeley there are quite a few small discussion-based classes for freshmen and sophmores, they are worth very few credits.
4. Scholarship:
At ND, I've been offered not only a merit scholarship, but also an acceptance to a program that includes faculty mentorship and a fully-funded summer research or internship of my choice.

I would like to make sure that my observations are correct, just to make sure I don't regret making an uniformed my decision. Is there anything else that you believe is crucial in making this decision, and what are your thoughts?

I'm currently a mechanical engineering student about to start my junior year. I have done a few internships over the past year and have really been becoming more interesting in computer/electrical things. I was dabbling if I should switch to ECE, but in the end I decided I liked mechanical more and could not see coding as a full time thing for me. I want to get into an area like maybe autonomous Driving, some kind of machine learning, aerospace, or automated manufacturing (i have interned at 2 semiconductor companies). Without rambling on any longer, do you think a computer engineering minor would help me accomplish these goals? I will link the minor curriculum below. I would probably take my electives in computer design and microprocessors. Other classes cover digital logic/circuit design, some programming, and computer organization. Money wise, it might put me back a semester in school, but it's something I'm very interested in. I enjoy learning how computers store information and stuff like that.

Thank you!
Curriculum http://www.ece.umd.edu/undergrad/ce-minor

Edit: tldr: I think a better question would be: do you think this minor will impact my employability or range of jobs I would be qualified for?"

What type? No idea. Maybe computer, maybe mechanical. I didn't know. Back then, all I really cared about was getting home to play video games or whatever, and due to my laziness  I got my only B in 3-D Art (89.4).

I joined Robotics Club, and that was my only freshman EC. Oh, and I wrote fiction, and had my English teacher proofread it. I was also in the piano class. Was that an EC? I don't know.

Sophomore year, I decided to run cross country, and it was pretty great. I wasn't in any other clubs, so I could always go to every practice (they were directly after school). I also ran track, which I disliked. Around the middle of that year I decided I wanted to be a doctor. What kind? I didn't know. Oh, and I kept writing fiction, and I also took piano again.

This year has been different. I did cross country again, but now I'm ramping up the ECs - I co-founded a public speaking/debate club with my friend. I joined the Jazz Band as the pianist. I'm the deputy of the environmental club, meaning I keep track of service hours. I'm looking into medical-related internships, and have a lot of summer plans.

I feel that my first two years were far too inadequate EC-wise. My grades were fine, except for that damned B. How much will this affect me in admissions? I know kids who load up on ECs their last two years of high school have a bad rap, how true is that?

I'm a computer science student from France, I'm going to start a 6 months internship in an agricultural laboratory to finish my Master's degree.

I'm thinking about doing a thesis after, and to be quite honest, I would also like this to be an opportunity to move out of my homeland.

I've looked for bioinformatics jobs in countries like Japan, but also India and Tunisia, just out of pure curiosity… and apparently pure naivety too, as some researcher told me countries like Tunisia were a “black hole”, meaning that if I go there to work, my thesis will be seen as worthless anywhere else outside the country.

Other researchers have suggested me to look for a “cotutelle”, which means a thesis in collaboration with two laboratories in two different countries (which could also solve the “black hole” problem).

So the question I'm asking right know is, which countries are considered “safe” to do a thesis in? Aside from the very obvious candidates like U.S.A., Canada, Germany.

Best regards to you all!"

88m43l,139,2018-03-31,Purdue University announces re-branding and merger to become IU satellite campus: Indiana University - West Lafayette,labtec901,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/88m43l/purdue_university_announces_rebranding_and_merger/,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The Indiana University Board of Trustees on Friday (March 30) approved renaming Purdue University's West Lafayette campus to ***Indiana University - West Lafayette*** to better reflect its changing and expanded mission.


The university’s transformation is a key element of the university’s IU Moves initiative.

Michael McRobbie, president of Indiana University, said the curricular and cultural transformation of the university warrants a new name and frame of reference.

“Indiana University - West Lafayette provides a 21st century education that will prepare students with skills, knowledge and experiences required by business and industry today and in decades to come,” he said. “It incorporates innovative learning environments, integrates humanities with technical studies in a learn-by-doing atmosphere, and offers new options for majors and for earning a degree. As we work to address the needs of today’s economy, we are redefining the Indiana University experience.”

In fall 2014, 33 first-year students participated in the university's pilot program of its transformed learning experience. Designed by faculty from Purdue’s colleges of Technology, Liberal Arts and Education, and Purdue Libraries, it featured new approaches to teaching, integration of English and communications courses into a redesigned learning environment and schedule, and a focus on design and project-based learning. It also focused on individual competencies that students could master at their own pace, allowing for more individualized educational experiences and a lower quality education than could be offered anywhere but an Indiana University campus.

“The faculty of this university deserve enormous credit,” said former Purdue President Mitch Daniels. “By revamping their teaching methods so comprehensively, to match the evolving needs of the marketplace, they have refuted the stereotype that higher education cannot be nimble, innovative, and easy as fuck.  I mean it's IU right?  Fuck it.”

In addition to making every degree shitty as a result of the rebrandning, Indiana University - West Lafayette has expanded the number of undergraduate majors it offers to capitalize on industry needs and faculty strengths. Students enrolling in fall 2018, for example, can choose from unmanned aerial systems, audio engineering technology, supply chain management technology, game studies or health-care construction management. In all, students can choose from 360 majors, all of them inferior to those offered by the departing Purdue University model.

“Team-based, learn-by-doing activities will be formally integrated throughout the Indiana University - West Lafayette curriculum - from freshman year through industry-sponsored, senior capstone projects and internship experiences. When we combine these with an integration with humanities, students will build their understanding of the complex nature of applying technology to social issues, problems and solutions at varying scales,” Daniels said.

This fall, all first-year students in Indiana University - West Lafayette will experience a curricula that highlights the intersection between their major, underwater basket weaving, English composition and fundamentals of speech communication. This approach expands the ideals of the pilot program across all majors and provides a foundation for the types of experiences students can expect throughout their time as Indiana University - West Lafayette students.

""We have always been impressed with the caliber and capabilities of our college's graduates, and this new broader and holistic view of education will result in graduates who are more well-rounded, allowing them to more quickly integrate into and contribute value in our company,” said Chuck Edwards, president of Lenze Americas, gritting through his teeth as he piled fat stacks of cash into his briefcase.

“For more than 5 years, this university has served a unique and valued role to meet the workforce education needs of business and industry in Indiana and across the nation. But those workforce needs have changed, and so too have the ways in which the current generation of students best learn. The economy has irreversibly moved to a thinking economy era where integration, innovation and collaborative problem solving are now key skills of the workforce,” Daniels said.

One defining featuring of the IU - WL change, Daniels said, is the constant exploration of new teaching methods, topics, experiential opportunities and research.

“This is the beginning of a new chapter for our faculty, staff and students,” he said. “While we have created the outline for where we are going, it is exciting to know that we will continually assess our programs and methods to ensure timeliness and nimbleness. It is what our students and their future employers expect and deserve.” "

On the other hand, I feel like I accomplished a lot outside of academics during my 2 years at University: I will have worked 5 internships (3 at different Big 4 and 2 at Med-Size) by the time I graduate, have held a research position, and hold leadership in various cs orgs on campus. I'm not interested in a particular field that requires a graduate degree, but I do feel like I know very little about Computer Science.

Currently, i'm considering pursuing a M.S at a more prestigious uni like Stanford or Yale. My other option would be to work in industry right after college. I think my ultimate question is: What are the pros/cons of going into industry after college vs enrolling in a master's program?

2) How easy/difficult is it to convert an internship into a full-time offer?

3) How favorably will this internship be perceived by other asset management firms, such as BlackRock and Fidelity? How favorably will it be perceived by other buy-side institutions, like hedge funds?
