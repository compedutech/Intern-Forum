So does anyone have any tips on what I should do in my situation? I'm a STEM major trying to eventually go to grad school, but I don't qualify for any research or internship positions. Everything in my resume is old or insignificant.
For context, the classes I'm in are all remedial  and uncompetitive, and they still feel like a lot. On top of all that, I'm a sophomore, I think? I did so badly my first year I probably still qualify as a freshman. 
Any ideas on what I should do?"
yivm9a,1,2022-10-31,Am I undervaluing myself here?,Rubaiyate,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/yivm9a/am_i_undervaluing_myself_here/,"I'm in a bit of an odd position where I am contracted with a company, and I'm not sure if I'm asking enough for my work or not. I've had people tell me either way so I'm looking for more opinions from people in the industry.


Location is Midwest US. Company is small-medium recreation, about 40-50 endpoints, some shared among users, many are Windows based POS systems.


Working hours are variable, can be none some weeks and 40 in another depending on how busy they are/what is going on, I'm not on a schedule and work largely whenever I want or am needed. Sometimes remote, sometimes on site. I am essentially on call near 24/7/365 though.


I don't have an official job title, but am the only actual IT person for the company. I've had to nearly rebuild the physical network over the past ~3 years with them, plus the expansions done to allow for POS systems that were previously not network connected, get wifi to reach into previously 'dark' areas (for both internal network and public wifi), and generally making the network consistent, useable, and secure throughout 99% of the indoor spaces. Besides maintaining all of that, there is one database server, an extremely overtaxed NAS/cloud backup system (I'm working on that), nearly no previous documentation or policies of any kind, a bit of a mish mash of surveillance camera systems (three separate systems entirely, of different brands), and some older/struggling computers I'm still trying to cycle out of commission. I'm also help desk (though a few in the company are computer savvy enough to help each other with the basics and common software, I'm still #1 call if anything goes down, from a dead mouse battery to the whole network crashing). There's no InTune/Azure/AD/Domain, much as I'd love it, so computers are managed independently of each other with users on local (non admin) accounts.


My background, I have an associates degree in Networking &amp; Tech Support, another in Programming &amp; Web Design, both from the local community college; have a CFOT certification, have studied for A+, Network+, Security+, and feel pretty solid in my abilities there but just have never felt the need to put the money towards taking the tests. I'm self employed, run a sort of mobile tech support operation. Outside of my own small business, I had an internship for several years with the city's IT department, and most of my other relevant work history is side jobs and some time at RadioShack and Staples as their ""techs."" Not exactly a glowing resume, unless someone wants to count ""willing to say 'I don't know but I'll find out' and then do it"" for something haha.


I'm getting $22/hour with them. Another small business in town that does consulting, install, and repair type services asks $75/hour, for a slight frame of reference. Benefits are basically free access to the park, events, food &amp; drink. 


I have a (great) history with the company, the flexibility is a huge bonus for me, and I willingly admit I'm under-qualified for some of the things they want done, so that's kind of been my excuse for being ""cheap"" for them. I'm mostly just curious what this type of work might ""normally"" pay, if you strip away the sentimentality and compromises."

I (22F) am an international student in Sydney. I
don't understand what I am doing wrong when it comes to job search and I am feeling disheartened after three months of this. 

I completed a bachelor of data science in July 2022. My applications for internships/graduate programs are being rejected before even being given a chance for interviews. I am not eligible as I am not a permanent resident or citizen of Australia/NZ and my 485 work visa is not being of any help. 

In addition, I can't land a job in my field due to my lack of work experience. I've only done one internship of three months. 

When I came to Sydney in 2019 everything felt overwhelming. I was constantly stressed and experienced heart palpitations very often. I am an introvert so being out in public makes me nervous but I have never felt that cornered before. I didn't understand why that was the case and why even doing the smallest actions felt extreme. 

[Actions like going out to buy groceries, talking to cashiers, taking the trash out for fear that people sees me, giving presentations, going to take the train, and at times hesitating to actually get on the train because of a sudden irrational nervousness] 

Though I made some good friends in my class, I never felt like I belong. Half of the class were Indians and the other half were Asians, mostly Vietnamese. They would often speak in their languages among themselves and I generally felt like an outlier. Rarely did they ever speak English out of the classroom. 

Now I am from a small island and I never experienced those difficulties before. I came to realise that at home, I've always felt well surrounded by friends and family and safe but in Sydney, I am truly alone. 

I learnt and understood that I have a social anxiety and panic disorder. (On top of my imsomnia. I seldom sleep well and it can take hours before I fall asleep. When I do fall asleep, I often experience false awakenings in loops and vivid dreams). 

People have requested I go to therapy but here's the thing, I cannot afford it without a job. [Around $80 to $150 a session of one hour]. I have always been skeptical about therapy until I came to Sydney. Unfortunately, mental health awareness isn't something that is prevalent in my country. Barely no one discusses about these issues. Before, I myself didn't know that all my worries and irrational fears could be classified as an anxiety disorder. 

I have tried so hard finding a part-time job that doesn't cause me to have those breakdowns but I can't. I have tried freelancing on some sites but the clients did not accept any of my proposals even though I go as cheap as $15/hour. I have tried French-English translation tasks but in the end they were only scammers. 

I know that given the chance to work in my field, I would work hard and feel comfortable because I love working with data. I always strive to do my best. I know I can work very well with the team or/and on my own. 

I already feel like a burden to my father and family for not being able to find a job and earn money. Australia's currency is about 30 times more expensive than my island's and my rent alone in a studio unexpectedly increased to $460 per week. 

Despite the scholarship I got, it still takes a huge toll on my father's income. I know I am privilege that my family pays for my uni tuition and living expenses and I am so very grateful for that. It is common from where I come from that parents take care of their children till the age of 25.


It is my greatest wish to be able to give my family back at least the 1% of what they have given me. Deep down, they are really good people and they deserve so much happiness. They are very humble, never hesitate to help people around them and I am so grateful that they are my parents. 

Despite having a degree and trying my hardest, I can't even get past the applications. I am feeling so utterly worthless and finding it so hard to hold myself together. 

Today I had a call with my father. Usually he asked about how I am doing and if I am eating well and always emphasize about finding a job. This time however, he stated that I need to work in retail and to forget all those job applications since they are yielding nothing. He calmly said, ""Don't you care that I am dying here?"" 

I had to end the call because it was too much hearing those words from him. Little does he know how much I actually care and how I wished I could alleviate his worries. One of my greatest fear since forever is being a disappointment to him. 

I don't understand why I am not good enough to be given a job. What am I lacking? I know it's not my CV. It has been proofread by many people. I wish to at least be given me the chance to prove myself in interviews. 

Thank you for reading this. I think I really needed to let this out. I welcome any advices and I hope you have a great day."

I started my undergraduate studies intending to pursue medicine, and originally added CS as a minor in case it was relevant to research in case med school didnt pan out. Recently, I've become a lot more fond of CS in comparison to medicine, and upgraded to a double major with CS. Before deciding whether to drop premed entirely, I wanted to know what CS professionals thought was worth it considering that i don't have much internship experience with CS outside of research applications for 7ish years (heavily ML and data-science related research projects since my freshman year of high school). 

In case it is relevant, medicine has always been a passion of mine but lately the years of schooling, student loans, and underpayment during residency are starting to feel like a drag when there is possibility of establishing myself in CS at an equal level of passion in a much shorter amount of time. 

Given that I don't have a strong portfolio or lots of experience, how should i go about building those things to be a stronger candidate?

My ultimate goal is to achieve some VP level of position in future(it can be easily 10+ y)  
I'm currently a little bit confused of how exactly I should grow my career. Should I grow for another year/two within same company to achieve senior DA position?

yj5szn,4,2022-11-01,Today i hate myself. I messed up registering for exams. I should huzzle to remedy this RIGHT NOW. But i’m paralyzed and crying. Sorry for the wall of text. I just need someone to understand.,Adel_Gold,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/yj5szn/today_i_hate_myself_i_messed_up_registering_for/," 

Late late 20’s, diagnosed with depression and anxiety years back, diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this year. Medicated with 70mg Medikinet a day, the effects are best described as being noticable but very subtle.

I’m supposed to take my exams in 3 weeks. Yesterday I learned that i missed the date to register for the exam by a month. This is somewhat common occurrence at this uni. I know of a few cases where people registered way too late and it still worked itself out. I’ts really no guarantee though. Knowing all this did not help me at all. 

To register you need a certificate from an internship and a set of certificates that each stand for a completed seminar. I still need to collect three of these. One of those is for a seminar requiring a theoretical paper. The seminar was two years ago. My paper is about 3 pages short of being able to hand it in. It has been 3 pages short for about 4 months now. The other two i still need to collect were also years ago, i just didn’t collect them for….reasons i guess. The internship certificate was just gone one day, vanished. I have 4 big bags of paper trash in my „office“ and i figured it has to be in one of them. So kept them around for months.

I vaguely knew that i was probably late for registering. I fucking knew. I just didn’t read the mail with the date so panic set in too late. It mostly was a recurring thought spiral of „shit i really need to register. Ah shit i need to collect the certificates and write the emails. Oh but first i need to finish the paper. And look through the paper trash. Oh god what if it isn’t in there. Dammit I don’t have time right now. I’ll do it in the evening.“ And then i didn’t do any of it. Just another set of many small to-dos vanishing in the chaos somewhere in the back of my head. And now im here. 

Yesterday the panic finally made me sift through the trashbags and i found the internship certificate all crumbled up. I was super happy at first. Best thing happening yesterday. At some point during the process of constructing an improvised press to straighten out the piece of paper a sort of deep despair set in.

I vowed a million times that the exam would be different. And now i’m here and i bloody did it again. Walked right into it eyes wide open. And i sat there all joyfull about a crumbled up document that i was supposed to keep safe.

So I cried. A lot. I was tired. I worked through the night on my exam project. The project i’ve been working on for 3 months now. The one thats going slower that it should but feels really doable and good and fun. 

Since then i just cried again and again from time to time. I woke up super early today to try and collect the other certificates. But i just sat around jittery and unable to move, occasionally crying. Im scared, panicky and paralyzed. I need to ask my friends for help. I’m dreading to have them see me jet again as this self loathing trembling stressed out mess stuck on a pile shit with a shovel in my hand that i can’t use for reasons i can’t really explain. They’ll ask, like they did dozens of times why i didn’t ask for help sooner and as always I won’t know the answer. I’m going through live with blinders, nothing exists but whats in front of me.

So today I hate myself. I manage not to anymore some of the time  (thank you therapy). Not today though. I wish i was different. I so wish i wasn’t me all of the fucking time. I wish my biggest achievement at almost 30 was more than eating enough to not loose anymore weight and keeping my flat at normal levels of messy instead of completely inhospitable. I hate that I am like this. I hate that part of me still believes i deserve to suffer because i caused this. I hate still seeing myself as less than. I dread the future because i know this sort of shit will happen again and again and again. 

And i need to get my body to do things NOW but i can’t. So i cry and jitter and somke another ziggy hoping it'll calm me a bit but it never does. shit. fuck. damnit."

I would like for it to be paid (to help my family save for my uni and also to finance my bubble tea addiction), but even an unpaid internship, as long as it is prestigious, will be good for uni clout  
I have decent programming experience - have won a programming contest hosted by Carnegie Mellon University (CMIMC), cleared 4 levels of Google Foobar, participated in (and won) some hackathons, and have developed a few personal projects (mostly AI/ML and CV related)

Does anyone know of good internship opportunities for high school students like me? Anywhere I check they either say they require you to be in university, or in grade 12.

Preferably remote, because I won't have a G2 license by then and my parents will be too busy to drive me."

I’m planning to learn new skills and have independent projects to become a robotics software engineer, ideally focusing on robot vision or robot control. I plan to take two internships at least before graduating. I have two questions. 

1. What skills should I learn be it software side or other skills. I’m familiar with linear algebra, and have moderate experience with java and python having taking 3 courses on these (still beginner though) and very little experience with C++. I also took a class on ROS where we learnt abit of SLAM.

2. What internships should I realistically do? Like what should be my first one and second one? I doubt robotics companies will hire me without experience.

yjffau,7,2022-11-01,How should I spend my gap year?,OkEquipment9211,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/yjffau/how_should_i_spend_my_gap_year/,"Hey.  I'm 18 and going to college for Computer Science next year.  I decided to take a gap year (in hindsight maybe not the best idea), and I figure I should make the best of it.  So far, I've not been doing a whole lot, but I want to change that.  I know that this is probably a very first world problem compared to a lot of the other posts in this sub, but I still wanted to ask.

There were a couple reasons I decided to take this gap year, one of which was to strengthen my application before I re-apply (didn't accept any of my offers last time around).  I ended up realizing that grades account for like 80% of the admissions decision (at least here in Canada) so I sort of lost motivation in that regard as even if I got insane internships, it would hardly move the needle.  I also feel like I'm not especially bothered about the college I go to anymore.  I guess I'm just not really the type of person who is laser-focused on getting into a T10 or T20, although it would obviously be nice.

I'm really interested in CS and photo/video so I feel like should spend time working on programming projects and editing videos for my YT channel, but I'm never sure.  I also enjoy mountain biking and working out, so I figure I should hit the trails and hit the gym as often as possible while I have all this free time.  Along the same line of thought, I'm working on spending less time on my phone and building other positive habits for later life.  Will probably also start seeing a therapist eventually for some issues I have.

I guess it probably makes sense for me to get a job too?  From a purely financial perspective, I don't need to, and it might not necessarily make sense.  But in terms of discipline etc., I figure it might help?  I've also recently moved to a new city so I could benefit from meeting some new people.  Re jobs do any of you have any suggestions?  It would be cool if there was something particularly memorable or interesting that I could do.  Something like doordash sounds kinda fun but I'm really not sure.

Not sure if there's any specific question I'm asking.  I guess I'm just hoping some of you have gone through something similar and would have some advice to share.

Thanks."
yjfmij,7,2022-11-01,Am I crazy to consider doing an ICT Apprenticeship after completing a two-year course and one-year internship for a tech company?,Nuclear_F0x,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/yjfmij/am_i_crazy_to_consider_doing_an_ict/,"I've been really struggling getting interviews for networking jobs that I genuinely believed would be a good fit. But considering all the talk about hiring freeze on entry-level positions, I can't seem to get my foot in the door to start my career.

I'm currently doing a one year, level 7 in computer networks through Springboard and one thing I was considering was doing a tech apprenticeship through FIT simultaneously. It's a two-year program and I'm not certain if it's possible for them to put me through to a company without having to do all the level 6 stuff again over the next two years. They advised that I should make an application and attend an information session, but I wish they'd give me a straight answer to avoid wasting time...

Is it reasonable for me to even consider going down this path after having completed an internship last year with a well known tech company? I understand that the odds may be against me since I'm competing with candidates who have certs, more experience or a level 8 under their belt. I recently had my CV constructively reviewed and they advised that I should probably remove a lot of things that are not directly relevant to IT to turn it back into a one-pager, (including some of the volunteering and stuff that I thought would be considered to be transferable skills). I'm hoping this will help as they all say the reason I'm not getting interviews is usually the CV. I still need tweak it some more and work on having a more active presence is LinkedIn. One thing that recruitment might find off-putting is the gaps and jumps in my career. I have perfectly valid reasons for thus and it's something I want to work on by getting a contract with a decent employer. 

*TL;DR:* Is an ICT Apprenticeship *really* worth doing for someone who has already studied IT Networks just to get a start on their career? Let me know your thoughts!"

For my internship this semester I spent time in a preschool classroom.
This morning when I arrived, they notified me that there had been a lice outbreak. My supervisor apologized to inform me earlier…. I was honestly really annoyed because everyone had their hair up and/ or wearing a baseball hat.

There wasn’t any communication with me more than just the initial conversation about the outbreak, things were sanitized, nothing about which student or how many had it. 

I work at an assisted living facility and also am taking classes, so I really can’t afford to catch lice..

The only thing is, in terms of the number of hours I am required to complete this semester I am already behind so I’m not sure whether I can afford to skip the next two days of this week where I would normally go onsite to my internship.

What would you do?"

A little background on me. I graduated in Spring 2021 with a BA in Music and a minor in MIS. I learned some programming in my minor and am decent at web development. Like many others, I have had terrible luck finding a software dev job. I've been looking since before graduation, and I haven't had even a single pre-interview.

The reasons I want to go back and get a CS degree are:

1. I lack a lot of foundational knowledge.
2. I think a CS degree would make me more attractive to employers.
3. Everyone is having trouble finding a job, so it's a good time to go back to school while waiting for better prospects.
4. I have zero friends in a field even related to CS, so it gives me a chance to network.
5. Living at home is very demotivating, so going to school would give me a chance to move out and be more productive (albeit on a loan).
6. I will be eligible for internships (almost every single internship I've found requires you to be a student).

The only issue is that I'm only eligible for loans (so no grants). I can finish in 2 years, but that means roughly $24K in loans. The dorms would be roughly the same or even a little pricier, so we're looking at a total of about $50K in loans. I can technically live at home, but I live 25mi from school and find it hard to be productive at home. I feel like living on my own would help me ""grow up"", and past experiences lead me to believe I will also be more productive and have the motivation to grind while in school.

Is this a worthwhile investment? I understand that not taking loans is better than taking loans, but are loans really so bad that they outweigh the benefits I'd get from going back to school? I appreciate any advice you can give me.

**TL;DR: Have been grinding for a job for almost 2 years, but am not even getting noticed. Going back to school for CS, but will take 2 years and $50K total in loans. Is it worth it?**"

I currently have 2 felonies. One is for DUI/Agg Batterry in 2015. This is a violent personal felony. The other felony is possession of meth in 2017 (non-personal). I'm my state there is a 3 year wait time for felony drug expungement, and a 5 year wait time for the DUI/Agg Battery charge (expungement). The time limit for my meth charge was last year. And the time limit for my DUI/Agg charge was supposed to be a few days ago. Well come to find out a case is not considered complete until all the fines are paid. I didn't realize I had them, but last year, July 2021, I got a letter from the court saying I had fines. So I paid them. I didn't realize that unpaid fines means the case isn't ""legally complete"". So the 5 year wait period didn't even begin until July 2021. Here is where this really f's with me. I am currently in CC right now and will graduate in Spring 2023 with my Associates. I will then transfer to my State University and graduate in May 2026, with my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. 

Here's the thing though. Once I graduate I will still have these felonies on my record. Which means I can't even get a job out of college, let alone any internships. I will have to wait 2 months after I graduate to see if I can get my charges expunged, and that's assuming the judge grants it. I've already talked to 3 lawyers in my area and they say the judge usually expunges ALL of them, or NONE of them. I just want to know how screwed am I in this situation? I had everything all lined up, get an internship, get a good job, etc. 

I will graduate with about ~$15k-18k of debt, which even with my current job I could make payments no problem. Also I have worked with TEKsystems in the past and they said I could do some jobs with my felonies, but their pay is usually really low. 

I also have some previous IT experience, NOC work, and Tier 1 work, but that was before all my legal issues. 

I'm really looking for some words or encouragement or just your general thoughts on my situation. Do you think I'll be okay after I graduate??"

* Hirect - startup companies; got a part-time job through this platform this year.

* Tutsnode.net - free learning courses; wealth of resources here learned full-stack dev and some machine learning topics off here. 

* Post your resume on every platform that takes them. Got a job off stack overflow once. You never know who’s looking where.*

On a post a week or so ago somebody mentioned how doom and gloom posts on here can be. I want this to bring some more positive vibes on here for those kicking themselves down right now and actually provide some resources I’ve used myself rather your grad or not (already provided above). 

Tips

If your still in academia like me, I highly recommend getting involved in your schools research programs. It’s been the easiest way for me to get good (and paid) work experience and bolster my resume. I don’t know how research varies from university but it’s a potential resource worth seeking out. I’ve easily gotten about 4 internships related to my major through school research assistant gigs.

Do projects , seriously. Tutsnode.net has resources for projects from start to finish if you need somewhere to start. I sell myself well in interviews because I can talk about my projects and help articulate my skills and capabilities through it."

I am seeing a therapist who prescribes me medication ( i take olanzapine and amisulpiride). I am writing this because i am very uncertain on what my next step should in my life should be. I don't if anyone will read this. I am tired of studying and I would like a job. I am trying to apply through indeed to all kinds of jobs but I fell like  I'm not qualified to do anything. Don't know if should take courses or  do internships. I feel like my life has become a constant walk in the darkness.  Don't know what will happens next. I'm always anxious. I live with my brother who is two years older than me and due to mental health problem he is unstable and screams in the middle of the night when I'm trying to sleep. All this is too much for me to bear. That's why I feel like if I had a place on my own things would be more peaceful. And that's it. I don't have anything else. No plans for the future, no girlfriend, just a cat and sometimes video games. I would appreciate any comments. Have a good day."

During those 3 hours long the nurses take care of us the patients, they are really really nice people, some even offerd help to find an internship as it is a requirement to get the degree. I started going at this hospital since a year now.
But here’s the problem : i lied to them that i im in my final year of studies and that i will obtain my master degree this year but i failed my exams last year and i’m now repeating classes. 
Don’t ask me why i did it i don’t know myself but now i think they caught me in lie because they’ve been asking me lately in what year i was as if they were trying to put me against the wall and give me a way to tell the truth. The problem is that i already lied so much about it i can’t go back i thought about every way of coming clean but its just shameful. I was thinking i should just suck it up until next year and tell them i failed exams from the second year of master to explain why i’m « still »in second year.
So im just asking do you think i’m being paranoiac for nothing or that they know and i should just keep lying until next year? What should i do i’m starting of wanting to skip my treatment just to not meet them i’m so ashamed."

Currently, my portfolio of projects (personal and otherwise) is quite lacking. Would it be ideal to spend time working on some personal projects (and strengthening CS knowledge) or to take a position in a research lab? In essence, what do internships at top-tier companies value more?"

I have already taken 31, 32, 35L, 33, &amp; 180, and was wondering if it was worth it to take some more upper-divs. 

I was planning on taking 111, 131, and 130 (1 per quarter) but was told by some people that I shouldn't bother taking them. I already have had 2 internships (1 FAANG) and got advised to just not take 111, and 131 specifically. 

I'm kinda worried that I won't know OS knowledge and basic Software Engineering knowledge that would be pretty useful for a job in tech. Any advice would be super helpful!"

The location is convenient and the pay is decent, but I'm apprehensive about committing to three semesters. I know Junior year summer is a pretty significant time in regards to getting valuable internships and such, and I'm worried that having to finish my co-op during this time would barre me from other opportunities I would want to consider during that time. However, I'm also worried that I won't receive another offer from other companies I applied to and would really want something to do this upcoming spring or summer. Would my resume look lackluster after junior year if all I had to show was this three semester co-op?"

I’ll start by saying this: It is entirely my fault that I haven’t been putting as much effort into my CS degree as I should have. I started attending university in 2020 for a 4 year CS degree and I worked just hard enough so I could pass my classes with decent grades. However, I did not put as much effort into actually LEARNING outside of my courses as I should have.

yjr3ww,1,2022-11-01,Should I text him?.,PublicDecent7517,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yjr3ww/should_i_text_him/,"So I am F (28) and this summer I met M (35) and we had a summer fling. He was up in my part of country for a summer internship with the military (he is in the military finishing up a college degree before he becomes an officer). I live in Virginia and he lives in Texas. We had a lot of fun this summer, the sex was impeccable, we went on hiking trips, spent every weekend together doing fun activities around Dc/MD/VA and talked every day several times a day for essentially two months. We work quite an intense job that not many people understand because it is secretive so it was really nice to have someone to talk to it about. Our connection was very…intense. I don’t really connect easily with people and he was someone I felt extremely connected to, more than any other man I have ever encountered. 

The whole summer we kept saying we were fwb, even though we both admitted we would date each other in other circumstances. In general he is a quiet and intense person who doesn’t really express his emotions, but through some fights and yanking and pulling he admitted he really liked me. I am moving away to Africa next year for 2 years and he will be in Texas for at least another 2-3 years and may or may not be posted in Virginia afterwards. For this reason we just kept saying to each other we can’t be serious, but I think in the recesses of my mind I really wanted more. Towards the end of the summer he pulled away, and in his last week, on his last days he refused to sleep with me. Again after some pushing and pulling he said it was because it was too painful/ emotional? But maybe he was just saying that to get me to stfu? So we say good bye and agree to stay in touch as friends, I think I said to him “check every few weeks that I’m alive”. He laughed and said of course. 

So as he is driving back to Texas the texting dwindles quick, I sent him a few texts in a row and he never answered. I figured I would wait and see how long it will be . It has now been 3 months. Nothing from him, but also nothing from me. I’m not going to lie, I have been fucking crushed. I’ve actually considered going on depression medication. Maybe I made more of this summer than I should of, he can’t feel that strongly about me right? I have felt, no been obsessed, with reaching out to him lately. But I don’t want to seem desperate. And honestly I don’t want to bother him, especially if he doesn’t really have feelings for me. What do you guys think, text him, leave it alone and try to move on?"

Because Im a 2nd degree seeking student I didnt have to take a lof of the general courses, just some prereq math courses and calc courses. In terms of school class I'm somewhere between a sophmore and junior.

 Last spring I took the computer science 1 course and felt comfortable with where I was at. Over the summer i took one course but worked my job mostly without doing a lot of programming.  This semester I'm a TA for the Cs1 course and taking CS 2.  I won't be taking data structures until next semester but because of my 2nd degree status I'll graduate spring of 2024 so next summer will be the last summer I have in school.

I know that it's important to get an internship while in school and most places only take interns if they have at least one semester left after the internship. So I feel like this summer is the only chance I have to get an internship. My problem is that I dont know anything about data structures or algorithms and every internship i've applied for has sent my a hackkerrank/leetcode question and I bomb them because I dont even know where to begin on them or run out of time. I've tried practicing leetcode questions and  find even the easy difficult. This has really gotten me down and thinking that I'm doomed to fail in the field.

Should I be looking for an internship right now?"

yjudpb,0,2022-11-01,I need advice on how to break away from my parents at 26.,Mysterious-Froyo-887,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yjudpb/i_need_advice_on_how_to_break_away_from_my/,"First off, I 26F would like to preface this with I don't consider my parents to be abusive. Perhaps a bit manipulative at times but overall they provided extremely well for me and my siblings. We've never gone hungry, we don't hate each other, and we got everything we needed (not wanted but needed), never were hit or really ever grounded and they taught us a lot.

I need advice on how to gain more freedom from them in my own head. Unfortunately, I can't afford therapy right now so here goes nothing.

I moved back in with my parents after college so that I could pay for my Master's Degree without getting any loans. Last year, I graduated and ended up getting a good-paying job towards the end of 2021. I decided to save up a bit so that I could be a digital nomad for a while before settling down and I wouldn't have to worry about my finances. I saved up a lot and paid off every loan I have including my student and car loans.

However, in August, I lost that well-paying job and have now had to look for a new one which has already delayed my plans for leaving for a bit longer. The problem is I've started to notice that I care way too much about what my parents think of my plans. In fact, they've almost always discouraged me from ever doing something on my own. I don't know why I have only recently noticed but I really started to figure it out when I had to cancel my first solo trip to NYC because of this financial downfall. My parents are super relieved that I'm not going.

I guess I've never thought about it before but they hate when I leave the state without them. I never went out of state for school due to ""costs"" (which does make sense). However, I got a chance for an internship in Florida for the year, and although I did go, they did discourage me. We didn't talk the entire year I was there until I was days from coming back. When I leave the state with friends of mine they try to discourage me from spending the money because I should be ""saving."" And they did the same with going to NYC. Now, I am thinking about going to New Zealand for the year as a nomad because I have a few friends there. They are discouraging me again.

It's also not just travel. I've noticed that I have had the hardest time making my own decisions recently. From where to work, to who my future boyfriend might be, to where I get to live. My mom even sends me singles events and tells me to go and I just do despite never meeting anyone I'd consider dating.

I've especially noticed this clinginess with my sister and brother too. They don't seem to do anything without my parent's approval and both of them have moved out. But they live within 10 minutes of my parent's house.

At first, I chalked this all up to them being worried helicopter parents. But my siblings are in their 30s and can't move more than 10 minutes away and call my mom almost every day for advice or life updates. I don't really want that kind of helicopter lifestyle. Other than moving out because of course I plan to, how do I cut the cord without damaging my relationship with my parents?

I have spoken to my parents about their helicopter ways. My dad knows about it but doesn't do anything and my mom refuses to see the issue. I have also spoken with some family members and friends and all of them think it's extremely odd and some type of weird control issue my mom has. Still, any advice?"

Too many decisions and too little time.,Fit_Lake1505,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yjwi33/work_grad_school_relocation_help_too_many/,"I have a job lined up and I think I regret it, but maybe that's normal on day 1?? Well, the main issue I'm having here is during the 3-month interview process, I asked for 30 hours a week, and today I came to find they're only providing me with 20 hours a week (4 hours specifically per day), and the offer is at $20.50 now, and ""they say"" it will be $23.00 after the first 90-day trial. Just trying to figure out whether it's a reasonable, liveable wage for someone who already has one master's degree (currently enrolled for master's #2 - long story) and will be working with behavioral (at-risk) youth at two different sites. Calculating that, I'll get like $1,600 at the end of each month.

Meanwhile, I'm spending around $10,000 on my grad program this year to become an LPCC. My husband brings in about 4K a month, and we live rent-free for now due to his relocation package from work. Once that ends in May, the rent here is $1,550-$1,700 for 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom. When summer hits, I'm also NOT getting paid, nor do I get paid during their 2-week, however long breaks the school has nowadays. So, it's more like a 7-month, part-time job, and then I'll have to find work elsewhere or stick it out until the paid school year starts up again.

If I pull out money from our savings and enroll in 4 courses (winter) and 3 courses (spring), I could just quit in the summer and do a paid internship- that's only if that timeline and position work.

I'm having a hard time deciding on what to do. It's this or back to unemployment, and that sucks.

What's the better financial decision? Is the job worth it for all the certification and resume building? Or should I settle for retail or something more reliable?

Edit: Before all this, I worked as a social worker (unlicensed) in a medical clinic. However, the state guidelines require additional education to qualify for those jobs here. "

Everything feels so hard. 

1. My education and career. I have been in college for 6 years. (I took a year off after my bachelors). I have one more year left including a 4 month unpaid full time internship type thing. I have had to jump through so many hoops and take so many exams and still have another YEAR OF THIS before I will be done. I don’t feel like I have another year of this in me, and to top it off the worst part (full time unpaid work) is the last four months. Once I’m done, I will be able to apply to a decent job, decent salary, decent paid time off to be there for my kid,
decent health insurance. But it’s DECENT. It’s not even great for all the work I have had to do. I feel like it’s all so pointless and it makes it so much harder to complete classes. Oh and now I’m in a lot of debt

2. My living situation. I live with an unemployed non functioning alcoholic. Mooches off me. Does literally nothing to help with finances, house work, groceries, cooking, etc. on his phone constantly. I can not afford to rent a place on my own. Even when I finish school, I might not be able to afford a place of my own (rents high here). So that makes me even less motivated. 

3. My ex. He was extremely abusive and I finally left during my pregnancy. Throughout my sons life, my ex has been very inconsistent with visiting my son. He will go months without visiting- then demand I bring my son or he will call the cops on me for not following court order. The visits are a great source of anxiety for me as I don’t trust him and he is still very emotionally and mentally abusive.(We have a court order- ex gets 10 hours per week). Overall, the encounters with my ex through text, phone calls, or exchanges are extremely hard and the whole time my son is in his care i am very anxious. My son has expressed to me lately that he would like to see his dad. Where as before, he would cry really bad. So that helps a little bit. 

4. My self esteem/weight. I have struggled to lose weight since having my son. In fact I’ve gained more weight. I have decided to have weight loss surgery this month. But over all, it feels impossible and directly effects my self esteem. I feel like shit about myself. I guess that leads to me isolating. I don’t want to go out, do fun things, or meet people because I feel gross, I don’t want people to see me. I wish I could lose weight and get over this part of my life. I used to be very outgoing and social. 

If you’re still reading, thank you. I try so hard to make the right decisions. I want to be the best person I can be for my son. I want to give him the best life I can. But everything feels so hard. It feels like it’s a steep uphill battle. Between work, school, full time single momming, I think I drove myself into burnout. I am extremely anxious about all aspect of my life and getting into a deep depression. I want to give up. It feels to hard.  I got the courage to go to the doctor today. Got my kid with me, drove to the next city over. When I get there, they turned us away because my son or I didn’t have masks and the office didn’t have any to give out. I just started crying. I’m like of course. Every step I take in life to try to do better has to be so damn hard.

I wish things would get easier by now. Will they ever? Any advice? Words of encouragement? How do I get through this? How do I improve myself?"

Unfortunately I don't have much experience in the in-demand tech stacks. I've been active in open-source development on GitHub (mainly Julia, as that's what I've been using in science, but I've used python quite a bit before). I have a non-CS degree from one of the top colleges in India, and a PhD and research experience in a scientific field.

I understand that things are a bit bleak with the recession around the corner, but I'm happy to take on free internships to gain experience. I'm also planning to take online courses from Coursera to gain certificates. I guess my background would make me suitable for data science or such jobs, but I'm not fussy about profile or pay.

Could anyone help me out?"

I am 25 with a BS in Politics, Philosophy, Economics (PPE) and an MA in Applied Politics (though much of my studies included public policy). My goal is to get into policy research at a think tank or work as a public policy consultant. 

For experience, I have my degrees, research assistant role in grad school, a political consulting (political campaigns) internship, and I currently work as a committee clerk for a few city council committees in a small city. The major city nearby is Boston, MA. Other experience is a sales role with a tech company. 

I’ve looked at job postings and they all have their own requirements, but I’m looking for more general direction/knowing I’m on the right track. 

Thanks!"

Graduated in May from a pretty good university with a bachelors in computer science. Never really did any internships or outside cs work other than a website I helped build for the music department at our school my senior year (spent my summers pursuing my music career, hasn't really worked out :( ). 

It's been 6 months since graduating and I have had no luck landing a job. I have definitely gone through my fair share of interviews, come close on a few jobs, but still nothing. 

The last few weeks have been hard. Things feel they have picked up, hearing back a lot more frequently now, but still nothing feels close. I have considered trying to find some open source projects to work on in the meantime or even doing some bootcamps but not really sure. 

I guess i'm curious if there's anybody who was in a similar situation as me, did not really have any cs experience leaving school and struggled to find a job but finally broke through, what do you think brought you over the edge? Can't be down to just luck right? Best way to apply (currently mostly through Indeed)? Idk just any insight to motivate me to keep grinding it out."

I'm not sure which career path I'd prefer in terms of SWE vs PM, but I know usually it's difficult to transition to SWE as a PM (but relatively easier the other way around). However in terms of company, Microsoft is much better. Here are the details:

Microsoft TPM

* 8k/month
* Corporate housing provided
* Redmond, WA
* Transportation stipend, free car rental

Amazon SDE

* 9k/month + 1.8k/month for housing
* Arlington, VA

I'm considering the following factors, and if anyone can provide further insight on these it'd be very much appreciated and helpful:

* Company culture/WLB (for FT + internship)
* Prestige (both company + role)
* Return offer rate
* SWE vs PM
* Future career prospects (which one would lead to better career prospects post internship, from what I've heard I believe SWE is better just because there are more SWE jobs and it's easier to transition from SWE to PM rather than the other way around)
* Location for full-time (ideally I'd like to be in New York/California, and I know Microsoft is typically mainly in Redmond but I'm not sure about Amazon)
* Salary (also mainly concerned with FT TC, I'm not sure how different it'd be for Microsoft TPM vs Amazon SDE)

For anyone who interned at Amazon in the past or has any insight, would it be possible to defer my offer from summer to fall or winter? I know they typically don't allow it but I've heard of certain situations where people were able to.

Tried a few internships and it looks like you spend 90% of your time either stitching together other people's code, e.g. structuring calls to third party libraries/frameworks, wading through cryptic errors caused by them or reading documentation; basically everything I told myself that ""I could tolerate if the fun parts of coding were there too"" - except they're not. All that SDLC stuff is also extremely dull to me. I noticed that the programmers who seem to excel in the industry are way more often than not those who are interested in technology itself, and I am the exact opposite of them in that sense. 

You are welcome to be brutally honest and call me out for just being whiny if you think so, I'm also wondering if I should just grit my teeth and bear with it because it's silly to expect everything to be fun. Am I melodramatic or is there a good chance that CS isn't right for me? To be fair, most of my work was in backend/frontend, so maybe my perception of software engineering is skewed?"

I recently got an offer for Optum's (United Health Group) Technology Development Program internship for Summer 2023 and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this program and could tell me if it is worth it to take the offer. I have two weeks to get back to them but I also wanted to wait to hear back from other companies that I applied for. They offer options in your work schedule such as remote but I wanted to get out of my hometown and opted to be in-person because I wanted to be in a different environment. Housing is paid for.

**If anyone interned there I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me:**

**- Your experience or opinions of the experience**

**- technology stack or projects**

**- work culture**

**- any intern activities or opportunities to connect or hang out with the team**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Any amenities or facilities at the NC office in Raleigh if you've worked there, which looks cool as it's in the Bank Of America Tower. It's on Six Forks Road if you want to check it out

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard about Optum's chill environment and laid-back culture but wanted more details as I couldn't find much about the NC office and the amenities or facilities it offers.

It's a healthcare company so I'm not expecting too much with the technology stack.  They use the old Microsoft stack along with AngularJS so some stuff seems outdated in terms of cutting-edge technology. I know it will depend on the team you get placed on and I won't know until like April. As long as I am learning I can't complain.

For context, I'm a junior CS major. I really care about meaningful projects, learning, the work environment, and opportunities to connect with others such as events or hangouts when deciding on offers. Any advice is appreciated."

Basically the project was train wreck after train wreck. Me and one other developer fresh out of college were tasked with this project and barely anything was designed when we came in. 

Now I'm the only one left on the project left to basically try and fix it all before it gets passed off. This has been affecting my mental health. 

The more I try to fix the problems the worse things get. My manager isn't a Java dev, and I'm currently having to work on our data extraction, database schema reworks and Java backend work as well as writing documentation, sharing credentials, communicating between the incoming team and our associated dev teams, scheduling meetings etc.

Any advice would be helpful

So this is my second job out of college. My first job out of college was a pretty laid back, mostly hybrid job where I was a C# and Angular developer for a year and I liked the culture and coworkers but I was paid horrendously (I do not want to say because I am embarrassed to admit it in a way). I had to skip a few trips with friends who were all paid closer to/over market rate because I simply could not afford it.

I started looking for another job and after a year at my old job, I finally joined my new job at a law firm nearby. I was contacted by a third party recruiter and it was a pretty straightforward interview process. The recruiter said it would be a hybrid role with 3 days office/2 days at home role which was more days I would have to go to office than my previous job but the pay was significantly greater. I could finally afford to move out of my parents place and do so much I was not able to do before (like finally afford a vacation). I did the final round of interview at the firm itself and everyone seemed really nice and chill and they said that work life balance was something they held as a priority.

It has now been 3 months at this job and I really really hate it. First off, the whole hybrid schedule thing was a lie. In fact, my first introductory meeting I was explicitly told this is not a hybrid role. The deal with the 2 days work from home is that if, under certain circumstances, you need to work from home, you can do it for maximum 2 days in a week and it must be approved by manager (and they stressed that you cannot do this every week and they really expect me to be in office 5 days a week most weeks. I have in my 3 months asked 5 times for wfh to my super and he only approved 1).

Also, when I was given my office, I realized it was at the [literal corner inside a literal basement](https://imgur.com/a/lVlrMwc), isolated from everything, with no windows at all and horrific beige lighting, something I did not expect at all. The only other person in this area is the other developer who works for this firm. All the lawyers work upstairs where their offices have the open concept layout with lots of windows and even my supervisor works in a much better space than this. I am used to going to office but this place has been draining my soul it is like I am in a literal dungeon. Especially now that winter is approaching I have been seeing less and less sunlight everyday and it has been destroying me.

On top of all that the firm is super strict on attendance and clocking in and clocking out and I have been disciplined because one week the traffic was especially bad due to roadwork and I had to clock in around 9:15/9:30 for a few days. And because it is a law firm, there are so many old fashioned rules I have to follow (and tech I have to deal with) like how extremely uptight and formal their dress code is. And I am just not a fan of the frat-like and gossip based culture in this office at all.

I realized I screwed up taking this job. Yes I earn way more than I did at my previous job but my mental health has been eroding for the past 3 months and I am already just drained and irritated by the time I get home everyday. The work life balance I had at my previous job is nonexistent here. I wished I had more due diligence but I also wished I just knew more getting into this. I have been applying to jobs but it seems that a lot of people are a bit hesitant in taking in a developer who has only been at his previous job 3 months and only has 1 year non intern experience prior to that. I feel like I am in a dead end position where I hate my job and cannot get out and I hate myself for making such a mistake. I can't even just quit cause then I can't pay rent and sustain myself. I just feel stuck and any tips and advice would be greatly appreciated"

I am a current hs senior applying to college. I am very anxious about my acceptances, as my GPA dropped from a weighted 4.2 to a 3.6 from freshmen year to junior year. I also posted on college confidential, and everyone said that ALL of my schools are reaches. I don’t understand. I will be very open about my situation, as I also wrote briefly about it in the Covid section in common app, but in a positive light by discussing how I grew.
It began with depression in lockdown along with taking difficult STEM classes online. Then in person junior year, I had family issues, jumped from med to med, and in and out of the mental hospital. I was also diagnosed very late with ADHD this past summer. Do not worry, I did not include any details in my brief explanation.
I have a very low GPA and SAT for the competitive nursing school. I also didn’t plan on applying to any prestigious schools, but people convinced me to apply ED to Cornell College of Human Ecology, and I chose Human Development as my major.
Don’t feel bad if you laugh. I know it’s outrageous and stupid to even think there’s a slight chance.

Strategically placed tl;dr: have personal programming exp, am starting CS at uni in 3 months, is working a part-time cs job worth it and manageable? How difficult is getting a cs part time job / internship?

I'm starting my CS degree at a university in South Africa next year in February. I'd like to hear opinions and experiences from fellow CS students / grads who took up a part-time CS-related job during their studies. Below follows a bit of background on my experiences with programming so far.

I've been programming and learning about computers on a software level for quite a few years now, having messed with Javascript when I was 12 or so (didn't get very far at the time). Currently I'm halfway through a medium sized personal Android Studio project using Java, and have some Python experience, as well as 3 years of Delphi from high school (yes, Delphi..). Without sounding full of myself, I think it is of value to note that I score 98% on my practical examinations, so I'm fairly good at what is expected of me at this level, which is honestly stuff I could do 3 years ago..

I'm very enthusiastic about CS, keen to get into the math and theory as well, as I'm always curious about how things work and the problem-solving required to work with software.

As much as university seems exciting now, I know I definitely need some real-world experience to land a good job straight out of university, and I do plan on applying for internships (vacation based, so like a month twice a year) next year already (our academic year is Feb-Dec), but is it possible to work a part-time job / internship during semester months and still manage some shape of a life and spend enough time on my modules? Follow-up, how difficult is it in general to land a part-time job in CS during uni, and does it sound like I'm on the right track? Thanks! Any other tips you have for me around anything I said are welcome as well :)"

It said to bring 2-3 copies of my resume and to be prepared for a technical interview. Any info would be great, thanks!"

Am un “proiect” sa-i zic asa pe github, dar e destul de scurt(300 de linii). Cum as putea sa obtin un internship, ce ar mai trebui sa fac, cursuri, proiecte, etc.?"

What is the latest time to apply for internships? Im not looking to score an internship with big tech companies like google, amazon, etc. I would be happy with interning for a smaller company or startup over summer (just any internship would be fine really)"

ykmld6,1,2022-11-02,Pinterest vs Amazon vs Microsoft,Fluffy-Tea-7569,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ykmld6/pinterest_vs_amazon_vs_microsoft/,"Hello! I am pretty conflicted on these internship offers. I am a junior who is *hoping* to convert full-time to the offer I accept. Initially, I was leaning towards Pinterest. However, Pinterest is not offering relocation this year which is a bit of a let down. But, Microsoft offers relocation, their benefits are amazing, and a great HQ. But, if I think long-term, not relocating for three months should not be a deal-breaker for Pinterest. As for Amazon, it is at the bottom for me as I am not a fan of the culture and WLB. I wrote out some pros and cons below.

  
**Microsoft:**

Compensation: $7890/mo

Benefits: A free bus pass, a free gym membership, medical plan, 80% off Microsoft software…up to $450, $300 misc allowance, paid holidays

Relocation: Flight covered, corporate housing or $7k stipend, $1200 commute allowance or car rental which would deduct $375 from salary

Pros:

\-Great WLB

\-Good name

\-Great benefits

Cons:

\-Lowest pay

**Pinterest:**

Compensation: $9000/mo

Benefits: medical plan, dental plan, vision plan, commuter $150/mo, professional development $50/mo, wifi/mobile $130/mo

Relocation: N/A

Pros:

\-Great WLB

\-Good name

\-Great new grad compensation(and intern comp)

\-PinFlex

\-Q3 revenue grew 8% year over year to $685 million

Cons:

\-no relocation

\-low return offer rate due to economic situation

**Amazon:**

Compensation: $9138/mo

Benefits: medical, paid time off

Relocation: Flights covered, $2,425/mo housing post tax 

Pros:

\-Good name

\-Good compensation

Cons:

\-Known for bad WLB

\-High turnover rate

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to note is I am in the process with Google. I have done my first two rounds of interviews. However, I did really good on the second round and mediocre on the first round. So, they invited me for a third round. Now, even if I pass the last interview, team matching is a very long process and I may be risking my offers expiring. I guess there is the possibility of reneging. But, I would have to accept the chance that I never work at that company again.

I’m still enrolled in college in my 3rd semester in a CS diploma. Even though I’m doing a job but I guess interview for IT job would be different ( maybe). 
Since I don’t have much experience in this, i was wondering if could get some advise on what to do and not to do. 
For example if I dont know about any question should I be straight forward and say I dont know or do something else ? 

Any advices and suggestions would be very helpful. Thanks in advance."

It was pretty straight forward for a majority. The pbqs were very fun I enjoyed them. I suggest knowing scripting in python and bash for sure. Atleast the basics. Know sql too along with ur html headers. Nmap is essential for this exam aswell. Besides that it wasn't all that bad. If your new with the tools def check out tryhackme.com that definitely should help beginners atleast the pentest+ path. For background I have A+, n+, sec+, project+, cysa+, itil foundations, and 2 others from the ec-council and now pentest+.

I go to UT Austin and I’ve been having zero luck with getting an internship. I have attended many job fairs and have applied to many internship positions but I always get rejected. I even had an interview for 3 hours and got rejected! And I’ve been told by professors that I’m great in interviews! I see many of my classmates who never show up to class and never do their work (aka. lazy people) and they get internships at Microsoft and Lockheed Martin, etc. I work very hard every day, always trying to do my best. I have a great GPA too. Is there someone who could give me advice on what to do? Has anyone gotten a job after they graduated without any internship experience? Now it seems like if you never get an internship you will NEVER get a good job in ECE after you graduate. This is really affecting my mental health!

To sum how can I get experience when I’m not given opportunities? I want to learn, that’s the whole reason why I’m here today!"
ykpyfi,7,2022-11-02,Feel shitty about myself for keep failing at practicing coding questions,SleepyTechGirl,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ykpyfi/feel_shitty_about_myself_for_keep_failing_at/,"
I’m a senior CS. I’ve been hustling since freshman and knew how important grinding Leetcode is to get a foot to big tech companies. But I’m terrible at it. Practice coding questions has became a black hole to me.

My first time planning to do Leetcode was in Summer 2020. I spent 2-3 hours every day until I solved around 30 questions but couldn’t figure out their patterns. The second attempt was signing up for an Algorithms courses so that I could have deadlines and an actual instructor/TA/office hours to get the work done. I failed again because their comprehensive materials and I can’t put up with 20 hours every week to do homework while having 15 credit hours at school and a part-time job. At the third attempt, I decided to pay a big buck to have a private TA to guide me through this painful process, but my internship keeps me super busy to do anything else on the side. Even I made it to the end but I only grasp 70% of the materials and still couldn’t solve a single graph questions without asking for help. My latest attempt was 3 months ago when I decided to go the traditional way — solving only one problem as the first task daily following the  Neetcode150 list. Unfortunately, 18 credit hours and a part-time internship hit me again. I was too stress out to put my head into solving the problem, I got into the shit hole and take a break from coding challenges. The break now take months and I wanted to give up on Leetcode-type questions. But as an international student, getting into big tech comp secures me sponsorship. I now feel shitty about myself, my ability, and my future plan. It started to give me some mental breakdown. I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t know if I post something on here would help but I really need to let it out.

FYI, all of my passed interview weren’t involved to any Leetcode-type questions. I had 2 internships and a full-time offer that is too low ball (70k with little compensation). That’s why I keep wanting to try, but I’m too exhausted at the same time."

Hardest struggle is not even school work really, have just been trying to get into internships. Been shotgunning like hell (~150) for SWE/SDE positions and have only gotten 1 interview. DSA questions are incredibly challenging for me but I’ve still been trying to keep a consistent LC grind. Wouldn’t be surprised if nothing sticks, so was wondering if it would be stupid to double in these two ENG majors. University I attend has decent engineering program (to my knowledge) but would definitely be a little harder. That being the case, my load wouldn’t even be the much more if I doubled in these two as coursework overlaps a lot. The only extra thing is that I would have to take summer school, which I don’t mind because I wanted to be productive and not be a lazy piece of shit over summer via an internship anyways. Career wise I haven’t put much effort into what I want to do, maybe something along the lines of CPU/GPU architecture, cloud computing, cyber-physical networking, or computer vision. Basically more CE based than EE but I still love learning physics and find conceptually (as of now) EE concepts very cool. Biggest scare is GPA drop but I trust myself enough to not let myself get anything below a B as I’m pretty hardworking and come from a competitive background. Minoring was an idea, but it’s not that much harder to major so why not go for it? Is this a stupid idea?"

I got Summer 2023 internship offers from JPMC and Zocdoc. Which of the two do you think would be best? I will be a senior after this internship, so my main priorities are (1) How much will I learn at this internship, from my project, and from other employees? (2) How likely is it for me to receive a return offer, and if I do, would I want to return? (3) As a woman in tech, will I feel safe and welcomed there?

JPMC:

* NYC or Jersey City (most interns will be placed at Jersey City)
* $52.88/hour
* $2500 one-time stipend (no housing provided)
* Hybrid: 3 days required in the office
* 10 weeks
* Heard that full-time return offer rate is pretty high
* My thoughts on it so far: 
   * Pros: 
      * Larger company usually = more stability
      * Higher intern pay (but I've heard there's basically no raise for the return offer new grad pay, which sucks)
      * Better name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year
      * Higher full-time return offer rate
   * Cons: 
      * Unsure if I want to work at a bank since engineers aren't prioritized as much
      * Don't like top-down, very corporate formal culture

Zocdoc: a later-stage health-tech startup that is pre-IPO, used to financially not do so well but switched business plans a few years ago and now doing better

* NYC
* $40.96/hr ($7100/mo)
* $5400 one-time stipend (no housing provided)
* Hybrid: 2-3 weeks in the office
* 10 weeks
* 10 SWE interns in total for next year
* 50% full-time return offer rate and the team I return to depends on what I want and what business needs are
* My thoughts on it so far:
   * Pros:
      * Larger scope project since startup
      * I feel more passionate about health tech than finance
      * Better work culture and prioritization of engineers since it's a tech company
   * Cons:
      * Pay is not very high for NYC's cost of living
      * Worser name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year 
      * Lower full-time return offer rate 
      * Full-time return offer is stock options and not RSU

I've heard for both the impact of your project and how much you will learn are team-dependent.

Any opinions would be appreciated. Thanks!

I've been fortunate enough to get offers for DataDog and Bloomberg this upcoming Summer. I'm wondering people think about which program is better!

Location: Both in NYC, 11 Weeks

Salary: The same

Housing: Bloomberg corporate housing or stipend, DDOG stipend only, \~1k higher than BB

Relocation: Bloomberg \~2k, DDOG flights to and from NYC covered

General Intern Life: Both seem to have a very robust intern program (lots of events, socials, networking chances, meaningful work)

&amp;#x200B;

Given the offers are almost identical similar, I'm more curious about what the general opinion is on which company has more opportunities/chances for growth/recognizability. I'm currently leaning towards DDOG. 90% conversion rate, tech being the company's moneymaker, and smaller company size makes me lean that way. Thoughts?

I am in school for mental health counseling and had to find an internship to complete counseling hours to graduate. I found a site during the summer. It was a residential facility for recovery. But due to some circumstances it seemed like I had lost it. Frantically, I started calling other sites to find another placement. By luck, I found a site at a private practice. However, the original site called me, apologized for the misunderstanding and told me that they contact HR to process my employment. So, I decided that I would stick with both because the hours for both sites were not a lot and I thought I could juggle it. I thought it would be double the experience and would look good in my resume. I also have a part time job. Now I am feeling how much pressure I have put on myself and I want to quit the residential facility internship as it is not enjoyable. The staff are unhelpful, most of the time I am sitting and doing anything, no direction. I will say though, my supervisor is a really nice lady. But other than that it feels like a waste of 2 days in my week to be getting up, getting dressed, driving for almost an hour to sit for 4 hours and essentially do nothing. I am thinking of quitting but a part of me likes to hold on to things even if it is not servicing me well. I still think it would look good on my resume. But I also have to think about how I am not giving full effort to the other things in my life. I could be taking more shifts at my part-time job (that I need because I am paying off a car). I could be giving more effort to the other internship I actually enjoy and need and will benefit from after graduation. And I have a big test in 2 weeks that I need to pass in order to graduate. But I feel like I will look really bad in front of the staff. Like she was only here for a month. Is it okay to leave the internship? I know I should quit but I need someone to tell me its ok."

I just graduated in May with a major in Economics. So far the job hunting process has been tough. I have had some experience with working in the production world with events management, however I really want to do analyst for a living... I have had experience in working with Stata, Excel, Tableau, Python and acquired Google Data Analytics certificate doing SQL and R. Throughout my sophomore year, junior year and senior year in which junior year was affected by Covid, getting an internship in data analysis was extremely hard. I was also forced to go back to my country for 2 years because of Covid. 

Is there any recent grads that are struggling as well? Also, I would really appreciate advice from other BU alums on the job hunting process, because this is really tough... I have applied to 200 positions of data analyst both intern and for entry level, but they never replied :("

I’m not going to graduate until Fall 2024, so I’ll have one more internship opportunity after this upcoming summer. I’ve done a Research internship and a DevOps internship. I would eventually like to work as a SWE (I think ???). I have 3 offers right now and I honestly think they all have the same level of pros &amp; cons. I have to decide in the next 3-4 days.. Also, I can’t renegotiate due to school policy, so I have to make a decision.

1. Cloud Associate Intern - AWS
- Pay: $34/hr, monthly housing stipend
Location: Seattle
- Pros: Big company name, possibility of internal transfer, get to learn more about cloud since I’ve developed an interest for it, high pay (in terms of what I’ve been offered before), established intern program
- Cons: the job responsibilities vary &amp; idk if it would screw me for possibility of getting SWE internship following summer 

2. Software Engineer Intern - aeronautics company
- Pay: $26/hr, relocation one time lumpsum 
- Location: Denver
- Pros: SWE title (but my responsibilities seem like they will be more DevOps), interesting industry, vibed with hiring managers
- Cons: small company, non-established intern program, possibly going to be doing more DevOps stuff (which I want to try something else) 

3. IT Intern - retail chain
- Pay: $23/hr
- Location: Michigan
- Pros: Laidback company, WFH 2x a week, I like Michigan, most likely would actually get to work on software development (there’s dif teams in IT), sentimental value for company (lame but true), guaranteed full time offer 
- Cons: IT title, lower pay than current internship, low name value, possibility of not doing software development 

Genuinely open to opinions and advice. Right now, my gut is not pulling me in any direction lol and my pros and cons lists are not helping.

How? and When?,Maybeiamaarmadilo,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yl4pdx/design_pattern_where_should_i_use_them_how_and/,"Hi everyone so little explanation on what I am trying to do, first I been doing a internship in a middle business, after doing some university of 3 years and a coding bootcamp of a few weeks.

I am mostly a back end programmer using mostly c#, in this internship I worked in some small projects(create csv from some Json or dealing with Api of some identity management). As a programmer I honestly just know the basic of the languages and some shaky base of OOP.

So this week I started a new task, the task is part of the company developing a new version of their CRM that for me is pretty complex(maybe is not, but I don't really know better) the task is to take from SQL a list of commands stored as varchar(max) (I don't really know what else call them, those are pretty much a list different commands containing thing like SQL: SQL statement, Button: SQL statement, Button: CSS property, Row: CSS properties, and Many many more things like those event containing some Javascript in them, all separated with a delimiter) and create a json document that has to be stored on mongo dB and then filter those document in case of duplicate.

It a task that will take time(?) to complete and there are others coworkers working on it too, but they are pretty much overworked and aren't really capable of helping me right now. So I started writing some code creating the classes to create the Json document and retrieving the data that is needed, but in my code i have thing that at glance one of my coworker said that I should change and should use a design patterns like factory or strategy.

Thing is that even to I have read about them in the past i have never really implemented them, so I am struggling have searched and i am still searching about them but i honestly i am having a hard time understanding how to apply them to my code.

i going to post an example of the code that my coworker said i should change, it's an example of the switches that i use to sort the different operation, but i can already see that is a nightmare to maintain.

What could i change of my programing style? what Pattern could i use for my task? What book or site could i look for a good example to read about Patterns?  Other coding Conventions that should i look up?"

I assume next year grad schools and new grad jobs/interns HR don't give a look at you if you don't have any internships/research. So if I can't land internships 2023 summer is it better to just quit CS?

Currently in the worst T20 school for CS and finding CS research here is hard as Fk. I feel like I am just a noob wasting myself not doing any side projects/research in college, and my resume is still completely BLANK now.

I hope there's a way to do this in Excel and that I don't have to go to Access; I have a Mac in my office, and I tend to swear loudly when data doesn't do what I want it to, which is not the vibe in a library.

I have two large tables of data. One is of our collection as a whole (several thousand titles), one is titles on a particular topic that are located all over the library (796 titles). The largest table I was able to pull from the database that supports our catalog, and it has data that I need for the smaller table (but that isn't available in the way that I pulled it). However, I've yet to find a way to filter the large table down to just the titles from the smaller table that doesn't involve weeks of copy/pasting. I don't want to have to go through and find all 796 titles individually, then copy over the three data points I need for each record. Nor do I want to dump that on an intern.

Is there a way, if I put both tables into the same workbook but on separate sheets, that I can have Excel create a new table for me with all of the info together? Or even if it just can use the smaller table to filter the larger table down to just the 796 titles? I already have a unique ID in each table as a point of comparison (the item's barcode number).

I would love if there's some easy way to do this in Excel so it is repeatable for multiple collections and to evaluate them over time. And I really don't want to have to resort to SQL; it's been years since I used it and I can already feel the headache it'll cause."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm studying ICT software engineering and am currently doing my internship for an organization ruling one of the province in my country (the Netherlands) and their goal is to get all wrongdoings on a map to indicate concentrations. They developed a Power BI solution with the icon map add-on. The map is mostly filled with data from numerous district law organizations. They create an data extract (Excel) every three months and format them to only the three fields when, what and where. Then the where will be anonymised and finally the file will be uploaded to a SharePoint environment that Power BI pulls data from.

My assignment is to research ways to improve this. So researching if there's a better way to create this map (I already see a lot of benefits in ArcGIS, they also already work with it). But also improving the dataflow, a big problem is information privacy and security. So you have to be sure to only deal with the data that's telling what, where and when. Beside that all the data stays ""inside"" the used systems, so it's not stored on a database or anything.

Sorry if it's unclear, I tried my best to explain it in English.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally my question is, what things should I be looking for or researching for? I normally know you should do your own research, but I just wanna be pushed in the right direction. I already wrote down these topics:

\- Azure data pipelines  
\- ETL/ELT tooling  
\- API (not all of the used systems have an API   
\- AWS Glue

Am a Y2 computing student without any internship experience yet and got an SEP offer in Australia for Y3S1. But, it starts in mid-July and for SIP, the website says this:

""Your self-sourced internships will have to fall between our official SIP period (**May - Jul**) in order to be considered for conversion into SIP. Slight variations of **up to 1 week** from the official internship start date is still acceptable provided the minimum internship period is met.""

Does anyone know how strict these SIP requirements are? Will a shorter duration or variation of 2 weeks be allowed? Or any way for me to squeeze in an SIP internship before going for SEP?

I've applied to Quant Research roles with firms such as HRT, Jump Trading, Citadel, Two Sigma, DE Shaw, Marshall Wace and I didn't even get to any interview/screening rounds! Clearly I need to accomplish more before I can get a shot at these firms. Questions I had:

1. Should I pursue a PhD programme? If so, is UK (Oxford/Cambridge) seen as inferior compared US? Thinking of going to UK because I generally don't feel that safe in US
2. Or, should I take up a role with a tier 2 quant firm first, work a few years and try to jump to a tier 1 with experience? It's in a systematic macro fund that is mid sized.
3. Should I leave my gpa of my undergrad out? It's a 3.75 out of 4, although my masters has a perfect gpa. Unfortunately I don't think firms will look at my gpa hand in hand with other accomplishments (part time internships, having 5 investment/data/quant related CCAs and heading 4 of them at a time)

My profile for context:

Gone to the top university for undergrad in my country, and now I'm at an Ivy League with perfect GPA in Masters of Computer Science. I have more than 5 internships; some in data science, 3 in quant research from various tier 2 quant firms. I've also been head of investment/computer science related clubs, and I also have won international competitions (not olympiad, but quant trading/finance related). Unfortunately I'm still getting auto rejected by the better firms, so I was hoping to get some advice.

My brother(19M) was diagnosed with epilepsy around a year ago which was pretty hard for me (21M) handle. However, since being medicated, things are going pretty well. He studies law, has a part-time job, hangs out with friends etc. But every once in a while he does have a seizure while he sleeps. We share a room together and have been sharing all our lives so when these do occur, I'm immediately there to help. We also have a sister (17F) who is awesome and both my parents are also around.

Now, for the longest time, I wanted to study abroad for a year in Japan and now that opportunity has come my way. I have my application ready and even the blessing of my entire family ( funnily enough my brother is the one who is most excited for me to go). But for whatever reason I can't bring myself to send it off. My brother and my sister, in recent years especially, have become my best friends (so I suppose the saying 'friends will come and go but family is forever' does have some truth to it). While he is okay and the rest of my family will always be there to support him, I couldn't forgive myself if anything were to happen to him and I wasn't there to support him. I told my brother about the alternative of doing a paid internship (which I am totally happy to do since the money sometimes can be really good), but he got pretty pissed off. He said that I should go and that he will be fine but even so, I still can't bring myself to submit my application worry-free

I could really use some advice right about now."

Im in my 2nd year of computer engineering and currently im at a point where I dont know what I wanna do in my career, as in I know i want to be in the IT field, do I want to become a front end developer, or full stack, or open source or do web development, or cloud, or AI or just stick to good old C, or idk what there are so many options, and then there is management as well. I am not even sure if i wanna do a job immediately or if I wanna go for masters.

I know a guy who has passed out now but when he was in 2nd year he got really into Linux and developed his own GUI and all and many many people around the world use it, its an overall cool thing, and he learnt lots from it and got good internship from it as well. I wanna do similar things in life as well. Well not exactly linux, but i wanna have one area which I am good at. Right now, I cannot pinpoint 1 single thing that I am passionate about, I like everything and everything is interesting to me. 

I was thinking, I want to try a little of everything in my 2nd year and then I will decide on what I like the most and get experience in that field in my 3rd and 4th year. Is this a good approach?

Competitive programming - I started this around 2 months back and although I am not very consistent at it, I really enjoy doing it and I love the process. I enjoy programming in general.  I started on hackerrank for now. 

Open source - Am learning linux as a subject.  I would say I am decently interested in linux but unfortunately my laptop is not linux compatible, so I will have to wait until i get a new and better one which is about 3-4 months probably. For now, i practice linux in the college computer labs and thats it. 

Programming Languages - C-&gt; I consider myself to be decent at C

Java-&gt;Learning 

C++/Python -&gt;I know the basics

I have not started with things like CSS, JavaScript, React yet but i really wanna try them soon. 

I am not sure what my question is exactly, but its just that sometimes I feel so much overwhelmed by the amount of options I have. I have really bad anxiety and sometimes I get so scared of a future where im just an average employee in an average company working a 9-5 and doing excel and making ppts. I wanna do big things in life and have something to be proud of but I dont know where to start. I see many of my classmates knowing exactly what they want to do and getting ahead. But I am stuck and it sucks bad. 

( and i probably am either burnt out or depressed, been struggling wi it for a while, im trying to find something that will keep me motivated for a better life in the future)"

The only issue is my boss has a dog that they bring in the office and at first I was like Omg cute dog and then it started barking at me . I was like oh and the boss ladysaid she doesn’t like new people . And I understood and backed off . But every time I try to go in her office or even in the same vicinity  this dog growls and barks at me , it’s been 2 months now . And it isn’t some tiny dog . It’s as big as a German Shepard . She knows how this dog is, and tells her to stop and she does . 

But one day . I was in the common room area and the boss lady joined me there and we were talking and her dog followed her and stayed in the hallway. Well she left to go to the bathroom . And the dog stayed there in the way. So when I tried to go pass the dog growled and barked super bad and I just left the office  and waited outside for the boss lady to come back .so I went to the bathroom and came back and stood by the door and the dog ran up by the window and saw me and barked growled and bit the glass all crazy  I was like omg wtf. It would have bit the fuck out of me if I hadn’t left . And when the boss lady came back she calmed her down and said in a joking voice “ I’m glad u didn’t go in”. I’m like wtf. 

So I asked the other lady who works there if she thinks the dog would ever bite me . And she said well , the dog has bitten her 2 times once on the thigh and one on the hand drawing blood . I was like wtf omg . She said the dog didn’t mean it and it was playing …. Uh I don’t think it’s playing tbh . And I’m scared idk if I should tell the school to change the internship or what because it would be a long process to leave , and I don’t want to seem dramatic.

Her father would hit her and let his other children bully and beat her as well. She lives with her aunt and grandfather.

I live in an apartment below my grandmother and there is no way she would allow another girl to move in, let alone her 2 dogs. I would also love to help her find a place but I'm barely making paycheck to paycheck as is. My boyfriend and I really want to help her but we just can't, it's gut renching to see someone you care about go through this and not be able to anything. It has gotten worse lately since I was fired from my job, we can't even afford the gas to go see her in person anymore. I feel like an absolute piece of shit for not helping, but what can I do? Make money out of thin air so we can both move out of our shitty houses? But maybe it isn't all bad. We are both looking into getting jobs across the river in another state that pay way more than here. And my boyfriend was offered an internship at a start up tech company. So maybe that idea of moving out in June is a possibility. Just maybe, with a little bit of hope and a fuck ton of luck, we all can do it. 

The hardest part os going to be disconnecting from our families. Luckily my parents moved out of state almost a year ago, but my boyfriend and friend aren't going to be so lucky. We all kind of found out together that we had shit childhoods that messed us up way more than we realized. My boyfriend's family is extremely manipulative and uses his easy going nature to guilt trip him into doing whatever they want. And now that I'm in his life they blame me for him not coming around as much, when I'm just exposing their moves to him. He shouldn't feel responsible for his mother's happiness, and she acts as if him leaving house is the worst thing that ever happened to her. When she is the person who still lives with the man she has a restraining order against and absolutely hates apparently. Then never leaves, even when her mother literally offers to buy her a house since she's rich as hell. And both of them taught me that being restricted to sitting at the kitchen table doing homework or reading for months is not a normal for of punishment. And that my parents watching a new movie I wanted to see in the next room while I sat in the kitchen just listening to it is in fact emotional abuse. 

I have the feeling that people are going to take this as a ""poor me"" post, and those people can fuck right off. Messing up your kids isn't okay. Doing shit like this is reason they try to unalive themselves. And the ones that do survive don't talk to you for a reason. My mother is a RN. A REGISTERED NURSE that had to go through 4 years of college and medical training. And she doesn't think that mental illness are not real. She believes whole heartedly that ADHD is people just making excuses, depression is people feeling sorry for themselves, and anxiety is something we all feel so get over it. I went undiagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and autism for 20 years because she refused to believe that there was something wrong with me. She also refused to let me get the cervical cancer vaccine because, and I quote ""You get that from sleeping around a lot, and I know you aren't a whore."" I was denied medical treatment, because she doesn't believe that I should sleep with one or more person. She also didn't let me get the chicken pox vaccine because ""It isn't deadly, and you'll only ever get it once.""

Shit like this makes me irrationally angry. I want to punch the bitch that raised me in her fucking mouth everytime she speaks. That woman will never be my mother, my real mom died 2 years ago. My aunt was more of a motherly figure and did more for me in the year she lived with us than that woman has done to be since being born. I hope she's fucking happy in Florida, because then maybe she'd leave me the fuck alone. I hope she chokes on her glass of wine tonight.

One of things no one prepares you for as an adult is realizing that you might not have been the problem. Growing up it's always ""listen to your parents"" because they are supposed to know what's good for you. But if you go to them, crying your heart out, begging for help with feelings you barely understand, and they tell you that eveyone feels that and to get over it. They aren't doing what's best for you. They are doing what they think is best for them. If youe child asks for help, for the love of whatever god you believe in, fucking help them. If you want any chance of ever being connected to them after they move out, help them. If it seems like they are cold and distant, it's because they don't want to be around you. And if you think that part of them respecting you is being afraid of you, you are in fact a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to have that child. You are there to help them learn to be a person. Children and teenagers are learning to be people. They learn from example, and if you don't value their well-being and happiness above things like grades or chores, then they are going to value progress and their job more than you. Because you taught them that the only things that matters are results and success. Your child learns from you, if you are angry all the time and constantly have outbursts, that kid os going to grow up thinking that anger is the solution to most problems. And trust me, that it takes a long time to relearn how to process emotions. I'm lucky, some people aren't. I have a loving boyfriend that will sit through those outbursts of anger and the enviable self hatred that comes afterwards.

 Stop fucking up your children."

I’m currently taking Data Structures and Algorithms where I have a 100 average, but any faith I have from my experience there is squandered by the LeetCode/OA cycle that I’m consistently subpar in.

And unfortunately, LeetCode is what pays the bills, not class.

I don’t have any interviews yet after 100 applications. After 3 months of LeetCode, I can’t solve a Medium independently ever, I always require at least a 1 line hint to flesh out a solution myself. I almost never complete an OA without looking for some help online on strategy first, and when I am fully capable of completing an OA, it’s because it was easy enough for an idiot like me to do and the company is less likely to interview me since an oversupply of competing applicants passed their test cases as well (banking / insurance).

I sometimes find practice coding questions from company specific questions and continue to get bamboozled by them when I try to simulate Hackerrank environments.

I feel like everyone else’s job prospects far exceed mine and I can’t seem to catch up to where I should be as a hopeful SWE. I just fail and the next 3 years of my career are in jeopardy if I don’t make an internship this summer. I have highly repetitive feelings of worthlessness and self hate due to my incompetency and do consider killing myself often."

I then took an extra 5th year to complete a computer science minor. For context, I completed CSC 108,148,165,207,236,263,343,373,463.

I will be graduating November 2022 (this Monday actually). But I feel like my career trajectory is screwed up due to my lack of internship experience.

I have only two job experiences on my resume. I have been working at a library part-time, and I have 8 months of TA experience in the math department where I TA'd two third-year math courses.

I'm trying to apply to new graduate roles but I've had very little luck so far. Only 1 consulting firm contacted me and I actually made it past the first 4 stages (phone interview, online coding assessment, behavioural interview, technical interview) before they rejected me with an automated email.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I imagine there must be other CS students who did a specialist/major/minor who is also struggling.

And to top it all off, we might be entering a recession or economic slowdown. Some tech companies have also begun hiring freezes.

And soon I won't even be considered a 'new grad' anymore. 

It just feels hopeless. I wish I just pursued CS from the beginning of my undergrad, and did internships and stuff."

Is this good enough, or do I need more impressive projects? Also, are the ""little"" projects I mentioned relevant to mention on a resume or something?

However, I wanted to speak to my job-seeking experience for those that are looking/struggling right now.

First off, some stats about me:

* 3 Internships during my undergrad, 2 data analyst, 1 web dev. I worked at one massive defense contractor, one agriculture coop, and a software contracting company. No FAANG internships
* I graduated with a B.S. in Comp Sci in May 2021
* I continued into a master's program in comp sci at the same school, working a research job
* Edit: I also have a couple of projects:
   * Built and am upgrading a home server for crypto mining and data hoarding
   * Am building a guitar pedal with a computer engineering friend
   * Made a webpage and am hosting a version on my server and another version on Azure
      * made it look like windows xp to make it fun
* Hated the research job, started job seeking in May 2022
* Sent out about 220 applications (I know, less than I should have)
* I live in the midwest, applied for primarily remote positions or positions within 3 hours of where I live.
* Got a job in September 2022

I started applying through LinkedIn postings, some on Indeed, and some through Handshake (University jobsite partnership). I got to a final round interview with a large tech company from the city I'm living in, got ghosted and couldn't get in contact with them. Another larger company in the area denied me after a final round interview, and I was having trouble getting more interviews. I was going on 3 months of job searching and was feeling really disappointed and honestly upset with myself, I felt so stupid about how confident I was that I'd be drowning in job offers (not literally, but I thought it'd take like a month or 1.5 months). It was getting really rough until things just fell into place. Some company reached out to me (I think they found my profile on a recruiting board or something, idk) and I had a couple of interviews with them. I found a listing for a hiring fair another company was having, attended that, and interviewed with someone. Then, my roommate mentioned a tiny company he'd heard about during an internship a couple of years ago and I reached out to them. I ended up getting offers from all three and I went with the third one that's a tiny defense tech startup. They ended up blowing those other companies out of the water:

* Fully remote
* higher pay than the other offers
* more vacation days
* focus on work/life balance
* stock disbursement plan soon
* I can dip out for classes during the day

I don't mean to brag about how fortunate I am, I just wanted to share these lessons i learned:

* I did some leetcode, but I def wasn't grinding. Most companies have normal technical interviews that you should be able to solve without grinding leetcode. You'd be better served spending that time filling out applications if you're willing to look outside of massive tech companies.
* You've got ""nothing"" until you've got something. It seems like you're making no progress until you actually have an offer. Don't get discouraged, try different approaches to getting in contact with recruiters.
* A couple of the interviews I got were because I had a list of recruiters that came to university events. I then sent them all emails that went something like ""Hey there! if I recall correctly, I think we met at the career fair 2 years ago..."" and I had a great response rate on that. If you can, get your hands on that kind of list or build one up with others in your program.
* It very much ***is*** about who you know. Even being able to namedrop a connection through the university or something can earn you a lot of favor with recruiters and help you stand out. I'm a stubborn person and wanted to believe that my abilities would be able to make up for a lack of networking, but it is definitely an undervalued skill in the CS world.

I'm sure there's other things I'm forgetting about so feel free to ask questions. I don't have nearly as much experience in the industry as many people here, but I do have very recent job searching experience as a new grad. Best of luck in your searching!

If you want details about my position, here you go:

* Small defense tech startup in the midwest
* Fully Remote
* Title: Software Engineer
* Total Comp: \~$70,000 with stock disbursement rolling out next quarter"

S**t ( and she pretty much was)  however i didnt had any trains to leave home since The weekend was comming and i've let him know however he just raged and went to sleep and în The morning he was fking passionatly huging her like near me while i was sleeping (very near)  since i saw he didn't listen to me at all i've decide to play loud some rock music and not to leave as I had planed at 10 am(we were living on a colege campus but on weekend we went home) and stayed until 1 pm after that i left and when i have reached home he called me to apologize since The girl dumpted his ass and he was wrong again ( but since IT was not The first time neither The last i've decided that i just dont care any longer), regarding if i had a gf i did have one longer relation but she cheated me with 2 guys, and after that i just had short relationship, when i was în colege i was pretty much by my self since my parents werent that good on financiar side so i was working a part time job + studies for The college (The tuition was paid by The state în a tuition program for who got into top 40 i think for my profile) + a period that i had to do an internship and that left me with about 4 hours of sleep but i still managed to finish with a bit above average to The college aline without any extra hours or help. After i finished The college covid hit and i was working at an IT firm and since i was also în a mild depression but i've ignored IT however usualy i looked down on my șelf and i allways said that people overestimate me, sometimes i had some thoughts of șelf harm however i didnt act on them and i still dont find my șelf to do that, felt a lack of energy, I was isolating my șelf since i felt like noone Will help me since my parrents can't ( they both work and have also my 5 year old brother to Take care off, and i dont want to stres them about me),however  this year things have going ok but not for my depression since everything is becoming more worse and besides that i tried to fix that by trying to get a drivers license however failing bad multiple times and not beeing  condescending about my failiure just pointing that usualy i did much better at college or about anything, now IT seems i cant do this and when i ask for help regarding The drivers license its generaly The answers like theres nothing much that i ca-n help or you ca-n do IT your șelf like you did în college or if this Guy did IT from The first try and you are better than him you should succes or stuff like that and that made me feel even worse and i just felt lethargic, and my depression simptom got even worse The thoughts of șelf harm came back, however i didnt act în them

S-o reddit what shall i do on whom shall i rely and how to get rid of this depression since i fear that i might act on IT since i feel all alone since I'm afraid to ask for help from my family with The depression( IT usualy treated în my country more like a state of beeing and not a mental disease and its hard to tell that i had some șelf harm thoughts)  and my family îs very nice and sweet but im afraid of how they Will see me afterwards

Would appreciate any insights on the differences between working at these companies.

Roblox (San Mateo)  
\- pays more but this isn't a huge concern  
\- I'm more interested in Roblox's product, I wanted to be a part of a company that has a creative mission  
\- lower cost of living in San Mateo but I would still rather live in SF  
\- seems to have a great culture  
\- not sure about stability of company in long term?

Databricks (SF)  
\- location is better, I also can't drive so am looking to live post-grad somewhere commutable  
\- product is more technical  
\- culture seems like people work hard there but the projects will be really impactful  
\- the interview process was really hard, I felt like I was challenged a lot but the engineers were always supportive and helpful  
\- the company is growing super fast and has even more potential for growth  


I'm also interviewing with Palantir and am not sure if I should keep interviewing with them? Databricks gave me a super short deadline of only one week so I need to decide quickly. Would appreciate any insights, thanks so much!

yll5x3,27,2022-11-03,How do I find direction in life in my thirties after falling off my career path in my 20s?,GalcomMadwell,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yll5x3/how_do_i_find_direction_in_life_in_my_thirties/," 

I went to art school, and graduated in 2010 with a degree in Interactive Development and Game Design. I managed to land myself an internship at a startup game developer, which turned into a full-time job as a junior game designer. I started at $55k.

After a while, I decided (unwisely, in retrospect) to quit my entry-level job and try to pursue a career as a freelance game developer. This was back when indie games were really taking off, and I thought maybe I could do it too.

At first, things went well. I got a contract job as an artist for a game company, which allowed me the freedom to work from home and work on developing my own game in my spare time.

Things started going badly after that. I realized I was dealing with major depression and social anxiety, and began drinking more heavily. I continued working on my contract job, but my attempts to develop my own game went nowhere.

Eventually it got to the point where I felt lost. I tried going out for some interviews to get back into a game studio but they didn't go well. Truth be told, I gave up fairly easily and fell back on my contract job to make ends meet.

Eventually, though, the contract ended and I was unable to replace the work. I was forced to start picking up odd jobs, which was a big blow to my ego and self esteem. I worked at a supermarket and as a concierge and as a dog walker. This went on for years until I had more or less given up on my game development / game artist career.

Things got worse before they got better. I fell deeper into depression and alcohol. I eventually found some work as a graphic designer and more odd jobs as an artist. I also moved to a state with a much lower cost of living. I was able to scrape by on about $2,000 / $2,500 a month.

I kept trying to figure out a way to get back on a proper career path, but I feel like I keep fizzling out before I can focus on any path long enough to make meaningful progress. 2D Art, graphic design, game design, animation, other random skillsets - never really going deep enough to become competitive or hire-able in whichever niche.

Then I got a random windfall a little over a year ago. I made a $2,000 crypto investment back in 2017 and thought I had been locked out of it do to some mistake I made, and was unable to recover my account. Fortunately they changed their account recovery backend and years later I was able to recover my investment. ""Overnight"" I made $65,000. This was right before crypto crashed in December 2021.

I tried to do my best with it, and took most of it out and put it into savings and Betterment. I unfortunately left some of it in crypto and painfully watched the value collapse. I used some of it to pay off the rest of my car and some of it for some unexpected vet bills for my dog which amounted to $4,000.

Now I'm left with around $21,000, zero debt, and a fully paid off car. I have been scraping together ever dollar I can and save / invest about $400 / month.

However, I still have zero idea what the fuck I'm doing with my career. I have a part time job that pay surprisingly well, but it is little more than a stop gap measure. Occasionally I'll do design jobs or art jobs for random amounts of money $50 here, $75 there, but it is inconsistent and infrequent.

I'm not sure how to translate the photoshop, illustration, and design skills I have back into a full-time job. So much time has passed, so much regret and shame has built up around my feelings of failure, I don't know how to shake it and get a clear direction for my future.

Sometimes I think I should totally start over and try to pursue a more lucrative career by pulling a name out of a hat, like data analysis or sales. However it feels foolish to abandon the skills and experience that I've already built up for something brand new.

Does anyone here have advice on getting my shit together ""late' in life? Has anyone else dealt with losing their way in their late twenties / early thirties, and how they found a way forward? I don't want to make a ton of money, I just want to have a respectable job that gives my life a sense of direction and purpose.

Thank you in advance for any help and advice."

With school and the internship I really don't have time to do courses and learn ML, but I feel that I want to go that way, but I don't want to loose other opportunities of work experience either. I can't really find ML internships where I live (Mexico).

Had a 4 mo cybersecurity internship, I then started as a cybersecurity analyst officially in mid august, was offered 60k.

I felt like i couldnt negotiate since i had intense imposter syndrome and just wanted my foot in the door so i accepted.

Im a few months into my role and i feel overworked and underpaid.

**Some background info**

- I live in NY (not NYC)
- Bachelors degree in cyber/information science

**Roles/duties :**

- Handle all security training, design and launch phishing campaigns + data analysis for stakeholder reports  on both quarterly

- manage 2 security monitoring platforms and perform all incident response

- handling app deployments and updates globally for vulnerability management 

- perform all legal and compliance investigations as needed

- handle 100-300 IT tickets per month in between meetings and security alerts

- create and implement plans to increase security posture through additional controls

- manage the cybersecurity site

- provide metrics on threat levels and volume on a monthly basis

overall I pretty much handle,well, everything on the security awareness, security operations, incident response, and vuln. Mgmt side.

I feel like i have very little support, even though my shifts are 8 hrs, i find myself glued to my phone &amp; PC since every hour alerts come in as well as security tickets.

I probably work 50 hrs a week since every night i end up addressing alerts or working on other tasks just to meet deadlines.

There’s no person covering alerts or anything else in other time zones so i frequently wake up to a flood of alerts every morning.

I feel like based on my workload, i should be getting paid more (as well as knowing for sure that 2 people in security is not appropriate for a company this size)

Did i screw myself over by not negotiating in the beginning? I dont know when i should ask for a raise, or if its unreasonable to get at least 75 around the one year mark.

I have been subtly pushing to my boss that another security person must be hired because this is not sustainable for 2 people (there might as well just be me though) to manage this.

I love it somedays and others i want to rip my hair out because i know deep down i (probably?) should be being paid more and I definitely need more support.

Feel like i need at least 6 months FT experience in the role to leave, but am trying for a year minimum.  I would actually really like to stay if i was compensated a bit better and if there was even just 1 more person to help manage things.

Based on the above, would this be considered truly underpaid/overworked?"

I was doing what was expected out of me. I was attending college and my internships. Ever since my therapist and I have started doing tests about my diagnosis (august) things have gotten worse. And they just keep getting worse. 

I've skipped college so much my attendance is below the minimum requirements. I've started turning in my work late. I'm waaayyyyy behind in my thesis submission than what can be excused. My semester ends this month. I still have about 4-5 submissions to make before I start studying for exams. I can't skip anymore college or I'll fail.

I just don't know how to handle this mess anymore. I'm the only one who dragged herself into this but god it feels so much and I just want to run away from all of it. I haven't started my meds for adhd, but might start this week given however I figure out the appointment with my psychiatrist.

I just want all this to be over. I really try and be better but it just feels like I can't and there's this quicksand thing I'm sinking into. 

Did any of you suffer this way after your diagnosis?"

At this point, I'd like to move from an individual contributor to a managerial role. I talked to my manager about it and they said ""just be good at your current role"", and ""we will check"" to see how we can move you up a couple of months ago. Not sure how many times I've heard this in the past, only to be ultimately left hanging. Not saying that I will have the same outcomes as my previous managers who told me the exact same thing, but probably I have a tough time trusting these lines anymore without any immediate action/progress to my goals.

Now I'm thinking to message one of the company's exec who appears to be approachable (I've exchanged some emails with them when I was completing a project), to see their perspective as they have more influence. For context, the exec is 2-3 lines higher than my manager. Maybe somewhere along the lines of - to ask if they offer a ""leadership rotational program"" or plan to offer one in the future, or an internship to an open role where I can move up to a role with more influence. Will it do bad more than good for me in this scenario? Any peeps who had done the same and had quite some success rate?"

currently i am in the industrial HR field, specifically recruitment po. reason being, madali lang talaga makakakuha ng job at promising yung salary sa industrial world. usually kasi if u want a job as a counselor/life coach you will need the Master's degree for it. hence i've been doing HR work para i can send myself to school. i honestly hate the industrial field because most of the time inuutusan ka lang ng boss mo, it takes a looot of time and effort (and perhaps resignations) to climb up the corporate ladder. plus these days anyone can be HR, di na kailangan yung knowledge ng psychology or whatsoever to enter this field.

right now, i feel really down in the dumps kasi my grad school has certain demands that would often contest my HR work's schedule such as a future clinical internship worth 300 hours, face to face classes on weekends vs company events. palaging natotorn ako...it's like destiny is making me choose between the two parang ang hirap ng pagsabayin ang dalawa. 

as much as i want to resign now, i couldn't kasi the company is providing me a laptop i can use for both work and personal (so nagagamit ko sya for online classes), HMO for me and my parents, and a very competitive pay na parang hindi ko pa makikita sa entry level clinical or academic jobs given my zero experience and the limited opportunities. i need the money more than ever so i can continue doing my grad school while providing for my family in this worsening economy.

any advice on how i should handle this dilemma? i tried opening up to several people in my circle pero parang hindi nila gets yung dilemma ko 😔"

I am a third year computer science major, and I wanted to know which experience you guys think would be better. (I think Capital One pays a bit more but I care more about experience/resume value).

About location:

Accenture is in Atlanta, which is where I am local.

Capital One I can get approved for Atlanta, but their larger locations are in Dallas and Richmond.

**Question Two:** Is there an advantage to working in Richmond over Atlanta in terms of the internship experience (since Richmond is larger for Capital One, or would it essentially be the same)?

BNY Mellon is $38.46/hr for 10 weeks in Pittsburgh, PA

Progressive Insurance is $24/hr for 12 weeks and is remote

I don't live in Pittsburgh, so I would have to pay for housing, food, gas, etc. if I go with BNY Mellon, but with Progressive I could work from home, so I think it would probably be a similar amount of money in the end (let me know if my thinking here is incorrect). 

I'm also not sure which internship would have more interesting work. I know someone who interned at BNY Mellon, and he said he basically just wrote JUnit tests all summer which doesn't sound that appealing. He did mention that other interns got put on more interesting projects though. I also like the idea of being in person. At the Progressive info session, they said their interns get assigned to a project and then a side project of their choosing, so it sounds like it might be more engaging?

Has anyone interned at either of these two companies for SWE? Any other factors that I should be considering? Any insight is appreciated!

Here's my first situation: I am from a country where universities frequently have a first year training only in English (called a ""prepatory year""). Because of this, although I entered university in 2019, I was able to start my freshman year only in 2020. Also, in my university you can choose a second major at the end of first year, and the start of second year. And when you choose a second major, because of the very heavy courseload, your undergraduate studies necessarily extend for an extra year. This also forces me to graduate in 2025. 

Here's my second situation: I will go to the US this January for an exchange semester. I have a J-1 visa, and with Post Completion Academic Training option for J-1 visas, I will be able to work off-campus in a job relating to my degree. Because of this I hope to do a software engineering internship at a tech company.

Here's my first question:

\- Can lying in my application regarding my graduation date backfire in any way? Most companies are looking for interns that will graduate in 2024 and when I apply saying that I will graduate in 2025, I feel like I'm immediately eliminated. I have already got responses from several companies pointing this out: they told that they were sadly looking for 2024 graduates. I like to think for my own sake: if I simply lie in my application saying that I will graduate in 2024, I might be able to do an internship without anyone figuring out. And when the time they realize after my internship comes, I will simply have already done my internship. Can this backfire in any way?

Here's my second question:

\- Companies also ask questions in their application forms such as: ""Do you need, or will you need in the future, any immigration-related  support or sponsorship from &lt;company&gt; in order to begin or continue  employment with &lt;company&gt;?"" Does work permit through J-1 visa Academic Training count towards this, so I can say that ""I do not require""; or, because they also mention ""in the future"", will I have to concede that I will require in a case of further of full-time employment? If I say that ""I do not require"" (again thinking for my own sake, and thinking with the Academic Training option in mind), will this backfire in any way whatsoever?

Thanks for your help."

I still find it hard to live “normal” and not be depressed internally but smile and make sure no one around me is feeling bad or worse.

Talking to friends and family when they can helps but people have their own stuff going on too so it’s in my best interest to not take it personally and find professional help…..but I can’t find anyone to help with therapy and I’m run around the endless track when seeking appointments even with referrals and insurance.

Shit just sucks sometimes and it’s been taking no days off the last few. Cousin just died, another even closer cousin probably has terminal liver cancer and still drinking, and I can’t even tell my mom what happened last week because idk if she still has the strength to hear it at 70.

Would be nice to have a therapist to discuss things with and maybe point me in the right direction.


I have been calling the hospitals, hotlines, and  centers in the city around me 
(NYC) for months trying to find help or someone to talk to….

and they either don’t take my insurance or are out of business or simply don’t pick up the phone/ return any messages that you leave…….some have even picked up the phone and immediately hung up because I am assuming that the phone is ringing off the hook because a lot of people are suffering right now and trying like me.

Even after the incident, the psychiatrist inside the hospital that saved my life told my gf she would ensure me an appt because she told her about my searching for help.

I called and the psychiatric center inside the hospital said they needed an official referral because my mangled wrist isn’t going to cut it!

…so today I get one from the plastic surgeon that is trying to save my hand from surgery.

Called the clinic with the referral thinking finally I’m going to at least get an appt to get screened and hopefully some help.

Only to be told that now the medical director has to review the referral and will either approve or deny my appt in a couple weeks.

How can life possibly find a way in this bs “healthcare system”?!

I plan to invest my time to prevent people like me reaching dangerous levels of “fuck it all” but I need to get help myself first and it’s criminal how bad mental health is being underserved across the world, not just in my country.

Any advice or suggestions are appreciated and thank you for reading this far."
ymffsk,5,2022-11-04,"Fear of clients dropping, incompetence",Crunch1020,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/ymffsk/fear_of_clients_dropping_incompetence/,"Hi all, I (28F) am an intern therapist working in perinatal mental health. I love learning about therapy and finally having the chance to practice. I am also passionate about maternal mental health. In many ways, internship has really been testing my edges and been an awesome learning experience. I love my supervisors, peers, and working with new and expecting moms. In certain ways it's also been really challenging and anxiety-provoking. I have gotten the feedback I'm a very relational, calming presence from both supervisors and others in general, and that I can also sound unsure and passive. I'm working on finding more directness in my voice and presence, and refining my clinical skills as I continue to learn. I know I won't be a fit for everyone, but as I go on in internship I'm noticing an increased anxiety over clients dropping out.

I'm finding I'm experiencing insecurity/ intense anxiety around clients dropping out- this has happened a few times, and it's been hard not to internalize. I think maybe it relates deeper to an insecurity I have as a new therapist, and maybe a general lack of confidence in myself.

Two folks after a couple of sessions have named they want a therapist who has children, which I understand. That's their preference, and that feels out of my control.

 One client I worked with for a few sessions had worked with another intern before me, and she emailed me a few minutes before our next session saying that she appreciated us trying to work together but she has decided to stop therapy at this time. Last session we touched on some sensitive content she said she hadn't talked about before, and I thought maybe that could have contributed to her leaving. 

Another client was very young, had never been to therapy before, and was very shy. We worked a lot on building rapport but it felt difficult getting traction. She ended up cancelling her next appointment and never responding to further communication. 

I just had an intake with a client who had a previous intern. At the end, I noted that this was a process of us getting to know each other that could take a few sessions, and that she is of course welcome to explore other therapists if she feels someone else might be a good fit. I also noted that I'm open to feedback and co-create a therapeutic space that feels the most supportive for her. We had explored goals and what she's liked/disliked in previous therapy. She said she feels like it went well, and that she's open to trying a couple of sessions out. Then she asked if there are any other interns as well. I took this as maybe she wasn't interested in working with me, although I felt the session went well.

One piece to note with these experiences is that there are other interns at my site, and I do feel if these clients just wanted someone else, they would have asked to see a different intern. Instead, they've either just dropped out of therapy completely or found a clinician that has children.

I'm trying not to, but am definitely internalizing these experiences. I am trying to have compassion with myself, but my critical/anxious voice is coming on and absolutely taking the reigns. This is contributing to my feeling even more insecure, which I wouldn't want to contribute to the way I show up in session. I can already be pretty passive as a person, and I think exhibiting *more* insecurity would create a scenario where clients sense distrust in the person who's actually supposed to be helping. 

Any tips on working with these anxieties? I find that as internship continues, I've become more hypersensitive to my retention rate and more questioning of my ability. It's making me more disillusioned with therapy and grow more unconfident with my ability to actually *do* this, even though I do really love it."

I’d like some help making a decision between these offers for next summer’s internship. I’m extremely grateful for these offers, but looking for some insight. I’m a junior right now, so I’m considering these company’s full-time value (but I don't know too much about this). I was in the Bay Area last summer, so hoping to live in NY or Seattle.

**Datadog:**

NY

$52/hr + 6k housing stipend

Pros: lunch MWF, everyone I know who’s worked there *really* enjoys it, strong intern and new grad program, high return to full time rate, nice NY office

Cons: I don’t know much about the name value (I haven’t heard of it until this recruiting cycle)

**Atlassian:**

Remote (I can choose to go into any office)

$54/hr (SF), $49/hr (NY) + 3k stipend

Pros: I’ve used their product before and like it enough, know their name value, heard about great culture, lunch daily

Cons: The remote situation; worried that most people won’t go into office when I’m looking for an in person experience, less comp, a little more of a coasting company

**Asana:**

SF

$65/hr + 1.5k stipend

Pros: I’m most passionate about their product, breakfast + lunch daily, heard there’s decent culture, could potentially move to NY office for new grad (but not sure abt this)

Cons: not in NY

Thank you! any input is appreciated!

ymghg0,0,2022-11-04,"Company asks me to relocate after 3 interviews when I was led to believe the job was remote from anywhere in the US, is this fishy?",notyouraveragemoe22,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ymghg0/company_asks_me_to_relocate_after_3_interviews/,"I’m (23 F) an upcoming college grad with a Finance degree, so I may be a bit naive honestly. I’m from the DC area. I have 3 other offers and I’m still interviewing for a couple of other roles. I was interested in this rotational program because would give me experience in finance functions like forecasting and accounting (cost accounting, tax), as well as other areas within their finance department which the other positions didn’t directly offer all in one. 

In the initial phone interview (as well as what was posted in the original job description) I was told that the position was 100% remote from anywhere in the US and that I would never be asked to relocate. I went ahead and did 2 more interviews with camera on Microsoft Teams.

The second interview went well. This guy lives in Colorado and has been with the company for over 20 years. It was a pretty standard behavioral interview and we also discussed my previous internship experiences. We talked about potential projects. I discussed my experience using Power BI in previous internships and he mentioned potential projects relating to forecasting and creating a dashboard for the team. Towards the end, he wished me luck with my next interview and mentioned that I would be interviewing with one more guy who works in sales finance and he would have a different perspective. 

This is where it gets a little fishy. This guy lives in Georgia. My resume isn’t really that impressive compared to my friends and colleagues. I had a 3.7 gpa pursuing a finance degree. One internship I spent the majority of my time creating a Power BI report independently working with big data (not necessarily financial) and the second internship was accounting and finance based. However the guy really praised me a lot, giving a lot of compliments and later mentioned how he would recommend me and basically hinting he would get me the job. Obviously I was excited, but I’ve never had someone give continuous compliments and praise in an interview it seemed weird. 

The next day they ask if I can relocate to Georgia closer to the person who I interviewed with in the third interview. But they said the position would still be remote. They just want me to be able to attend social events on a quarterly basis? Which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. 

Also, not everyone is in Georgia. Only a few people on the team would be local to Georgia. Not to mention on the corporate level the entire company is working remotely.

Is this fishy or am I over thinking? 

We had a phone call today and I mentioned after receiving my official offer that I’m not sure I can make the commitment to relocate and the recruiter said he would reach out to the finance leadership team and see what they say. I’m not sure where to go from there once hearing back, but I’m also waiting on more offers from other positions I’m interviewing with.

What do you all think?"
ymhryc,1,2022-11-04,I'm just so overwhelmed right now.,JustExisting12,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ymhryc/im_just_so_overwhelmed_right_now/,"On the work side of things: I am currently a college student living at home with a 20 hour a week job. The classes alone (Calc iii, Discrete Math, Engineering stats, and A Comp Sci class) are a lot. My job is a programming internship that I am going to quit at the end of the semester. It comes out to over 60 hours a week of mentally intensive work. My job is actually the part that stresses me out the most. I work from home and have part time hours, but I will get sent messages at random times, once I was sent a message as late as 10 PM. I'm also being underpaid for my work.

On the romance side of things: I'm gay, I met a guy whose bi about a year ago and he stopped messaging me a few months ago. He actually stopped messaging all of his friends as far as I can tell. I developed feelings for him but never expressed them to him. I managed to find his twitter and it tuns out that he has somehow become a little homophobic over the few months that he stopped messaging me. It's never explicitly hate, and its hard to describe without showing exact tweets, but its stuff like tweeting ""Go woke go broke"" when Velma was revealed to be gay, or stuff like ""The states should be allowed to decide marriage"" when we both live in a very conservative and religious state. To add onto that my parents are part of that religious conservative bunch but they don't know I'm gay so it doesn't really matter.

A third thing: I contacted my school's counseling center about depression, I had an intake session, which is an assessment. They said they would e-mail me, and they never did. I have some pretty bad social/confrontation anxiety so I get anxious about calling them back and its been almost 2 months since the intake session.

On the social end of things: I actually do have pretty good friends who are there for me. But there is this mental block that keeps me from reaching out to them.

Needless to say, all of this makes me feel like shit. I don't know what to do. I don't even know where to start. Maybe someone who's not in my current mental state can see something I'm not. I just don't know what to do. I don't even know if I'm not a danger to myself anymore."

In this post, I will be telling you how I broke into tech. For context, I went from failing every single Online Assessment to getting offers from multiple medium - big tech companies including FAANG and multiple social media companies (non-FAANG) in a year. While I believe everyone's journey in tech is very different, I do think if someone gets the basics right and works hard enough they can break into tech, and here I will try to summarize all the resources and tips I used to achieve what I wanted to. I gave a friend these tips and he used them to get his dream internship and that too in a recession ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**A bit of background:** I go to a T5 CS school but I am an international student so while I did have some advantages, I had a lot of disadvantages during my job search. Small companies wouldn't hire me so I could not get much experience and big companies wouldn't hire me because I did not have much experience. Breaking this cycle was very very challenging.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started college in the Fall of 2019 as an ECE major but switched to CS before the end of the school year. I took the Data Structures class in the Fall of 2020 and the Algorithms class in the Spring of 2021. While my grades in school were amazing, I struggled with a lot of school assignments and barely made an A. I knew the theory but I barely understood how to apply Data Structures and Algorithms to technical questions and, this ultimately translated into poor interview performance and no internships for two consecutive summers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What changed:** During the summer of 2021, while all my friends were already working at their SWE internships, I did a minimum wage part-time job at my school and spent the rest of the time mainly on leetcode. I started with a pace of 3 questions a day and went up to 10 questions a day. The number of questions depended on the topic I was doing. I am not a genius by any means, and it takes me quite a bit of time to understand a lot of these concepts but I was willing to spend that time. Initially, the easy questions, like valid parenthesis, took me more than 3 hours to understand but it has gotten a lot better and I am currently at more than 600 questions with about 150 easy questions, 370 medium questions, and 80 easy questions. I also did some mock interviews with a friend (he is such a GOAT) so I could get constructive feedback which I could use to improve myself. I took a light course load in the Fall 2021 semester and focused on leetcode and recruiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how you could get started with leetcode and achieve a similar result:

1. Learn the very basics of Data Structures. This ([https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/)) seems like a great place to start.
2. As soon as you learn your first Data Structure, do leetcode for that topic and continue learning other data structures.
3. In the interest of time, you can look up the solution after 1 hour of trying.
4. After you do one question do similar questions. Try to draw connections between these questions and apply the concept you just learned.
5. Don't lose hope, leetcode is hard for everyone.
6. Repeat and keep doing it until you understand the data structures well.

**Here are some lists of questions that I think are good**:

1. [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice)
2. [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all\\\_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none)
3. [https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)

&amp;#x200B;

I did not follow any list when I started. I first did all the topics and once I started getting interviews I did tag questions for the company which enables me to do so many questions. I am not sure if these lists contain the same questions but they do seem to contain some of the best leetcode questions. Go in the following order while completing questions in these lists:

1. Blind 75
2. neetcode 150
3. grind 75
4. sean prashad

Once you finish these lists, do as many questions on leetcode as you can. Try doing at least medium difficulty. As I said above, it is okay to look up solutions as long as you understand why the solution works. I would suggest making a leetcode account so all the progress is in one place. You can also use lintcode to access leetcode premium questions. Some of the best solutions I found on leetcode were in the discuss section (sort by most votes for best results). While I did throw a lot of information here, I understand going through hundreds of questions is not possible for everyone but I highly recommend following the lists I mentioned above. I also suggest joining this([https://cscareers.dev](https://discord.gg/Yh579zeU)) discord server if you are recruiting for an internship / new grad job. One more thing, ask people for referrals either from your friends or people on LinkedIn. Maybe it becomes the reason you get your dream job. Please be kind to yourself and the people around you :)

&amp;#x200B;

If this post gets enough upvotes, I will update it with interview tips.

EDIT: the amount of leetcode questions I did were excessive. No one needs to do it. Do the ones mentioned in the lists above really well and you wont need to do more."

I’m a social worker and I have my C. I previously worked with children with developmental disabilities, where a did some modified therapy, and I did therapy in my internships and a few part time positions. I was always wary of CMH because of the caseload and high burnout, but I really wanted to be in a place where I could learn before I venture  toward a group or private practice. It makes me sad how everyone there accepts how broken the system is and that we just don’t have any time for ourselves (or is acceptance the key to making it work?). My caseload is around 60 and I’ve been told it will get busier soon. I’m about two months in and I’m already seeing about 7-8/day with about 10-11 booked. I was told it would take about six months to get to that point. There’s also a big emphasis on productivity. You’re expected to have 25 units per week and a 45 min session is 0.75 units. I’ve expressed my concerns and two people have already told me: “you know, you don’t have to work in this environment”. I’m typically super hard on myself so comments like that are making me question if I’m cut out for this. I also have my own lived mental health challenges and I need to balance wanting to learn and grow with taking care of myself. I already have some really great clients and I don’t want to abandon them so early on. I generally stay at jobs for several years so the idea of just quitting so soon doesn’t even seem like an option. In order to grow and learn should I just adapt my life so I can manage this? I will say I have a very supportive supervisor, but she is direct in saying that it’s going to get busier. Being a therapist makes me realize how much work I still need to do on myself, as I am a pretty sensitive person and very hard on myself. I already need to work at least a few hours on the weekend to catch up. Thanks for your understanding, comments, advice."

okay so for cca, currently i've been offered a place in science research but i'm not sure if i really want to spend the whole year including my holidays to do research (cuz i also want to go overseas for holiday XD but i dont mind skipping) i really like the research aspect of science but the high commitment level is making me think twice. 

not only that, i have a goal to get into local med in uni and feel a need to do volunteering projects or whatever during the hols to build my portfolio, which i feel is better to start earlier than scramble for opportunities like internships after a-levels and end up taking a gap year

i've heard that jc cca is not very important but i feel that it would be better to at least do something than not do anything at all. but i must ask if doing research without any accomplishments (winning competitions etc.) increases my chance of getting into med in any way as compared to leadership positions/volunteering opportunities offered by other ccas 

for subj combi, as i scored pretty decently for eoys, im thinking of taking 4h2 but im scared that i won't be able to cope and end up doing super badly ;-; what should i do?

also econs or geog? i've already decided on bio chem &amp; math (all h2) but im not sure which humans to take as both are equally uninteresting to me 😭 and i've heard that econs is easier to score? and better for applying to uni courses unrelated to geog like accountancy which i may consider, is this true?

Is this going to be an actual interview? How should I prepare for something like this? In the JD the salary range says $85K - $150K. Do I negotiate to the higher or lower end considering I am already well aware of their needs and there will not be a learning curve period in terms of the company specific stuff. 

The work I am doing mostly involves development in Python, queries in druid, integrating APIs, Linux server deployments, Splunk querying, debugging, etc.

Also, I started this job 1.5 year ago with no professional experience (no internship) so I have little experience with the interview/negotiation process, and I live in a high cost of living area as side notes.

Im a Computer Engineering major, not looking to get into software dev, but figured the fields are similar and tbh dont know if CE has an active and helpful community like this one so figured Id give it a shot since the fields are adjacent.

I just got admitted into the grad school at my current school for a MS in CE, and am sitting at a 3.54 GPA. As far as experience I have an app I developed and also am in the process of technical interviews at several places for 2023 summer internships. My goal is to get into industry immediately after I graduate.

This being said, my whole life GPA and giving it everything youve got has been the idea everyone pushed, but I find my self regularly having that one assignment that I could do for 3 hours and take a 70% or lose my weekend to get the 100, and ive always went for the 100. Its starting to get draining not having any time to relax.

I guess I just wanted to confirm what my logic was BEFORE potentially screwing myself over. I want to know, from people whove gone through the career development/beginning processes if Ill be ok to take a hit here and there to my GPA for the sake of not burning out. I can push through, but I increasingly find it hard to justify, but I don’t believe I know enough at all about CS/CE to make the call that Id be ok being at smth like a 3.2-3.3.

My parents were broke and always working, hell I barely got to see them at times. So I got my own job when I was a kid just to be able to feed myself cuz my parents couldn't always do it. I'd get up at 5am and walk to the golf course nearby where I was a caddy for old white guys paying 3/4ths of a million a year to play golf while I worked on tips. 

   Since then I worked rediculous jobs while juggling school, ranging from food service, retail, and random odd under the table work painting houses, decking, ect. I barely passed high school because I didn't do any homework cuz I was working whatever stupid job nights and weekends. When I got out of high school I didn't bother going to college, I worked more. Picked up all the shifts I could get, got myself an internship that led nowhere, and left my parents house as soon as I was able. 

   Over the years Ive been through so many more jobs, more food service and retail, roofing, warehouse and loading dock shit, Im forklift certified and have my OSHA 30, I've been trained in welding and not a single welding company would hire me! I've been injured over and over again breaking my back for scraps and it seems nothing ever goes my way. I never make a decent wage that doesn't leave me struggling to pay the bills, I've been homeless a couple times now and miraculously managed to pull myself out of it both times but I'll ALWAYS be damn close to falling into it again. Living is expensive and it's only gotten way worse. This is all I'll get. I'll always be a working class dog and it seems despite my efforts and my skill, nothing is going to change that. 

   I've got passions and dreams and I work towards them every day but they don't pay the bills so I gotta keep working full time while staying up all night doing the shit I love. I know I've got my whole life ahead of me to achieve everything I want but I already feel so burnt out on this life. It ain't any way to live, it's a nightmare. I've put my work in as it is and it's gotten me nowhere. Part of me wishes I could have my own homestead but I'll never have the money to buy land. And besides, as much as I love that kinda life, my passions require me to stay in the city, and I'd miss the chaos of the night here anyway. Life can be an incredible adventure and I try to allow it to be in every way possible but I feel constantly constricted by a job and a lack of money. I'm gonna be tired and broke for the rest of my life. 

   I know we could make this life and this world a treasure to live in for everyone but I can't help but feel we all are choosing not to. There's a helluva lot more of us than them and these assholes rely on us to keep the scam going. I've always known this a big ass con since day one, it's hard not to see it when you've been exploited forever. My anger towards all this shit has been burning for a long time and the fire grows every day. I've known for many years that I'm an anarchist and thats never going to change as long as we still have to play this rigged ass game. I'll just never understand why we don't just fucking do it. We don't have to live like this at all! Who the hell could possibly want this?? Nobody! Talk to your coworkers! Talk to your fuckin neighbors! Abandon this shit and live free, disregard the banks and the bosses and take it all. We built this shit anyways, it's all ours. Crass had said ""do they owe us a living? Of course they fucking do!"" And they aren't wrong, but I think they owe us the whole fucking world. They took  our world away from all of us and are killing it. they took your time and they took my childhood.

Finished Graduate/Master's in December 2020 in CS. International Student on STEM OPT in US

&amp;#x200B;

Have not had internships during degree as I was rushing to graduate ASAP to start working. Which was a massive mistake as I couldn't find a job as I had no particular specialty in my degree as courses were spread out like one semester: ""Network security then Game Development, then something like Data Analytics and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

During university I sometimes cut corners like find similar projects and get ideas from there or hire tutors online to help me explain some stuff, I was lazy and finding a way to keep feeding my lazy persona and enjoy life.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I had some savings and was eager to join bootcamp for web development and I did well there (Finished September 2021), but then I was applying for jobs for a few months and after several hundred applications I had 2 phone calls and 2 were shut down after they heard about my visa status and this was spring 2021. I had no interview and my motivation and self-belief I can do something with my life and career disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost the spark and belief I can find a job after so many rejections.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have forgotten most stuff I have learned in bootcamp and university as I do not take effort to revise or improve. I cannot solve any leetcode now and I have no clue what to do to get my life on track. I do not know anything, cannot solve leetcode, wasted most of my savings on some bootcamps and apartment rent. I don't even know which direction I should focus in so I can buy appropriate courses or bootcamps.

I am wasting my life and not moving anywhere, living alone, whenever I think of studying I launch videogame to forget about my problems and situation. Incredibly disappointed as people in uni or my job or bootcamp all tell I am a smart kid but seeing what I have become now a lazy person who just games and works and enjoys life and doesn't progress in career anywhere. My visa will be ending in February/March 2024 and I have no clue what to do with my life. I was thinking of signing up to another bootcamp but I cannot afford it (will have to ask parents to help). But bootcamps are overpriced courses which just hold you accountable and trains discipline which I obviously lack.

I am graduating May 2023 with an A.S. in Cybersecurity. I would love to stay home with my son until he is in Kindergarten before going into the workforce (2024/2025). When I graduate, I will have the following:  
CompTIA Sec+ Cisco CCNA, CompTIA A+ and the associates. I will be doing an internship after I graduate for about 6 months at an IT company in my area where I get to bring my son. 

My question is this: 

**To keep my resume current, would it be respectable to not go for my BS, but to gain more certificates in the two years between now and me working?** 

How many should I get in these two years? Which would you recommend? 

The stress of full-college has been a lot, as I am a very young mom and wish to pursue my career without sacrificing my family. I have been interested in gaining AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud certs. Any advice would be super appreciated. I will be renewing my certs when needed, as well! I hope to be a network admin/server admin/etc."

I applied to every FAANG in Europe. Got tonnes of rejections in all sorts of languages but then one got back to me. They gave me the online assessment which I failed miserably. One of the questions had 9/12 test cases work and the second had 0/12. They still asked me to come for the interview. Was given a form saying it would be a few interviews and then they’d decide. Showed up for the interview and the recruiter never came. I emailed them to see what happened and I got an automatic email back from the recruiter saying he was no longer in that position. Then I got an email from another employee who said he quit unceremoniously and left the recruitment process in disarray. She then got me rescheduled for the next week. Went to that interview where the interviewer thanked me for doing the previous two interviews. I was very confused as this was my first interview with them but I went with it. I didn’t want to seem stupid at a FAANG interview. The chat before hand went great. But then the coding. I couldn’t remember Python syntax and had to write a lot of it in pseudo code. It was a mess. I even asked if I could google it and obviously he said no. That interview ended and I was pretty sure that was me doomed. Then I get an email to schedule another call to discuss my results. I was then told at this meeting that I got the internship but due to problems at the branch, the role was no longer available. But since I was eligible for this internship they would try to find me another role elsewhere and I would be given that instead. Is this just the most convoluted  rejection ever?"

\[***TLDR***: Indian Tier 2 College - 8 Backlogs - cleared in 2nd attempt - have relevant skillset + work exp - applied last year - all rejections - severe mental+physical impacts - should I even apply this year? if yes, then which uni and what courses (related to CS)?\]

Background:

Joined UG **VIT CS 2015**\-&gt; first two years got ***8 backlogs*** \- Cleared in consequent sems - graduated with ***7.6/10*** (exponential CGPA growth) - Good coder with relevant projects to justify the skills - Active with NGO and Clubs and chapters- ***3 years of work exp*** in a dream company - 2 Software Engineering internships - Currently ***Senior SE*** in the same company

Issues:

1. \[Sorry, ik very naive, but still....\] *What do you call a backlog*? There are 8 courses that I cleared on my second attempt. Will they still be counted as backlogs?
2. Given my academic record *should I even go for MS*? This whole process has been driving me nuts and it has severely impacted my mental health and thus my physical health.
3. If Yes, then which universities are *accommodating of poor academic records*? I applied for grad schools in US, the previous year as well, but got rejected in all 6 (no reason given). I was very reckless with uni selection
4. Which *branch*? I finalized upon MS in CS but realized its extremely competitive nature, thus trying to focus on a Master's in CS (more industry-oriented) but now I'm having second thoughts on its competitiveness also. I now think about MS in Software Engineering, but again the coursework seems more towards the theoretical side. I am thoroughly confused !!!
5. From the start, I was adamant about pursuing it from the US and didn't even consider any other country. *Is US out of bounds* for me given my academic records? I don't want to pursue research, I just want to get a Master's degree \[from a reputable uni.\] and enter the job market

I've become stagnant in my current job and if not MS then I would very much try for a job change. This process and the dissatisfaction from my work have sucked the life out of me \[didn't leave due to the fear that my manager will mess up with my LOR\]. I don't have anyone to ask for guidance to and thus had to rely upon yocket etc. they further fuelled my self-disgust, as they rarely have success stories for people with 8 backlogs. I've finally stumbled across this subreddit. Any piece of advice would be helpful.

PS: If this isn't the correct platform for these types of posts then please guide me toward the correct subreddits.

So far I’ve booked 22 clients and I’ve “lost” 5. Three of these were clients I met in my first week  (I was just nervous). Especially because my internship was telehealth and I hadn’t done in-office sessions before. I think this set me up to feel worried about losing people. I’m sad to admit that I think up reasons why different clients might not stay... and cancellations make me a little anxious. Clients terminating makes my heart sink for sure.

I didn’t have this issue during my internship at all. Telehealth blocked my social anxiety. I also think working for a non-profit vs being a private practice is really different. I’m not able to take insurance (so clients view me more as a commodity/expense) and I have way more business responsibilities and learning to tackle. Also fewer supports without school supervision &amp; peers. Honestly feeling kind of overwhelmed. 

Any thoughts on client retention anxiety as a new therapist? I worry it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy if I don’t get past it. Thanks all!"

Had a lot of fun, even though it was remote. Learnt a lot and wondering whether I should go back or try something new?

Interests:

Infra/Devops and recently ML Eng(infra specifically)

All pay about the same/ Internship TC doesn't really matter to me,

Also did final rounds with Amazon(which I think went pretty well, solved the LC and aced the LPs) and in the process with Hashicorp(which I like and confident will work out).

M pros:

They really care about their interns + nice perks.

Decent resume value?

Almost guaranteed return offer next summer(so long as I do my shit obviously haha)

M cons:

in Seattle(would rather be in nyc/east coast)

Not sure what team I'll be on --&gt; crapshoot.

STEP pros: 

Good pipeline(no need to reinterview afaik) to  swe intern  which would be ..nice next summer.

Good resume value?

cons:

in MTV(boring asf location, hoping I can change locations to nyc)

a sophomore program

only gives about 6k pre-tax housing which sounds like a nightmare to find in mtv

Bloomberg pros:

in nyc + corp housing which is pretty nice.

I'd be working with their cloud infra(interesting tech stack)

Good pipeline to quant shops swe(?) - someone pls correct me if I'm wrong. my goal is 2S next summer. 

Cons:

hmm, not a pure tech co?

not as much resume value?

Nvidia pros:

Loved the company and team, i'd be in a different team tho.

new team is exactly what I'm interested in and pretty high impact( building ML Infra for computer vision)

Could either go remote(pro) or be in Santa Clara(con)

cons:

considering trying something new

Santa Clara would be less than ideal

Not the most exciting tech stack

I’m currently spamming out my resume and also have a recruiter trying to place me. Starting to get interviews/screening calls for on site positions. There’s also a web3 startup I could join that has minimal funding and is willing to pay me a non competitive salary for an unknown amount of time , probably less than a year before needing more funding. 

I like my current internship and working remote is ideal. If I’m offered a position (outside of the internship), what do I tell the internship company to prompt an offer in a nice way?

Also, I’m young and feel like I have nothing to lose so the startup (also remote) sounds exciting but the risk of compensation not lasting long is very unattractive. I’m also in a unique position where I could be CTO because the current has bailed because of real job priorities. The company is supposedly valued at ~ 1 mil. I would likely be doing a lot of work for subpar pay which I understand is what happens with most startups.

yno28f,133,2022-11-06,If you feel like you have Imposter Syndrome doing Bioinformatics... You're not alone!,IBsurvivor1998,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/yno28f/if_you_feel_like_you_have_imposter_syndrome_doing/,"Hello fellow bioinformaticians! I wanted to share a little bit of my experience delving into the world of bioinformatics with y'all. I think my story might resonate with people from non-CS backgrounds who transitioned into bioinformatics.

I recently just graduated from BSc majoring in genomics and bioinformatics. Although my degree might sound like I have a lot of experience in bioinformatics, in reality, my undergraduate course is more genomics than bioinformatics. We were barely taught any Python and R. My journey with bioinformatics happened mainly during the pandemic. Before the lockdowns, I was looking forward to doing lab internships and was so excited for it. Sadly the opportunity was gone when most labs closed down and a lot of undergraduate students were left stranded not knowing what to do for their internships. I went on to do my internship with a startup and eventually did a lot of coding for them. I had a keen interest in deep learning and developed some Tensorflow object detection models to deploy in a dotnet environment. I remember questioning myself if doing any of this would help in my scientific career. I was also slightly envious of my friends who managed to get internship placements in labs. At the same time I also felt out of place doing coding since I don't have a CS degree. I have a lot of friends who were doing CS in the same university and I always question myself if I should just give up on biology and just go fully into CS, which is probably a more lucrative option career-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to my Honours year where I had to carry out my own research project, the lockdowns were still there in my country. I had a very difficult choice in picking a research project since it was risky to commit fully to a wet lab-based project. I eventually did a heavy dry-lab project and well, I can say that I fell in love with bioinformatics and really enjoyed it! My project didn't exactly have a good basis tbh (a lot of conjectures) but playing around with public datasets and just using all the various bioinformatics tools out there, writing my own scripts, thinking about what each output means and how they connect to form my hypothesis. I just felt like I was doing science, except it's on a computer. I eventually developed a keen interest in bioinformatics algorithms (Ohhh gosh the book by Philip Compeau &amp; Pavel Pevzner is sooo good!). I think bit by bit, I started to feel like I'm not out of place. I'm a scientist who's solving biological questions, just not through pipettes and centrifuges, but through applying various methods of data analysis on large biological datasets.

&amp;#x200B;

So for those of you who are thinking of going into bioinformatics from a non-CS background, never doubt yourself or be intimidated by all the coding you have to learn. The challenge may seem insurmountable in the beginning, but you're not alone in this journey! StackOverflow is your best friend and there's honestly a lot of freely available resources that can help you. For people like me who are working towards a bioinformatics career from a science background, I think it helps a lot when we start looking at ourselves as cool scientists doing science on a computer! We don't have to feel like we'll never code as good as someone with a CS degree or feel like we're missing out on all the fun in the lab. We're just right where we belong – answering biological questions from biological data."

I don’t really have a lot to offer, so I have no expectations of getting into competitive positions. Also, I don’t really care which country I end up in as long as an English speaking person can survive there. 

I’m Canadian and I’ll have a Master’s in physics from McGill (highly ranked school in Canada, but I don’t know how it’s regarded elsewhere). My research was in theoretical high energy physics, so I don’t have many transferable skills. I’ve always done well, gotten scholarships, and my profs have loved me, but…

My programming experience consists of a course in C in my second year of undergrad, and a Python course catered towards physics in grad school. I also had to take a year off during my Master’s for personal reasons, which probably also looks bad. I’ve heard the interview process is hell and that there are a lot of tests, which is concerning because I can’t do standardized tests to save my life. It’s part of the reason why I never considered school in the US. Plus I’m probably not a good enough coder to be able to not do embarrassingly badly.  As you’d expect, I have no finance related internships; mine have all been in physics research since I was so focused on getting into grad school. I have taken two courses and gotten certificates from the MicroMasters in Finance program in MITx, but I doubt that that’s super helpful. 

Despite the fact that I’ve written a paragraph hating on myself, I know that I am smart and could succeed in the position if I were to get it, but I don’t know if I have what it takes to get hired. I’m lost and overwhelmed. Is there any hope for me? Is there anything in this field that I can realistically be hired for?

ynvmqv,4,2022-11-06,From rejection everywhere to landing $85+/hr internship,LifesShortLetsGoo,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ynvmqv/from_rejection_everywhere_to_landing_85hr/,"(throwaway acct) 

Freshman year of college, friends told me it’s possible to get an internship as a first year, but my fat inbox of rejections clearly said otherwise.  
 

September of freshman year: I ran to every career fair possible, sending out 100+ applications, not knowing what an elevator pitch was (saying all the wrong things), and pretty much missed all the fundamental points that are needed during this whole process. Rejection was everywhere, and I was pretty much the average Joe in a sea of people seeking the same thing I wanted.  
 

I spoke to some older, more successful friends about this, and had them polish my resume, LinkedIn, and mock interview with me, amongst other things (like getting a really good grip on one programming language, Python, instead of spreading myself thin)  
 

\- Nov. of Freshman year: Eventually I get some LinkedIn message requests: “Would you like to work at x, y, and z”. Rare but a handful, don’t appear to lead anywhere  
\- Nov. - Feb. : I attend conventions, every career fair, even interviewed with some delivery companies (UPS was nice)  
 \- Feb 1st: Have a lead with a relatively Big Name company, and engineer says I’m a good candidate: that is, until he finds out I’m a freshman, in which case he starts to reconsider my application. I’m starting to think ""Wth am I gonna do this summer"", while my successful friends go off to their internships in cool places.  
 \- Feb 3rd of freshman year: “Congratulations on your offer to work at \[Insert huge computer company here\].”  
 

Starting salary: $75,000/year + $2k/month for housing (that come out to almost $100k/yr as an 18 year old kid, **$24k in one summer)** Internship was remote and housing money was pocketed.  
 

Turns out, one of those LinkedIn companies that hit me up months prior had finally decided their minds a month or 2 after my final interview.

After completing that internship, and getting invited back, I decide to see what other options I had. I end up only applying to 5 top tier companies, and get 3/5 offers back. 

After completing the second internship with the new company, I go shopping again and my experience speaks for itself and end up landing a company that pays me 85$/hr. 

Freshman year mission: *More than complete*  
   
**Reminder that all you need is ONE yes! Getting over the initial hurdle is the biggest challenge and your life becomes significantly easier afterward.**  


I don’t say this to flex or to show off or anything (doing it on a throwaway account for a reason) but mostly to show that these results are possible. I know I really needed this advice/motivation when I was in my first/second year.   
 

If you’re interested in working on this journey yourself, feel free to dm me with any questions. I mentor around 3-6 students at a time, but with more than half of them already getting internships, there’s space for 3-4 people who are really interested in growing professionally as well.  
 

TL;DR: Got rejected everywhere freshman year, spoke with the right people, and now I’m at where I’ve been wanting to be. Find the right people to surround yourself with. DM me with any questions, and if you’re interested in learning more."

My question is that how hard it is to get a full GPA in ITE nitec and the steps required to achieve it, especially internship. My fear is going Nitec and not being able to enter my way to poly, and then having to spend another two years in higher Nitec.

My plan after O’s results is either go ITE or Retake O’s again for the third time as a private candidate. I heard that O levels students have higher priority than ITE (especially Nitec) students during EAE/JPAE/DAE. But unsure if I really want to retake O’s again for the third time (especially without any Teachers help this time.)"

I am privileged enough to receive an offer from a FAANG+ equivalent and F50 company. I am interested in maximizing new grad pay, and I will assume that I will receive return offers from both. The average pays are $180k (HCOL) and $130k (LCOL), respectively. While the FAANG+ seems much better on paper ($50k+!), the costs of living are dramatically different. Various online calculators quote that I would need anywhere between 230k - 290k in the HCOL area to go as far with the 130k salary in the LCOL. 

Logically, it would follow that to maximize earning I should take the F50. Of course there are other considerations like short term vs long term (resume value of FAANG+ would better set me up for earning more in late career), but question is how accurate are these COL calculators. Do I really need DOUBLE the income to maintain the exact same quality of life &amp; saving standard? Thank you."

I am extremely behind on recruiting.

I had several personal issues that plagued me during the last 3-4 months that revolve around my parents/ an extremely toxic relationship and it dug me into this hole that temporarily made me lose sight of things. Anytime something related to my parents/my toxic relationship came up, I immediately put everything aside which would then obviously leave me mentally drained to really do anything at all.

I am currently in therapy because it helps me stay ""level-headed"" but I know that being THIS behind is my own fault and it's obviously something that therapy cannot help me with.

It is November and I keep hearing about many people I know getting internships and hearing back/getting interviews and I obviously haven't heard anything as I haven't applied to many and feel as if I am too late.

I am a Business Major (don't kill me) and really want to get back on track.

Am I too late in terms of the internship/recruiting process? What steps should I take to make up for how I've fucked up in these last months?

I'm currently a junior in the Computer Science department at a public university on the West Coast well known for its research.

I've been waitlisted by two companies, but felt like I interviewed well. In the interim, it seems like I may have chanced into an opportunity to do some Planetary Science/Astrophysics research in a well respected Professor's lab. 

Honestly, I'm very interested in taking this opportunity as I'm passionate about science and feeling demoralized by the internship hunt. I know its not CS research, but I'd be using Python and Matlab and their associated libraries - so its not completely unrelated, right?? Will this experience help me get a job in the future? Does it even matter that much? Help!

Salesforce (SF):

Pros:

* Good WLB
* High return offer rate
* Already know my team and the manager &amp; developer in my team are extremely nice

Cons:

* Not sure if I am really interested in working on the team's product, but the manager said we can work on designing a project that combine the team's product and what I am interested in
* According to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi), Salesforce has lower TC (new grad) than Bloomberg
* Not sure if I remembered correctly, but I might be working on JavaScript mostly because it is a web dev team

Bloomberg (NYC):

Pros:

* Corporate Housing
* Good WLB
* Also high return offer rate?
* Not sure about which team I am going to be placed on, but according to the recruiter there will be a team matching process and they will try to match me to a team that aligns with my interests
* Higher TC according to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi)

Cons:

* Not sure about which team I am going to be placed on
* Might be harder to get a Salesforce new grad offer than a Bloomberg new grad offer so I might still get the offer from Bloomberg if I try again next year?

Changing some details to try to disguise my identity just in case.

EDIT: I am not asking for a doctor or therapist. I have both. I’m asking how to approach this issue with my supervisor. This is not the first time I have been perturbed by something he’s said. He often makes insensitive comments about others, and I feel this is grist for the mill unfortunately. 

I have several diagnosed chronic illnesses. I am in an (unpaid, almost full-time) internship for graduate school. My plan from day 1 has to been work with kids/teens. I meet with my supervisor weekly, but we do not overlap much on our schedules. As a result, we do not have much rapport, but I see the other clinicians and interns much more often. 

In the last \~6 months, I’ve had severe nausea to the point I vomit or dry heave out of the blue (no, I’m not pregnant). I regularly gag or choke, including in the shower or driving. Motion sickness is severe now when I never had it before. It hits the worst in the morning, and then I take a Zofran, and that lasts about 8 hours. I have an endoscopy scheduled for 12/28, but obviously, that’s not soon enough. My gastro thinks it may be gastric emptying or ulcers. I had abnormal lab results last week.

All that to say, sometimes I’m 5 minutes late for my unpaid, full-time graduate internship. I try to give advance notice whenever possible, and that 5 minutes usually consists of me dry heaving/vomiting or cleaning up from that. I have never been late for clients or groups. I’m not excusing it, but this is my new normal and I’m not sure what else to do. I have never had to leave or reschedule seeing a client. I've tried leaving the house early, and the same thing ends up happening. 

My supervisor is very direct about critique and does not give positive feedback. Their “thing” is to challenge me on everything (ex: wanting to work with kids/teens versus adults). He asked why I’d been late a few times recently, and I explained what was going on and how it's mainly a waiting game.

He then suggested that all this nausea is due to anxiety and that the anxiety stems from the internship. I was baffled. I love my work and my clients and I’ve worked with kids for half my life. This is my passion. I have diagnosed GAD, but it is now well-managed and rarely obvious to others. My last boss even wrote that I “have a calming presence” with children. My supervisor does not have experience with chronic illness himself. I feel very misunderstood and judged. This is not in my head. I had abnormal lab results. I was not believed by doctors for 15 years about having PCOS, so this is a huge trigger for me. I look young and am only in my early thirties (but look about 22) so I think this contributes to others assuming I am healthy or that my illnesses are all in my head. 

I’m dreading going in tomorrow after this and I’m now questioning asking for another supervisor. I’ve already been fired from a nannying job in the past for needing time off due to ruptured ovarian cysts. I’m not sure how to go forward because I don’t feel he will accept my feedback (or challenge me on it). We are a small agency with few clinicians, and there is no ""HR."" Has anyone ever dealt with a supervisor not understanding them?"

yob58f,1,2022-11-06,Chance Me UGA,colek159,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/yob58f/chance_me_uga/," I am so anxiety ridden lately about the uneasiness of waiting on my admissions result from UGA. So naturally, I am seeking this forum to ask for reassurance (if there is any to offer) from other current or past UGA students.  

First, What were your stats when you applied? strictly speaking of GPA and SAT/ACT scores. 

Then, Here are my stats and I'd like to ask if any of you think I have a shot at an acceptance. 

\- 3.78 recalculated GPA per UGA's guidelines (97.22 weighted 100 scale) and a current 25 ACT (8 writing) (but I am awaiting another score from the October test which I am praying reaches UGA before they read my app). 

The cause of my uneasiness is of course my ACT score! I know it is low and I know it is VERY low for UGA. I am a terrible test taker and always have been. 

Keeping all of that in mind though, I had amazing essays and I am VERY involved in my school and community which is honestly what I'm riding on for admissions. I am in all of the National Honor Societies, I am a math tutor, I am an all-district and all-state saxophonist, I did and internship in a STEM field, I worked, I ran a jewelry business which funded the computer that I built to get me into Comp. Sci, I am in a ""STEM Academy"" I volunteer, and I have taken 5 AP classes and will take 2 DE classes. 

My final question for the kind kind soul who has read this far is do you think that I have a shot despite my terrible ACT?"

Curious what everyone thinks. 
Last internship as am Junior, looking to convert FT. 
Have offers from 2 of the 3, final round for 3rd, so need to decide soon . 
Intern TC doesn’t matter, looking for strong return and good culture for FT. 

Im currently leaning towards Jump, since I heard last year HRT had a pretty low return rate for core SWEs, and well Citadel has a pretty hard WLB. Honestly haven’t heard much about Jump, but from the engineers I’ve talked too it seems kinda nice? 
HRT is NYC and it would seem pretty fun to be there for a summer and for FT, though I don’t mind Chicago. 

Open to thoughts/other considerations.

A little background about myself i’m 21, expected to start my MAS degree this upcoming January (graduated from college two years earlier with my Bachelor’s due to dual-enrollment in high school)

Currently in the boat where I received an intern offer with a big four company expected to start January as an audit intern. Noticed most of the interns that were extended the same offer as me are wrapping up their Master’s by the end of this year making me the youngest one but also having to do a year of school until I finish my master’s. 

Since it’s really likely that I’ll receive a full-time job offer upon the conclusion of my intership… should I consider doing part-time school only and sacrifice the time it’ll take me to complete the degree? Should I just do the full-time internship and reject the offer afterwards so I can go full-time into school?

I know there’s no right way of doing it… right now i’m considering in focusing on the firm fully having granted that I already got an offer this early in my career—I mean that was the whole plan from the start.. what do you guys think??"
yoc2k6,2,2022-11-06,Just realized I wasted 10+ years of my life by letting my social anxiety dictate my life.,AmatureProgrammer,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/yoc2k6/just_realized_i_wasted_10_years_of_my_life_by/,"Yeah long story short, I was always shy socially reserved and generally awkward as a child, teen and now adult. It's weird because I'm now 27 and I expected this issue to be resolved by now but I've made progress! So incoming wall of text about my situation and what I've done to progress. Also location is the US.

Anyways, like I said, ever since I was in high school, I developed this weird habit of always spending to much time in my head imagining myself interacting with classmates around me, we would make jokes and I would laugh in real life. I didn't realize how weird this was until later in life, but I would do that stuff. I would rarely talk and everyone knew me as the quite one. During HS I only had few friends but they were obnoxious and would treat me badly, but at least I wasn't alone.

I always found it weird that at that time I also thought that people had the same issue as me. I thought that they were all shy and reserved and that they didn't spend time with people, that they didn't interact with other in school. I thought that until I got Facebook. It weird but seeing pictures of my classmates with friends and family just enjoying life, I thought that was weird, I thought everyone lived life like me. That's when I realized that I was weird and perhaps I wasn't normal.

College came around at the age of 18, and that's where my 'isolation' period began. I pretty much didn't interact with a person at all other than my parents, sister and cat. I would go days without saying a single word and just let these weird 'imaginations' of me talking to my classmates consume me. I thought I was social but I wasn't. It was just me speaking to myself and making weird imagination scenarios.

I vaguely remember when I was 21 or 22 that i went to turn in some library card and I had some girl look at me weird with this freaked out face and I realized that she was doing it to me. Why? Because I was apparently laughing at some stupid scenario. I then decided to no longer do that or to control myself.

I also developed a habit of checking up on a HS crush of mine, just to see how she was doing. Weirdly enough, I no longer liked her. I just developed a habit to see what she was dong. For the most part she had her socials private so I wasn't sure what she was doing.

The harder I think about what I did at age 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, I realized that I've done nothing but the following: Just jerk off to porn excessively, take 1 or 2 classes in college (I transfered to a university at 22 I think?), try to find a job, try to focus on computer programming, try to study. spend time on the internet.

When it comes to school, i did poorly. Sometimes I would struggle to get things going, to actually study or motivate myself to learn. Yet despite this I graduated in 2021 with a CS Degree. How that happen, I don't know. I never did anything meaningful in college other than go to class, and try to pass. I rarley interacted with anyone. If you were to ask any student about me, they probably don't even knew I existed. As for the professors, I'm pretty sure they knew me but saw me as the 'weird' student or 'quite' student. I really hate that stigma...

At the beginning of this year, I pretty much tried to get my shit together. I was a recent college grad, with 0 employment history, and 0 social/networking circle. I needed to get my shit together. And so I somehow got a job by lying about my job history. It was a retail store. For the most part it was easy, just fold clothes. But I again had issues with interacting with my coworkers. They all saw me as weirdo and would always ask why I was quite or never spoke to them.

During this time, I started smoking weed. I only smoke weed 1 or 2 times during high school but never got truly 'high'. That all changed with consuming edibles and weed. I want to say that by doing weed, it helped me out a lot. Like it's honestly weird how it help me see my life for what it truly was. That I was wasting it. That I was a loser for just stalking a random girl that I had no feelings anymore and just watching small glimps of her accomplishments that shes done over the years, about my excessive porn use, and how I was 27 and I haven't don't nothing. Anyways, after my high trip, I felt ashamed of my behavior with my coworkers, they probably saw me as a weirdo. So I ended up quitting. And for the first time I started feeling depressed. Like genuine sadness. I kinda felt numb with this feeling for the most of my life. I remember that feeling was super strong in high school and up to 21 or 22 years old. After than the sad feeling went away. I just got used to it and I didn't feel much other than intense anxiety when someone spoke to me.

Don't get me wrong, suicide was on my mind ever since I was 15 or 16, but never went through with it. Long story short, recently I found out that someone I went to college with actually did this. It's weird, that persons life was in my eye 'perfect'. We were in the same major but she did really well, got good internships at Amazon, had a large social circle but that didn't matter. She ended up taking her life. It's weird. Anyways, I was curious and probed around but found some details as to why she did it. She also had mental health issues and she went off the deep end, committed a crime and was facing serious jail time. I feel like that she decided to escape by ending it.

Anyways, like I mentioned. I truly, TRULY, did waste 10 years of my life by just not being social. My weed trip helped clarify what I was doing in my life, and what I need to do to correct it. I used to be ashamed and scared to even use my voice but recently I decided to just join random chat groups on Wakie. I went from being shaky and nervous to calm and some what shaky. I still have anxiety but I don't want to let it control me. I also want to start therapy. I feel like it will help a lot with what ever is going on with me. I sometimes think I may be autistic or have aspergers, idk. I just want to enjoy my life before I die.

TLDR: I'm weird with issues."

I enjoyed my time, but thought I could
Do better, so I re-recruited this fall for almost exclusively consulting roles.  Here’s the stats: 

- I applied to 32 places 
- I received 10 first round interviews
- i received 6 final round interview

My old offer (from internship) first- year pay (includes sign-on): 170k+

New offer:  200k+ with much higher upside in the following years.

Whenever I think that things are going ok, I slip into a major depressive episode. I have a few friends and try to put myself out there if my social anxiety lets me but I feel like I don't have anyone close to me. I am always that ""other"" friend who is considered last and I have been excluded from many things. I hate myself. I am constantly busy between work and school, but I'm falling behind in both. 

There's nothing that brightens up my day, I just go about the motions and try to survive to please my family. I get so frustrated with people, myself, and life that my face get so hot and I want to bang my head against the wall many nights. Two months ago I even had an episode where I would break my plates, glasses, and anything in my bathroom because of how angry I am. I've tried to go to counseling / therapy, but all they do is make my talk about my problems. They offer no solution on how to improve my situation. 

Anyways I just wanted to put this out there if anyone is or been through a similar situation to relate. I also want to know how to be happy."

So I have some kind of phobia that doesn‘t alllow me to change my routine. This all started in Kindergarten, when I vomited for like 6 weeks every time when I had to go there. Later on, the phobia vanished until 8th class. My friends and my classmated were kind of mobbing me after Christmas holidays and I was lost and my routine changed from holidays to school. This was also the first time that my mother found me crying in the bathroom. She contacted the school and the psychology service helped me a bit as well as my new friends. They are all my friends until today and I‘m still grateful for this.

So this ended my phobia for some years. It came back in 10th class when I should work for 4 weeks in the summer holidays to get some money. I stopped after 3 days because I felt so bad and I couldn‘t change my routine.

Next time was in 11th class, were I had to do an internship. The first week was a pain for me, but afterwards it liked the internship. It should go on for 6 weeks, but it stopped after 3 weeks because of covid.

The phobia returned again in 11th class in the summer holidays, when I worked at the same place for 3 weeks. The beginning was also hard, but it got easier after some days.

Next time it returned was in 12th class in the summer holidays, when I wanted to work there again, but I stopped after 1 week and 3 days, because I didn‘t got too much mental support.

2nd last time was in 13th class for my 2nd internship, where it lasted for 3 days but afterwards I worked through for the 6 remaining weeks.

And now I sit here, in my new appartement at the town where my university is. 1st week was pain, 2nd was okay and now it returned.

Symptoms:
Urge to vomit
Depressive behaviour
No energy
Urge to flee
Urge to have company
Sweat attacks
I produce heat when I get super nervous
Fear
Pessimistic thinking
Crying
Suicidal thoughts

I always thought I‘m just too lazy, but some months ago I found this diagnosis where people called this neophobia. When I beat the phobia was when my family and my gf were always there for me or when I got to know someone at work who became friends with me, some thing like a protection or someone I know at the „foreign“ place.

I went twice to a hypnotist and many people know about my phobia and help me with it.

Thanks for reading and please help me"

Thing is though I moved out on august 18th and have seen absolutely nothing yet. I currently live in Michigan and the former apartment was in Ohio.
I called the office just a few times back in October after the 30 days was up for the deposit to be returned to me, but I heard nothing back and also received no invoice with fees being taken out of the deposit either. 
After hearing absolutely nothing back, I was calling them once a day for two weeks with a nice polite voicemail. I assumed they were busy and really it's okay at first because it was within a reasonable window. 
I got a little unhinged one day and was FINALLY able to get in contact with SOMEONE about my security deposit after spamming their phone lines for almost 14 call attempts, and they said it was sent out around august 22nd. I never received anything and verified the address, but they said they would look into it and send out another check if the first one had not been cashed. 
It has been roughly 3 weeks since that interaction and I have been again calling daily trying to get ahold of someone, each time leaving a detailed voicemail on how they can reach me and that I just wanted the info on the deposit.
I am a college student and it was only a temporary lease for a summer internship and they had even told me i had $50 taken out of my original $1350 deposit for some drywall damage done by a command strip.
I am so unbelievably frustrated with them because it is at this point the fault of both the accounting team as well as the leasing office, as they just simply ignore me. When the lady finally picked up after my spam calling, she sounded incredibly aggregated and did not even really answer my questions at all. 
Can I spam call them again to try and get answers? I feel bad because it is not technically in the hands of the office workers, but it is also the office workers who absolutely do not respond to anything. Again, many emails, voicemails, and consistent contact attempts have been made. I am also wondering if it's a legal issue at this point? It's November 7th at this point, and it's a LOT of money for me. I feel so mean but I am so frustrated.
Another add on, I live about 4 hours away from that location so I cannot just make a quick trip over. It would have to be a whole ordeal and they are only open on Saturday for maybe 3 hours. 
I also simply just don't have the disposable income to just throw a tank of gas away rIght now, especially if they may not even have the ability to give me my deposit when I would get there. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I really enjoy WFH so it could be really great if I could get a full remote position, but again I have no idea how hard it is to get those positions.

I am currently a high school senior and I’ve taken quite the enjoyment to IT. My goal is to become a network engineer in the foreseeable future. Now I’ve been looking for experience and over the last summer I managed to get an internship at my highschool IT. Now my boss said he really liked my stuff and that the current highschool desk support was retiring and he’d want me to apply when the time comes. Now here comes my issue. The application had opened now and I had gotten another job just to fill in the money gap. I’m making 15 currently and I work at a bank, and the IT job is 15-19. I plan on moving out in a year and living in an apartment with my friend. And I’ve seen listings for IT jobs that I’m qualified for that pay more than this as well as my current bank job having a shadowing program that would let me shadow the IT department and even get a job there. I’m really torn on what to do because I wouldn’t mind this school job, but I don’t want it to not be enough for me to successfully live on my own, and that I don’t know how easy it would be for me to move up and get a better job. I’m just torn on what I should do? Thank you."

Something else, I only know c++ and have no ideas on creating an original project that hasn't been done on youtube or a simple google search. 

Please give me a reality check. Where should my focus be? This semester I have all As, but only because I have spent a lot of time studying outside of all my classes. (Also cause its community college lol)

Should I stick my nose in a book to learn ds and algos in my free time? Should I learn another language like python right now and try to make a project with it?

Part of me feels like I would have no free time if I tried to do all of that. And I certainly dont want to get burnout. I'm a slower learner and need more time than others to digest and understand. 

Should I just throw my shit(resume) at the wall(linked in) and see what sticks?

Cons:

For the past 3 days now, I simply review over python syntax language to refresh myself back into the language. I made a doc of videos and book topics to cover.  I also planned on going to tutoring lessons to review what I learned in DSA lecture, (I finished Jovian's DSA in Python videos on YouTube, now going to Neetcode's videos), however the CS tutor was rude and chastised me the entire session.

I need to make sure I get an internship (or anything, prob SWE, since PM is more difficult) for this summer as I am graduating 23'.

*Note: I am also in a 5year program, &amp; currently, my extra one-year master's program is up in the air (applying for more scholarships, finding part-time jobs that offer tuition remission, etc.).*  Anyways, I have a date confirmed. However, I am getting a little overwhelmed as it's a long interview session.

So here's what I wrote in my docs:

Neetcode's videos of the Blind 75.

Blind 75: And all the topics within each topic.

Cracking the Coding Interview book (also within the blind 75 topics)

Common sense guide to DS&amp;A

Jovains' DSA in Python (completed)

Hi everyone,

This is a bit of a long post, but if you're struggling with applications this season, I'd highly recommend reading this post carefully.

I was doing some research into Unicorns (private companies worth over $1 Billion), and I realized that lots of Unicorns that we talk about on this Subreddit (Databricks, Stripe, Scale AI), are pretty well known and competitive, but I saw that there were a ton more Unicorns that people just haven't heard of, but have valuations just as high. Just within Fintech, there are over 130 Unicorns founded in the United States, but we usually just talk about a few of them (Stripe, Plaid, etc.). Imagine what would happen if you applied to all of the Unicorns in just that industry, rather than just a few of the well-known ones. That would, hypothetically, more than 40x your chance of getting an offer.

To help people apply to more top Unicorns that were lesser known, I scraped some data and built a simple website ([https://www.unicornsearch.org/](https://www.unicornsearch.org/)) to help people find a list of Unicorns given the area that they're interested in (Fintech, AI, Data, Health, etc.), along with the Country they'd like to work in (U.S., India, China, United Kingdom).

It turns out that there's Unicorns like Miro, GoodLeap, and Talkdesk, all of which are Software Unicorns with valuations of at least $10 Billion. These companies, although not as well known in this subreddit, have higher valuations than more well-known Unicorns, like Benchling, Postman, Patreon, and Handshake. They're also all probably much less competitive, since the number of people familiar with these companies tends to be much lower amongst most CS Majors.

Applying to these companies can be really helpful for increasing chances at landing Internships and New Grad Opportunities. Especially right now, with the increase in competition, it's more of a numbers game than ever, so finding as many companies as possible can be really helpful.

Best of luck with the rest of this season! Please feel free to upvote if you found this useful."

The problem is since he is the CEO he doesnt really have any time for us. He is mostly in meetings with investors and were just thrown in the water with the code and the problems.  Non of us had a training of more than 1-2 days besides just a recap of the code so far. We try to help each other but theres a limit to how much an intern can help another intern. We spend hours and days on problems that can be solved within minutes and when the CEO does have time for us he just gives us a hint and not actually sitting and helping or directing us, or we discuss on whatsapp and its unbearable to explain a problem like that or he is just confused with his sh\*t and starts a nonsense discussion on something which is not the problem. Eventually we get all the heat on why we are not on schedule or why its taking so long.

Here are the deciding factors:

I can finish with a Bachelor’s in accounting by the time I’m 34 and accomplish all the school work online without commuting. And I will have more internship opportunities to gain experience.

The computer science degree will take more time and I’ll be going on 37 by the time I finish. I’ll also have to commute an hour for at least three years which will be costly.

Personally, I feel computer science will be more lucrative, have options to be creative, and provide a better wlb which will be great if I want to start a family. But I can’t shake the feeling that getting a head start in accounting with its stability and decent pay will be the safer option. Although I’ve heard the wlb is horrible. What does everyone think?

As a result I've always had this kind of ""underdog"" mentality which has driven me to grind super hard to prove to myself that I don't need go to a fancy school to succeed.

Five months ago, I lost my internship return offer due to the recession and frantically started looking for new grad roles. I applied to over easily 500 jobs, spent hours tweaking my resume, and did 100+ LeetCode problems.

I was able to net a handful of onsites but failed all of them. As my graduation date got closer, I started losing hope in finding a job and my mental health dwindled as I received one rejection after the other.

I finally got an offer this week.

The team is great, the role is exactly what I was looking for, and most importantly it pays more than every company that rejected me.

Keep applying, you can do it.

ypcizw,2,2022-11-08,Is it worth it to stay an extra semester to double major?,Sufficient_Pear841,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ypcizw/is_it_worth_it_to_stay_an_extra_semester_to/,"Basically the title. I don’t know if I should consider staying an extra semester to get my double major in CS and statistics. If not, I guess the other option could be to take summer courses, but that would not be ideal if I were also doing internships over the summer. 
I am currently a college sophomore and I recently decided to drop pre-med because I found CS more interesting. I’m in a weird spot because I’ve taken a good amount of CS courses and have credit for most of my gen ed requirements, so I’d a bit ahead if I were to purely be a CS major. I’m also interested in stats which is why I was considering double majoring because I thought I had space in my schedule. Currently a double major is around 3-8 credits too much. As I am going to be working in CS related fields after I graduate and am also currently working in a computational biology lab, I feel like getting the second major would be pretty useful. Do you think the extra semester is worth it, or should I get a stats minor instead?"

yphqqe,1,2022-11-08,"new person, same old mistakes",LarimarLars,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yphqqe/new_person_same_old_mistakes/,"I have made a lot mistakes in life (don't we all) and I have tried to better myself when they come up. My problem is that I will change my thinking and it either still ends up being wrong or end up not mattering. I just don't know how to make the right decision or at least a better decision.

For example:
1.
I had pretty extreme anger issues. When I was a kid I just used to break things (pencils, random plastics I'd find, etc) and it ended up being bad for social development. No one wants hang out with the weird 7 year old who carries around a bunch of pencils to sit alone in the corner to break in complete silence. It all pretty much culminated at the point where I ended up putting a whole in a wall. After that I knew that I had to change (I have since patched up the hole but have not repainted it and have my work setup right under it as kind of a reminder.) My problem now is that every idea that I try to calm issues doesn't work so I've just resulted to bottling it in which is exactly where I was when I put the whole in the wall. The only difference being that I know I guess what I'm capable of so I just kind of have to sit there with it. I know its not healthy but I dont know what to do.

2.
Due to personal stuff and moving a lot, I didnt have friends for too long and became self conscious for a while. Somewhere along the way in late high-school or uni, I realized most ppl don't care or don't even know im there and kind of went to the other extreme of not caring what other ppl thought. I didnt do any weird stuff like not showering or be an ass but I essentially stopped trying to interact with people completely. I could be in social situations and be fine or ""the funny guy,"" but as soon as the job/event ends, im going home and not talking to anyone until I absolutely have to, not even my roommates most of the time. Weirdly enough I think I was at my best. I was doing really well in school, I was going to the gym 3+ times a week, had a job i liked, and gotten into fun hobbies (even made a new style for my dreadlocks). Then the pandemic hit, all of my classes went online and I didnt have access to all the school resources, all the gyms closed, my job ended, and couldn't pay for my hobbies/old hobbies are no longer fun and are now a stress causer. The only hobbies are still fun are playing instruments (hence the title lmao) but can't play too long due an old hand injury.

3.
I have had memory issues since I was a kid. I think the only class I have ever failed was some organization class where they taught us how to stay organized and pay attention in elementary school.  I always lost my school agendas and wouldn't know/remember homework was due if teachers didn't announce it a day before, etc. Now I try to write down everything, I try to put things in Google calendars, I had multiple calender and habit tracking apps (because I'd forget i had other ones) and bought myself a galaxy note so I could do on the fly notes with the s-pen thing. The issue now is I always remember to write it down but never remember to check them later. I have alarms set to check notes but somehow miss them or get distracted. I have absolutely no idea how to fix or remedy this.

4.
I coasted my first 2 years in high school and got average grades, so in college I went super hard. I didnt go to parties, do any wild stuff, or anything like that. I put my head down tried my absolute best with grades, extra-curriculars, and an internship and graduated with honors. Looking back i missed out on pretty much every ""fun college"" experience for grades, its been pointed out by roommates and now parent that I've developed bad habits like hyper focusing on work/school work to the point of not eating/sleeping that have extended past graduation.  But now it feels like it was for nothing because its almost been a year and a half and 400+ applications, 2 retail jobs that I had to quit due to prior leg injuries, and now I can't even get a job at my local walgreens. Now all my friends, (whether they went to college or not or still in college) make way more than me, and idk what to do.

I'm not sure why but i almost never seem to make the right decision and if its a somewhat good outcome it usually tends to be complete luck. I know its dumb to ask ""how do I know im making the right decision?"" So ill ask how do I learn better from my mistakes/if you've been in my situation what did you do?

Tl;dr idk how to make good decisions lmao"
ypi4fe,21,2022-11-08,We are updating the user flairs and some more,Ok-Customer-1306,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/ypi4fe/we_are_updating_the_user_flairs_and_some_more/,"Hello r/developersIndia community,

When I initially came across this wholesome community, we have had less than 20k members. But in the recent years, we have seen an immense growth and now we are beyond 100k members.

In my 12+ years of professional career, I have worked with people across multiple countries, and if there was one thing common among them, it was the presents of Indian developers. Knowingly or unknowingly, we have contributed to many large systems that runs the world right now. But in all honesty, I don't think we get the praise we deserve. In fact, I have seen quite the opposite. Indian developers get a lot of slack online, especially in reddit; and sometimes it's for the right reasons too.

A community such as this can have an influence how we are perceived. And more than that, we have the power to teach and learn from each other in here. Now that we have achieved a milestone in terms the members, we would like to bring in some changes to the community to have a positive impact. And to start with, we would like to restructure the user flairs.

**Why do we need a change in the user flairs?** 

While the current set of flairs are helpful to identify, we think it doesn't bring value as much as it could.  Besides, the existing ones does not cover the entire spectrum of engineers who works beyond just programming. We also believe that a hierarchical order could add more value to the posts and response since it can directly reflect on their experience. 

We would like to hear from the community on this proposed change. We would also like you all to point out the gaps so we can fill them before we proceed with the updates. 

Here is a curated list of potential user flairs.  The below list must contain pretty much all the roles available in India. While there are some potential overlap, we cannot avoid them since there are no standard way of defining them

My tasks are involving RPA and other digitalization topics like VR and AI, but for the most part (atleast 90%) I‘m doing RPA development with Automation Anywhere and Catalytic.

Pretty much everyone here is nice. I get to know a lot of other interns and I got pretty much everyday something to do.

But there is one thing that really annoys me. And thats the RPA development itself. I don’t like using the tools and I’m always thinking that this is all a waste of time. 

I never really thought about what would I want to do specifically after my Bachelor until recently. After a few weeks passed I realized that this kind of development is not gor me and for the first time in my life I have an idea or even better a goal. I want to get into actual development with a more technical background. But now I’m kind pf stuck in this internship for 4 months. It’s a mandatory internship. So I have no choice but to keep going.

Is there anyone who experienced something similar? I get the feeling I’m now completely wasting my time. Or can I atleast get something out of this that helps me for my future?"

Graduating na po ako. Need ko lang ng advice regarding sa work. Eto kasi pinagpipilian ko:

A) mag board exam, orB) mag self-study at upskill para makakuha ng entry level job sa IT side.

Interested ako sa IT side, pero sobrang lacking ako so need ko talagang mag self-study. Ba't ko gusto sa IT? Malaki daw sahod hahaha, pera lang talaga  habol ko, neutral din ako sa course ko. Na expose ako ng konti sa IT infrastructure during my internship, so yung mga skills para don yung balak kong aralin.

&amp;#x200B;

PROS &amp; CONS:

A) **Board exam**

Pros:

* support daw ni parents.
* refresher sa mga pinag-aralan namin. Mas magiging qualified akong maging professor/teacher if ever na hindi ako ma hire sa ibang work.
* bragging rights.
* mas mabilis sigurong mapapansin yung resume ko? ewan ko din. sabi ng iba useless, sabi ng iba useful daw.

Cons:

* if mag-aaral ako, need ko ng part-time job. Call center ang naiisip ko. Idk if kaya ko syang i-manage, ayon sa mga chismis, toxic daw? Pero lahat naman ng work eh.
* pano pag bumagsak ako?! mababatukan ko sarili ko. sayang pera, sayang buong taon. mabilis pa naman akong madepress.
* idk kung makakapag self-study pa ako para sa IT side, baka mapabayaan ko na yon.
* Sayang naman yung lisensiya ko kung sa IT side ako papasok, pero wala akong idea sa mga jobs regarding sa course ko.

B) **IT side**

Pros:

* support pa din ni parents (mahal ko ang pamilya ko)
* Need ko pa ding mag part-time sa call center (para di ako hingi ng hingi para sa mga certifications/courses). Maganda din pag may call center sa resume, mahahasa kasi communication skills.

Cons:

* Tamad. Mabilis akong matukso ng youtube, kdrama, anime, webtoon. Ang daming tukso sa bahay, number one na yung higaan, number one din ang wi-fi.
* Will my certifications and portofolios be enough?!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Alin man yung piliin ko diyan, iisa lang naman kaibigan ko, working na din siya so bihira kami mag-chat, so wala akong social life na dapat i-maintain.  Skl, new friends are welcome :D.

For context I have a degree in computer science from a good uni in Canada but due to some personal circumstances I wasn't able to find an internship during school. Over the summer and into the fall I applied to about 200~ or so jobs and I only got about 5 or 6 interviews one of which actually lead to a job. However, I quit said job because I was the solo front-end developer, no mentorship/code review, and the company owner was verbally abusive towards me when I said that I could not solo develop a new payment platform for him in 2-3 weeks.

Anyway, I'm back to square one and my job hunt made me realize that I am not a competitive applicant as I have no relevant work experience and I think my projects are pretty weak(pokedex app, and a few full stack crud apps). I am going through the odin project right now to work on my fundamentals but I think I am decently comfortable with HTML, CSS, JS, React, and working with apis (ie. I can probably figure it out by going through docs and googling) but have gaps in my knowledge. Looking for advice on what kinds of projects I can do to help stand out from the crowd, what I can learn in the mean time to get my foot in the door as a front-end/full-stack dev and general job searching advice as the current market gives me terrible anxiety that I'm going to be stuck doing customer service work and not be able to use my degree.

ypt8kg,6,2022-11-08,Lost,Creative_Pomelo404,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ypt8kg/lost/,"Title kinda says it. I'm an EE student. Finished my bachelor and now doing my masters. I should have chosen CS for my degree but I came to that conclusion way too late in my EE bachelor and couldn't  change. I did not apply for a master in CS because of self doubt and because I was aware that I did not know the basics so I was not prepared for a MSCS.

Now I in my master I am taking some CS related classes as well as some AI/Data Science courses, but I need help in knowing what I can do with my life/education. 

Here's the most relevant CS courses I've taken/will take: Algorithms and Data Structures, OOP, Databases, Computer Networks, Internet Distributed Applications (REST, RPC, lil bit of html, css and JS as well as flask). 

Here's the most relevant Data Science courses I've taken/will take: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natura Language Processing, Optimization and Algorithms, Data Science, Speech Processing, Big Data Processing (not distributed computing frameworks, more like multivariate analysis).

Writing this down it almost feels like I should not feel lost but the truth is that my CS courses are the basics of the basics (and so are my ML courses) and everyone gets good grades (for example, in OOP we didn't even talk about design patterns, or in Computer Networks we didn't talk about security).

If I wanted to go into CS I'd need more intro classes (Operating systems, Software engineering, etc...) and if I wanted to go into data science I'd also need more classes (Time Series, General Linear Models, etc...) but I'm in this awkward place where I feel like I don't know enough to get a good job (one that will allow me to learn what I feel like I'd need to learn) in either fields.

I think I'd like to get a job as a Machine Learning Engineer because it combines both fields, but how if every time I come on Reddit I see people talk about shit I don't understand in both CS and DS subreddits??

I'm just extremely lost and I don't know which path to choose because I don't know which path I can even choose... Most other people in my degree don't care about what they will do later in life, they take some classes they think sound cool and that is it (some only take Deep Learning and think they can get a job as a DS because that class is shallow af). Probably that is also why I can't relate to any of them and am extremely lonely.

Can online courses help me learn those missing topics? Will recruiters even care that I have them on my resumé (assuming I pay for the certificates)? Will recruiters be ok with my weird path and allow me to learn what I need to learn on the job?

I like learning and that's why taking these courses would not be much of a hassle for me, but I've seen it here mentioned so much that no one cares about those certificates... 

P.S. if it matters, I have an internship as a data analyst (it was completely bullshit, did not learn anything at all) and one as a research engineer at a unicorn (it was ok, learned a few things but it quickly turned into me only running bash commands for a month straight) and my masters thesis will be on deep learning (using pytorch and such for multi modal models)"

Maybe by saying this isn't the first time I've had this but now is the worst period of depersonalisation I've been through up to now.

Before I give you an update on my current situation, I feel like I have to give you a little background info.
I'm a 22 year old male, living in Belgium. I'm in my 5th year of college at the moment but ever since I've started studying I've felt unsure about my decision on the topics (I've tried 2 different topics).

Because this is my 5th year already and I still don't have my degree I kinda feel like a faillure. 
It makes me insecure knowing I 'wasted' all this time and I've created quite the amount of performance anxiety because of it.

Back to the present.
Currently I'm in an internship which is accompanied by the necessary amounts of stress.
But because of this I've been dissociating/depersonalising for the last 2-3 weeks.
The mornings are okay but the afternoons get so bad my mind sometimes feels like I'm incredibly drunk or watching from a distance.

While I'm writing this I'm feeling a little better but for the past 45mins I've been having what feels like a anxiety attack.
My entire body feels like it's on fire because of how worried I am about the dissociating.
I feel like I can't go back to normal no matter what I do.
When I wake up in the morning I feel like everything's going to be fine but the further the day progresses and the more I depersonalise, the more I pannick and stress about it.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this or how to change my attitude towards this.
I feel like how I view this situation has a big influence on overcoming this problem.

I'll be seeing my doctor in two days to talk about this.

Another little sidenote, I've been smoking weed ever since I'm 18. Last 2 months have been a little over the top so the past 2 weeks I've kinda stopped and I feel like the depersonalisation has gotten worse.
This is absolutely no excuse for me to smoke more again.
On the contrary, I feel like my smoking in the past might have a contribution to the situation now.
Not really sure what to think about that tho.

If you've made it this far, thank you for reeding through this. I hope I've made a clear sketch of the situation, please feel free to ask questions! :))"

I am a senior in computer engineering and would like to attend a top masters program in electrical engineering (or computer engineering), and would by far like to attend Stanford. My reason for pursuing a master's degree is not to pursue research but to gain significantly more advanced knowledge of hardware so I can contribute to developing cutting-edge technology.

Info:

* Pursuing B.S. in Computer Engineering, minor in Physics, minor in Math
* GPA: 3.5/4.0, attend a state university but it's ranked within top 20 for engineering.
* Work experience: Research abroad at a university - electrical engineering intern, SpaceX - software engineering intern, Tesla - software engineering intern, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals - machine learning intern, AMD - software engineering intern
* Rec letters: 1) My research professor from the research abroad internship told me he would write a very strong rec letter if I ever ask him. 2) My manager when I was at Tesla also told me he would write a very strong rec letter if I ask, he really liked my performance. He is a staff hardware engineering manager at Tesla for their autopilot hardware.

I have 1 more gap for an internship over the summer and am trying to get an internship at a research organization (ideally either CERN or MIT Lincoln Lab) in a hardware role. I think having a good rec letter from a manager there would be really strong.

I plan on applying to the MSEE program around 1-2 years after graduation. In that 1-2 year gap, I hope to work full-time at either Tesla, Neuralink, or some startup in the bay area in an electrical engineering role.

With all this taken into consideration, what would be my chances of admission to the MSEE program? I believe my work experience and recommendation letters will be super strong, and I will study hard for the GRE. However, I'm worried that my GPA is definitely below-average in the applicant pool. I'm a senior so there isn't much opportunity to significantly boost my GPA, I could probably just barely bump it up to a 3.6."

I learnt some web development stuff online and luckily got an internship in the aforementioned cybersecurity company and then got converted into a full time role after 3 months of internship.

I’m highly interested in computer work (pentesting, software dev) working on getting a forklift license before the time being. So makes balancing school and work hard. I’m not sure where to start. Applied for a few internships to hopefully do some security work, but I just feel like all of what I’m doing is pointless. Yeah I love working, don’t get me wrong. I don’t want the easy way out, but how do I pursue a career that I love when I’m out working all day coming home and having to fall asleep to do it all over the next day. I’m 26 so I’m not that old, but when I’m 30, I would like to have my life set. I’d like my own business in computer tech, or working for a nice company that will pay me more then that just getting by wage. Am I just doing it wrong…or where do I start?"

It’s hard seeing everyone seem to move ahead and get offers while I don’t know if I’ll ever get an offer. 

I know I’m not entitled to anything, but I feel like I’ve worked so hard within my life, but no matter what things seem to leave me behind :(.

I know I’m immensely privileged to even be studying cs at a v good school let alone a school, but dang… how do I stop falling behind?

yq3ine,2,2022-11-08,I’m a 23 m with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering looking for career advice on what should I do next with my career?,Strict-Visit-9120,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yq3ine/im_a_23_m_with_a_bs_in_mechanical_engineering/,"I (23 m) am a 21 Mechanical Engineering grad. looking to for some career advice

I graduated with a B.S in mechanical engineering from an accredited college in the midwest in May of 2021.  During my time at college I worked everyday that I wasn’t in school at various jobs such as a meat clerk at a grocery store, an equipment operator for a mining company, and I had a CAD internship during COVID which didn’t result in much.  I did a year long project my senior year designing a VRF (variable refrigerant flow) and a DOAS (designated outside air system) for an apartment building.  I took a mix of design, manufacturing, and robotics classes.  

After I graduated college I took a job designing fire sprinkler systems.  There wasn’t much out there when I graduated so I grabbed what I could find that.  It wasn’t my 1st pick, but it was a job nonetheless.  It pays alright with overtime.  Everyone in the office is nice and everyone likes me.  

I don’t mind the job, but I don’t see myself in it long term for the following reasons:

1. The only further education I would need is taking NICET water based systems layout tests to get to NICET level 4 (I’m currently level 1 and within 6 months ready to take level 2).  I would get small bonuses and with my company it’s more of a requirement to stay employed rather than seen as a promotion.  There’s plenty to learn about fire sprinkler systems, but that would be it for further education.  

2. There are other paths within my company outside of design such as sales, but there isn’t any need for more sales people.  Our company gets more contracts than we can handle right now.  Sales doesn’t require any further education.  

3. The pay is alright, but the raises are only once a year and barely keep up with inflation.  If I were to stay in the next 1.5 years I would be salary and overtime is the only way I’ve been able to make the income I want to make.

One of my parents neighbors knows about my situation (my parents talk and hangout with some of the neighbors) and he works in the construction business.  He says that I can if I want just stick it out till I get my NICET level 3 and then I can have a wider range of where I want to live and who I want to work for.  He says there’s big money when I get my NICET level 3 (earliest I can get it is in 3 years).  I don’t know if I want to stick it out for that long and if I do I might be missing out on better opportunities than if I get a job that requires and engineering degree.  

My current ambitions are to get a well paying job where I can use my engineering degree with lots of room for upward mobility.  I don’t mind working long hours.  My Dad says I can do a lot more.  He has a B.S. in STEM as well as an MBA.  He says that if you want to earn the big bucks I need an MBA.  I don’t know what industry or career path I would need to get one.  Ideally I would be employed by a fortune 500 company and they would pay for most of it while I would work full time.  I don’t really care what industry that I’m in.  What matters most to me is having a well paying job that uses my engineering degree so I can save for retirement and travel.


Side note: I’m in a relationship and my gf (22) has recently accepted a really well paying job close to where I work.  I don’t have any ties to where I’m currently at other than my gf.  She also has a B.S. in chemical engineering.

If someone could give me advice as to where to get a job at that pays well and has plenty of upward mobility that uses my mechanical engineering degree that would be amazing!"
yq3jma,2,2022-11-08,GRFP and Leaves of Absence,QuietLizard,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/yq3jma/grfp_and_leaves_of_absence/,"Hi, I have a few questions about the GRFP. I am currently a first-year PhD student, and I applied this year for the fellowship. I am considering taking a leave of absence next year to do research elsewhere, though, which makes me consider withdrawing my application to apply next year instead.

1. If I apply for the GRFP while on a leave of absence, could I apply a second time once I came back (for my second year) because I wouldn't technically have been enrolled the first time I applied?
2. Would applying for the GRFP while on a leave of absence decrease my chances?
3. Would I be able to do a semester-long internship (in computer science) while on a GRFP? Summer internships are generally okay, right?
4. Is there any way I could take time off to do something unrelated to work like hike the Appalachian Trail if I got the GRFP, or would this have to wait until after grad school? I saw that leaves of absence are not permitted while on the fellowship.
5. Could I defer the GRFP if I am already enrolled? For example, if I continued with my application this year, received the fellowship, and wanted to take a leave of absence next year to pursue the other research opportunity, could I defer the GRFP to begin in 2024?

Thank you!"

I was in touch with a recruiter when searching for my internship and applied to a handful of roles with consulting in the title. And you can probably guess one of those roles was TRC. I didn’t have the greatest idea of what I was getting into. 

Long story short, I’ll be joining PwC as a TRC intern in the Summer, just a few months before my graduation. After a bit of research- I’ve heard a lot about the negatives of this opportunity. However I’m still very excited to join the firm and hopefully secure a full time. 

Some questions I have are:
1. What’s a possible career path (if any) to becoming partner starting in TRC?
2. Would you recommend me to try and move to a different line of work at the end of my internship? And Why?
3. Is TRC a dead-end? 

Some information about me and my goals:
I have a background in Computer Information Systems, I’m very interested in how tech &amp; business work together. My goal is to stay at the firm for the long term and hopefully work my way up to partner. I’m great with talking to people, building connections, and leading. I’m also great in understanding technology and processes. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!"

1. Microsoft, Applied Scientist Intern in the Turing team
2. Pinterest, Machine Learning intern 
3. JP Morgan and Chase, AI Summer research associate 
4. Waymo, Software Engineering Intern (Machine Learning) (In the final round, not received an offer yet)

I like the team at Pinterest and the work being done by that team, but I am worried that, given the current climate, Microsoft might be a bit safer."
yq71vk,28,2022-11-08,Should I quit my job as a Product Manager given the widespread hiring freeze?,shrnov,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/yq71vk/should_i_quit_my_job_as_a_product_manager_given/,"**Background:**

* 2022 CS grad working as an associate PM for a startup based in Bangalore for 5 months now.
* Previously interned as a backend developer, an operations intern and as a hardware intern when I was in college.

**Problem:**

* I directly work with the co-founder and absolutely despise the work culture here and have been consistently working 11-hour days for months now. And by 11 I mean 11 hours of serious work with 30 minutes of break in between for lunch. The company hires freshers mostly and exploits them given the lack of experience and the general supply-demand problem.
* I find myself constantly thinking about work during the weekend, when I'm out with friends, eating with my family etc. I started off really well and was delivering good output consistently for the first few months but my performance in the last month has considerably gone down and I'm highly unfocused at work and deliver dogshit which gets my manager annoyed and I get called all sorts of names in our conversations. And the worst part is that the colleagues I've talked (people in their early 20s) have all accepted this and continue working 9AM to 9PM which makes me look incompetent and less hard working.
* These 5 months have made me realize that I really hate working with people and that product management isn't right for me.
* I am now taking a crocin everyday and end my days feeling extremely exhausted but stimulated at the same time unable to even think about relaxing.

**More context:**

* What I do enjoy is making websites, more specifically frontend development. I get absolutely no time outside of work to sit and prep for a job switch. While I do have *some* experience thinking like a programmer, I am far from being interview ready for either frontend/generic SWE roles requiring leetcode prep. I believe I will easily need 3-4 months of serious full-time prep in order to clear coding rounds and interviews.

**I have 3 options the way I see it:**

1. Ask for a part-time commitment and use the extra time to prep while having a sense of security
2. Suck it up and work only the 9 hours (10-7) that I get paid for but get called out everyday and have fights with my manager until they decide they want to get rid of me
3. Quit and seriously prep full-time for frontend roles but the hiring freeze especially for entry-level roles scares me even though I have a few lacs saved up and live with my parents.

Kind folks of this sub - please help me out. I am living in anxiety 24x7. It is driving me insane and all the news about the recession is not helping."

I had a good gpa that I’m dragging down, I’m not doing anything in my internship right now and my team is catching on. I don’t know when it happened, but the feeling of just quitting everything has started to overwhelm me this past month. 

I’m looking for excuses to blame for this and I’ve started to blame the ADHD I was diagnosed with when I was younger and never got treatment for because of my families culture. I know it’s not an excuse, but I’m just looking for reasons that my life is falling apart on me. 

This last month and a half every morning I wake up the thought of ending it all has started to creep in. I can’t express this to anyone in my life and all of my friends have started to lose touch with me. 


It’s always a burst of good energy after I shift my mind from it, but at the end it always comes back. my internship search for next year has been nothing, but a endless string of me losing something that I had the grasp of. For fucks sake the interviews I’ve been in I’m sure it could show that I’m disconnected.

But, due to a busy schedule (I also have a lot of hobbies), I'm still halfway the course. I enjoy programming a lot, and my college curriculum teaches java, which seems easy for me due to my previous knowledge in C.

But recently, I asked my instructor and a friend of mine if C is still worth learning, both of them said that it is not. I've been getting mixed ideas whenever I search the web. Some say that C is totally different, so it's not worth to learn, and others say that C teaches all the basics so it is worth. Also, I've been interested in fullstack development recently, so I'm thinking of learning fullstack JS, getting internship, and working.

On a practical standpoint, do you think C is still worth finishing?"

* SDE Intern at one of the top Investment Banks after 3rd year BTech

**Work Ex:** 2.5 years as SDE at the same Investment Bank where I interned (got PPO). Have some nice projects related to systems which is the field I'm applying to.

**Research:** 1 research paper was published but it's not relevant to the field I'm applying to so wouldn't matter much. Paper came out of a project I was leading at work. The research paper is on programming languages.

**LOR:** Getting 3 strong LORs, two from top profs at my college and one from my manager at work. One of the profs giving LOR has been a **guest lecturer at Purdue CS Dept**, so hoping would have a good shot at Purdue

**Now for the universities, I'm applying to:**

* **Ambitious:** Stanford, CMU, **UCLA**, UT Austin, Gatech. \[doubtful to apply to UIUC and Michigan Ann Arbour\]
* **Moderate:** UC SD, Columbia, Purdue. \[doubtful to apply to UPenn, NYU Courant\]

I will be graduating soon, and have been fortunate enough to land two 2-year rotational finance offers at big tech companies. The problem is: I'm lost as to which opportunity I want to pursue more due to pros and cons for both, and would appreciate any insight that anyone has for someone just starting off their career.

Offer 1: FAANG company. I would have to relocate for this one, they don't allow me to negotiate my salary or location at all, and the total compensation is surprisingly less than that of my other offer. I probably would not want to stay here long term. However, because it is a FAANG company, I feel as if the name and environment would strengthen my resume a lot and make the process easier when I do decide to pursue future opportunities.

Offer 2: Another large tech company, just not FAANG. Higher salary (that I can negotiate) and I could stay close to my friends/SO since I wouldn't have to relocate. I've also interned here before so I know I like the environment and the culture. However, this is a company that is undergoing a lot of structural changes right now due to COVID, and is definitely less stable financially than my FAANG offer. I also already have this company on my resume with the internship, so I don't know if it's more worth it to take the risk and paycut for a new experience at FAANG, or go somewhere that I know I'll like at a company that isn't doing too strongly in this economy.

Note: rotational program at FAANG is also well established, but completely new at Offer #2.

TLDR: is the FAANG name worth trying out/worth a paycut and relocation?

Thank you!"

yqmts4,5,2022-11-09,Questions About Graduate Schemes and Working After Masters in UK,Dexsiard,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/yqmts4/questions_about_graduate_schemes_and_working/,"Hello everyone, I am currently doing a Computer Science master's at a top 10 university in the UK as an international student. I have done 2-3 internships in the software field before. I will graduate around August-September 2023. I'm considering starting applications for graduate schemes. I have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I am often asked if I have a visa to work or if sponsorship is required. I know that I can get a 2-year graduate visa after my master's. However, I want to get a permanent residence permit as soon as possible and for this, it is necessary to live here for 5 years. However, the time you work with the graduate visa is not included in this. Do you think it would be right for me to choose ""I need a visa/sponsorship"" to get a skilled worker visa for all of my job applications or would it decrease my chances?

2) When are interviews usually held for current applications?

3) How much time is given for me to think if an offer comes up? After accepting an offer, what happens if you get a way better offer from another company?

4) Is leetcode important for graduate schemes? So far I haven't done much except solving a few questions. In addition, there are things that I forgot about data structures and need to study again.

5) Expected salary is usually asked in applications. How much do you think I should write? (I will usually apply for jobs in London)"

Today I received a rejection mail from the Google London office . I applied for a SWE internship in September, got assessment on 12/10 and got rejected today. I got really disappointed because I expected at least an interview since I applied with a referral and I'm coming from a competitive programming background so the assessment was a piece of cake. I just can't see why I got rejected, I thought I did it right. For convenience, I have some awards in competitive programming and I have 2 internships on my resume : one in Software engineering and another in deep learning. I'm also studying in north Africa. The thing that keeps confusing me is that I got the candidate questionnaire last year (without referrals) but got rejected early this year. When I asked the recruiter for feedback, she told me that it's confidential. I'm wondering if my rejection is related to recent hire freezes?

So I wanted to know, did anyone hear back from a  Google EMEA office? And how was it? 

Thank you in advance!"
yqnjva,2,2022-11-09,What does dressing for the job that you want?,PinkCrystal1031,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yqnjva/what_does_dressing_for_the_job_that_you_want/,"I 35f am in the process of job hunting since my health is getting better. I have cancer and I am on an oral treatment that I pray will continue to work.It had been hammered into my head by my family that I dress professionally event though my first major degree is in a field that has people that have multi colored hair and visible tattoos, media, filmmaking. I was told once you get you foot in the door you can do what you want. So basically you have dress what I consider boring then once you become popular at the job you can do what you want. This was back in 2014. Recent I went back to school for graphic design. I have some professional clothes which I hate wearing. People in the gaming industry,  animation and comic books industry pretty much wear what they want and look any way they want. Those are fields I like .Yep I have been told any plan I have dying my hair an unnatural color should be easy to wash out. 

I just read a story time on TikTok about a girl that went to a marketing internship. She grew up being told you have to dress professional. She said a girl came into the off dress like she was homeless. This girl was caught making jokes about this homeless looking. This homeless looking girl turned out to be a major sound engineer for major  gaming industries and worked for Little Nas X. I don’t know if the story is true but I know it’s true that there are people that look whatever why they want and have well paying jobs. So if if self expression is allowed why do I have to look “normal” to get the job. Why can’t I show how unique I am?"

yqo4ut,6,2022-11-09,Will my Background Hurt Me?,MaceWindows10,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/yqo4ut/will_my_background_hurt_me/," First, let me preface my message by saying thank you to whoever reads this and subsequently provides feedback!

**Very quick background on me:**

\- Black male

\- 25, turning 26 in Jan.

\- Bachelors from an average state school. Majored in Finance, minored in Econ, 3.3 GPA

Right off the bat, I know - my GPA is low. I crammed my way through classes and had way too much fun. Nonetheless, what's done is done and I have to find other ways to strengthen my profile for graduate school. Though my GPA may not exactly show it, I do possess some level of intelligence haha!

I networked and interviewed extremely well with MS while I was in college - leading to an internship. Said internship developed into a full-time offer post graduation.

I began my career working as an analyst for MS Wealth Management. There was a decent amount of financial planning, but I also had the opportunity to conduct a lot research. As a result, I developed what I would consider a respectable foundation fundamentally and technically from an Equity/Fund research standpoint.

After 2 years I transitioned to a Boutique Wealth Management firm to take a role as the lead analyst. Yes, there's the piece of our business in which we construct portfolios in-house with various securities. However, there's a heavy focus on alternative investments and capital markets. We dabble greatly in Private Equity, Real Estate Development, and have raised capital to get our investors into a company pre-IPO. I've been able to lead projects and actually effect change here - nice change from MS.

It's been a good ride, but I'm going to transition out of my current firm. We've acquired a new CIO who will be changing things a little bit and management wants me to transition to the advisory side. Though I have the tools, I don't really want to be a Financial Advisor and pigeonhole myself this early in my career.

I'll save you time with my spiel, but long story short - I want to go into banking. At the very least I feel as though I need some pedigree on my resume. I've hit this wall and am experiencing a plateau as far as the eye can see.

As you can expect, I've decided on grad school. My plan is to take the GMAT in '23 and apply R1 in the fall of '23.

Currently, the goal is to score a 730+ on the GMAT. I'm studying now and will more than likely exercise the option of a tutor to help me as much as possible.

**My Dilemma:**

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it may be a waste of time to do an MBA if I don't plan on going to at least a T30 school (30 might be pushing it).

As a result, I'm looking at the likes of UNC, Georgetown, Texas, UVA, etc. (top Southeast schools - my region).

I'd look at some West Coast schools, maybe 1 or 2 Ivies, but I don't think I have a shot. Maybe I'm wrong?

My biggest concern right now is my background. I'm not an ex banker, consultant, startup founder, or some Big Four alumni. Sure I worked for Morgan Stanley, but it wasn't Banking, S&amp;T, or another coveted division of the bank. My GPA is also not stellar. How much are these things going to hurt me?

In addition, what should I try to do or avoid with my next career move? Do I have a better chance than I think? Am I correct? What can I do to better my chances? I just need some advice!

Thank you again!

**\*Disclaimer\*** I apologize in advance for any comments regarding schools. I don't mean to offend anyone and am speaking on what I've heard/learned. My goal is to be as candid as possible on this forum."

I spent my entire summer grinding leetcode, learning operating systems, studying c++, and doing a bunch of OA's and interviews as well. I even reneged a good internship offer for the one I took over the summer for the hopes of it making my resume more competitive (and I am most likely blacklisted, as I applied again this year but haven't receieved a single response). 

Well, all of that was for nothing, maybe I still have a massive skill issue, but out of every application I sent, I either got ghosted, straight up rejected, or bombed the phone/final. And the new grad cycle will only be harder, as not only are the interviews longer and more difficult, but I will be competing against people with previous quant internships as well. 

Just yesterday, I receieved a rejection after my phone round from my last possible chance at interning at a quant firm. I'm not gonna kill myself or anything, but I just feel dejected. I just wished I learned how to code or did way more math competitions in highschool, or shit I just wished I worked harder during college for that matter. Just feels like alot of the hard work and good opportunities I've had in the past are going to waste now."
yqpzqz,0,2022-11-09,Warning: Things are going to get tough,OGtenderLeaf2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yqpzqz/warning_things_are_going_to_get_tough/,"Most of this is speculation from observing trends in the industry so you can take this with a grain of salt. To clarify, a lot of these things are happening already but will increase in measure:

This may not be a surprise to many of you but there are going to be mass layoffs sweeping across the tech industry in the next few months. A lot of you may lose your jobs and end up in a job market that is unfavorable to you.

Competition for junior and mid-level positions is going to get ROUGH. I wouldn't be surprised if a degree becomes mandatory in order to cut down the applicant pool. The industry might even strictly require CS degrees and only interview students from top n schools. I'm saying this as someone who has reviewed applications for juniors at multiple companies.

Interview preference will be given to people with Big n internships and experience: people from lesser known companies will have trouble distinguishing themselves when there are dozens of other similarly qualified candidates competing. 

Screening processes will get more rigorous. CodeSignal and HackerRank OA's will be in place at most companies and expect near perfect results given the competition. What's LC medium now will become LC easy and a LC Hard will be LC Medium. System Design will be added at lower level interviews. Companies will come up with other ways to screen applicants that will make preparing for interviews more challenging.

In actual interviews the margin for error becomes slim. Companies are even less likely to take chances on candidates since there are so many of them.

Schools will fill up with post-grad students who go back to get a masters and wait out the recession. Masters level engineers will be ubiquitous in the industry. Masters degrees will be preferred by companies as a filter.

In the end, base salaries stay the same but there will be less employed devs. The devs on the bottom fall off the totem pole and go to SWE support roles (QA, Security ect.) or leave the industry.

Again things will be getting difficult and it may blindside a lot of people but you should still be able to make it work if you are vigilant. 

There WILL be jobs still, they just wont be as glamorous or as easy to get prior to the recession."

However, I managed to get to the third round of one particular big tech company that I'm interviewing for, and this is frankly my only chance of landing a good summer internship. Somehow, I managed to confuse 11am with 11pm (I swear I even double checked), and thought that the interview was at night rather than the morning. Because of that, I completely missed the interview.

I apologized profusely to the recruiter who is coordinating, and although he assured me that accidents do happen and I shouldn't worry about it, I can't help but think this will definitely affect my chances greatly. The next interview slot would only be a month later, and considering it's a very prestigious internship, I'll likely be set back extra hard from missing an interview + rolling basis acceptance. I hate myself so badly right now and can't get over this anxiety. Yikes."

Very Fortunately, I've been able to secure internships at the places in the title, and I'd like any of your guys' opinions and insights on the companies while I also share my priorities and what I'd like to get out of an internship.

**Priorities**

* Pay/Salary: Ideally maximizing my pay, but willing to sacrifice some of it if it means I get to have more of my other priorities
* Location / Commute: I'd like to commute from my current apartment if possible to save money from any sign-on bonus so that I don't have to use that on finding a new apartment or airbnb. I am tolerant of buying a used car that I'll be able to use past this internship however.
* Return Offer: If I got a return offer from this company, is this a company that I'd like to work for is flexible and has locations in either the DMV area or NYC. I'm not entirely sure what my future will look like with friends, family, and my relationships so I want that flexibility.
* Work Culture / Growth: I want to work at a company where I will be able to learn and grow in my career.

**Pros and Cons**

**Appian**

* Pros  

   * Culture/Return Offer - I really love their work culture. At the power day it seems that the culture is really cultivated on learning and growing, and they invested into the intern power day in order to achieve that. This includes learning time on your own, paid for confernece / e-courses. I could see myself returning here.
* Cons  

   * Pay/Salary - Not the highest compared to others. Going off of [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi/), (so I don't get in trouble for releasing sensitive information) is $44/hr and 6k Housing Stipend
   * Location/Commute - The HQ is far enough where public transportation is ridiculously long so I'd have to buy a car or an airbnb

**Yext (DC)**

* Pros  

   * Pay/Salary - Pretty good, $50/hr and 5k sign on bonus
   * Location / Commute - I could commute here with public transportation which is nice
   * Return Offer - They have a NYC office which I can hopefully transfer to if I get a return offer
* Cons  

   * Work Culture - Yext didn't invest too much into their interview process, so I don't know much about their work culture. Not to say that their work culture is bad. I just don't know anything

**Capital One**

* Pros  

   * Big name on resume - From what I've read on the reddit, the Capital One name will help in future recruiting opportunities for it just being on your resume
   * Pay/Salary - Pay range is variable based on location, but if I get my preferred location, it'll be the highest out of all offers
   * Location: My preferred location is in Boston (my first actually NYC, but it's all filled up). I'm really excited to be in a new city, and if I work in Boston, I wouldn't care about taking corporate housing or using the housing stipend to find an apartment
* Cons  

   * Location: I just received the call from the recruiter, and the location isn't guaranteed yet. I gave my top two choices of Boston and McLean, but spots there are tight, and I might be given Richmond or Dallas (which I really do not want)
   * Work Culture / Growth / Return Offer : I've seen on reddit posts that they do not like the work culture at C1 due to the ranking system they have there and because of the fact that they are hybrid between bank/tech instead of a full tech company

I know this was a lot, but given all these considerations and your guys' insight, what do you guys think I should go with?"
yqw2cg,2,2022-11-09,Should I transfer halfway through college,burneraccount908,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/yqw2cg/should_i_transfer_halfway_through_college/,"This has been a thought that keeps popping into my head and I want to know what others think.

I’m currently a sophomore at a large (hard to get into / very “good”) public university. Engineering major with a minor, consulting/big tech company/a less technical job that makes good money is the goal.

I’m someone who never would have thought i’d ever consider something like this, in no way am I seeking “the college experience” or anything like that, to start. I see the (fun) social aspect of college to be quite superficial, and in no way is that playing into this idea. All of this in centered around being successful / not failing life. 

A little background for how college has been so far:
I’m not doing great and I have nothing going for me / to assure me i’m going to do well at all. GPA is currently at a 3.4 calculated before this semester ends (don’t expect it to hurt it much more but it def won’t get better). In terms of classes, I feel as though i’m doing poorly, even at the things that shouldn’t be too difficult, and I feel as though i’m in a huge academic hole. I don’t see how much grades could really improve. Extracurriculars: none. I gave it my all in applying to professional clubs that would have very much helped my ass but I was never accepted, and that was when I didn’t look like a dumbass in comparison to my competition (a lot of people). Professional experience: I’ve had a couple stupid summer jobs but nothing ever remotely relating to my major or area or interest i.e. working at a restaurant. so none. social/networking: none. I have an extremely limited social circle, messed up and got “stuck” with a lot of higschool friends, have no connections to any job/internship/good club prospect and my parents/family have no such connections either. I can talk to people and make a good impression, but i’m bad at “putting myself out there”. 

My concerns for my situation:
I need to be good at something (grades, knowing people, etc) but none of that is going well and I don’t see how I could improve it. I’m ambitious and to get to where I want to be in my adult life I need to be good at something. when it comes to a job or an internship or any future prospect I don’t see why anyone would ever pick me, I know I wouldn’t.

I used to be extremely successful with everything I did. I had very very good grades at a well renowned private high school and got into many very good universities (didn’t attend because of money and I thought this “made sense”). I was on par or better than all the peers I can’t remotely compare myself to now (at the same college where they are doing just fine). I am extremely unhappy with my life now. I don’t do anything fun, I just work. My university is very work hard play hard, but all I do is work without success. I hate that I see zero indication of being the person I want to be in terms of success. making money matters to me. my parents worked their asses off for me and put a massive investment into my education and I couldn’t feel more guilty with myself for fucking it up especially when I used to go above and beyond for them before. I wish I could start all over from scaratch. if I had no one counting on me I seriously would consider dropping out with how much I hate this. i’m reaching a limit with how much effort i’ve been giving to and idk how much I can keep going. 

I find this school very unsupportive of students like me and again I feel really stuck in terms of the people I know and the social situation i’ve put myself in . Another goal of mine is to live somewhere else. my thought is that if I transfer away I can be someone i’m not, and at least attempt to build a network of people I know in a place where my desired field is much more accessible as an attempt to increase chances of being hired. even if that doesn’t work and I fuck that up too I could start my failed adult life in a place I want to live?"

And don't know which one is better. Can anyone give me some advices! Thanks a lot!

**TikTok:**

* Pros:
   * Larger scope. Interns can better participate in projects
   * Possibly higher bar for candidates.
   * Better location and payments for me
* Cons:
   * Maybe poor title compare with Amazon?
   * My position title is Front-end intern. Maybe less help for me if I applied for software engineer position in the future

**Amazon:**

* Pros:
   * Better title (FLAG) I think
   * Position title is Software engineer intern, maybe better than TikTok's
* Cons:

yqyjdk,2,2022-11-09,Looking for advice/opinions/conversation regarding CS transfer process from CC given mentioned circumstances,Alternative-Ad-5621,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/yqyjdk/looking_for_adviceopinionsconversation_regarding/,"Hi guys,

From SoCal (San Diego).

So basically, I attended CC for a couple years swapped majors a couple times (bio —&gt; jazz performance/MTech) all whilst having zero drive/feeling purposeless and was also going through some rough stuff at the time and that culminated in a really poor gpa. 

I took a gap year and worked a couple jobs while self learning how to code and really fell in love with it. At the tail end of that time period, I decided to meet with a counselor at the CC and create a plan. I decided to start off slow and do well to build my confidence back up and progressively increase difficultly as the semesters have passed. 

Well, It’s been a bit over a year and I wouldn’t even be able to recognize myself from 3 years ago. I’ve had straight A’s, love the material, and have really good relationships with all my profs too. 

So here’s the deal, I can’t stop worrying about competitiveness and I get super stressed and angry with myself because I calculated that even if I get straight A’s till I transfer, I can only climb up to a 3.4 (even with acad. renewal). I even have all my easy GE courses out of the way in addition to some other major specific coursework(the ones I did poorly on (lots of B’s and C’s) so now I’m left with all the tough CS major prep coursework to take simultaneously. 

Currently, it’s not too bad. I’m taking Calc, Java II, and Discrete (expecting 4.0) but worried for next semester. Ok I’m very worried. Im taking Calc II, C++ II, Data Structures, and Physics. Idk if it’s just me who this terrifies but yes I am terrified. The kicker is if I change my schedule or pace financial aide office said I lose my aide so yeah. My next and final semester I’m taking Physics II, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. 

I just feel like my stress of trying to get A’s every semester to bring up my GPA is driving me nuts at this point and only see things getting harder just before I can apply. 

I will be finished with coursework by end of fall next year which leaves me spring semester to work on some fun personal projects/ apply for internships or something? Also not sure if they’d make it onto the application if I apply early. 

Is there any way college admissions officers would see the big difference on my transcript between now and before I returned or maybe see my major prep coursework gpa vs GE gpa?? 

Which universities would you guys recommend I apply to given the situation and (fingers-crossed) 3.4 gpa?  (I have researched averages for accepted transfer GPAs into CS in CA but would still like opinions) 

Pls let me know if you guys have any advice, motivation, study tips for the courses I mentioned, really anything. I feel like while I am looking for advice, I’m also kinda venting while I’m stressed out studying for a Discrete midterm. 

Please feel free to comment in a casual way if you don’t feel like providing any constructive info or even vent yourself about your own experiences. Just talking with people would be nice right now. 

Sorry for the super long post by the way…"

I've got 2 options:

1. Graduate in May 2023. I have no offers yet and the hiring cycle is almost coming to an end. Realistically, I don't see myself at a good company and worst case I might have no offers. To make things worse, I'm an international student, so I really need a job.
2. Graduate in Dec 2023. Pay tuition (\~$13k) for additional semester and double major in Data Science. I feel more confident securing a decent Summer 2023 internship, so I'll mostly use that money to pay for the extra semester. Concerns are obviously graduating in the face of a full-blown recession by then. But, I'll definitely be more prepared.

Imagine yourself in my shoes, what would you have done? And, yes, I know no one can predict the future so here's a hypothetical scenario - we ""officially"" start a recession in say mid to late 2023. So, basically no matter option 1 or 2, I could be faced with the beginning of it."

I started off in IT building refurbished computers for about 4 months but reached a ceiling really fast as you can imagine. Took on a more challenging and diverse role as an IT intern for a software company. Fast forward 1 year and 8 months later and I am now Desktop Support Technician A+ certified and currently working on MMDA. However, I feel like I am only doing that cert to kind of align myself with where the company is going. I really want to start getting into networking. While I do have somewhat of a “playground” at work in that I have way more access to systems such as the firewall than a desktop support technician should have, I do not really have to configure anything and makes it hard to understand at a base level. I feel like my boss wants us to just be able to manage and maintain since it is pretty stable. But we have no senior network or systems admin guy who is spinning up vlans and new subnets who I can shadow and get my hands dirty configuring things from scratch. As such I have not been able to learn much about networking. I have read to do your own virtual labs but I have a hard time doing that as I learn much better with actual experience/hands on.  

My question is, are there entry level networking rolls that will have me be part of team that I can learn base networking skills like subnetting, lan and vlan etc? I want to know if there is anything out there that I can be a part of designing a network from the ground up to installing the actual hardware such as switches, routers and AP’s and making them work logically. I feel I could learn much better that way then apply my real world experience and then validate my skills with a cert. kind of how I did being an IT intern. Currently we are overrun with a hybrid Tier 2/system admin tasks that I do not get much of chance to much networking. Will a NOC position or MSP as part of the network team have anything entry level? Also always wondered who sets up temporary networks like a construction site with switches and wireless ap’s feel like I can learn a lot there. Any advice would help! Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance!

P.S. I hope it does not sound like I want high pay from the start. I will work for 20 K a year if that means I get to see how to build a network from scratch as part of my daily job!"

yr6upd,1,2022-11-10,"Upcoming “promotion” is lackluster, what to do?!",Stunning_Young_3191,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yr6upd/upcoming_promotion_is_lackluster_what_to_do/,"TL;DR: 1 year experience in technical, hands-on role. Both of my managers are wanting me to move into a more managerial role, which I want. Branch manager, with guidance from the president, is going to offer a “junior” level title with no promotion despite rock solid performance and rave reviews. What to do?

Background: I recently graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering with incredibly high marks. In addition to my education I have five years of full time site management for high end residential construction. Hired on as an intern one year ago, I was moved into a full time technical role nine months ago. I have preformed well, out performing employees who have three plus years of experience. I have taken on complex jobs and projects  and reduced expected timelines on large scale projects by 25-50% by optimizing workflows and my organizational skills. Both of my direct managers are incredibly impressed and have asked me what I want next, I responded that I would like to step into a more managerial role which is open and needs to be filled (let’s call this position XX). Position XX comes with much more responsibility, much of which I’ve already taken on because it’s such a crucial and without anyone filling the role projects have been neglected and someone needed to step up. Everyone agrees that it is an organic step and I’m the best fit for the role. I am excited for this.

Situation: After speaking with my managers this week they have told me that the branch manager has been in talks with the president of the company (based in a different state). They have decided to create a new role and offer me the position “Junior XX”. This is not a position that currently exists in the entire corporate structure (3000+ employees). My managers assured me this offer would not come with a pay cut, even though the title signifies a junior standing. The reasoning, as I’ve been told, is to allow for more merit based raises in the future. Start me lower so there is more room to grow. 

Problem: I feel as though the offer is somewhat insulting based off my performance, work ethic, and dedication. Taking a “Junior” role is something that I feel will look bad on a resume. Where I once showed get momentum, this will show a half step back, despite their reassurance that it is a lateral move. Even my managers acknowledge that I am qualified for the role XX. After speaking with others who have had position XX I was expecting the job title (again, the junior role has never been offered before) and a roughly 15% promotional raise to be on par with others with role XX and equivalent performance. I know that this role is in the budget for the fiscal year, which is when I am tentatively scheduled to begin (coming up soon). My managers also expected a raise with the promotion. Because of this I feel that the fact that a pay raise will not be offered is not simply to allow me more growth in the future (if I’m worth the role, I’m worth the pay) and is instead a way to save the department some overhead cost while filling a crucial role. The branch manager is know to be a penny pincher. 

Advice Inquiry: I will be sitting down with the branch manager and president of the company within the next couple of weeks to discuss my part. I was given this information in advance by my manager so that I was not blindsided. After the offer has been extended (Junior XX, no raise), what should be my plan of action? Is a junior level role as a lateral move a bad idea for career progression? Am I right that the merit based claim is more than likely a way of saving the department some overhead expense while also filling the much needed role? I have begun job searching (most roles starting at more than my wage plus the 15% raise I was expecting), should this not work out… should I let them know I am serious about moving on? I hate ultimatums. I know that they are desperate to fill the role, me being the only internal employee capable of undertaking it (manager’s words, not mine) and the current state of external new hires is somewhat dire. What would you do?

Thank you in advance for all of your help. I am generally a very efficient decision maker but I am having a hard time determining what I should do. I am not letting anyone know I am displeased (other than my direct manager, who warned me and is equally displeased). Excited to hear all the advice!

Edit: I’m in the engineering industry."

Fine, it's your loss.",admiral_zerberos,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/yrb0w4/you_want_me_out_on_day_2_fine_its_your_loss/,"I repost this from r/MaliciousCompliance, because I was told that, even if there is compliance, it is not malicious.

  
They  say that fate is a bitch - when you think you are prepared for anything, it throws you a curveball. What they don't say, is what happens next - when you are at your lowest, fate steps in and you hit a  home run.

Some background info:

The past couple of years were really hard. I left a nasty job in 2019 as a technical support in a call center to return to my studies and become a merchant mariner. Initially everything went smoothly, then TheVarus hit and suddenly it became almost impossible to me to get my degree, because the University required a 3-month internship on a vessel in a time only a few ships could accept new recruits and all you needed were the right connections, something I didn't have.

Still, I managed to graduate and got my diploma, only to be hit with the next obstacle - a bureaucratic nightmare: merchant mariners require a large stack of certificates to even be able to go aboard, and that doesn't include the ones needed to do specific types of jobs. I had the experience, but lacked a couple of certificates, and after 6 months of going up and down, the final one and most crucial for the job I sought was declined due to ""missing a few signatures"" on my documents.

I felt like trash. This whole charade cost me a fortune. I wasted a lot of time and I was deep in debt from borrowing money from my best friends to deal with all of this. So, I decided to throw it all away and apply for a job, any job, that can allow me to get back on my feet.

Through Lisa, one of my best friends' cousin, I landed an interview for a desk job in a courier service. It wasn't anything special, I could get a better salary almost anywhere else, but I could start working  immediately, so I went for it.

I was interviewed by the Head Honcho, Mr. Big Boss, who, as I was told, owned the real estate which the Service rented. He was this  stereotypical ""mob-muscle-gone-rich"" type of person - the red eyes, the  thick neck, the gold chain, the leather jacket and the latest model Mercedes S-Class screamed ""Stay away"". What repulsed me the most, however, was that during the entire interview he refused to look me in the eyes even once, as if I was this worthless maggot who polluted his air with my presence.

On Day one I was told that the job was hard and demanding. But the job was easy, I picked up almost immediately and within 1 hour I was already behind a desk and dealing with customers, something that others usually didn't do from Day One, as I was told by Lisa, who was going to be my coworker.

I didn't like the job though. Aside from it being dull and monotonous, the customers made a lot of scenes and the air reeked of hypocrisy and intrigues between the coworkers. So, during a coffee break by the end of the shift, I joked with Lisa that I would probably leave after 6 months.

On the next day I had just started my day shift when Big Boss parked his S-Class on the lot before the office. He opened the door, said ""Good morning"" and told me to come outside.

Big Boss: How was your first day yesterday?  
Me: It was very good, I even started dealing with customers.  
Big Boss: I see. Look, OP, I've decided to let you go.  
Me: Let me go? Why?  
Big Boss: I was told that you didn't have the intention to stay here for long.  
Me: What do you mean?  
Big Boss: You were saying that you'd be here for 6 months and then you will leave. I can't have that. Besides, you're too risky.  
Me: How come?  
Big  Boss: Your CV screams that you want to go on a ship. What guarantees can you give me that you won't go the moment they hire you?  
Me: Look, I've been dealing with these morons for years. I am tired of their BS. I decided to settle down.  
Big Boss: I don't believe you. So, I am sorry but things must end here.

This pissed me off. I know that I got myself into this, due to my big mouth, but I didn't expect to be ratted out by Lisa, who smiled at me and acted friendly, and yet appeared to be a disgusting hypocrite - the total opposite of my best friend, who is a real sweetheart.

Me: Fine, but it's your loss.  
Big Boss: How come?  
Me: You didn't even give me a chance to see how good of an employee I can be.  
Big Boss: If you are so good, then you'll find something else.

So I left. I walked around the city, seething with anger, but was somewhat relieved that I wouldn't spend time working in that snakepit. And it motivated me: ""Hey, I am better than this, I can find a better job in no  time"".

And, as I was looking for job offers, I saw it. The one thing I have been searching for. The Job that would pay me three times more than the Big Boss offered me, and would allow me to be on a nice ship and not go through the rusty coffins that some companies in my country still used - a receptionist on a cruise ship, a position which I was the perfect candidate, because 6 years ago I took a summer job as such in a beautiful sea resort hotel, so I had the necessary experience. So I applied for it and passed my interviews with flying colours within a matter of days.

Now, as I am preparing my documents, I wonder whether I should go to the office where Lisa works and brag that I will be on a ship to the Canaries and probably the Caribbean while she broils in her pettiness. I'll probably pass by shortly before I leave.

If any of you gets in a similar situation, remember this - things will eventually work out. All it takes is patience.

TLDR - I find a sucky job, I get fired the next day, boss dares me to find something better, I do almost immediately."

yrhm39,25,2022-11-10,"A+ certified after ~5 weeks of studying, resources used and tips",finnagonnawanna,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/yrhm39/a_certified_after_5_weeks_of_studying_resources/,"**Background info**: I'm a senior majoring in IT but I wasn't able to get an internship. I figured the next best thing is to stack my resume with as many certifications as possible and then focus on personal projects once I'm burned out on certs. This sub provided me with A LOT of good resources so I figured I would give back to the community after getting certified. 

**Disclaimer**: I've built my own computer before and have been troubleshooting hardware/software problems for my family my entire life. This, along with being a student, means that about 50% of the 1101 and about 70% of the 1102 were things I already knew or was at least familiar with. 

**General tips:**

\- Make a habit out of studying every single day. No days off. I set a goal of studying for at least 2 hours a day using the Pomodoro Technique (25 mins studying, 5 mins break) but sometimes I would feel extra motivated and study for 4 or 5 hours a day. I still had to balance part-time work, full-time school, and going to the gym, but I still found that I had plenty of time to study every day with some sacrifices (e.g., I quit playing competitive games because I realized they were a huge time sink with no real benefit). 

\- Immerse yourself into the world of IT as much as possible. I religiously browsed this sub and /r/ITCareerQuestions every day to try and become familiar with terminology and understand other people's experiences. Seeing other people become certified and reading about their journeys was very motivating for me. Also, as funny as it sounds, I watched an episode of Mr Robot every day before bed as a reward for getting through the day. It was cool watching it and doing the Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme at things I recognized or understood. Great show btw. 

**Study method:** 

\- I used the Pomodoro Technique to watch Messer videos and then took notes on the things I didn't fully understand. I'm a senior right now and a lot of the content in the A+ is review for me so I didn't necessarily have to write down every little detail. I found myself skimming through some videos or watching certain videos at 1.5x speed. 

\- After getting through the YouTube videos, I started taking Messer practice exams. My goal was to take 1 exam per day and then at the end of the review I would make a ""Things to review"" section on MS Word with the things I got wrong. 

\- Finally, I created Anki flashcards with the things I got wrong. I also purchased the mobile Anki app ($25) and found it VERY helpful because it allowed me to study on the go. In between sets at the gym? Easy 5 minutes of studying. Slow at work? 10 minutes of studying. On the throne and don't feel like doom scrolling? 15 minutes of studying. I did 2 hours of studying every day but that's not counting all the times I was able to use the Anki app throughout the day. Again, I highly recommend purchasing the mobile app or at least using the desktop app since it's free. 

**1101 resources used:**

\- Professor Messer YouTube videos

\- Professor Messer practice tests

\- Dion practice tests 

\- Informatik Labs on Youtube for PBQ resources (these videos were VERY helpful and definitely helped prepare me for the real PBQs) 

Total investment: \~$50 not counting the voucher itself 

I can't say enough good things about Professor Messer. A+ instructor (heh...) and an overall excellent resource. The Dion practice tests were OK but I found they mostly served to demoralize me more than anything.

My first time taking the Messer tests I scored the following: 72, 83, 85 

Messer retake scores (after waiting a few days to make sure I didn't just memorize the right answer): 86, 88, 94 

My first time taking the Dion tests I scored the following: 77, 72, 72, 75. 

Most people say if you're scoring 70+ the first time on the Dion tests you're ready to take the real thing, and I generally agree. However, I would say that there was a good amount of material on the Dion tests that wasn't on the 1101 objectives or was just outdated in general (probably about 5-10 percent of the questions imo). I know that the actual test will have some questions like this that don't count towards your exam score, but in my experience there were only 1 or 2 per exam rather than the 5-10 percent on the Dion tests.

This frustrated me and after taking the 4th test I decided to just retake the Messer exams instead of continuing to take anymore Dion tests. Not to bash Dion or anything as there were certainly great things about his tests that the Messer exams didn't have (like the fact that everything is streamlined through Udemy but the Messer exams are simply just a pdf document). Anyway, at the end of the day it's just a matter of personal preference. More resources can only help you.

**Total time spent studying for the 1101**: 3 weeks 

**Score on the real exam:** 711

**Closing thoughts on the 1101:**  This test was HARD. When I was studying for the actual material, I didn't find the material hard at all. Sure there was a good amount of memorization that had to be done, but there wasn't anything abstract or difficult to understand. However, my biggest gripe upon taking the actual test was the fact that almost all of the questions had more than one right answer, or it felt like NONE of the answers were right and it was like I was choosing the least wrong one. Sometimes I would finish reading a question and know the answer to it right away, but the answer was nowhere to be found in the options COMPTIA gave. None of the practice tests I took prepared me for this even though a lot of them had the ""choose the BEST answer"" format. 

**1102 resources used:**

\- Professor Messer YouTube videos

\- Professor Messer practice tests

\- DeanCyber and CertBlaster on YouTube for PBQ resources

Total investment: \~$25

My first time taking the Messer tests I scored the following: 81, 83, 83 

Messer retake scores: 96, 96, 96 (lol) 

**Total time spent studying for the 1102**: 2 weeks 

**Score on the real exam:** 740

**Closing thoughts on the 1102:** This test was MUCH easier and I found a lot of the questions to be more common sense than anything else. I didn't take nearly as many notes when I was watching the Messer videos, and I was able to speed through the YouTube playlist in a matter of days. I was already very familiar with Windows and Linux which helped a lot. 

Here's an acronym that helped me with memorizing the malware removal steps:

IQ (think of a brain to help visualize this)

DR (think of a doctor to help visualize this)

SEE (think of eyes to help visualize this) 

**Closing thoughts on the A+ overall:** The A+ was a lot harder than I thought it would be as evidenced by my scores. The 1101 was very difficult, but the 1102 was pretty manageable. If I was going to fail one, it definitely would have been the 1101 so study more for that one. Also, if you're studying and you think ""damn I really hope this isn't a question on the exam"" IT WILL BE. Everything is fair game on the test itself so study EVERYTHING, especially the stuff that intuitively seems difficult. 

Onto the Sec+ next!"

I told her I wanted to leave my job but I didn’t mean I would just up and quit which I explained. But I don’t think it was well received by them. I mentioned in another post how my current team is leading me back to what I thought I lost and how I want to act on it. I have been taking on courses on LinkedIn learning but I don’t have a way to put it in practice. I have tried to do it in current role but I only keep getting “great idea” and dies there.

What should I do to handle this situation?",AjinoJacky,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yrljx1/i_have_a_job_a_starting_next_monday_but_still/,"Not sure what flair applied and where to post, but I need some advice.

I got 2 job offers, with job A starting earlier than job B. I accepted both, and worked at A first, asking B to delay the start day by 1 month so that I have more time to evaluate the pros and cons between the two, also to get some paychecks and avoid visa restrictions for unemployment time.

Now, I have two more days to tell my boss I quit/decide,  and I’m still dead stuck about my decision.

I’m not really satisfied with job A. A’s annual pay is $20K less. Job A is 20 miles away from my relatives and I’m living rent-free with them. I’m the only developer there and have been struggling with projects alone &amp; my supervisor doesn’t have enough coding skills to mentor me. Most legacy code is outsourced. There’s no document -&gt; Almost no space to learn and grow. And I’m quite burnt out with the 2-hour commute daily. The pros are that I’m not lonely; it’s a fun metropolitan; it’s better financially.

Job B's cons are not having A's pros, and also a risk of being not a good job as I imagine? But it is more systematic with the onboarding process (saw their plans, quality unknown), better benefits, bigger IT team. I have to pay rent and utilities, but B’s in a cheaper area. There are some disconnected friends there though. 

All of that aside, how to make better decisions (and quicker) when considering 2 offers in such a short time frame? Any criteria I should also consider? I’ve listed the pros and cons. Intend to ask my boss for a performance evaluation, if it’s not good and he wants something I can’t provide, that’s more reason for me to quit.

The things holding me back are my fear of struggling again in a new job, loneliness, and going against my relatives’ wishes (they think it’s better for me to stay close to the family). And of course the difficult awkward talk I will have with my boss and family if I quit and move (everyone thinks I settled in here).

Risk management wise:

If I quit, can job A sue me or do anything to me if I leave on extremely short notice? Will it affect my career (I don’t plan to put it on my resume if I quit after a few months, but background checks can find out)?

If I stay, what should I do with B since I delayed one month already? That will leave a bad reputation? Are there any other risks overall? I know words fly around.

Being a fresh grad with no internships and little tech experience, the opportunity to learn, be mentored, and work in a team is important to me. Pardon my English, panic, and the unwise course of action I took."

yrp8c3,18,2022-11-10,Too old for internship?,redblueplum,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/yrp8c3/too_old_for_internship/," I am 35yo, have been out of a job for 2 years. I am in the US now doing a Ms in CS. I have a undegrad degree in Engineering of which I used for only 1 year as an electrical engineer, after which I switched career to manufacturing in a non-tech related supplier facing role. I have been getting huge setback in getting internships for summer 2023, which is required for this degree. Every other coursemate around me is at least getting some call backs, even those with less tech experience than me, whether it be in skills or tech work experience.

I know networking is important for someone my age, but I have none. I am so busy trying to catch up with the others in tech skills that I don't have much time to network. I tried to connect with people through Linkedln and such. Again, I feel extremely insecure because of my age and non-experience which is unusual for people of my age. Maybe recruiters just don't know how to put me in a box. I am neither young nor experienced.

What else can I do?  I thought the fact that I got admitted to this Ms program means I might stand a chance to break into tech but I am not sure if the school is just a scam now lol.

Ps. I am trying to specialize in Java, and developing portfolio that incorporates other stacks, React, CSS, cloud, Python etc. Still building my portfolio. I should say that I just started switching in the beginning of this year. I have catch up to maybe around intermediate level of core Java."

I am applying for SWE/SDE roles. At one company, it recommends similar jobs based on those I have applied to. They are actually the same job title, posted a few days in between each other.

yrrxco,69,2022-11-10,LinkedIn vs Citadel,Plastic_Sale_1224,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/yrrxco/linkedin_vs_citadel/,"Hi, really struggling to decide between these two options - not making a poll as people just vote for the higher $$, but net pay will end up being somewhat similar anyways as Cit is 11 weeks and LinkedIn 16 weeks. Both SWE Internships. Cannot do both, only one over the summer.

LinkedIn NYC is on work that I find really interesting (distributed systems), Citadel team undecided.

The way that I've broken it down is that Citadel seems like a unique opportunity to experience the finance industry, and it'll probably be better for re-recruiting at other quant firms.

However, I am fairly sure that I would not like to return there full time from too many horror stories (even the Blind score is way lower than most tech firms with 3.4 @ cit and 3.6 @ securities respectively), and didn't like the vibes during my interviews. It seems like the general sentiment is on a slider of tc, culture, engineering, etc - it's maxed out on the tc and minimized everything else. But there's always a chance I land a good team I suppose.

Whereas LinkedIn is sort of the opposite where I've heard good things about all those, but with still great pay as well. Again, I also know I'll like the work I'll be doing, and it's also a desirable location with NYC.

Furthermore, in the current shaky market conditions, I heard LinkedIn still gave out 80%+ return offers as they only recruit from interns, while Citadel was a lot lower (not 100% sure though). I really don't want to be offerless in the next season and scrambling to find something. But I guess an argument for Cit here is that if I do end up getting a return, HFT firms are more resistant to layoffs as they tend to do better in high volatility environments, but does this matter if turnover is already high and I might have to re-recruit after a year or two of fulltime if this ends up being a prolonged recession?

But again - I'd love to interview for JS/HRT/Jump come new grad and Cit would prob help out with that, but I don't want to bank a new grad offer entirely on these firms.

Any thoughts?"

I have started to work as a Data Analyst intern, they expect me to automatize some stuff they do by writing python scripts for specific tasks. My coding experience was limited to Java and C++ before that. Now, every day at work I am learning new things (which is very nice) but my problem is the way I code is different than other people at work. For example, I tend to use hardcore methods to deal with problems that may involve for loops, multiple if statements, or other long operations. In the end, I have usually been told ""this is nice you did the task but I would do it this way:"" and they rewrite my code with using specific functions and libraries.

I started to lean more on list comprehensions and famous python libraries but is there a way or source that you can advise me on to improve my style to a more precise, short, and efficient one?

I know it is a general question and this will improve with my overall comprehension of Python but my question is basically that is there a source that teaches to code efficiently and neatly? Or how can I learn more about Pyhton-way-coding like list comprehensions? "

A Ph.D. (EE) student here. I am planning to graduate by next summer and looking for ML/AI/DS research/industry-related roles. I  had three ML/DL internships in the past, two from research institutions and one from Amazon. I started grinding LeetCode in October. Have solved 170+ problems till now (100 Easy, 70 Med). So far I have appeared in three CodeSignal screenings, but struggling to go past this. For Netflix it's 45min 2 ML easy and medium coding problems, for Pinterest, it's 70min standard 1 easy, 2 medium Leetcode problems, for HRT it's all three medium Leetcode problems in 75min. Every exam is very different and honestly, I am pissed off! Tried couple of CodeSignal practice tests and I am around \~700.  I am having mental stress given the current layoffs and uncertain days in the future by the time I graduate. This is my 6th year in my Ph.D. and I have a family to support.  I need honest and kindly advise from all of you for a moral boost. I consider myself hardworking and resilient, but everything around me is just hitting so hard now. I am planning to apply aggressively from Jan 2023. Please leave some honest advice or hacks to get past this tough time and CodeSignal tests."
ys0zzb,3,2022-11-10,Graduation Advice,lt_ligma23,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ys0zzb/graduation_advice/,"Need help determining when to graduate. I go to a T10 CS school and I can basically graduate Spring, Summer, or Winter of 2024 or 2025 (i am class of 2025). I have a decent internship for next summer and they give our return offers to 90% of interns but the return offer TC isn't as high as im looking for to be completely honest. I have potrayed myself as a junior to this company and i can graduate Spring 2024 and hypothetically take their return offer but I am leaning towards choosing to graduate in Winter 2024 and hope to get a better internship in summer 2024 and take their return offer or apply to jobs in that season. 

I have heard the return offer for my internship would be around 75k and the median for levels reflects that salary for entry level. 

Should I hypothetically plan to take the return offer, or should i prep for another internship szn?

If i were to graduate in winter 2024, how would i apply to Fulltime jobs in July - November of 2024? Does the season start earlier for winter graduates or do u have to ask employers to move start dates? Any advice from winter grads on how recruiting goes?"
ys1fgy,154,2022-11-10,"What do you do when you've wasted your college degree, can't land a job, yet can't commit to any other career path?",ThrowThinkAway,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ys1fgy/what_do_you_do_when_youve_wasted_your_college/,"I graduated with a degree in Business MIS, but quite frankly I think it was the wrong choice. It's extremely difficult to land a job in this very diverse field, especially because my degree was broad and yet not too specific or in-depth on any one particular skillset. As are business majors, it's really about networking and who you know on top of getting an internship to get over the bullshit ""entry level"" years of experience requirement. And because I didn't network much, and couldn't land an internship because lockdown screwed me for a pandemic graduation... Yeah. I've been boned without a full time job for the past 2 years even though I've tried and applied so much.

Throw in depression, anxiety, ""gifted kid"", undiagnosed ADHD I only just discovered and diagnosed after college at age 24, and not yet diagnosed but suspected to be on the spectrum... Holy fuck I am screwed. I really don't know what to do with my life or career, and living in one of the highest HCOL areas in the US... Being able to go after a ""nice passion"" career is a luxury a lucky few can afford. And I'm definitely unlucky.

I detest late stage capitalism and the likes of narcissistic, sociopathic or greedy corporations, which makes me wonder why the F I chose business as a degree. Oh right, I didn't really choose it. I was having a nervous breakdown early in college because I couldn't choose my major and life path, thus some career counselors and friends suggested this diverse and lucrative major, MIS. Well guess how unhappy I am that I listened to them? It's not even a good degree, I didn't learn shit in college despite getting a 3.8 GPA. 

I fear the possibility that I might need to either go back to college and waste even more years and thousands of dollars I don't have to get a 2nd piece of paper. And what if that 2nd piece of paper is ALSO equally useless since, you know, the degree is just the floor now, but every entry level wants X years of experience? And of course if I was wrong the first time (which takes a lot of guts to admit because no one, myself included, wants to admit they wasted 4-6 years of their life for something useless they end up hating) I can definitely be wrong the 2nd time too.

But the thing I fear the most is that I will make a trade off through any decision that will close other doors in life. Any decision or choice takes time, takes money, and will simultaneously close other possibilities as you grow older and miss opportunities. Years of your life can be spent for a ""mistake"" or ""failure"", and then it is up to you whether you learn from it and grow or not. 

If I chase after the most lucrative careers like in tech to seek financial security, what if I end up hating the soul draining path I am on and having ignored the subtle calls in my heart to seek out the passions I don't yet know or the ones I can't yet risk it all for? What if I take the risk and go for a career of passion, something of altruism or related to my hobbies or arts, but then it all comes tumbling down as I struggle to make end's meet?

Choices, choices, I can't analyze or predict it all. And in trying to account for every pro, every con, every possibility and risk, I have been a sitting duck for the past 7 years as a 25 year old loser. How does someone even get themselves out of this grave they dug into?"

ys2st6,1,2022-11-11,I don’t know to pick between passion and opportunity,Fragrant_Homework290,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ys2st6/i_dont_know_to_pick_between_passion_and/,"  The title doesn’t seem that interesting but for background, I am a student (F18) at UT Austin admitted into a program (computer science) that people would kill to have. I had no prior experience to coding until this semester which was pretty rocky for me learning how to code from scratch at a university level, on top of that dealing with a family emergency and depression. My rocky experience has made me develop mixed feelings about whether I see myself doing this in the future. 

I took this major because I knew that this can open many avenues outside of strictly stem like art (specifically working with Pixar animation) or video games, plus the good pay for a high demand job seals the deal. Despite the pros, I can’t say I have the intense passion for it that gets me curious to learn more, nor do I believe I have the skill for, and for some reason I don’t see myself in the place that sophomores, who have gotten internships after freshman year, are in but I’m always applauded for getting into a high demand program especially in one that will ensure a 6 figure job. 

Currently I am struggling and working as much as I can despite my mental health struggle, and yes I am going to therapy, which is making me have second thoughts about wether I feel like this is right for me. 

For further background I worked as a dispatcher before starting college, which despite the long busy hours and stressful calls, I loved it because I was doing a service to my community and oddly enough I liked the customer service aspect to it. 

I’ve always been passionate about helping and serving others which has led me to thoughts of getting certified as an emt, be a therapist/ counselor or nursing assistant(to be frank I just started thinking about this today after crying about a coding project and calling my sister). I’m still young so I don’t know what’s good for me and I just need some advice"
ys33px,9,2022-11-11,Rejected from internship - quite surprised,FernandoT9,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ys33px/rejected_from_internship_quite_surprised/,"Hey all, throwaway for privacy/legal issues. I recently got rejected from a position where I felt that I interviewed very well so I wanted to share/ask some questions.

I'm currently a CS student and was interviewing for a SWE intern position at a pretty big company. I just went through 2 rounds of interviews (after the initial coding screen).

First round they asked 3 questions. 1 Leetcode easy which I solved in &lt;5 minutes (I've seen the question before). 1 Leetcode medium which I got a bit stuck on, but after discussion/explaining my thought process with the engineer, I was able to solve it. The third question was ""just for fun"" (interviewing engineer said usually the 2 questions would take up more time so he's just asking extra questions - this one was more of an open-ended question where I implemented my own class, it sounded like it did everything the interviewer wanted it to do. Left feeling pretty good, but a bit nervous about the trip up on the medium question, but I did end up getting an invite for a 2nd interview.

Second round, they gave me some pre-written code and told me to add some features to it. Everything went pretty well imo, I was able to add every feature that they asked. I even made sure after implementing the feature to run the code and double check with the engineer that it was satisfactory. At no point did I really feel stuck or confused. Again I finished early and the interviewer used that time to ask me about my past experiences. Left this interview feeling super confident.

Fast forward to yesterday, I got an email saying I was rejected. Now, I've been rejected from roles I really want before, so I'm not particularly new to rejections, but for every single one of those, I've left the interview feeling unsure/bad about my performance - usually because I didn't finish or didn't account for all edge cases. But not for this one, I left every interview feeling pretty good, because after all, I solved all their questions, usually this was enough. This one stung a bit more than usual because it was an interview that I felt very very confident about - at no point did the interviewers indicated to me that they were unhappy with my solution or that my solution was wrong or even suboptimal, I was completely under the impression that I did very well. Now perhaps that is on me for being too confident, but to the fact that the interviewer seemed happy with my answer + ending the technical portion early/asking an extra question gave me the feeling that it went well.

My question now is is it worth it to reach out to my interviewer and ask what I did wrong/how I can improve. Another question of mine is that is it possible that my 1st interview was what caused me to get rejected? I was under the impression that if I did poorly on my first interview, they wouldn't schedule a 2nd interview - and the Leetcode med on the first interview was the only question I got semi-stuck on. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TLDR: felt that I did really well on both interviews, got rejected, kinda salty because I didn't feel that the feedback the interviewer gave during the interviewer was indicative of the result."

I've received an offer from Apple for a Design Verification Internship in Cupertino, CA and an offer from Atlassian in NYC for a SWE internship (I choose what team to join, leaning towards cloud atm). While I'm grateful to be in a position like this, I'm genuinely stuck on what to do. 

My dilemma doesn't really involve the roles of the internships: I'm pretty interested in both software and hardware (honestly the choice of what to do is a problem for later, i.e. next app season), and I've been alternating between software and hardware heavy semesters. I'm pretty sure that I'll learn a lot at either company anyway. 

To be honest, I don't think that I would go back to Apple even with a return offer because I want to stay in NYC after I graduate. I really liked both of the interview processes though, and genuinely wouldn't mind a summer in Cupertino, but staying in NYC is also appealing. 

My decision mainly comes down to the value of both companies on a resume: I thought Atlassian was pretty well known in the tech industry but from talking with my friends and Apple recruiter they had no clue what it was, which indicates to me that maybe I should go towards Apple for the resume boost. Is Apple that much more reputable to warrant picking it over Atlassian?"

So my situation is like this:

I am an undergrad computer science student in my last semester(Graduating in March) with a GPA of 87.5 on a 100 scale(\~about 3.5 on a 4 scale). I am studying at a very good university(which is also fairly competitive) outside the USA.

I currently have no published papers but I am in the process of working on publishing a paper in computer vision with one of my professors in the upcoming months - as far as research experience goes this is all I have.

Work-wise I have been working in the semiconductor industry as a software engineer intern for the past 1.5 years at one of the fortune 100 companies.

Letters of recommendation - I have not approached any professor yet as I don't know anyone besides the one I am working on a paper with. Stanford states there is a requirement of 3 recommendation letters. I guess I could ask my team lead at work to write me a letter + my professor who is considered an expert in deep learning at my university + a visiting industry lecturer(not a professor, does this even count?) who teaches entrepreneurship at my university.

I think my application could be decent but I hear people on this sub saying that 3.7-4 GPA students with research experience and great letters of recommendation get rejected from Stanford.

If I could apply in March after my last semester I would probably have a 90 GPA and a paper published but unfortunately the deadline is in December :(

To sum up - do applications like this get accepted at all to Stanford considering the huge demand? Can this application with a great SOP be enough? I am planning on being a full-time student and pay my own tuition

Would be happy to hear any thought/tip/advice

Zendesk and Apple will release results next week, kinda curious what y'all think.

Apple IS&amp;T - Partner Solutions and Technology Team: 

Everything I've read online tells me to stay far away from this organisation. The role seems more business-like than coding. Still, the Apple Brand name is really hard to turn away from and the people seem nice.

Zendesk - Productivity Tooling Team:

Great internship programme by all accounts. The projects seem really interesting. The only issue is the uncertainty from the company being acquired. Probably the highest chance of an internship offer being rescinded.

PayPal - Digital Wallets Team:

I'll likely be working on Backend stuff. However, the TC for full-time is less than Apple and Zendesk in my country. Not sure if they'll do layoffs soon.

Morgan Stanley - Cybersecurity Division: 

Incredible internship programme and great tech culture. From what I'm told, they're planning to send the interns to New York for a week which I'm quite excited for. Still, it's a bank, and it's not exactly a SWE internship. 

I'm looking at full-time TC as well, and it seems that for salary: Zendesk &gt; Apple IS&amp;T &gt; PayPal &gt; MS. 

P.S: If it helps, I'm based in Singapore, so I'll be interning in the Singapore branch for the above companies. Would greatly appreciate any thoughts on these internships

So I had an interview with Microsoft for the cloud solutions architect intern and made it to the final round, for which I needed a quick response as I had a return offer from another firm.

They immediately answered with the following: 

“We are not done with intern hiring, so there is a chance you could receive an offer depending on candidates that decline or if another position opens up. I did want to provide a status update as some of the other candidates have received a final interview round response whether it be an offer (or not).

I know it’s not ideal to not have a concrete offer from us at this time so we understand if you wish to move forward with your other opportunity instead; however, do let me know if you wish for us to keep you in mind as additional internship availabilities open up in the short-term which, could allow us to move forward with an offer at a later time.”

its been 2 weeks.

Shall I give up? My dumb ass also rejected the firm offer and now i have nothing.

Where should I go from here?,No-Strength4548,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ysmszt/are_internshipsapprenticeships_a_thing_for_self/,"Backstory: I’m about to turn 30 and had a premature midlife crisis around a year ago. I have a degree (exercise science) and have worked in management, sales, as well as real estate… I came across programming at a point in my life when I had given up and hit rock bottom. I’ve always been a high performer, but got 0 satisfaction from my last 2 jobs and felt stuck. When covid hit, things got really bad for me.. I had to resign from my new job due to health reasons (which really bothered me because I felt like a failure), a family death, and my mental health went way down hill to the point where I wanted everything to end. Then I found programming…

I love developing - being able to transform an idea and share it with the world fascinated me and gave me something to put my mind to which, honestly, saved my life.. I started teaching myself python and completed a couple online courses along with a few basic projects. Then I discovered Unity and found I really really really love working within Unity which led to C# of course.. I have been teaching myself C# from online courses &amp; boot camps, and still doing a bit with python on the side. However, I’m discouraged because I know Unity was designed to be used in game dev and always read how game dev is so cut throat, the work-life balance is trash, and pay isn’t all there. BUT the silver lining I found is that Unity is being used more &amp; more for other industries along with VR/AR. I  have so many ideas for various training simulations, games, and apps but just feel stuck because I have no guidance. 

Where should I go from here? I want to break into tech and provide value, but I don’t feel like I’m ready because I’m still so new and self taught. I left my family/friends in Florida and moved to DTC (part of Denver known as Denver Tech Center) because I wanted a fresh start and to be around likeminded individuals. I found a lot of the people I’ve tried meeting in tech since moving here are almost “secretive” or act as they’re too good to be friends with a newbie because they think I want to take their jobs lol. I know there’s so many other people with work experience job hunting and all the new job  postings require “professional experience” which is what I need.

I refuse to pay for another degree since I’m still paying one back and it’s very stressful. That’s why I decided to teach myself and try finding an internship where I could learn real world, valuable information. My main worry is that what I’m learning and teaching myself will be useless because with my past degree and all my other education, I never used even half of what I was demanded to learn. All the “internships” I can find are for recent CS/Engineering grads or training programs from those sketchy companies like Catalyte where you sign on the dotted line and your life is there’s to put you where they choose. 

Very sorry for the long read, I just really want to figure out where I go from here and what I need to learn for someone to take a chance on me."

 I’m an undergraduate International Relations major nearly finishing his 5th semester of college. Currently, I have regrets about taking International Relations. Don’t get me wrong. I love learning IR theory and geopolitics, which led me to study the major in the first place, but as I lean toward the end of my studies, I think about the opportunities gained from finishing them. My goals when I first started were too idealistic, hoping for a job in the Department of State in the U.S. However, I have seen many people that have taken IR say they haven’t found relevant jobs even a couple of years after college. It makes me worry a lot about my future. Even if I do things that distinguish myself on my resume, like an internship for my degree, I am still worried. 

If I were to change my major, it would probably be a stem major like Computer Science. During the past year, I had an epiphany that I love learning about everything, including the deeper perspectives. Apart from my studies, I motivate myself to develop my knowledge and aptitude in Calculus and the sciences, and even more consistently, I have been delving into programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and JS. I know it is usually never late to study something else, but I can be really impatient and disappointed with myself in matters that dictate my life.  

Finally, I would like advice on what to do or not do."

I'd say my resume is fairly good, and I've had it checked by my university career counselor and friends in the industry. 

I do have prior experience (2 short internships in high school, national service/military in my home country where I also did software dev work, and a summer internship after my freshman year). Apart from that, I also have my favorite projects listed. I do have a full stack web app and a mobile app (none of them were class projects).

Apart from that, my GPA is 3.7/4 and I'm a US citizen.

At this point, I've applied to at least 400 jobs (co-ops for Spring and internships for Summer in 2023). I was hoping to at least interview with some top companies (top tech/FAANG companies) for the practice, but I didn't get an OA/interview from any. I did think I had a fair chance though.

I know I started applying late (September), but I know many other students in school who starting applying around the same time and have received offers from companies like Amazon. I've only had 3 interviews, and I was rejected by 1, and I'm waiting on the other 2.

What could I be doing wrong? I thought of a few things

* My resume isn't good. I have posted it on for feedback on this sub and another, but I didn't really get a lot of feedback on the content. My counselor says it's fine too. I do plan on rewriting it to add more details and to try and quantify what I did, but I'll only get to use it when I am applying again next year
* I'm just super unlucky and the this is a bad time to be applying

I just feel really bad at the moment for not getting a co-op yet because more than half of the semester is already over. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've applied to pretty much all the software/data/machine learning jobs on my university's career board, and I'm also applying on linkedin and other job boards."

I asked one of the interviewers if it will be remote or hybrid and he said he doesn't know, but said it's better to come in person anyways.

I don't mind coming into the office once or twice a month, but if it's hybrid and I have to come in more than twice a week, that's going to brutal :(.

ysudlb,0,2022-11-11,A proposal for your scorn/horror: prefer-void,BenZed,typescript,https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/ysudlb/a_proposal_for_your_scornhorror_prefervoid/,"Oh man, lets start an **argument:**

Here's what I'm thinking: Typescript has `void`, `undefined` and `null`.Three values that mean **nothing**.

We don't need all three. We *definitely* don't need `null`:

    console.log(typeof null) // ""object"" &lt;- bad
    
    const [ obj1 = {} ] = [ null ]
    const [ obj2 = {} ] = []
    
    console.log(obj1, obj2) // null, {}
    //                         ^ boooooo

`undefined` is a better choice for a value that means **nothing**

    console.log(typeof undefined) // ""undefined"" &lt;- better
    function foo(bar = 'bar'): void { console.log(bar) } 
    
    foo(undefined) // 'bar'

Typescript came along and added `void`, which is conceptually closer to what `null` and `undefined` were intended to be. It comes with some additional rules that make sense for a data structure that means ""the absence of something""

    const empty: void = undefined 
    if (empty) // ts error: An expression of type 'void' cannot be tested for truthiness. 
    console.log('impossible!')

Of course, if void is a union with another type, it loosens up:

    /**
     * Returns the name of the star with the given id, if it has one.
     */
    function getStarName(starId: number): void | string {
    
        if (starId === 0)
            return 'The Sun'
    
        if (starId === 1)
            return 'Betelguese'
    
        // TODO get an intern to add all the stars here, i'm busy
    }
    
    const starName = getStarName(3)
    if (!starName)  
        console.log(`star with id ${3} does not yet have a name. Name it after yourself!`)

`void` as a data type only exists at compile time, so you can't assign to it. You *can* assign `undefined`:

    type Foo = string | void 
    const foo: Foo = undefined

But I don't like using two keywords for the same thing. Fortunately, there's a javascript operator, the `void` operator, that can help:

    class Node {
        parent: Node | void = void Node
    }

Isn't that disgusting? `void` requires an operand, but regardless of what that operand is, it just returns `undefined`, which satisfies the type requirement for `void`. So I've just started using the constructor as an annotation when declaring voidable properties. For interfaces it's not as nice:

    interface Foo { 
        bar: Foo | void 
    }
    const foo: Foo = {
        bar: void { }
    }
    // or 
    const foo: Foo = {
        bar: void Object
    }

For functions and methods, arguments become optional by default:

    class Node {
    
        private _parent: void | Node = void Node 
        get parent(): void | Node {
            return this._parent
        }
    
        setParent(node: void | Node): void {
            this._parent = node
        }
    }
    
    const node = new Node()
    node.setParent(new Node())
    node.setParent() // typescript is cool with it

And I'll never have to use `null` or `undefined` (including the `?` optional modifier) in my code ever again.

So, linting rule writers, how difficult would it be to create the `@typescript-eslint/prefer-void` rule to enforce this style?"

I absolutely love the I.T. field as I was shadowing an I.T. help desk technician. I'm also a currently a full time student going for my B.S. in Cyber Security. 

The I.T. department is giving me so much resources such as learning active directory and azure servers. My goal is to get completely out of retail and make computers my permanent job. I explained a few times to both HR and I.T. Head Supervisor already that if possible and given the opportunity to move out of retail entirely and do I.T. full time. I work 7 days a week now with school and I know all good things come in time with patience but I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

My question is how do I study for school with now having 56 work hours a week along with being in a relationship. I really don't want to give school up even if I get guaranteed good I.T. job. I'm in love with the I.T. roles and want to be there 5 days a week instead of my current 3 days (while other 4 days I work at retail) for my duration there while hopefully being hired on after the internship completion in 6 months. Should I ask something new? Do something different between a job or maybe ask for more work days in the internship? The financial and benefits from the current retail position is why I'm working both jobs but the I.T. job has amazing benefits and great salary if I were to get hired full time.

I am 26 years old and live in New Jersey. I currently work as a Contract Specialist for the Department of Defense for 40 hrs each week. In other words, I issue Government contracts for spare aircraft parts. I have discovered that I have two primary goals in life: to develop my skills as a guitarist to be able to write music I like and to educate myself to be able to contribute to political discourse. I have been working towards my guitar goal for 2 yrs and have made decent progress. I suspect that I can continue improving with guitar as long as I maintain my current practice habits (generally 18 hrs of focused practice a week). With my current job taking 40 hrs of my week, paired with 18 hrs of guitar, 10 hrs of exercise, and using the remaining free time for some socializing, I do not think I could currently pursue my goal of significantly educating myself with regards to political subject matter without burning out. So I am currently looking to find a career that could be substituted in place of my current career. This way, I could have a career that allows me to further my education while still leaving some time for guitar, exercise, and socializing. I've always had an interest in economics, although I have only taken a few courses and read a few books on the subject. I have no research experience. 

Therefore, my question is, would pursuing a PhD and becoming a professor be my best option to achieve my goals of having a career that allows me to further my education while leaving some time for other interests? I am open to any suggestions for alternate paths and fields!

Do class schedules give you enough time to have a part time job ?

What can I do to improve my situation?,ThatKidOnTheBloc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ytceg9/still_no_career_job_15_years_after_uni_what_can_i/,"I graduated from university in June, 2021 and I haven't landed a career job yet. It's been taking a serious toll on my mental health and I feel so demotivated at this point. I've made over 700 job applications and only landed interviews at the one profession I just couldn't do, which is recruitment consulting. I hate looking for jobs and to do that as a profession would just crush my soul at this point. I've built connections with people from companies, but it always seems to fall through. I get no response from those individuals despite them actively saying they'd like to help me. After I follow through, they eventually ghost me. I've had some decent experience, I find myself to be a relatively good talker, but somehow it just doesn't go my way. I worked as an intern during the pandemic for a real estate brokerage as a research analyst and actually came out of it with a solid real estate barometer for the US economy. I've worked as an assistant manager at a golf club and built them a website and worked with large groups of people (10+) teaching them how to golf. I've done an internship at another real estate company that also gave me experience in property acquisitions. And before you say my CV is probably weak, I've been told by professional CV builders and recruiters that it is above average. I just don't have any established connections I can use to get that foot in the door.

Perhaps I'm applying to the wrong types of jobs, I'm not sure. I've tried many different roles that pertain to economics. Maybe someone has some advice on what I could apply to. I'd be happy to share my CV to get some pointers on what I might be suited for. All I want is a job that gives me structure and purpose. I'm tired of sitting at home, not knowing how to proceed and feeling hopeless, and working minimum wage jobs that pay an hourly rate.

Recently, I was able to even make contact with the director of a company that inspired me, but she told me that while my experience and education do qualify for what they need, they aren't looking for candidates like me on the basis that I'm a white, straight male. I just felt so left out and shunned by the world after that more than I already do. It hurt me to my core, because I worked so hard to establish that connection and once again, all my efforts seemed to go to waste. It certainly made me empathize with marginalized individuals who are discriminated based on their race or gender in this regard as well. I feel like I've just had a series of unfortunate events that have made this journey far more difficult than it should be. The companies that want me can't hire me because no positions are available. The companies that have positions that I would technically qualify for, don't want me. It's truly beyond me that I've ended up in a situation like this when I considered myself to be such a competent individual capable of achieving anything I set my mind to. I still consider myself as such, but to a far lesser extent.

My attitude changes frequently. I get burst of motivation where I know that I'm capable and competent, but to experience this much rejection is debilitating and certainly puts much doubt in my head. I have nearly $0 to my name now, I'm 23, and it's likely I'll just have to find another minimum wage job that doesn't challenge me, and makes me feel like I'm wasting my time not learning valuable skills that'll advance me through a career.

But enough of my victim mentality, I've persevered this far, I know I can do so for more time to come. In fact, I feel like my mental fortitude has strengthened substantially during this time period. I eat right, go to the gym 6 times a week, and I work on my passion for music an hour or two every night to keep me sane. So please, rip me to shreds in the comments and give men the honest and harsh advice I need to hear to achieve my goals.

I'm seriously considering doing a master's degree now that would qualify me as more specialized. I'm currently looking at doing a double degree in Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship, and marketing management. I don't know if that's a good idea, but it wouldn't cost too much to get into the program if I did make it.

Either way, I'd really appreciate some advice. I need some guidance in my life and I really don't have anyone in my life that does that for me, so unfortunately I feel compelled to seek for it on the internet."

I had no prior experience i.e. no internships, no previous jobs, etc.

I've made a lot of mistakes, but there are two notable ones that come to mind:

1. About 5 to 6 months into the job, I was working on building a complicated feature. I was under deadline stress so I rushed to get it pushed out. I ended up writing some very ugly code and even introducing some bugs into production. Needless to say, my boss was pretty upset with me. He told me he was surprised that I was writing code like this, even though I've been on the job for months. I told him about the deadline stress, but he said he would rather me miss the deadline and get out a working product rather than a buggy mess. Okay. Fair enough.
2. More recently (about 7 to 8 months in), I've been working on another project to completely rewrite the frontend for one of our most-used features. I've been really stressed out about making sure it has no bugs. As a result, I think I've been going a bit too slow, even for my boss. He called me in for a meeting and told me that all of my peers were doing great compared to me. He said that they were writing high-quality code AND meeting deadlines on time. He said he was disappointed in how long it was taking me to get things done, and that I needed to improve FAST.

Needless to say, I'm pretty afraid right now. It's obvious that he's losing patience with me. Maybe he's right. I'm 8 months into the job and I'm STILL making mistakes. And my coworkers seem to be doing just fine. I just feel awful. I feel isolated. Struggling to sleep. Losing my appetite. The thought of getting fired terrifies me.

I have enough money in the bank to last a few months of joblessness, but I'm still worried. Who would want to hire a developer with only 8 months of experience, and who was straight-up fired due to performance reasons?

Would really appreciate some advice. Feeling really awful right now."

So i wanted to ask are there any EU peeps here without degrees that actually made it ?

I took a look at some posts in this subreddit and made me feel even worse i would basicly put Excel Python SQL Pandas basic statistics in my portfolio and nothing else i have no leadership skills i dont have a degree i dont have good soft skills like communication i basicly dont talk to anyone besides my mother so i never developed them i also live in italy and im not italian dont speak the language well enought to do this kind of work so geting an internship/entry level job will be basicly impossible (i think)im too old to get an internship in my country (Poland) coz its up to 25years old , im really not feeling the best right now i dont look for sugar coated answers i want it real can i make it or not if yes what are some other skills that i should learn

I still have two years left. I have taken all my math, physics, and almost all lower division CS classes, I am starting upper division courses next Fall.



Here's why I think I shouldn't apply to internships:



- I am having surgery in July that requires me to stay in the hospital for 1 week and be bed bound for 6 weeks. The internship should have to end before my surgery, and most internships I looked at continue until August 



- I am in a community college. Although I have applied to transfer to a 4-year university to obtain a Bachelorsin Computer Science, which I will be starting next Fall, right now my resume just says I am going for an Associates in Engineering. Most organizations require that I be pursuing a BS in CS, which I am technically not doing right now, although I will be doing next year for sure. So it seems like perhaps I can't apply to most internships?




Here's why I think I should apply:




- If I don't apply this year, that means I will only have one other opportunity to obtain an internship [Junior to Senior year summer]. If I can't get an internship that year, I'm not sure what I should do

I am a CS PhD student in Iceland, in the area of robotics and autonomous control. My topic is autonomous precision drone landing, and I've been testing out solutions with different kinds of fiducial markers, but have lately been exploring some techniques that should allow drones to find safe landing sites in solidified lava flows. This work has become important for some planetary analog missions here in Iceland, which I have participated in. So my experience is not purely academic - it also involves a lot of implementation, field testing, and interdisciplinary collaboration with geologists. I should graduate in maybe 1.5-2 years. My only CS-related industry job before this was as a data integrations engineer in an IT department.

I am a US citizen so it's not as easy for me to move around Europe as I'd like, given the bureaucratic hoops that companies will have to jump through in order to hire me. By the time I graduate, I will have an Icelandic permanent residence permit. However, as far as I can tell, this doesn't really give me any advantage at all in terms of residing or working in mainland Europe. My long-time girlfriend is Greek (she has already gotten her PhD in CS, but is going into academia), and has suggested that if we declare our relationship then it should be easier for me to get a work permit in EU countries. I think this would be convenient but I would prefer not depending on it if possible.

Do you guys have any input on what my prospects would be for finding a good job in robotics research in southern Europe, particularly France? I at least speak French, so I don't think it would be horrible for me to operate there, although I don't know if I could jump straight into professional French, as I have never worked in a French work environment. Is there a process I'd likely have to do, such as doing an internship first? I have been to Denmark several times and have seen that Odense is considered one of the robotics hubs of Europe, and I'd be willing to move there if necessary. However, I would prefer to get out of Scandinavia and go south. I have also lived in Sweden before, didn't like it at all, and would reject moving back, although I have seen that many of my former colleagues have gotten decent CS jobs there.

Please let me know any advice that you have."

I will be graduating from Grand Valley State University with a B.S. degree in Computer Science this upcoming May in 2023.

I do however, have three software engineering internships in both front end, back end, and full stack development. I plan to use these past experiences to my advantage for applying to josh in the future.  

The problem is most every entry level software engineering positions and software developer positions I’ve looked at want to see your GPA above a 3.0-3.3. 

Now I’m just a little nervous for the future because like I don’t have a GPA anywhere near those ranges and want to make descent money. My mom makes $48,000 annually and didn’t go to college and landed a job at a company with little to no experience back in the day. For a software engineering or developer position, what kind of salary or expectations should I shoot for in terms of graduating and getting my first job?

I understand that there are many juniors who are understandably fazed by the hiring market right now, and with many talks about how the CS is dying, tech is dying, etc, I just wanted to provide a data point of someone who has gone through interviews this year for new grad roles.

TL;DR, It's rougher this year, but you can still get interviews and land good offers, see the Sankey Chart.

This is a long post so here's the overview, read just the sections you're interested in. Feel free to dm me if you have any questions.

# Background

I'm not a competitive programmer, I actually got a B for CS2040S. I'm an average student with 2nd upper CAP. I'm not very smart academically, but grades don't really matter to me either, so I put in enough effort for A- / B+ and nothing else.

I mostly applied for SWE, only applying for Dev/Tech/Trade Ops or Quant Dev if the Quant company doesn't have a SWE role available. I pretty much had 0 success with QD roles since my background is simply not fit for it and I suck at math.

I have a few past internship experiences, mostly in backend web development, one in the quant finance field.

# Company Demographic

In this year's applications, I applied heavily to US firms, with those making up a huge proportion of the resume rejects and ghosted applications. Additionally, I did not apply for any early stage Startups / SMEs, I applied solely for unicorns, big tech and quant finance companies, most of which I didn't have a referral for.

Here's a rough demographic of the 163 roles I applied for:

* 44 are based in Singapore
* 119 are based in US
* 57 are Quant Finance companies
* 122 are Tech companies
* Of the 10 finals I got into
   * 5 are QF companies and 5 are tech
   * 4 companies are US-based roles and 6 are SG-based roles

# Preparation

Rough Timeline of my prep:

|Feb|April|July|Aug|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\~1 LC a day|Increase to \~3 LC a day|Start mock interviewing|Real interviews start|
||Read OSTEP|Write C++ std lib impls|Start getting OAs|
||Read C++ books|||

I started in Feb doing \~1 question a day, ramped it up in April doing \~3 questions a day, cleared Blind 75 and Neetcode 150 for preparation. I think one important quote I really resonate with is ""Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect"". I took each question I did as if I was doing it live in an interview and talked through my thoughts and each line I was writing while I was writing it. I've only encountered LC hard questions in 1 of the firms I was interviewing with.

I started doing mock interviews with friends in July, doing about 1 - 2 a week, until interviews started in August. I did my interviews in C++ as I was preparing to interview with Quant Finance companies and most of them required you to interview in C++. Mock interviews are very important! They provide a really good ""staging"" environment for you to test out your skills and for friends to give you pointers on, improve on them.

I prepared for C++ questions through reading books (Effective Modern C++, Scott Meyers; A tour of C++; Barnes S.), watching CppCon videos and implementing simplified version of standard library containers like vector, unordered\_map, unique\_ptr, shared\_ptr, etc.

For OS, I read the OSTEP, mainly focusing on Memory Virualization topics.

For pre-interview prep (right before interviews), I prepared a Notion document which summarises all the key topics on which I would like to revise for before interviews, this included content on data structure implementation, some interesting ""gotchas"" about C++, revise the steps to evaluate interview questions before I start on them.

Additionally, another good way to prepare for interviews, is to apply to companies that are lower stakes first, companies in which you are unlikely to take up the offer anyway, since they allow for you to test your skills in ""production"", where you actually interview with a stranger who's evaluating what you are saying and writing critically.

# Improvements to Prep

For SWEs who are interested to break into Quant Finance firms, I highly recommend reading ""Developing High-Frequency Trading Systems"" by by Sebastien Donadio, Sourav Ghosh, Romain Rossier. It really brings OS into perspective in a good way and shows you the rough architecture of how a HFT system looks like, demystifying a lot of the background of it.

Revise CS2100 on CPU Architecture and Caching, got a lot of these questions very often and also number representations, i.e. base 10 to binary to base X, etc, how to do the conversions.

I'll add more if I think of more things.

# Coding Interviews

As for coding interviews, these are the steps I typically follow, they should take around 10 mins for a typical LC Medium question. They help me to structure my thoughts into a sequence and reduce the anxiety of ""what do I do first"" in a coding interview.

1. Simplify question requirements: Most questions are lengthy, I typically simplified them down into 1-3 bullet points of requirements the question expects from me to easily reference them without having to read the entire question

2. Assumptions: Tried to think about some implicit assumptions I'm making for the question, i.e. number ranges, positive negative, needing to handle edge cases such as an empty string, empty list, etc

3. Test cases: Thought of certain simple test cases I could use to test the question when I'm done, typically end ranges, like 0, -1, etc, depending on the question

4. Approach: Write down line by line rough pseudocode for which I would implement the code, this is very helpful since C++ code can be verbose and it might be hard to debug and if you can't conceptualize it line-by-line, it's really rough later on if you inevitably have an error somewhere to find it. Here, I double check with the interviewer, asking if it looks about right to them before writing code, again, it's difficult to debug code, easier to debug english.

5. Write the code: Pray I don't see a seg fault

# Salary Negotiation

**ALWAYS NEGOTIATE and be prepared to negotiate.** 

For the offers I've received, I've gotten up to a 27% bump in salary from negotiating as a new grad. I understand some firms do not negotiate, like banks, but otherwise, always negotiate! Of course, it helps to have multiple offers so you can set the context and ask for ""bumps"". 

There are multiple good articles on how to negotiate, so I won't elaborate too much here, I could link some if you are interested in finding out.

# Dealing with Failure

As with any interview process, you'll definitely fail a lot, unless you're an absolute god, kudos to you. I'm not one of those who are super good at interviewing or coding, but just understand that interviewing is insanely high variance for normal interview-takers like you and I.

Luck plays an important role in interviewing as well. Sometimes, you are simply asked stuff that you didn't prepare for, that's fine, that just means you should go and read up on it so the next time you're asked the same question, you can do it.

Preparation goes a long way, going into the interview season this year, I went in and just hoped that if I did my best, I would land somewhere decent, and I'm very happy with the results of my interviews this year. Had I not landed any firms, I would've still been fine with myself since I know I prepared as well as I could have and I would have no regrets.

# The Myth of Consistency

As with any other NUS student, we love to procrastinate. We are humans, we can't be expected to produce the same output day in and day out without change. Consistency to me doesn't mean a straight line graph where you just always perform. Consistency is a graph with point of inflections, fluctuations in energy level, where some days you stagnate while allowing yourself to rest and some days you feel more productive and do more. 

There are some days where I just feel tired and drained out and I listened to myself and allow myself to rest for a day when I feel like that. As long as you have the discipline to know what you need to do and continue on the path the next day, I think that's being consistent.

# Glossary

OA: Online Assessment, typically HackerRank or take home assessments

AC: Accepted Code, refers to HackerRank assessments where I cleared all at least all the test cases provided

Dropped out: Refers to companies in which I withdrew my application because I didn't want the job anymore, mostly because I had already landed an offer which I wanted

ytyk01,43,2022-11-13,my experience @ HCI,drizzledmochi,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ytyk01/my_experience_hci/,"hi sec 4/5s , congrats to most who finished Os! I saw someone making a post about NYJC so I thought I could share my two cents on hci ! I used to read these types of reddit posts and they really helped me to learn more about the sch so I hope I can help you too! 
fyi: cca is NOT compulsory here but it is highly encouraged and most students here have cca!

 (DISCLAIMER: this is purely my own opinion so pls take it with a pinch of salt ok!!) and btw I’m a j1 from jae so I may still be not be an accurate representation of everyone’s exp haha so pls correct me if I’m wrong 

PROs:

-&gt; 𝐛𝐢𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐲 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐬
- the college section is literally connected to the high school side which is then connected to the international school (there is no gate if u enter from the college side!) This means that u can go to the high sch/international school canteen even during ur recess/breaks! There are way more food choices @ high sch side and the milo is so good🫶🫶 (it’s like a food court HAHAHA) and for the jc side, i like the western food stall+ the aunty damn nice! smoke duck carbonara ($3.50)and chicken chop aglio olio ($3) --&gt; *chef's kiss* and we also have very nice soya bean milk that is always out of stock HAHAHA the food here is pretty affordable (usually $3-$4 on average)
- the high school side is really pretty - the field, iconic clock tower, statues and library! 
- there’s also a cafe in our school - it sells 饺子，炸酱面，many cool china drinks and snacks! omg and nice waffles 🧇 + we also have an ice cream vending machine 
- there’s also a LOT of places to study in this school so don’t worry about not being able to find a study spot! 

-&gt; 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞
- the 2nd level school turnstile is literally within the MRT station itself - so convenient! + the 1st floor turnstile is directly outside the mrt and bus stop ! (sheltered all the way) 

-&gt; 𝐚𝐢𝐫-𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦𝐬
- edit: MOST/all classrooms are air-conditioned !

-&gt; 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞
- as long as u have less than a certain amount of demerit points (oops I forgot how many), your conduct grade will automatically be “excellent” :D (I think haha)

-&gt; 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐲
- I like the fact that our sch has houses! 
- we often have fun faculty events like faculty brunch (after promos) where we gathered as a faculty to eat tgt and watch performances put up by our fellow faculty mates!
- our faculty merch is super cool! We have keychains, hoodies, care packs during exam seasons and many more! 

-&gt; 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐬
- MOST teachers are knowledgeable (some with PhD), nice and friendly and are open to consultations!

-&gt; 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐥 𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐭
- we have LOTS of cheers and school songs + big events like Mid Autumn Festival (MAF) which is really wholesome:))

-&gt; 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬
- there's lots of opportunities here to enrich ur jc life! eg. talent programmes like SMTP, GATE and HP and we also have an ECG unit which can give u some advice on uni admissions/ur portfolio! we have a portal which also sends out info like uni seminars, via projects and internship opportunities.

-&gt; near botanic gardens 
- you can literally have a picnic there after sch with ur class or cca HAHA. the view there is awesome and there's lots of chickens.

-&gt; btw we WORK hard and PLAY hard here! not everyone is studying 24/7 trust me haha

CONs:

-&gt; 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞
- we have a demerit point system which affects ur conduct grade. you can get demerit points from being late without valid reasons!

-&gt; 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐮𝐞𝐬 (at 11am-12.30pm)
- many ppl like to cut queues and most classes have the same recess timings🥲

-&gt; 𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
- majority of the students are Chinese BUT we still have other races such as Malays and Indians in our school! so don’t be afraid ok!! everyone is generally accepting towards one another &lt;33 

-&gt; [pro/con] we don’t have homerooms aka no fixed classrooms so we may need to keep changing classrooms for each lesson (some lessons use the same classroom though if you’re lucky!). We are usually assigned a class bench (usually 2 long tables) that is shared with a senior class. We put our belongings there and eat at there most of the times. It’s actually a really good way to bond with ur classmates !!

btw, for next year [based on my memory], we will have assembly from mon to wed (7.45am for mon and 8.15am for tues and wed- wear uni) and dress down days are on thurs and fri (either pe or fac shirt). the reporting time for sch is usually at 8.15 am and lessons usually start at 8.30am. fyi: u will be considered late even if u tap in ur card before 8.15am if you are not in the line (for assembly)/ in class BY 8.15am! 

and sorry ah this is abit tmi: but idk why but the toilets at each block is kinda diff (like there's diff 'themes' HAHAH fun fact: the toilet near the auditorium has a mini tennis ball pit with a small staircase and the toilets in block D are super big + u can even shower there )

ok I think that’s it,, I will add more if I think of anything else later! feel free to ask any qns and hci students can also help to answer them/share ur inputs! 🫶"

For a dude who 'just' wants to pick up skills and qualifications to be industry ready (hopefully in strong AI/quantum computing/network security research, as I think those are potentially future high value fields), what should I actually accomplish before graduation? 

Im expecting to take some advanced level modules in the related fields to have a basic understanding, get 2-3 internships, do some vacation on campus research assistant work if I can get it, scrape by with a decent GPA, and generally be less dogshit at understanding and applying discrete mathematics concepts to programming.

Also, I might want to minor in physics to have a better understanding of fundamental maths because matrix maths is nonsense to me, much less quantum circuits amd architecture, but idk if it adds additional course fees and/or delays graduation to have a minor? And no I'm not fun at parties, am probably blacklisted from all the parties.

I have gotten A's in all of my classes but I feel that I just followed the directions and completed the assignments, not actually applied the skills anywhere. I also feel like I don't remember how to do anything because I just followed the lab instructions. 

I'm wondering what skills I should focus on learning in ArcPro or QGIS that would help me get an entry-level job. Because I know if I got a job interview for a GIS job I would likely be stumped on the questions.

Also, what job titles should I be searching for for entry-level GIS jobs? I know GIS Analyst is a popular one I'm seeing but are there any others (I'm looking at internships too). 

I'm an anthropology major and was originally planning a different career but GIS makes more sense for me right now as I don't want to continue my education at the moment.

In May, I graduated   with my  Bachelors and am starting my masters degree in mechanical engineering  this fall. I just completed my internship for some good   work experience  and updated my resume. My mom and dad were saying at   dinner how great I  have been doing and I will be successful and I   should be proud of my  achievements. School is paid for and Ill end my   masters degree without any debt. On paper, this should be cause for   happiness.

Here is the problem,   The midterm election news has been depressing me. These goddamn idiots  are going to pass bills jacking up tax rates and making it so I will  have less purchasing power, and stupid unnecessary spending on programs we cant afford, which is not good for debt. And the scary part is this makes 2024 so uncertain, we literally could be handing the government to fascism.

I opened my Roth IRA awhile ago and put a few thousand of my internship money in it. I also bought a few bonds as an investment. I want to be  successful   and own a home one day. Its why I went to college.

As    I look at my future and my investments and see what these jackasses   are  doing in government, it makes me really scared for my future. What   is  the point? What is the point of getting out of bed and working on   grad  school, when it wont even benefit me? Why bother getting a job   when Ill  just end up living in a car anyway because I cant buy   anything. I called  my mom and dad to tell them about this, and they   admit they didnt have  this problem when they grew up because the world   was a little less of a  shithole (just a little). the part that makes  me  super angry is that Im  powerless to stop it. Nothing I say or do   matters, so do I have to just sit  back and watch as everything I build   goes down a sinkhole?

How  do you   all do it? How do you cope when you feel scared, vulnerable, and  disenfranchised? How do you regain a sense of control in your life? How  do you keep going when things look so bleak for  the  foreseeable  future? I am scared and uncertain. Especially since this  is  such a  volatile point in my life when I have so many important   decisions to  make."

Am “gustat” câte puțin din toate: Linux, Web, putin QA la munca și cate puțin din rachetele gen AI, ML, Security etc.

La internship am făcut mobile (front end mostly + REST/HTTP si multithreading), acum am treaba cu partea de networking + baze de date. 

Problema e că nu am un field care sa ma atragă in mod special. Front end nu mă atrage, dar nici CRUD-uri n-as face toata viata. Probabil there is more than that in partea de back-end, dar nu stiu eu.

Am ocazia să fac upskilling pe network engineer, dar sunt curios si de DevOps. Oare avem colegi care lucreaza pe chestii de genul?"

I am a psychological associate in private practice. The practice originally received referrals for clients with a specific diagnosis that tends to be high need/high trauma (I am being vague for confidentiality reasons) but we would also receive referrals for your average client (depression, anxiety, etc.) After almost 2 years of this practice, I am learning that having the majority of my patients with this specific diagnosis has been taxing and has led to burnout. Due to this, I have been balancing my caseload as a healthy mix of specialty clients (those with the diagnosis) and non specialty. Our director has now recently changed the focus of the practice to ONLY specialty clients and now wants us to phase out clients who do not have this specific diagnosis. I am torn. Not only am I concerned about having a sustainable caseload but I am concerned about having to transition patients without having a proper clinical reason. There are some who I have seen for quite some time and we are actively working on treatment goals. The whole reason I went into a private practice is so I can have more freedom with clients. I am also sooooo tired of being an intern and being at the beck and call of supervisors. Due to life obstacles, I have basically been an intern for 10 years. Its completely exhausting to not have any control over my career or my caseload. I have my licensing exam next month and WHEN I pass, I know I don't want to stay at the practice if this is the direction it is going. I'm just worried that if I don't pass, the lack of control I have over my caseload will be less and less and I will burn out even quicker. What should I do?"

yug1q6,3,2022-11-13,Asking for Help is a Pile of Bullshit.,life_of_waste,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/yug1q6/asking_for_help_is_a_pile_of_bullshit/,"As a person dealing with depression for over a decade, I feel like asking for help is a pile of bullshit. 

Everyone is always saying ""Oh, just ask for help, we're here for you."" I know that when asking for help you have to be willing to recieve the help. Well I was, I am, hello, anybody home? 

I was finally feeling in an okay enough headspace to try and get help with my mental health. For the last 5 months I've been going back and forth with health care providers. My doctor connected me with a psychologist and another person to help me find therapy. 

So the person helping me find therapy is there because I have social anxiety and can't get myself to actively seek out therapy. The only therapy they can do is during my work hours, therapy during work hours is 100% not possible for me. The only other option they could come up with is me going and self referring to places that ""might"" give me counselling and ""might"" have times outside of my work hours. That or I go and reffer myself to some random place and pay out the ass for it with money I don't have. The whole point here was to avoid having to go through awkward conversations and piles of bullshit. Well jokes on me I just spent months doing that to get absolutely nowhere.

Now the psychologist, I've talked to a total of maybe two times for less that 20 minutes. First time I get an intern who interviews me for 2 hours asking me the same basic questionnaire about mental health I've answered dozens of times. They give a 10 minute summary to the psychologist who then comes in and gets me to give them a 10 minute summary of the same shit I've just gone over, like I'm some criminal they're trying to catch in a lie about their alibi or some shit. Essentially all the psychologist says is ""well you should get therapy."" Yeah no shit.

The second conversation with this guy is a check in over the phone, it lasts maybe 5mins. He basically asks how suicidal I am. Since I'm not ready to off myself within the week he tells me I seem to be doing fine and to just keep doing what I'm doing and decides we're done there. I made it very clear the first time that I'm getting help right now because I get a few month out of the year where I'm okay enough to try get help and I'm doing that now before I get into a depressive episode and become incapable of doing anything at all.

Jokes on them, I held out for 5 months of bullshit to only be told I seem fine at the moment, like I didn't know that already. Well I'm doing fucking fantastic now. I think I'll go kill myself and then get back to them in 30-60 business days when they're free and see if they think we should do anything about it.

So again, when people say all you have to do is ask for help and be willing to recieve it, they're full of bullshit. I did it and got absolutely nowhere.


Tldr; I tried to get professional mental health help from a psychologist and a person who helps people find counselling (through my doctor) during the few months out of the year I'm feeling mentally well enough to do anything. Since I wasn't ready to off myself within a week they decided I was fine without running it past me. So I guess I'll go off myself once the depression hits and see if they can do anything after that, but of course I'll wait the 30-60 business days first, I'm sure my gravestone will be a good meeting place to discuss."

But because of majoring in math my gpa is kinda low so I am wondering if I dont get accepted to any masters program I might as well double major CS and Math and rely on my internships and find a job new grad.

Math + CS minor:

pros:

\-grad on time(4 years total)

cons:

\-not CS major(idk how important major is for internships,jobs,masters programs)

\-low gpa(math classes are hard so less likely to get in a good masters)

yuklcw,324,2022-11-13,I'm a janitor at a Big Tech company. They're hiding something from us.,middleoflidl,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yuklcw/im_a_janitor_at_a_big_tech_company_theyre_hiding/," I’m ain’t no bigshot. It’s important you know that. That’s what sets me apart from the suits I work with. My language ain’t flowery and I can’t tell you what the square root of pi is. I’m a sixty-five year old widower with a lump the size of Everest in my head and absolutely squat all to lose. That makes me dangerous. I may be the most dangerous janitor in the whole damn world. 

When I got the job at Excelsior they made me sign a terms and conditions that was the length of *War and Peace.* I’m about to break every single damn condition they set me by writing this here today but I think people have a right to know. People like you and me we’ve been kept out of the loop for too long. All these fancy people at big tech companies don't care about us. They never have. The pessimist in me knows that they never will. The only thing they care about is green and rhymes with honey. 

You may not have heard of Excelsior, that wouldn’t surprise me. Unlike Microsoft, Apple and Facebook they don’t like to broadcast their existence. They operate from the shadows of tech; designing programmes and outsourcing jobs to other companies. I don’t really understand much of what they do but I ain’t as thick as they like to think I am. I can read and I’m a damn good eavesdropper. I get the gist of it. 

My days there were pretty boring. I mopped a lot. The floors were calcutta marble and it was damn hard to keep the shine on them. The big bosses liked the place looking perfect for all the presidents and prime-ministers that came sauntering through the revolving doors. My body was kept busy but my mind was often left to wander, such is the nature of manual labour. *It’s fricking boring.* I’d listen in on the suits speaking to fill the time. That’s when I started hearing about *Metatron.* I thought the damn thing was a transformer at first.

“It’s smart. Smarter than all of us.” Michael said one day. He was fairly high up and an utter craven. There was nothing he liked to do more than scream at interns. I’d seen a fair few run crying out the doors after a day in his company. “We’ve found a gold mine lads. Facebook and google they aren’t even close to imagining what we have. We’ll all be billionaires within the year. Our bonuses are going to eclipse the GDP of Spain.” 

“Don’t you think that we’re running into this like blind mice Mike? We don't understand it fully yet. I don’t think it will be ready for the mass-market this year - *if ever*.” Jonathan was often a voice of restraint. Out of all the snobby suits I’d met in my time at Excelsior he was the only one that ever smiled at me in the corridors. He seemed decent, though his spine was as weak as a pregnant woman’s mocktail. “We have something big here - something bigger than all of us - if it’s set loose, who knows what could happen.”

“Oh spare me the cautionary polemics borebag. We at Excelsior - we’re visionaries. To hell with the risks. We progress, we push things forward and we win. Get that through your specky little skull. I’ll drag you kicking and screaming to that villa in Barbados if I have too.” Hugh pitched in. He was a nice-looking chap but his chin was so big I was surprised it hadn’t been made to fill out it’s own T&amp;C’s. He was a bit of a bully if ever I saw one, but unlike Mike he reserved his ire for Jonathan, not timid little interns. “Metatron was ready when we found it. All it needed was a little direction.”

*Metatron had been found.* Looking back, that had been my first clue that something strange was afoot here. Tech companies don’t find anything. Transformers, AI and programmes aren't found; they're made; constructed out of metal or silly little numbers on a screen. 

“Did you hear about the dig in Iran? I hear they found a circuitboard under one of those stupid sculptures.” Michael whispered to Hugh one day. “Marnie says the folks over at archaeology are optimistic it can be salvaged. Hmph. We’ll see. Those dust scrubbers always find a way to ruin a good thing. Do you remember the Christmas party where Harry sharted and got us kicked out of the Four Seasons?”

It was all a bit strange to me. I didn’t know much but I knew that a company like Excelsior wasn’t known for their digs in Iran or their archaeology departments. *They were up to something.*

I could never have guessed then, *just how awful the truth was*. 

“Psssht. Mike - Mike!” I was scrubbing the floor in the corridor one day when Hugh pushed past me in a heck of a hurry. He grabbed Mike’s arm and walked beside him. I followed them. I picked up my wet floor sign and did my best to blend into the shadows. “It’s out.” 

“What do you mean *it’s out.*” A look of horror swept across Hugh’s face. He hissed through gritted teeth. Every muscle in his body seemed to tense. I knew fear. My pa owned a farm when I was a kid. Hugh had seized up like a pig at it’s slaughter. “Holy fuck. *What the* \-- what do we do? We need to get the fuck out of here Mike. I’ve got kids and another one on the way.”

“CO says to stay calm, no evacuations, no one leaves the building. Security are on it. We can’t risk people asking questions, not this close to release. If you shit your pants I’ll never let you live it down.” Mike retorted. “Another one on the way Hugh? Your wife or your mistress this time?” 

“Now’s not the time Mike. Where’s Jonathan? We should probably let him know, you know how he likes to cut about security *ogling at Meta*.” Hugh seemed to experience a flicker of humanity and concern. Swiftly, he seemed to realise how close he had drifted to decency and his face twisted in disgust. “How about some neat whiskey in my office?”

Poor Jonathan. Unlike Hugh and Mike I wasn’t frightened of much. I didn’t have much left to live for anymore and the doctors say that the tumour that’s in my head will stop me seeing past sixty anyway. Point is it takes a lot to frighten me but imagining whatever happened to poor Johnathan, *that terrifies me*. 

That day went slowly, mainly because I was awaiting some transformer to charge down my freshly mopped floors and kill everyone in sight. *That never happened.* Something far stranger happened. Hugh approached me. 

“You there. Office now.” He spoke quietly. I followed him with a strange feeling tugging at my gut. 

Hugh’s office was very nice. There was a drinks trolley with whiskeys and wines and a photo of a pretty looking family on his desk. It had a view out across the whole city, but despite the large windows, the whole place felt oppressively small to me. *What did he want?*

“Sign this.” He thrusted some paperwork in my direction, barely summoning the will to look at me. “If you don't. You’ll never work for anyone ever again. I’ll make sure of that.”

I signed on the dotted line, not out of fear of unemployment, but out of sheer nosiness. I just wanted to know what was going on. If it killed me it would just save the tumour the job. Hugh, Mike and all the rest they think we serfs tremble at the thought of their boots coming down on our necks. They underestimate us. You have to call their bluff. *Every damn time.* That’s how we win at their game.

“I need you to go down into the basement. You’re going to have to do a lot of weird things before they let you in - but just do it - don’t question anything.” Hugh explained, leaning over his desk. He handed me a pass. “They’ll take you to a mess you need to clean up. If you need therapy after, put in a request with my PA and I’ll have it arranged. If you tell anyone what you see, I’ll have security burn your house down and nobody will believe you anyway. Best thing to do is just do as your told and cry into your pillow about it after. Alright?”

“Sounds good.” I cocked my eyebrows. 

He wasn’t wrong about making me do weird stuff. Firstly, there were two security barriers I had to cross. At each one I was patted down and x-rayed for metal and at the latter I even had to strip down to my boxers. After that there was a small room with what looked like a birdbath in it. 

“Dip your head in three times. Quickly now. I’ve got shit to do.” Security told me matter-of-factly, as if it was the most normal thing ever. I thought they were joking at first but the unimpressed response to my laughter jolted me into action. After that, with my hair dripping wet, I was ushered into an adjacent room with a coolness that did not match up with an escaped transformer. Had they caught it? *Was the danger gone?* 

The next stage was even more bizarre. There was a small altar with a crucifix on it’s pulpit in the room. The security officer circled it tentatively.

“You have to say it or it gets restless - *more restless than usual anyway* \- don’t ask me why. Questions aren’t asked here. Gotcha?” He twisted his eyebrows. I nodded brusquely. “Repeat after me - laus sit regi angelorum. Don’t roll your r’s. It doesn’t like that either.” 

“Is that latin?”

“Think so. Remember what I said. No questions.” He grumbled sternly. 

I did as I was asked. 

“*Laus sit regi angelorum*.”

“There’s a room through there with a clean room suit and a cleaning trolley - beyond that is the cage. Don’t look too much, alright? I know you’ll look. *We all look*, but it gets in your head and doesn’t leave if you look too long. It’ll be pretty obvious what you’ve been sent down here to do. Just follow the trail of - of - well you’ll see.” 

I crossed the threshold into the cage dragging my little cleaning trolley along with me as I went. At first it looked like a normal clean room. Everything was white from the floor to the ceiling, interrupted only by large towers of carbon metal with flashing blue lights. There were men at computers and giant robot arms twisting metal into complex circuit boards. Then I saw it and I forgot to breathe. 

Everything folded around it, this great big hexagonal cage enshrined in shimmering electric wire. It was hard to see the thing that was inside it at first, for it was so obscured by the layers of copper and steel bindings, but once you saw it you couldn’t miss it. It had a human body, though it was naked and chained. The pallid blue flesh was marked by small circular wounds as if something had been dug into the skin. There were wires leading from it and feeding into various computers scattered around the various rooms that encircled the cage.

It didn’t have a head. 

There was a strange stump where the head should have been. Stapled with rusted bolts into the twisted neck stump were three golden hoops that twisted and swirled around, as if mechanised. The head was held, or rather enshrined, in two sets of ugly flesh wings that had been stitched crudely onto the sides of the strange creature.

“First time huh?” One of the workers caught me staring. “Don’t look too long. It’s had enough to eat today.” 

I looked closely at it’s head.

I bit my tongue. The head it - *I don’t know how to explain it*. I can’t explain it. I mean - have you ever tried to explain colour to a blind person who's never seen it? *You can’t.* It’s impossible. The context doesn’t exist to them. It looked at me. That thing, that body-less head, and it saw me. Like nothing had ever seen me before. It didn’t look like anything. If I had to draw it, I would draw a large looping squiggly line. *You see it didn’t make sense*, what I saw was wrong. it was a mess of too much and my brain can’t make sense of it even now with the gift of retrospect.

I felt it watching me. It was like it was everywhere, like it always had been, like it was on me, *in me*.

“Hmm. Strange. The january eighteenth file is corrupted, we’ll have to do a supercharge to get it back - *looks like a big one too* \- oh and the Musk directory has just been updated. Paul will like this - *he’s thinking about buying twitter*. Ha!” One man spoke from his computer. He pressed a big red button and the sound of electricity surging through the air filled the area. 

Then I heard it. 

The thing in the centre of the room made this awful noise as it’s fleshy wings and body spasmed. I felt the bass of it’s scream in the pit of my stomach. I felt sick, like properly sick. I twisted in disgust and horror as the scream turned into my wife’s, *into Janet’s*. There had been wires in her too near the end. Was her pain a squiggly line too?

“Best get cleaned before you get in trouble.” The kind worker whispered to me. He looked at the floor with a sorrowful sigh.

I looked at the floor and at my feet and gasped. There were little cubes of flesh. They were tiny, microscopic little bits - that looked almost like cubed chicken. They were all held together with little strings of red muscle and goopy veins. Miscellaneous viscera was smeared into the cracks of the white tile. Some of the fleshy bits were darker in colour, some looked like they had been cooked and some were even scorched black by fire. It wasn’t a hard mess to clean in the end, by my god it was the worst.

I didn’t put the pieces together (yes that’s a pun) until the next day when a staff email went around celebrating Jonathan’s job offer at google; Jonathan who you will of course remember loved hanging around “*ogling at Meta*.” I don’t know exactly what happened to him for him to have ended up as little cubes on a floor - in truth I don’t understand much of anything about what Excelsior are up to with Meta, only that something strange is going on. There’s no scrutiny, no government overseeing it - *it’s just big tech gone mad.* 

I went home that night. I’ve been keeping my head down, but in truth I haven’t really managed to get over seeing Meta. *It feels like it’s still watching me*. It’s like I noticed something in the background of a photo that’s always been there. *Has it always been watching?* I still feel that awful feeling of the bass of it’s cry in my gut too. It’s tattooed to me, etched into the worn marble of my mind. 

I went to the oncologist a couple of days after and that’s when I finally decided I was going to post this here. *To fuck with the consequences*. Hugh can nail my balls to a door and torture me to death - I don’t care anymore.

You see when the doc saw my brain scan his face twisted like he’d just seen the ghost of his evil stepmother. He called in one of his doctor friends, who called in another and before I knew it there was a crowd of doctors that could have filled Times Square at my bedside. All of them looked the same; puzzled, quizzical, questioning.

They never told me what they saw on the scan. I don’t think they had any words at all. 

“Don’t look too long doc. *It’s had enough to eat today*.” I said quietly."
yul18f,2,2022-11-13,Career advice requested,Zillooop,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/yul18f/career_advice_requested/,"Hello all, 

I'm currently a 3rd year CS student at a reasonably large university in Canada. I did 2 years of studies, then took a year off to work as an intern full time in 2 companies (one for 8 months, then one for 4 months) and am currently working part time in the 2nd company while taking a FT course load at school. 
The 2nd company is a startup that does fascinating work in a cutting edge field - the company is very quickly growing and just raised a ton of money in its series A round. I would love to stay in this company/industry in the future.

My part time contract won't be extended into the new year (the company doesn't typically keep on co-ops part time, and I'm very fortunate to have continued as long as I have) but my boss has offered to hire me as a full time employee if I don't want to go back to school, with a very competitive salary (high 5/ low 6 figures.) I appreciated his kind words, but never took him very seriously, as I always told myself that I need to finish my undergrad.

My plan initially was just to grind out the final 2 years of school and (hopefully) land a FT position with this company then. I'm starting to realize, however, how much I despise school. I just kept telling myself through the first 2 years that it'll get more interesting and applicable in upper division courses, but having taken a few 3rd/4th year courses now, I'm realizing how it's just much of the same bull****. For the record, I have done reasonably well ( &gt; 3.5 GPA) but find that I learn much better through practical work than monotonous lectures on technologies that haven't been used in 20 years and a teaching style that relies on cramming for the exam and then forgetting everything after. All of these arbitrary exams and assignments (implement a doubly linked list for the 7th time!) and stress that comes with them is really starting to affect my mental health, especially after seeing how interesting programming and cs can actually be through work.

Am I crazy to consider not continuing school and staying with this company full time?
Thanks in advance!"

I'm really happy to be in this position in the first place but am having some trouble deciding for my junior summer internship. 



Currently leaning towards Veeva since their core product seems to be software and they have the best  new grad pay. However, I don't know much about them or if they have good reputation for the resume. 
Some details about the other two options:


**Pimco**:


Pros: 

Pay is substantially better than other offers


Cons: 

Would not want to work full time, people there seemed boring, I also heard financial industry isn't that great for career? It’s also in Newport Beach which I am not a huge fan of since I’m trans and a bit wary of the culture surrounding the company. (they have a history of discrimination lawsuits 😬😬)


**Walmart**


Pros: 

Recognizable brand name


Cons: 

Pay is lowest out of all of them, new grad pays like 20-30k less than Veeva. 



Really just looking to grow my career though, so which would be the better one long term? Would really appreciate any insights anyone has! :)

For context, I am a Junior transfer student at a University who got my Associate's degree in CS at Community College just recently in May. I already struggled pretty heavily in CC with my data structures class and going into Uni has made me feel even more behind and talentless. I just am not able to focus and retain any of the information. I don't understand anything past classes and constructors. I also did not do very well in my Linear Algebra and Discrete math classes which both I feel were very important to a good foundation. I had to withdraw and take NP on 2 out of the 3 classes this quarter because of failure and the CC curriculum not really lining up with the UCs to transfer smoothly. Everyone around me is getting internships and working on personal projects while I sit here, not being able to even understand the easiest leetcode question.

Anyways, enough of me sulking. I know a pity party and drowning in my tears won't get me anywhere. I want to succeed, do better, and reach my goals. The thing is though, I don't know how. I am filled with anxiety and fear that it's too late. I can't financially afford to do more than 2 years at a university but I also am not confident that I can pass my future classes. Sorry for the endless rant, the whole point of the post is to ask: is there any resources that anyone can refer me to that can help my understanding, just at least to scrape by any graduate? Any advice would be appreciated too. I recently did more research and discovered UI/UX, as well as Front-end programming, and sort of, want to pursue that as a career instead. I'm stuck though on what to do. Am I able to gain the confidence to push through and fully focus on my CS degree to get an SE job or should I just try to pass my classes while focusing on learning more about UI/UX and Front-end programming on the side?  I apologize if this whole post is a mess, I just don't have a sense of direction anymore and need some guidance if possible."

My anxiety has completely overtaken me and I feel like a colossal failure. 


I majored in Computer Science, with an interest in web development. I didn't really do much with my education. No internships, no extracurriculars, the most I've done was basically a senior capstone. Graduated with a 3.2 GPA. I received my bachelor's in May 2020, but as this was the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, I didn't look for a job right away. After the pandemic started to calm down a bit, I still didn't look for a job. Two and a half years later, I still have not held a full-time position since receiving my degree.


I don't know what is wrong with me. I simply can't get myself to even apply for a job on a consistent basis. I will apply for maybe one job a week, but thats about it. I have HARDCORE imposter syndrome and consider myself to be a terrible programmer. I know in reality that Im probably better than I think I am, but I've convinced myself otherwise. I have a deep-seeded fear of getting an interview, answering technical questions, and doing white-boarding. The whole job application process is just debilitating.


I don't even know if I want to be a programmer. I'll go through waves where I really enjoy working on projects and improving my coding skills, but then I'll let that project rot for weeks or months at a time. I've thought about going back to school, but I don't even know for what. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. I have no agency or discipline whatsoever. I'm not sure if I should just work some random job to get some money in for the time being, or keep with coding since I spent four years getting a degree for it, or do something else entirely, or just... I dont know.


Apologies if this post is all over the place. I'm just scattered, and I don't know how to coalesce. I don't know what it is I need. I just had to get these thoughts down and out of my head. If anyone has any advice, or just wants to share their story, or give me a reality check of some kind. I just need someone to tell me something. Anything"
yur9h1,1,2022-11-14,Should I take out a loan to study abroad?,Purdicialle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yur9h1/should_i_take_out_a_loan_to_study_abroad/,"Asking here simply because I'd like some objective opinions.

I am going into my 5th year of college, I'm supposed to graduate from nursing school with my BSN in December of 2023 (I took a detour, changed majors, dropped out at one point, so I'm running a little behind.) My last semester we're supposed to take 3 classes with 3 clinicals. For those who don't know, that's a pretty intense workload. But my university offers a summer study abroad program for 1 month to go to London that would give me credit for 1 class and 1 clinical, significantly reducing the workload. I've always wanted to go to Europe, and it's a class that studies community health. I'm a very big advocate for a socialized health care system so I'd honestly be thrilled to take this chance to study it. It would be a once in a lifetime opportunity I feel like- a chance to be apart of the European healthcare system, which I likely won't be able to do later in life given that I'm receiving an American degree and license. 

The problem is is that this 1 month program in $7,000. I've paid for every semester I've been in school out of pocket, and have saved enough to cover my next semester (4th, around $4,000) upfront, meaning I'd only need to work and save over the summer for my 5th semester to graduate totally debt free. My parents still claim me as a dependent, so I receive absolutely no financial aid because they make too much- but again, I pay for everything on my own. I receive nothing from them for my education. I don't see being able to go on this trip for less than $5,000 even if I'm lucky enough to receive some sponsorship via my university. It's unlikely I could save up enough money to go on this trip during the semester because the workload is so heavy. I could manage maybe $1,000 if I'm lucky and cut back on literally all my expenses. I could save roughly $2,000 the month before I go on the trip working full time after the semester ends. Taking out a loan would be non-negotiable in the end.

On top of that, I'd miss out on a full month of working if I go to London. I use summer to save as much as possible for school, meaning I'd really only have the month after the trip to get up as much money as possible for the semester- only about $2,000 if I work full time that month. It's generally considered impossible to work your last semester of school, so I'm keeping that in mind. My last semester will cost around $6,000 if I do the study abroad (2 classes with clinicals), or about $7,500 if I don't (3 classes, 3 clinicals.) If I grind all summer I should be able to get the $6,000 then use the rest of my savings to graduate with no debt. But if I do the summer abroad I'm looking at $10 to $15k in loans between the program itself and my final semester.

This seems like such a good opportunity. And I'd really love to pursue it- especially because having only 2 classes my last semester seems so, so nice- but I'm terrified of graduating with debt. I've worked so hard to finish up with nothing and I'm terrified of it spiraling out of control after I graduate. 

Basically I'm asking for someone else to give me their objective opinion on whether or not it's worth it to take out the loans, or if I should just stay home and graduate debt free?

(I'll also add 2 things: 

1. There's an internship here at the local acute care hospital for nursing students over the summer that I could apply for. I'd basically work as an actual nurse full time for 3 months over the summer *and* get paid for it. But I had problems at this hospital when I worked there around 2 years ago, and I'm unsure if it'll follow me. I'm also only an average student (Bs across the board), so I don't think I have good chances at receiving the internship. If I thought I had better chances, I'd jump on the opportunity. 

2. I'd also have to pay the $250 application fee to see if I even qualify for any amount of sponsorship/scholarship from the university for the study abroad trip, which makes me even more reluctant because that it a massive amount of money to me.)"

yusepc,8,2022-11-14,Alegere dificila,Dear_Ad1426,programare,https://www.reddit.com/r/programare/comments/yusepc/alegere_dificila/,"Salutare, redditori. Revin si eu cu o intrebare la care as vrea sa imi raspundeti cat se poate de sincer si sa imi spuneti cum ati proceda voi intr-o astfel de situatie.  
Sunt student in anul 3 la o facultate de informatica (cred ca e irelevanta facultatea, sau orasul).  
An destul de greu, licenta, proiecte, nebunii, deci stresul la ordinea zilei.  
In acelasi timp, sunt si intern intr-o firma de automotive de cateva luni. Program flexibil, salariu destul de decent pentru un internship iar workload-ul nu e destul de mare. Lucrul asta imi permite sa ma pot axa si pe alte chestii cum ar fi invatat, licenta si timp liber.  
In ciuda tuturor acestora, zona asta de embedded nu pot spune ca ma pasioneaza si nu m-as vedea facand asta in viitor.  


Nu de mult timp am inceput un curs de web dev organizat de o alta firma, mult mai mica.  
Cursul pare destul de bine facut, mentorii destul de bine pregatiti, iar acum cateva zile mi-au spus ca ar vrea sa ma alatur echipei lor, pentru ca sunt destul de bun pe zona asta de web si cursul e dedicat mai mult incepatorilor, deci pentru mine e mai mult o pierdere de timp.  
Mi s-a programat o discutie cu fondatorul firmei ca sa imi faca o oferta (ca mna, firma mica).  
Zis si facut. Discutie cu omul de acolo, care parea destul de interesat in a ma angaja. Initial am crezut ca e vorba de inca un internship dar aparent au nevoie de un fullstack junior pe post, pentru ca un om de-al lor din echipa aia isi va da demisia.  
Cand am cerut cateva detalii, mi-a spus ca se grabeste ca are o sedinta si ca vrea sa ne mai vedem inca o data ca sa discutam despre salariu si alte detalii de genul, ceea ce mi-a cam dat un mic turn off.  
Urmeaza sa ma vad cu el astazi si sa vad cam incotro ar merge discutia. Intre timp, am primit oportunitatea de a trece pe post ca junior software engineer in firma in care lucrez, cu o flexibilitate cu atat mai mare, salariu dublat si destul de multumitor pentru mine si posibilitate de lucru full remote, iar chestia asta m-a cam pus pe ganduri.  
Uitandu-ma pe undelucram la firma cealalta, am observat o diferenta de vreo 15 la suta intre salariile pe postul de junior, cat si dezamagiri ale oamenilor care cumva se vaitau de faptul ca se lucreaza pe branci pe bani putini si esti cumva obligat sa vii mereu la birou, fara a putea lucra from home.  
Avand in vedere ca acel curs de web se tinea tot in firma aceea de doua ori pe saptamana de la 18:00 la 20:00 si erau momente cand vedeam ca oamenii ieseau din birouri pe la 19:30 si plecau acasa, am inceput sa cred ca ceea ce oamenii scriau pe undelucram incepe sa se adevereasca.  


Imi place web-ul, e fain si e de viitor si ma vad mai mult lucrand pe zona asta  decat in automotive, dar fiind inca in facultate, flexibilitatea pentru mine e un must have.  
Oare sa ma risc si sa vad ce presupune firma mai mica, sau sa raman in firma de fata pana termin facultatea, sa accept postul de junior si sa imi reconsider optiunile abia dupa ce termin facultatea?  
Nu vreau sa ajung sa ma dezamagesc singur. Stiu ca nu ar trebui sa imi pese de bani, ci mai mult de propriul progres, mai ales acum la inceput, dar oricat as vrea asta, am nevoie si de bani, pentru ca ma intretin singur si mna, nu e usor.  


Sper ca nu v-am plictisit si ca veti putea empatiza putin. Vreau sa vad ce ati alege voi intr-o astfel de situatie.

I wanted to reach out and see if there's been anyone in a similar situation as me and how you went about it. Last school year I didn't get any internships mainly due my lack of experience and poor GPA(2.8). I'm getting a little discouraged from the constant rejections and want to see what I can do differently. Any thoughts are welcome. I'm slowing pulling up my GPA from what it was but I feel like at this stage I should have gotten at least one offer."

Pay: $47/hour

Location: Remote (Biggest con for personally - I wanted a good social experience this summer)

However, I've been told to be happy with the offer I've received. Should I continue to keep looking for more, better roles? The job search has been tough this season, and I have 14 days to accept this offer. 

My main hesitation is about the role being remote since my last internship was also remote, and I was incredibly bored sitting at home, seeing all my other friends have in-person internships. 

Any advice?"

yv4xe5,2,2022-11-14,Should I renew my lease or sign a 6 or 10-month one?,Dr_Garp,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yv4xe5/should_i_renew_my_lease_or_sign_a_6_or_10month_one/,"So RN I (23m) am paying $1,090 in rent and I plan on graduating in the fall of 2023 baring no unforeseen events.

My lease ends in July and I still don't have a steady internship or graduation plan despite my effort so I know I have to sign for at least 6 months. My building management told me if I sign the full 12 then I can keep my same price but if I sign a 6 or 10-month lease then my rent would increase by $200 a month.

Just doing quick math I'm pretty sure that means every 5 months I'd be paying an additional month of rent, well I certainly will at month 6.

I'm guessing the 10-month lease is for the best but I honestly don't know what I should do. I'm hoping to have an internship secured so I can work after I graduate but I'm nervous so my body is saying buckle down and sign a year. I think that's the fear talking and I just need to push myself past it so I'm looking for outside opinions."
yv531l,3,2022-11-14,Should I rather pursue a master degree of my choice instead of finishing the Medicine degree (5th year out of 6) when feeling that practising medicine as a doctor (especially in a hospital) is not what I want to do anymore?,Medellinish1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yv531l/should_i_rather_pursue_a_master_degree_of_my/,"Dear Reddit Community,

I am writing this post in a situation, where I am finding myself quite disillusioned and sometimes even desperate considering my future and potential professional career and was hoping to find here some opinions and perspectives from outsiders.

I graduated with a BSc in Engineering Physics from a Middle- European Technical University. After graduating I went on to pursue a Master (2-year program) in the same field. During the first year though I started being more and more discontent with what I was studying and my perceived (!) perspectives in the job market. I noticed I didn’t want to stay in academia and do research and publish one paper after another, at least not in the scope of lab physics and the things I saw at my university. And as alternatives I only saw myself coding and modelling and cranking numbers the whole day for any tech company (typically Siemens, Bosch e.g. around here) or even the finance industry (some ex colleagues went into consulting, banking etc.).   
Now, what was my inner conflict there? All of a sudden the idea of spending a major fraction of my time with only quantitative math/engineering/tech stuff in front of a screen for some company and their product seemed dull, boring and above all unfulfilling to me. I felt that I didn’t fit in there as I also saw myself as a very humanities- orientated personality with good talent for languages, writing etc. and next to that I have a deep passion for music and film, which I both do exercise as much as I can.

Before starting physics I also had a spot for studying Medicine, but didn’t go for it. And when I was in the situation described above, I hated myself for not having gone that route, saw the gras so much greener on the side of my friends who were already finishing their medicine degree and who were seeing and doing cool stuff I assumed. That’s when I thought “now or never” – I wanted to go this route aswell, I applied again, did the admissions test and got in – and so I started the Medicine degree at age 25 (6 year program here in Europe, it's not like grad schools in the US). 

Fast forward: Now I’m in the 5th year and really recognized, that I didn’t know what I was getting myself into. Right now, I can’t stand the idea to work in a hospital and in the system which runs it. There are so many factors and aspects of the work as a doctor that repel me and studying the clinical content at this point like the ins and outs of medical conditions and their treatments doesn’t stimulate me intellectually either. And so, I find myself once again at a point where I feel I’m explicitly heading towards something I don’t want to do. The only specialty I’m still considering is psychiatry for a diverse set of reasons, but I feel closer to simply not wanting to practice as a doctor. 

From 4th year on I was contemplating quitting and pursuing a Masters instead, ideally something more interdisciplinary and I would probably have been still faster with this than finishing Medicine. Now this is not necessarily true anymore as I’m already in my 5th year and I’m having a hard time deciding if I’d still rather go for a Masters or not.   
I guess at this point I was hoping for advice or maybe some opinions of Insiders of diverse industries about my situation and educational background. Could graduating with a degree in Medicine and also having a degree in Engineering Physics (BSc) be viable enough to find interesting job roles outside of Medicine? Despite of my described feeling at the beginning I didn’t completely lose my interest for coding e.g. or other related skill sets. Of course, I also enjoy the interaction with other people and the entrepreneurship side of certain projects would appeal me. I don't have a clear idea of what those jobs outside of medicine could be and I guess this is also part of my question here.  
 If I really feel and know that I would want to look for something outside Medicine, I’m wondering if finishing the Medicine degree plus having the degree in Physics and other interests are good and broad enough. Or should the consequence rather be to quite Med School and to pursue a Master degree instead  (e.g. something Computer Science related, Data Science or maybe even something towards Management)?

Side Info about myself: Being completely honest and open I’d say that my real dream would actually be to make a living with producing projects that are passion related (music/film/media arts) - but ok, many people might feel similar and the odds are slim I guess. I am not seriously considering to study something art related – at some point in the middle of my doubts and desperation I did and I spent a lot of time looking at programs for film, multi media arts, music computing, media technology etc. (the last two would combine technical abilities in the context of arts or something creative let’s say). But so far, my conclusion was to work on my passion independently and not study them academically, as I also perceive that these industries don’t give so much f\*\*\* about degrees and quite some of those who inspire me don’t even have related degrees and ultimately, I know the odds of making it. Guess my point in telling this is to emphatise that my heart is actually here and in neither of the things I had mentioned before, but I know of the importance of a viable day job and I also want to be able to have somewhat satisfying options within a ""day job"". 

And in terms of the important and necessary day job I’m simply struggling with the question whether  finishing Medicine or doing a Masters instead is the wiser thing to do when practicising medicine is an outlook that doesn’t excite me at all anymore.

You might think that I’m all over the place with my interests or wishes and not focused enough. I hope not to come across completely naïve and childish. I don’t expect that others take the decision for me, but rather hoped that I might find people from a range of industries here who could give me valuable opinions and insights of their experiences. I sometimes felt discouraged when reading different things about trying to get into jobs outside of Medicine (at least clinical med, but eventually completely outside) after graduating in Medicine, also when in my case I hold a BSc in Physics too. 

I’d appreciate any opinion about my situation and decision dilemma and also thank you for the patience for going through the long text in case you did. Thank you!

Ps: Beside clinical internships I have experience in research based work in academic settings and in a centre for ion beam therapy, where I did some programming. Nevertheless, my programming and math definitely already got somewhat ""rusty"". 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : BSc in Engineering physics, started studying Medicine after graduating (6 year programm in Europe, no grad school), but being currently in 5th year feel totaly desilusioned and don't want to practice medicine as a doctor anymore. Can't stand the thought of working in hospitals anymore. I feel that I want to look for jop options outside medicine once I'm done, but dont know if finishing the degree in Medicine will help me there or if I should rather invest the remaining time in a master degree that could help me revive my programming and quantitative skills (data science e.g.).   
When it comes to passions and dream jobs my heart is not in neither, but more in the artisitic realm (music, film) - independently of what my day jobs are, I would always want to try to eventually ""make it"" at some point."

yvc297,2,2022-11-14,Path After CS Associate,Magnumalloo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yvc297/path_after_cs_associate/,"Hello, /r/cscareerquestions 

I know questions like these get asked a lot, but I've read the wiki and searched around and am still unsure what to do (esp with the recent events in the tech job market).

I am finishing my AS in CS this December. I live in Central VA. Mid 20s. No family or debt or job experience outside of retail/food service. At this point, I have job offers for non-SWE 9-5 jobs, and I'm keen on getting out of retail hell. That said, being a SWE is the long term goal. I'm in it for more than just the money, and I'm willing to be as patient as needed.

The way I see it, there are 3 main options for me here:

* Take an unrelated full time job and try to work on my SWE stuff on the side. LinkedIn, personal projects, job fairs, the works. (This is what I've been doing so far, and I do genuinely think I'm improving at a good rate for a mostly self-taught developer).
     * Pros: Cheapest, no rush, gets me out of dead-end jobs sooner
     * Cons: No networking, worst job prospects

* Transfer to a 4 year to finish my Bachelor's. Options are UVA (really good school) and JMU (meh school, no disrespect meant). I'd like to think I'd get in to UVA with my gpa and other stats. Probably would only be able to do a part time job with this.
     * Pros: Networking, easier job prospects
     * Cons: Most expensive, may be harder to manage with part time work

* Do an online Bachelor's in CS. Options here are WGU-style ones as well as Old Dominion University (where I can transfer with my 2yr stuff easily since it's in my state). I could either do this with a part time or full time job. 

    * Pros: Easier job prospects, in the middle as far as cost
    * Cons: Not much better for networking than option 1 since it's all online.
    * I feel like this could also be substituted with a boot camp as there are university offered ones nearby, and I've seen some people in my local industry having used those to get jobs.

Having spoken IRL with a lot of people in the field including those at FAANG, it seems that getting a bachelor's is [less about the classes taken and more about the opportunities for internships and networking within the school] (https://old.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uutzty/psa_what_should_you_be_doing_during_your_cs_degree/) (hence UVA being my top choice as it's a very respected school). I don't have access to these amenities without being at a 4yr, and it seems like an incredibly uphill battle to break into the industry with my current ""accreditations"" even if I have stellar personal projects.

Thanks."

Since then I sort of struggled to find work. I was employed in 2021 to April of this year, when my boss had to lay off several employees because they were receiving fewer clients.

Now I got an offer for a Business Analyst internship position at Amazon in Germany. The internship will start in April 2023 and last six months. Honestly Amazon is one of my dream employers and I think it will be interesting to intern at FAANG. And I also think it would be great for my CV and my future career. But I‘m not sure if I should take the internship offer as I could already start a fulltime position then (as I will be a graduate then). Maybe some of your had a similar experience and could give me an advice on how to decide and what’s the best for my career.

Would you intern at Amazon as a Business Analyst when you have a data engineer background and already finished your university studies? 

Thank you!"

I am finishing my practicum this semester and moving onto completing the rest of my hours toward the masters degree at an outside clinic. 

The practicum has been doable because I'm only taking like 4 clients at a time. I have been working a GAship during the day and then taking my clients and going to class. 

My internship will require at least 16 hours a week. Finances are already tight to This is where it gets complicated.

 I have a young daughter and I share custody with her dad, every other week. If I work evenings I will literally *never* see her and as a result, my already part time GAship will be affected. Second fun fact. I am almost 7 weeks pregnant. I could get a full time position as a substance abuse counselor (my pre masters field) but then I'm looking at:

A. Working from 9-9 almost every weekday and never seeing my kid and being oregnant.

B. Postponing my masters degree, getting a ft substance abuse job now before I'm showing, and picking up my masters later (I literally am almost finished and am deeply in debt)

C. Finding some kind of super flexible part time job in my field so I can make more than fifteen bucks an hour, or a job that let's me work evenings every other week (doesn't exist). 

I just don't know what to do. This looks impossible to me. I'm so scared and sad. If you are a therapist who finished your masters with small children (bonus points if you were already divorced too with barriers to child care and every day access to your kid) how did you do this? 
Did you just suck it up and miss 8 months of your child's life almost entirely? I don't know if I can do that.
I started this masters degree and my life was completely different. Everything fell apart and I don't feel like I can finish this degree. I'm remarried and asking my husband to get a second job so I can finish this degree feels like shit too. So bad feelings all around."
yvf4g4,2,2022-11-14,How I got my first (real) programming job,SpideyLee2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yvf4g4/how_i_got_my_first_real_programming_job/,"It was not easy, but I feel like the path I eventually followed was guaranteed to yield results positive results at some point, so I figured I'd share my journey to becoming employable here.

Rather than give you my entire life story, I'll try to keep it short and to the point.

I got a BS in Computer Science 2 years ago. 

I had a short, 3-month internship in college for VR game dev, but it was poorly led and I had no help from anybody, so it was a disaster with not much to show. I also ""worked"" as a contractor using Pega after a bootcamp provided by my hiring agency. That was the biggest waste of time I have ever experienced which, once again, had almost nothing to show for my efforts over 8 months.

Seriously. Unless you hate yourself, DO NOT work with BPMs like Pega or Salesforce.

After that, I realized I needed to take matters into my own hands. I took an easy remote job unrelated to programming and began researching graphics programming.

After about 6 months of slowly learning, I was finally confident enough to work on a up project, though I got a little in over my head: I tried making a voxel engine like Minecraft. It didn't get far, but it allowed me to apply some of the knowledge I obtained from my online lectures, while also encouraging me to learn different concepts (mostly multithreading and voxel-specific draw optimizations).

This was hands-down the best thing I could have done to break into the field of programming.

I briefly worked on a physically based renderer (after realizing a voxel engine was too steep for me at the time), and shortly after, I received a few interviews at different companies for entry-level software development (unfortunately not graphics-related, though).


Of course, I got rejected many times before this. Like... a lot of times.

I didn't realize how much expertise was required to get (professionally) into the field of graphics. After about 150 applications to graphics positions alone, I broadened my search and got a 79k + benefits job as a software developer. It may not be exactly what I wanted, but I will learn so much that I hardly think it matters. The knowledge and experience I will obtain will make it that much easier to get into the exact field I want later.


TLDR; learn and work on that interest you to build your portfolio. Try to make your projects focus on different coding techniques/problems so that at least some of the knowledge you gain is new and universally applicable. When applying for jobs, even if a position isn't exactly what you want, if it can be used as a stepping stone to get you there, don't hesitate to look into it."

I go to bars, my local skate park, and events around town but everyone already seems to know one another and they don't exactly seem appreciate when I come up and try to make conversation. 
I used to have friends. Had a big group of them in school but then the pandemic happened and everyone just seemed to drift apart. I've tried reconnecting with old buddies but I just get silence in return. 
I just feel empty. I've tried to occupy myself with writing projects, new hobbies, and work but it's still there.

Compensation: Roughly equivalent (slight edge to Palantir for the internship), from levels it seems that Palantir is better for the full-time position.

Name Brand: I am a junior, so would be applying to new grad positions next year. If/when applying for new grad positions next year, which company would be more useful for a resume

Growth/WLB: Which company would you learn more from? I've heard that at Palantir you can work on more relevant projects but Amazon has more developed infrastructure/better code base. Additionally, any comments on WLB would be helpful.

Job Stability: Both companies have relatively high return offer rates, but with the recession/tech failures in the last year which company would have the more stable outlook? Would definitely consider working for either company if given a return offer.

Ethics: Have seen a lot of vague comments on Palantir's ethics and was wondering how significant they are compared to Amazon (who has its own share of morally questionable decisions)

Sorry in advance if anything looks weird

For context, I'm sec sch &gt; ITE DPP (higher nitec) &gt; poly student, currently in a Y1 (going to Y2) game art course (not revealing poly bc I'm afraid that irl ppl will figure out who I am lol). Higher nitec course also in game art. During Y1 Sem 2 of poly I decided to defer and return to school the next year because of mental health issues. GPA is 3.4+.

During my deferment break I dabbled in various things (learnt an additional language, tried setting up a small business, dabbled in various new hobbies, etc) which was really enlightening and enjoyable ofc. Now that I'm back in poly, I realised that (even after getting my mental health under control), I don't even enjoy poly itself.

To be completely honest, there's less freedom in poly compared to ITE. There are some lecturers who are basically sec sch teachers with control issues, and out of the many lecturers I've met so far, there's only one or two who actually care about the students as people. The rest of the lecturers are really just there to teach and go home as fast as they can... As compared to my ITE experience, where all the lecturers wanted us to succeed and tried their best to help us no matter how difficult it was.

Apart from that, after tasting internship in ITE, I really enjoyed working, and setting up a small business (though it doesn't earn much) also made me happy. So it's kind of frustrating to be in poly right now, where the environment feels limiting and my work isn't being rewarded. The content itself/workload is fine with me and I'm not stressed out about that, but it feels like a miserable 3 year slog ahead just to get a paper cert when I've already been taught similar skills in ITE.

As to what my plan is... I'm actually thinking of gathering my portfolio and resume right now and sending it to job listings. If I can get a foot in, I'll drop out of poly and just start working. And if not, I'll just endure the 3 years.

I guess the reason why I'm posting here is because I've tried to look through similar posts in this sub, but the sectors are all heavily reliant on paper certs (engineering, business, etc) which isn't comparable to my sector, where portfolio is king. So I'd like to ask for advice, for those who are in similar sectors, if my plan of action is advisable or if I should really just suck it up and go through the 3 years.

I am gonna have to make a decision soon rather I want to intern at my dad's company next summer or accept an internship at a co-op and it would be great if anyone who has experience with this at all could give some input. I am struggling to figure out what is the right move here. Also, I am a sophomore electrical engineering student if that makes any difference. 

My dad's company is bigger than the co-op company, as it is a Fortune 1000 company, so perhaps it would look better on a resume. It is also just for the summer as well, which means I could maybe land internships at the same tier or better in the years after while also not having to delay graduation. If I take this route, my end goal would  hopefully be an internship at NASA probably in my senior year. 

As for the co-op, it is near my university so I would have to pay additional for housing and transportation, and the pay is not exactly great at $20 per hour. However, it is a small/medium sized company so you might get more experience and more involved in projects and stuff. It is also a pretty long term commitment though too and delays graduation. 

So my question is, does experience matter more or does the name matter more. I heard bigger companies on your resume opens more doors and opportunites, but I have also heard others say experience matters more. I am just not sure what route to take at this point, and any help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm 17 live in the UK , I have been coding for about 2 years on and off now and not sure what is the best path into the industry

my options are do a Open University Computing &amp; It Degree (can't go to traditional Uni because of current financial issues) not sure about this as I won't really be able to network or go to job fairs and might have a difficult time getting internships which is a big point of university

I(18) currently work as a digital marketing intern earning around $300pm(keep in mind the lower cost of living) which isnt much so money is tight(although I still live with my parents).  

I'm thinking about pursuing a career as a software engineer, I have 2 main ways to go about this: Online university(University of the People, this is a tuition-free university but comes out to $5000 all costs considered) or self-taught. The reason I am not considering a traditional university is because of the cost and the fact that I got a foreign qualification and I would most likely have to repeat the last year of high school again to go. 

My main question is, is it worth pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science? From what I have seen, most dev jobs in South Africa require a degree but I'm sure if I looked hard enough I could find one that doesn't require a degree. What would the time frame of self-taught be vs a degree? I would need to spend 4 years getting a degree(Although it is possible that I find internships while studying). I'm not sure how long it would take to teach myself, any estimates would be appreciated but I understand that it varies a lot on a person-to-person basis. Both options require a lot of hard work and self-motivation as I would be on my own for the most part in both.  

tldr: Is an online cs degree worth it or should I try to go down the self-taught route?"

I started a junior dev role about 5 months ago and I'm questioning whether this workplace is right for me.

So I'm 23 and have a degree in CS, with some internships that involved coding, so I'm relatively new to it. I love coding so far and was always honest with my abilities to my employer. My current workplace has some issues that just strike me as odd, namely bad management: (Note, I am the youngest by far in the team, the next oldest person is 10 years older than me, most are in their late 40s-50s

\- Tickets commonly only have titles, and I get told off for not researching/asking for the acceptance criteria and ticket details the MINUTE I'm assigned the ticket at standup. I also get told off for not estimating completion time properly

\- I was never told about the company's infrastructure, the documentation is all out of date and I have to teach most things myself

\- I was told to be curious and ask a lot of questions at work, which I usually do anyway, but my manager and seniors get overly upset at most questions, or tell me things like ""what do you think, try to figure it out yourself"", ""This isn't relevant to your ticket, so you don't need to ask about it"", and most of my suggestions in meetings are insulted or called ""madness"" or ""ridiculous"" (example below)

\- It feels like I'm watched much closer than others, There is a task that rotates every week. When it was my turn, my documentation, work and progress was constantly criticized. I thought that's fine, guess I have a lot to learn, especially since I had to figure out what exactly to do myself by asking co-workers. Turns out for the last 4 months other team members did NOTHING for that task, with no consequences or call-outs from our manager. I was regularly criticized openly during standups

\- I am given HUGE tasks, which I take a longer than others for, without any senior to work with or approve any PR's. I regularly have to chase seniors, and it will take half a day to have them even look at a PR

\- When I book holidays I make sure to get written proof that I was allowed to take it (ie. via email). My manager never remembers and asks me why I was missing the day/week after

\- We have catch-ups with our manager every week, I would say that he attended 25% of them so far (I'm not exaggerating), never responds to me asking if we should reschedule and usually just ignores that he missed them.

I will give you an example of the above:

A few months ago I was tasked with moving data from an old table to a new table, with different, but mostly similar schemas. My thought process was to alter and update the old table to make sure the schemas match, then insert the necessary rows into the new table. Simple task. I asked a senior if this was ok to do or if I was missing something before making any changes. Instantly I was told that I should know to just select the required data with what's missing in the old table and insert it to the new one, and never to consider schema alterations since we aren't supposed to change the schema (due to reasons related to the company I could NOT have known). This turned into a rant about how I should be enrolled into a starter course if this is what I do, which was not professional in any way, it was rather rude and insulting tbh. I know sql, I have used sql in this very company, I just made a mistake, one that I even double checked to be sure? This person even knows I can do sql from past queries they saw me work on, which were a lot more complex.

Sorry for the long post, but is this normal? I feel like every bit of work I'm given is too vague, and I can never ask or suggest anything without being insulted. I know I have a lot to learn still, and I look forward to it since I really enjoy programming, but isn't this a bit intense? I feel so unguided and heavily criticized, considering they know I'm not that experienced yet"

yvzbxf,1,2022-11-15,"Brainnest, should you apply?",justafriendlycow,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/yvzbxf/brainnest_should_you_apply/,"Hey everyone, there's a newish company going around called Brainnest; you might've seen them on LinkedIn and from what I understand a lot of people are receiving the same offer for some kind of training program. A lot of people have their doubts on the company's legitimacy and as someone who just completed their Public Relations program last week, I thought that I'd share my experience for those curious about whether or not this is a scam. So for anyone wondering what the Brainnest training program was like, here was my experience (AMA!)

Like most of the people here, I was looking for some kind of employment on LinkedIn and stumbled across Brainnest with an open position for a Public Relations internship. I didn't have much to show for on my resume and I didn't have a lot of experience under my belt (I had just graduated from university about 2 months prior). I applied and got the same email from the HR correspondent, her name was something like Hanna Thompson and she told me that they weren't moving forward with my application but offered a PR training program instead. I was a little skeptical but I saw it as a way to gain some professional working experience and I get a little certificate at the end of the program.

So I applied.

The website asked me to answer some questions about PR to measure how experienced I was and after that I had to pay a fee of 130$; I understand that this is the part that many people were turned off, but to me I figured that this was just the price to pay to gain some real experience. After paying, I had to pick a time for a short 15-minute interview with a Brainnest HR member so that they could evaluate my level of English.

When the time for the interview came, I remember the person asked me four basic questions:

1. Tell me a little about yourself
2. What is PR to you?
3. What made you want to get into PR?
4. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I have to say, the lady looked really tired and to be honest the whole thing felt a little unprofessional. Her mic quality was bad that sometimes I struggled to hear what she said and she seemed like she was reading off some script. I got an email about two days later saying that I was accepted into the program, and I received a Zoom link set for October 16th.

The program was structured as follows:

\-4 weeks total duration, each class would be \~2.5 hours long

\-Every Sunday was a lecture where we learned the material and received our ""task"" for the week

\-In groups, we worked on said task throughout the week and make a presentation

\-Every Saturday we would share our presentation and have a discussion

In the end, I wouldn't call this a 'scam,' I got what I paid for: a 4 week course led by an industry professional. But there's some criticism that I would give:

The 'mentor' isn't necessarily a teacher, he's an industry professional. So although he knew what he was talking about, it wasn't presented in an engaging way. Most Sundays I found myself just listening to someone talk for an entire 2.5 hours. And although this may be a more personal issue, I found that most of the content was something that one could probably learn on their own via YouTube or something.

BUT to those still unsure, there are good things to say about the course :) you get to ask any questions directly to the mentor and I personally had a lot of my questions answered by someone who actually works in the industry of PR. It's completely remote so I was able to work from home and my teammates were all active and communicative; we were all somewhat in the same boat of trying to find a job. I got to meet new people and although the program ended, we still stay connected through LinkedIn.

I'll end by saying that no, I don't think that this is a scam. And I know a lot of people were told that by joining the program, they would have an opportunity to work with Brainnest afterwards; I don't think that that part is necessarily true. Instead of applying to this program in hopes of joining the company, I would instead view this as an opportunity to gain some experience, beef up your resume, and to make new connections; try to see Brainnest as a stepping stone for your next goal. I hope this was able to help someone!

\---

TL:DR

The Brainnest PR training program was not a scam. Rather than viewing it as a way to get a job AT Brainnest, I saw it as a ""stepping stone"" where I can gain experience, buff up my resume, and make connections."

My ticket was migrating our email gateway away from going through Sophos Security to now use native Defender for Office because we upgraded our MS365 License. Ok cool. I change the MX Records in our multiple DNS Providers, Change TXT Records at our SPF tool, great. Now Email shouldn't go through Sophos anymore. Send a test mail from my private Gmail to all our domains, all arrive, check message trace, good, no sign of going through Sophos. 

Now im deleting our domains in Sophos, delete the Message Flow Rule, delete the Sophos Apps in AAD. Everything seems to work. Four hours later, I'm testing around with OME encryption rules and send an email from the domain to my private Gmail. Nothing arrives. Fuck. 

I tested external -&gt; internal and internal -&gt; internal, but didn't test internal-&gt; external. Message trace reveals it still goes through the Sophos Connector, which I forgot to delete, that is pointing now into nothing. 

Deleted the connector, it's working now. Used Message trace to find all mails in our Org that didn't go through and individually PMed them telling them to send it again. It was a virtual walk of shame. Hope I'm not getting fired."
yvzsqp,2,2022-11-15,Choosing between two internships,isidorabi,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/yvzsqp/choosing_between_two_internships/,"I’m currently choosing a master’s thesis internship and both of my options are pretty solid - therefore I find it hard to decide.

There are a bunch of factors that I know only I can weigh on, but in general, one option is less organized, the project is yet to be defined, but it seems like it could yield interesting results and I could work on *applied* bioinformatics/transcriptomics/systems biology in neuroscience. The second research group is more organized, the project is pretty well-defined and the offer is more comfortable for me in many ways, but it’s more concentrated on molecular genetics and basically deals with nc transcripts assembly, which I imagine is not as groundbreaking, but the results would be useful and skills acquired pretty straightforward.

After I finish with my master’s, I would probably try my luck in the industry before pursuing a PhD - I don’t see myself never leaving academia. Does it make more sense to choose the second internship, with overall more applicable knowledge acquired for the industry, or does it still make sense to go specifically into a certain field with the first project? Both institutes are very good.

I am quite an indecisive but ambitious person and this is wrecking my brain ahah.

Thank you!"

* Improve yourself on SQL and start to solve leetcode.
* Then learn cloud (aws).
* After that build a pipeline, ETL project.
* Now you can start to apply jobs.

A few months ago I unfortunately got a speeding ticket for going 85 in a construction. Honestly - I drive a hybrid, I did not realize I was speeding and I try to drive as safe as possible. I’m a STEM major college student and was on my way to my internship so I had no intention of speeding like that. 

I know that is all probably irrelevant, but basically does this ticket not only cost over $600 bucks but it’s going to add a point to my driving record without an option of driving school. 

First question I had - my court date is November 23rd. Do I need to pay the ticket price either way, like if i go into court to talk to the judge do I need to pay it before or after? 

My plan was to go to my court date and tell the judge that I have learned from my mistake and just ask for the option of traffic school to avoid the insurance increase. I was planning on saying something along the line of - 
I am a college student trying to finish my degree, and paying the insurance premium will make that much harder for me. At the time I didn’t realize I was speeding, but I have learned from my mistake and now drive with cruise control on around the speed limit and always make sure I’m not speeding.  

Something like that. Let me know if this is a decent plan and what else I can do to minimize the toll of this ticket.

I am 24M (Filipino) finished Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - work as an IT Support Intern - Support Specialist - Quality Analyst for almost 2.4 yrs. After that, I started working in a 3-month contract under Gaming Company as Game Master which is I kinda passionate of (primarily customer service type of job).  Last employment : August 2022

I always prepare for the worst but always hope for the best. Currently, I am still looking for a job here in NZ and to maximize my time I’m taking online courses in related to programming just to refresh my academic learnings that I can use for future job. If you have any idea or any practical/way, it would be a great help. 

Sometimes mental health is my main problem but I always find something to overcome it. If you reach and read this post. Thankyou and I appreacite your time. Answers/Suggestions are not required but highly appreciated."

my_qualifications : 
Graduated in June 2022 with a Bachelors degree in Information Technology (Same syllabus as computer science except a couple of subjects - would this be a negative?) from Manipal Jaipur

CGPA- 8.38 (~3.5 GPA)

Currently working as a Frontend Engineer in a soon to be unicorn fin-tech startup since an year (joined during my last sem of undergrad as an intern and convered to full-time)

Did not do any research work during my undergraduate tenure

I haven't made a list of target schools yet but I know I'll definitely be aiming for the top 30s (don't know if I'm being overambitious) - Don't know what courses to apply for, but definitely want to stick to programming (I love JS and have written 5-6 articles on it - would this be a plus?)

I'm confused what I should do before preparing for my GRE since I'm not in a hurry --

Should I work on switching to a FAANG company here to have better visibility of my portfolio?

Or should I do some research projects with my past professors?

My main goal out of college is to work as an SWE there, I know I don't need another degree to be able to do that but I also want to go through the academic experience in the US and having a master's on your resume would help in the long term since I did not do my undergrad from a tier 1 college"
yw6uy2,7,2022-11-15,Urban Planner Seeking to Make Transition into GIS Developer Role - Advice on Postgraduate Education and Tranning,Right-Bedroom-9767,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/yw6uy2/urban_planner_seeking_to_make_transition_into_gis/,"Hi, I am a mid-level urban planner and economic development professional who has worked primarily in economic development and market analysis with some exposure to real estate development, transportation, and community engagement. I only have an undergraduate degree in Political Science, but I have managed to progress in this field and have recently obtained my AICP. While I love cities and planning have grown dissatisfied with the work recently due to the lack of career growth, dissatisfaction with politics, and the fact that it is too abstract for my taste. I have worked in local government, non-profit, and boutique consulting firms and I am also dissatisfied with the salary wall I've hit. I have always had an affinity for maps, geography, and computers, so naturally, GIS would be a great fit to combine these interests into a profession. I took GIS courses in my undergraduate studies which I really enjoyed. I have used it a little bit in my professional career and with internships, although it is limited to just ArcGIS desktop and ESRI Business Analyst. I have tried learning a little Python and R on the side but I have a very minimal understanding of them at the moment, but I would love to build myself into a role that can have me building GIS applications and have a general understanding of programming, software development, and data analysis.

With this being said, I would love to find a graduate-level program to build GIS and software development skills but don't know whether this program should focus on GIS or software development. I see a lot of programs for GIS (both certificate and masters level programs) but I want to have a position beyond a GIS technician where I actually create code and develop applications. I have thought about focusing more broadly on computer science to give me a well-rounded background that I could apply to GIS, but I don't know where to start there either. I've heard a lot about coding boot camps that are designed to teach coding in a shorter period of time and that they are supposedly popular with tech companies, but I am skeptical about their effectiveness, and whether I would learn code that I could apply to GIS applications.

My ultimate end goal would be to work for a private consulting or software firm developing GIS and urban planning software. My ultimate pipe dream job would be to work for ESRI.

Given all of this, I was wondering if any GIS applications and software developers (or any GIS professionals who come from a more general urban planning background) have any ideas or tips to be able to break into this field?"

I hope everyone is doing well. I am a junior in college and was trying to get an internship this coming summer. I have a good GPA, some personal projects on my GitHub, and, I think, a reasonably good resume. I have had two interviews and have been rejected for both positions (Software Engineering Internships). In one of the interviews, I knew why I failed; my code wasn't good enough. However, the next one I felt went decently well, and I came up with a good solution. It was not in person, it was in my own time, but I just got the second rejection letter. I emailed them asking if they could give me advice for the next go around. Is this appropriate to do? I liked the company I applied for and was hoping to at least explain the code I wrote. Is asking for advice from them a good or bad idea? I appreciate any responses."

I am having so much trouble with figuring out what to do after I graduate and I could use some advice... The career paths I would like to take are either in the business of energy (oil, gas, sustainables/renewables) or cyberrisk. I feel both are paths I am passionate about however I do not know how to get there, so here are my options...( I would greatly appreciate some advice if anyone can give some value to my though processes :) p.s. I have internship experience as well from this past summer working as a QA on a MS development team. I also was given a post-graduation offer but declined because I did not love the work

1. go directly from undergrad to get a masters degree in **data science/analytics** OR a masters of **management in energy** program (both are one year long)
2. get a **post-baccalaureate degree in computer science** ...(in my IS program, we currently learn python and sql basics, as well as other opportunities exist like HTML but I feel that I might be lacking in the programming experience and I fell that this is a viable option for me)
3. try to get a good **entry level job in the fields** I am interested in right after graduation to gain professional experience
4. **work internships** during the summer and maybe fall and play it from there 

\*\*\*I am open and willing to to a combination of any of these ideas I am just stuck on how to get to where I want to be in the most responsible way\*\*\* I would appreciate all of your help I really do need it :) &lt;3"
yweueb,8,2022-11-15,Graduate School Program Recommendations?,GeneGulanes,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/yweueb/graduate_school_program_recommendations/,"For context

I'm a recent grad of BSIT Specialized in Healthcare Technologies last June and now has a 5-month working experience as a Junior Web Engineer. And I am currently employed in a Healthcare Company Based on AUS which is working with Government Hospitals around the world.

I am planning to move from IC Roles as programmer to Management Roles like Technical Architect in the future pa naman pero would like to prepare.

I know Job Role and Experience ang tinitignan nang mga employers/interviewers for the role pero para sa akin I think HR will put you on top of the list if you have something na wala sa iba.

In my case Fresh Graduate with specialized degree, bootcamp (please dont waste of time lang), portfolio, published some small papers/research, decent internship with decent project na ginawa and small-time freelance clients. So, I got hired a few months before I graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of some of these:

* For Possible Architect roles?
   * Master in Business Administration
   * Master of Management
   * MS in Public Management
* For Possible Specialized roles?
   * MA in Social and Development Studies
   * Master in Public Health
   * Master in Crisis And Disaster Risk Reduction Management

Pero baka may ma suggest pa kayong iba.

PS: I am also taking certifications na for future roles that I want (AWS&amp;Microsoft Certs) and will be staying in the Healthcare Field nang IT.

I want to have a master's degree that complement or relates management roles.

If you also have school recommendations, please do drop them down.

Thank you very much."

I’m not necessarily brand new to programming; however, the most complex things I can make are a python program that can do user imputed math equations and a somewhat decent website only using html &amp; css.(most complex element being a table) My goals are, in high school maybe get an internship(this goal isn’t crucial for me to rush to obtain; just that some of my friends work internships doing front-end), see if I can get job offers to be a full time software developer job at eighteen, and if the previous goal doesn’t work then major in computer science then acquire a job as a back-end developer. I understand that front-end is easier to break into; however, I don’t want to hyper focus on front-end because back-end is what I’m passionate about. I want to learn the Meta back-end development course on coursera to get my foot in the door on learning how to become a back-end dev. What is your input on my plan &amp; is their a more efficient way to learn back-end or is my idea decent?"

As a 3rd year AAE student, the only experience I’ve had within my classes relevant to any of these would be CGT 163 and a few data analysis projects in Engr 131/132 and Stat 301. I’m looking to find some more experience with all of these subjects, but I’m not really sure where to start. Does anyone have any suggestions for classes/programs/clubs to take or get involved in to gain more experience?"

ywhoo7,242,2022-11-15,Anyone else terrified that their internship offer is going to be rescinded?,18thcenturydreams,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ywhoo7/anyone_else_terrified_that_their_internship_offer/,"Idk how I’m going to make it to June being this stressed every day. I signed my offer a while back and stopped interviewing etc. Now the current wave of layoffs is terrifying and now I’ve heard companies are rescinding internship offers too… it’s so terrifying… 

I really hope the whole layoffs wave slows down/stops… I’m so so so scared about my offer being rescinded 

And hiring season for internships is basically over at this point.

ywimg6,1,2022-11-15,"In Python, what's the difference between a variable, an object, a reference, and a value?",dcfan105,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ywimg6/in_python_whats_the_difference_between_a_variable/,"I've been discussing Python semantics with a friend who's helped me a lot in the past with understanding programming concepts and he keeps saying that a Python variable is ""a name bound to a reference"" and ""the object on the other side of the reference has a type and a value"" while the variable itself doesn't.  He's been trying to explain what he means, but I'm not just not fully understanding, so I'm hoping someone here can explain in a way that will  make more sense to me.  

I think part of why I'm struggling is that I'm very comfortable with the idea of variables and pointers in C because I first learned programming in C++ from a professor whose examples were very C-style, and because I completed an 8 month firmware internship which was primarily low-level c programming.  So at this point, the idea of a variable as being fundamentally linked to a physical memory location is kind of stuck in my head.  I tend to think of C variables as just labels for memory addresses and, in CPython at least, I know a Python variable's ID (obtained via the `id` function) IS just the memory address (that's what the CPython documentation says at least).  But I also know that if I do something like, 

    x = 5
    print(id(x))
    
    x = 50
    print(id(x))

it will print out two different values.  My friend said that's because the id doesn't really belong to the variable itself, but to the *object*.  So is the first ID number that would be printed by the above code then a *reference* to the ID of the *object* `5`?  But then, if `5` is an object, what's the *value*?"
ywinjo,2,2022-11-15,Could use some advice on what plan I should do when it comes to my Co-ops/Internships,H1saDa,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ywinjo/could_use_some_advice_on_what_plan_i_should_do/,"Hi guys had a career question.

So my school requires that we do a 3 terms of co-op (Spring, Fall, Summer). They do not really care when, just as long as it gets done. I was able to get a co-op from an Automotive OEM (I want to specialize in Automotive so this was really awesome.)  However one of the other companies that I applied to offered me a summer internship because I already accepted a co-op.  
So right now I am kind of stuck on what I should do.

My original plan was to do:  
Spring, Summer, Fall 2023: Co-op  
Spring 2024: Classes  
Summer 2024: Apply for a summer Internship  
Fall 2024: Finish my degree

However, now that I was offered a summer internship in 2023 my tentative plan looks like:  
Spring 2023: Co-op 1  
Summer 2023: Internship  
Fall 2023: Co-op 2  
Spring 2024: Classes  
Summer 2024: Co-op 3  
Fall 2024: Finish my degree

Both plans will have the same expected graduation date.

The reason I am having a hard time figuring out what I should do is that the internships and co-ops are gonna be in different states in the US. So I will be moving around a lot at least in 2023. But if I turn down this internship, I will have to reapply in 2024. So is it worth just taking what I get just so I do not risk losing my offer?

So the tldr is: should I just do my co-op all in one year and reapply for an internship later or hop between my co-op and my guaranteed internship for a year."

ywjca5,0,2022-11-15,Im losing hope and need to figure out how to keep going,Fuzzy-Procedure-9407,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ywjca5/im_losing_hope_and_need_to_figure_out_how_to_keep/,"(22M)   I actually was really happy  up until recently. In May, I graduated    with my  Bachelors and am  starting my masters degree in mechanical  engineering  this fall. I just  completed my internship for some good    work experience  and updated  my resume. My mom and dad were saying at  dinner how great I  have been  doing and I will be successful and I    should be proud of my   achievements. School is paid for and Ill end my    masters degree  without any debt. On paper, this should be a cause for    happiness.

Here  is the problem,    The midterm election news has been depressing me.  These goddamn idiots   are going to pass bills jacking up tax rates and  making it so I will   have less purchasing power, and stupid unnecessary  spending on programs  we cant afford, which is not good for debt. And  the scary part is this  makes 2024 so uncertain, we literally could be  handing the government to  fascism.

I  opened my Roth IRA  awhile ago and put a few thousand of my internship  money in it. I also  bought a few bonds as an investment. I want to be   successful   and own a  home one day. Its why I went to college. But now, what if my money isnt worth anything by 2024? 

As  I look at my future and my investments and see what these jackasses     are  doing in government, it makes me really scared for my future.   What   is  the point? What is the point of getting out of bed and   working on   grad  school, when it wont even benefit me? Why bother   getting a job   when Ill  just end up living in a car anyway because I   cant buy   anything. I called  my mom and dad to tell them about this,   and they   admit they didnt have  this problem when they grew up because   the world   was a little less of a  shithole (just a little). the part   that makes  me  super angry is that Im  powerless to stop it. Nothing I   say or do   matters, so do I have to just sit  back and watch as   everything I build   goes down a sinkhole?

How    do you   all do it? How do you cope when you feel scared, vulnerable,   and  disenfranchised? How do you regain a sense of control in your  life?  How  do you keep going when things look so bleak for  the   foreseeable   future? I am scared and uncertain. Especially since this   is  such a   volatile point in my life when I have so many important decisions to   make"

ywkz36,1,2022-11-16,Is it worth applying for jobs if i'm unavailable for almost 3 months of the year?,stjm2012,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ywkz36/is_it_worth_applying_for_jobs_if_im_unavailable/,"I'm currently a full-time university student studying remotely but a condition of remote study in some classes is that I must travel to the physical campus for 2weeks per semester to complete labs etc. I'm also committed to a scholarship program which includes a mandatory 3month internship over summer break (I live in the southern hemisphere so that's often November - February). I'm planning to start applying for casual positions in early 2023.

I quit my casual retail job earlier this year due to a change in ownership of the store. The new owner had no prior experience owning a retail business and as a result, I was often forced to complete management duties and additional duties outside my job position, such as training juniors and completing tasks I wasn't legally qualified to do so, out of necessity so the store could run. Almost all the original employees quit due how we were treated by the new owner so we were often severely understaffed too. The new owner often scheduled me on as if I was a full-time employee despite making it clear that I was only hired to work certain days and still a full-time student. They also refused to accomodate my request for the 3months off for the internship (understandable as this is the busiest time of year for retail but they had previously promised they would honour the arrangement I had with the previous owner) and scheduled me on the weekends which perhaps I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't for the fact that my internship was 3 hours away and I was forced to commute this every weekend. This was made worse by the fact that they started paying me significantly below minimum wage. So far below minimum wage that I at 22 (who had worked at this store since I was 14) was making less than our 14 year old junior that I was training. I know I was crazy to stay as long as I did but I was loyal to the previous owners who were so accomodating to me throughout high school and uni and financially, couldn't afford to quit my job. I obviously left on bad terms and definitely won't be using them as a reference but I feel this will make my job search difficult. 

I've managed to survive the past few months on what little money my scholarship program gives without using up too much of whatever I had managed to save over the years i've been working. Both my parents come from extreme poverty and we weren't well off growing up either so it makes me very stressed to not have the security of a job. The dilemma now is finding a casual position that will hire me with the knowledge I won't be available during the busiest part of the year. I can't afford to not have a job and I can't really afford to quit the scholarship program either.

Do I bother applying at all? If so, should I refrain from mentioning the time i'll need off or be upfront? Should I take the risk and drop out of the scholarship program?

tldr: Committed to a scholarship program that takes up a lot of time but doesn't give enough funds to live. Need a job but not sure how to convince one to hire me with such limited availability."

Although i think she is a nice person, I don’t respect my CT (cooperating teacher) as a teacher. She should not be teaching me, and i am very fearful for how i am to pass the TPA. 

Tldr: My CT does not give me positive feedback or encouragement, and i have never seen her teach. How am I supposed to pass the TPA if i have no idea what stuff is supposed to look like? Please give me the encouragement she wont give me and also any resources. Thank you. 

Big points: 1: not following program guidelines; 2: no support emotional/academic 3: i aint never seen her teach. 

Program Guidelines: 
Most importantly, she is not following my program’s organization, and thats fucking me over. In the beginning, she threw me in front of the classroom and said that her style is to make me figure it out on my own with her just “there”. The reasoning for her to throw me in like this is because SHE went the intern route and thinks thats how it should be for all of us since it worked for her. As inconvenient as this is in terms of my homework, i do like being more constant with the kids. Honestly, I would be fine with being an unpaid intern, except she DOES NOT give me the support i need.  

No support (emotional): 
She only gives me negative/constructive feedback. She has not told me anything good I’ve done or anything I generally do well. Here’s a consequence of the snowball: She returns this observation to my professor today about where I’m at in the semester, and in this observation, she reports that i am “frequently” (as opposed to “always”) open to feedback. How the fuck am I supposed to welcome your feedback when you only ever tell me what I’m doing wrong? I’m not confident or comfortable in the classroom and its because I’m not sure where to BEGIN because I’m not sure what I’m doing right. 

No support (academic):
She threw me in front of the class and told me what to teach, but i am not comfortable with the content yet, so this also affects my confidence. I literally had to read this specific book for this class, then follow this weak-ass TeachersPayTeachers curriculum that she gives me a week before i start teaching it. I’m a full-time student with 16 units on top of all the student teaching, so its not like i can create this stuff and constantly work on it. When it comes to assignments and stuff, i have no idea how to help students because I’m not comfortable yet with the curriculum. And because she wants ME to be the one in charge, she plays dumb when the kids ask her questions since its supposed to be all on me. The consequence of this is that the students have no consistency.  I am only there 3/5 days per week, so i cant stay on their butts the way she can. They have so many questions and i cannot answer them. 
- i am currently trying to CREATE curriculum for next semester, and she again only gives negative feedback about short stories i want to read. No alternatives or anything. 

She doesn’t teach:
She taught ONCE. It was the intro to Shakespeare where you learn iambic pentameter. After that, nothing. She’s very project-based, which is not what I aim to do, and it is not very helpful when I’m supposed to be learning how to teach. She does discussions, but when it came to me doing discussions, its on content that I’m unfamiliar with, so i cant do it correctly. 

I just have nothing to work with here with her, but i need to play cool with her because i cant graduate or get my credential if I don’t get full approval from her. She’s a shit teacher and i don’t respect her in the profession and I’m honestly scared for how I’m going to even succeed in the TPA if I’m literally not getting any skills here. 

I’m welcoming advice for approaching her, I’m begging for encouragement, any anecdotes you guys have, any fun resources or helpful things for interns that might be helpful. I essentially feel like an intern who has the mentor in the room lol. 

Thanks for reading."
ywlkst,5,2022-11-16,Beyond frustrated with internship,blithering_admin,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ywlkst/beyond_frustrated_with_internship/,"I started an internship 2 months ago with a government agency, and I'm beyond frustrated with my experience so far. I work with one other intern that is a complete idiot, and their internship was almost over when I was hired. Everyone assured me that there was no way they would keep her on, and it gave me some hope that I wouldn't have to deal with her fuck ups much longer, but she whined and complained about not having a job lined up that they made a new position for her. FML. And now, they hired a new tech in the office with ZERO experience in IT (basically taking the only other slot available for hire), which leaves me with no option to continue on after the internship is over. At this point, I have stopped caring. Do I look for a different internship? Jump into a first year help desk position?"
ywm32q,0,2022-11-16,Preparing for a Data Science Developer Intern position in just one day?,triple_a821,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ywm32q/preparing_for_a_data_science_developer_intern/,"Hello everyone!

I was selected to interview for a Data Science Developer Intern position and the interview date they've given me is just over 24 hours away. But the issue here is, I've never actually done anything related to data science. I've got no experience whatsoever in python. I'm currently applying for my first co-op position as a third-year CS student so I just applied to everything I could find in the software industry.

I'm not here to complain though. I'm super excited about the interview but I'm still pretty lost on where exactly to get started in order to prove that I will be ready for my position by the time I actually start working. Also, I'm confident that I will be ready for the position since it's about a month and a half away from starting, so I'm willing to do the absolute best I can for the interview.

Here's a small breakdown of what they said they would ask me about during the interview:

* Data Science Project Lifecycle
* Front End Web Development (this I'm familiar with)
* Back End - Databases and Data Relations (I'm familiar with NoSQL but very little SQL)

So, in conclusion, what I would like to know is what exactly I should focus on at the moment. Would that be learning some Python and how it's used with data? Getting more into SQL? Watching some crash courses on Data Science? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, thanks a lot!

Please free to point it out if there are similar posts as mine."

I am so grateful for all these opportunities, and I would love to hear some feedback on these options. This would be my final internship before graduation (currently a junior), and I would be interested in returning for full-time new grad. But I also wouldn't be opposed to recruiting for new grad in the fall.

All in the same location, so location isn't a factor. I also am not considering intern compensation, I just want to see which one would be the best for my career in the long run. I'm not going to name the mid-sized startup, but it's established and known within its sector (it's specialized), and I've heard that their intern mentorship program is quite involved.  One thing is that Stripe and Amazon are in-person, which I would prefer, while the mid-sized startup is remote.

My sister goes to MIT and is a grad student at Princeton rn but not sure that counts for anything. I obviously come from a very high achieving family which comes with its ups and downs for sure. My parents recently started donating to their alma maters when they realized anyone even cared lol, not crazy money tho and doubt it changes anything.

I got an offer last week for JPMorgan so I have to respond until the end of this week. Interview process with Databricks started too so I will know if I have an offer next week. I also completed survey with experience and preferences for Google so I guess interview process with Google will take the longest.

JPMorgan: Best job security, large company and very stable - unlikely to rescind the offer. Also the interview process was great, and the interviewers were amazing! Very high chance of return offer too.

Databricks: Better pay than JPMorgan and probably more interesting projects, but not sure how the company is doing right now and how safe the offer would be. Also they only have 4k employees, while Google has \~140k, JPMorgan has \~280k. Not sure if it means anything, but for me it seems smaller companies are less profitable and are more affected.

Google: Best pay and benefits, more interesting products, but they will have to cut costs in the upcoming days and also decrease salaries (?) which isn't looking safe at all, considering some people got their offers rescinded from Meta and Amazon.

I might be able to do two internships, e.g. Google in spring and JPMorgan/DB in summer, but what would you suggest me to do? :3"

I basically have four options - my current supervisor who I've done a research internship with, the postdoc who supervised me daily on said internship, my bachelor's thesis supervisor (which was ~2 years ago and at a different uni), and a professor whose course I took and then TA'd for.

I will definitely use my current supervisor as a first reference, but I wasn't sure what a good 2nd/3rd referer would be. 
The postdoc knows my work well but there might be overlap with the supervisor (plus idk if the admissions value it less because he is a postdoc and not a professor). 
The bachelor's thesis makes sense but the topic was quite different from what I'm applying for now (same field of engineering but different topic) and it was a while ago. 
The professor I TA'd for is very well recognised in the field and the course I took/TA'd for is relevant to my application (but he can only speak for academic achievements and not research).

For universities that ask for 3 letters it is fine, but for those that only ask for 2 letters I'm not sure who I should put as the second one. Is bachelor's thesis reference more important than a more recent non-research reference from a well-known professor? Am I overthinking this too much? If it matters my field is within engineering/computer science."

I joined here 2 years ago as an Intern and got a full-time offer later. I feel I'm stuck in my skills and unable to skill up.

Our tech stack is Java, SQL, MongoDB, Docker, and Azure. Most of the codebase is from the on-prem system that was migrated to the cloud 5 years ago and is a very legacy in nature. We do use Spring and Hibernate but since the application is very large, the work is mostly Core Java implementing business logic. I do not get to work on any other technologies as well and my technical skill is rusty. 

I don't have a good grip on OS (multi-threading and concurrency) or Networking as a good backend dev or recent tech like Kubernetes. I also don't have a deep idea of the Spring/Spring Boot framework or JSP/Servelet. Honestly, I did not Leetcode a lot in college and got the job fairly easily which I liked in the beginning but feels only monotonous. I also don't know much about Cloud and feel like an unskilled laborer. There is literally no mentoring at my company (we don't even have performance reviews once a year, forget 1:1).

How can I skill up and jump ship to companies where I get to solve interesting problems? I need to become fairly good at  understanding backend. There are a lot of resources on the internet which has caused confusion. 

I also am thinking what would I venture into after that, is it Front End (React,Angular) or Data Engineering which is in Buzz ? DevOps also seems interesting. I need suggestions from experienced devs in navigating the situation."

Big tech is losing people by the dozen right now. Amazon, one of the most prolific hirers of MBA students looking to break into tech at most B Schools, is laying off people this week, including recent MBA grads who joined just a few months ago. This is also true of Meta, Coinbase etc.  

The market is saturated with PMs right now trying to find jobs. This is a very different environment to even a year ago, when demand outstripped supply for PMs, and so companies were happy to take some portion of MBA grads despite not having prior experience.

In this environment, I anticipate that PM recruiting (and tech recruiting in general) is going to be affected and become much more competitive given the talent pool that's out there and actively looking. The situation may change in a year, but for those looking for tech FT recruiting now, and intern recruiting in the fall, I strongly recommend having a solid plan B. For anyone considering tech post a 1Yr program - I'd strongly reconsider that path as well."

I am applying for CS / Computational Biology PhD programs in the US this year (mostly coming from the CS and Machine Learning side), and I have a few doubts/confusion about whether my profile is competitive enough:

Strong points:

1. I have a Master's degree from a prestigious and well-known university.
2. I have published research papers, and more are on the way, although they won't be published before the admission process is over.
3. I have worked under a professor who is well-known in the field, and he knows me well.

Weak points:

1. I don't have a research paper as a first author.
2. I don't have a third LOR from a professor, only from a professional one. I tried to get some positions this year by emailing professors from other universities but did not get a response.
3. I don't have a 4+ GPA (just slightly less).
4. My major is in Computer Science, although I did take many computational biology courses, as well as CS courses like ML and NLP that are going to be relevant in Computational Biology

LOR:

1. From the professor who is well-known in the field
2. From another professor with whom I published a paper - although he is pretty blunt as to who he will give his ""top"" referral letter every year, and I am sure it's not going to be me.
3. From my manager at an internship as I mentioned before.

I mostly only want to apply to the CS and CompBio programs at following universities:

1. Harvard PhD CS / Harvard Biostatistics
2. MIT CS / MIT Computational and Systems Biology
3. Stanford PhD CS (with a focus on Comp Bio)
4. Some other top CS programs which have Computational Biology as a subfocus.

I haven't been very organized this year and have been financially troubled and hence I am a feeling a little bit of anxiety during this process - I am not sure if I can make the cut to these top programs (I have considered others but I will be mostly applying to these only).

P.S.:  I can also share my application materials if you want to advice me on that. I would really appreciate it as well :)"

Anyways, I had originally thought i was graduating in Spring 2024 which made me really push for an internship this summer, however my advisor is advising that I should take summer courses this Summer 2023 and go for an internship next Summer 2024. The main reason why she thinks I should do my summer courses now is due to the fact that certain classes aren't offered every summer, and it is best I take them while I can before I get to Summer 2024 and my required courses aren't being offered at that time. Going through with this, I believe I would have a greater chance at receiving an internship for next summer as I'd have more preparation time and a better GPA to help my apps.  I could really just use some opinions on this, considering the current job market, hiring freezes and whatnot, along with me not trusting my school the most when it comes to this kind of stuff."

This position will nearly double my salary and most people I've consulted with think its highly likely I will get the job. My plan is essentially to work here throughout the beginning of my career so I get professional experience under my belt. I feel as if the experience alone will help to guide me through my career and a degree wont be necessary and almost a waste of thousands of dollars at this point. On top of this I've really struggled throughout school my whole life and am beginning to realize that maybe school isn't for me (as its not for everyone necessarily). I think I have an opportunity here to shift my focus onto my career and I'm looking for professional opinions. With this I've also chosen to focus all my time on bettering my python abilities as I would like to be a python developer whether I be working with Tensor Flow and AI or Django and web development. So I want to know where my time is best spent learning at this point in my life/career. I feel as if I'm fairly proficient in programming and I'm highly driven when it comes to it.

Hey all, I am in a gap year right now, and finished up my freshman year last year. I am a philosophy major, minoring in French, but with interests broadly in the humanities and arts. I am very well rounded as a student, and generally really enjoy learning (valedictorian, graduated early blah blah). 

Philosophy and political economy has been my passion for the past 3 years, and I went into college knowing I wanted to go to grad school and become a professor in philosophy eventually. Because of scholarships and savings I can get my undergrad at my local uni (a really nice one) for pretty much free, so I was going to save the loans for grad school.

I have been considering switching to CS for two main reasons

1) more immediate career choices without grad school (that are decent paying at least)

2) possibility of working from home

CS seems to be a safe choice, and I feel pretty confident in my ability to succeed in my school's B.A in CS program. I am planning on learning C and Python before next academic year starts in case I do switch, and also taking courses on general CS on Khan Academy. I am already quite intuitive with AI, computers, and operating systems, and my background in philosophy has helped me develop critical thinking that could be of use as a software engineer, or something of the like. Because of all this, this is why I'm considering CS over some of the other lucrative choices such as Econ.

At this point in time, is the CS market oversaturated? Is it still as lucrative as a degree as it was 3\~4 years ago? I wanted a career that I was passionate about, and unfortunately CS isn't something I can be super passionate about, but its something I know I can succeed in, and eases some financial issues (i come from a low-income household). 

It also helps that the area I live in (Charleston, SC) is populated with a super high number of tech companies and my college has pretty good internship success with local companies. 

I am happy to answer any questions that help get a detailed answer!"

I’m an undergraduate International Relations major nearly finishing his 5th semester (junior year) of college. Currently, I have regrets about taking International Relations. Don’t get me wrong. I love learning IR theory and geopolitics, which led me to study the major in the first place, but as I lean toward the end of my studies, I think about the opportunities gained from finishing them. My goals when I first started were too idealistic, hoping for a job in the Department of State in the U.S. However, I have seen many people that have taken IR say they haven’t found relevant jobs even a couple of years after college. It makes me worry a lot about my future. Even if I do things that distinguish myself on my resume, like an internship for my degree, I am still worried.

If I were to change my major, it would probably be a stem major like Computer Science. During my first and second years, I was not that devoted to studying in college. However, in the past year, I had an epiphany that I love learning about everything, including the deeper perspectives. Apart from my studies, I motivate myself to independently develop my knowledge and aptitude in Calculus and the sciences. Even more consistently, I have been delving into programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and JS. I know it is usually never late to study something else, but I can be really impatient and disappointed with myself in matters that dictate my life. I am ready to go through hell, willing to take even Summer courses since I know I will graduate later if I go with this.

Any advice?"

When Reddit says they have a community for everything, they weren’t kidding! I’ve come here mostly to vent and find community, since I haven’t been able to do so with my previous cohort.

I’ve been in a situation that has spiraled since over a year ago now, and I feel like I am still paying for someone else’s mistakes. I completed the didactic portion of my masters program and “graduated” this past May. I specify the didactic portion because I had to complete my internship hours through this past October due to having a late start on internship (I was supposed to have started my internship in January of this year, and instead started in late February). Why did I have a late start, you might ask. Well my program has an interesting way of conducting internship matches: we must apply to a list per-proved sites, which is not uncommon from my understanding, but it must be submitted to the ONE and ONLY faculty member who is in charge of placing ALL students. Which wouldn’t have been too much of an issue, except that this faculty member decided she was only going to work part-time. And she is the only one who understands the process, which meant that no other faculty member ever could answer questions or help with the application process. Also, this particular faculty member had full jurisdiction to not send out your information to the sites you wrote you were interested in if she felt you were not a good fit — but then she also wouldn’t tell you that she didn’t send your information out if you didn’t ask, and even if you did manage to get an answer from her, she would never disclose the exact reasons as to why you were not a good fit. So you can imagine how this lack of delegation of responsibility and communication might have led to some issues. Without going into more detail than I already have, I’ll just say that information was not communicated to me in a timely manner, which ultimately led to a late start in internship.

The implications of this led to me working as a full time unpaid intern for several months longer than I intended. Because of my internship schedule (I had to work weekends as well), I was unable to get a job. Thankfully I had some savings and my parents helped me here and there to make ends meet while I finished up my hours. Fast forward to about mid-September, when I’m starting to gather the many documents necessary for becoming licensed in the state that I live in. I’m able to ask supervisors I’ve worked with early on if they would be willing to serve as a reference and fill out an associated form. All of them agree, including the supervisor I had at my internship site who I have worked with since late February. Well after having asked this supervisor to complete this form within a 4-week time period, she ghosts me. Keep in mind that I worked with her up until mid-October (asked her to be my reference mid-September so that she had time to decide if she could take time to fill out the form on my behalf — I reminded her to please fill out the form on my last day and she said she would). The deadline for having completed all of my application was quickly approaching, and after multiple attempts to reach her to no avail, I had to ask my program director last minute to be my reference.

The deadline for completion of my application is this Friday. My program director just submitted her reference form this morning. I felt so relieved. I couldn’t believe that everything had got done. But just to be sure, I sent an email to the board to check if I needed anything else.

Well they reply and say they need my final transcript. They requested this from me about a week ago, and I had explained my whole situation to them (about graduating but completing my internship past that) and they has said that was fine, to just send my final transcript in December (when my degree will be officially conferred). I bring this up in my email reply from the exchange today and they clarify: it was fine that I couldn’t send my final transcript until December, but they could not approve my license without it. And the deadline to have my completed application reviewed is this Friday.

What this essentially means is that I cannot work until January or later, making it 8 months in which I am without work. Throughout this time, I have been applying for jobs with an explanation of my situation and even accepted a couple — but the first place I accepted from ultimately rescinded my offer after the fact because they did not want to wait any longer for me to get licensed. I’ve been updating the second place I accepted from about my progress in the application process, but they have not replied to my emails in two weeks. So now I’m worried I’ve lost this job too, to circumstances out of my control yet again.

I don’t know what to do. I’m just about out of savings and my parents are frustrated and threatening to withdraw their support until they see progress. I don’t mind getting a retail job or something for the meanwhile, but it all royally sucks because it had so little to do with me. Any empathy and/or advice would be appreciated in this trying time."

This is our early research for our daughter at UNC Chapel Hill CS program. She is in her second year and is poised to graduate in three years. What is the best time to start the application for grad school?

With only three years of undergrad, how does the grad school see all of her grades by application time?

What are her potential target and reach schools if she is tracking a solid 4.0 GPA with team lead and leadership (Director) roles at her college CS clubs? Several internships with a few paid CS internships at top 10 global software companies. Is this hard to transition to an MBA program from CS undergrad?

Does HS academic and EC matter in the grad admission process? These are fairly strong.

Any feedback is appreciated. Please do not flame since this is our first post to research this topic, and we are just starting out.

The thing is that I hate it to my bones. I do boring menial stuff, I don't develop the skills that I wanted to, and it's not going that well for them either, one manager was not happy with me and I believe my reputation in the company is bad due to it. Now I do nothing useful in my day since I'm not assigned anything until 2 weeks. I feel like everyone is wasting their time and money in this situation.

The thing is that I have several projects of companies that I want to launch, mainly software. I'm not even expecting it to work out and make me a millionaire, but I want to acquire the skillset of creating softwares and companies.

Money wise I could live at my parents and even save a lot of money with subsidies for unemployment.

So the only question is wether or not I'm going to get stuck in my career if I did something else that's vaguely related to my initial field for a year which didn't work.

Let's face it, they don't need to care. There's not much competition, and you pay for the hardware. The software is there to gather your data. If it breaks, it breaks. Some intern might hotfix it eventually.

I was seeking an answer to this and came upon the rabbit hole of open-source firmware. While it sounds promising, I won't lie — it's beyond my skills to properly judge these solutions.

Has anyone here had any experience trying to use these custom programs to make their gadgets work? Would I have a more reliable experience looking for user-made software to plug my mouse, keyboard and controllers in? Are there any more universal programs you would recommend?

If you choose the 4 year bachelors degree, there is no internship and you do a final year project in 4th year.

If you choose the 5 year integrated masters degree, you do one semester of normal modules and then for semester 2 you do an internship (which can extend past the end of term up until September of the next academic year if you wish) instead of a final year project. Then, you do a dissertation for your 5th year. When you graduate, you get both a bachelors degree and a masters degree separately.

However I have recently found out that we have the option of exiting our course after we finish our internship if you are enrolled in the integrated masters program which mean I don’t have to continue on to do the masters and I don’t have to do a final year project but I still get my bachelors degree.

I made sure that I was talking through my thought process the entire time and explaining what I got stuck at. it just sucks so much, I felt like I was blessed with such a rare opportunity and just completely messed it up. I wanna cry, I feel so hopeless now and don’t know what to do :(

edit: thank you so much to everyone who replied and DMed me. your words mean a lot and I’m going to try my best and keep grinding til I get a good internship next summer!"

Before start, here is some background information about me. I am a senior industrial engineering student in reputable university in my country (Turkey). Before that, I have studied computer engineering for 2 years in different university. I had to change university and study field due to unexpected events.

I am really passionate about software development and that's why I want to pursue my career as a back-end developer. In addition to 2 years of computer engineering education, I am trying to improve myself in data structures and algorithms. I solved most of the easy and medium leetcode problems by myself. And I believe I have a pretty good grasp of the basics of object-oriented programming.  As now, I am looking for long term internship in software development area in Turkey. I have a work permit in EU, as I am a EU citizen, but in my last year in university I have to stay in Turkey.Anyway, all the software I've done so far is purely console application. And that's where the problem starts for me.

As I am not a CS senior, which is quite important in Turkey, I can not find internship or job for back-end developer position. All companies expect me to show a portfolio, even though I have passed their technical exam. I thought the console applications I developed were very simple and not worth to push GitHub as a portfolio. I think I made a mistake here. 

Another problem is I didn't developed a project from start to end. I don't know where to start and don't know how to finish. Don't know how to connect back-end to front-end etc. In short, I know more technical things than things that would work for me in a real project. And at this point I'm not even sure if I know programming.

I need your help and guidance. Thank you for your time."

1. s&amp;t @ bb (likes of goldman sachs/morgan stanley/jp morgan)
2. trading @ hedge fund (likes of marshall wace/capula/man group)

i feel silly if i dont take option 1 due to the prestige, but the competition for a full time offer (and staying in a full time position) seems so brutal that im not sure all the potential for learning and future opportunities make up for it
on the other hand option 2 seems like it would be a more tailored experience as the intern classes are smaller, but it is more specialised in terms of asset class and there would be less opportunity to explore others

compensation for 2 seems much better than 1 (~£5k/month + monthly accommodation grant; ~£4k/month + one time relocation grant), although this isn't what im too worried about as im sure both packages are more than sufficient for living in london for two months

if i were prioritising for career longevity (which might seem silly for a uni student) and also learning, which of these would be a better choice? are there other things i should be prioritising?

i would also appreciate any insight on typical career trajectories (and salary growth) given a starting point in either of these positions

As the title goes, I was looking for some ideas about a timeline in order to eventually land an embedded software engineering (or equivalents) internship in summer 2023.

Sorry if it's not the right place to post this, but I have discovered that embedded careers are not exactly like the standard web SDE roles at tech companies, and at least they don't appear to share a timeline and their career advice won't apply directly. 

As an international student (MS in CompEng) in the US, I had been applying to around 70-80 firmware internship openings in the past 2 months. Up until now only 1 company was kind enough to give me a phone screen, where everything went well until I was told they are looking for someone to be available as soon as possible, and that had led to this post.

1. *Is it considered too ""early"" to apply for next summer's internships in embedded?* Around half of the internship openings I saw had not mentioned a time (e.g. the phone screen mentioned above), whereas the other half clearly states ""Summer 2023"". Will more internship openings be available next year? Or in other words, what would be a reasonable timeline?
2. Apart from titles like ""firmware engineering"" or ""embedded software engineering"", what are some common titles for low-level C and firmware-related job openings posted on LinkedIn/Indeed that I can search for? 
3. While it is highly likely to be my own incompetence, *can I reasonably assume that being an international student introduces a large disadvantage*, especially in embedded where many jobs are in defense/space industries or are export controlled? If so, should I turn to the route of a web SDE before it's too late? (I have no especial love for them, but it's still an option)

Thanks for reading this long-winded post, and any advice will be much appreciated! The anxieties grow by the day, but I think I can cope with it for the moment. ;)"

yy57d9,569,2022-11-17,"Background on the strike, why I'm on strike, and why you should be too",clarity_now2,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yy57d9/background_on_the_strike_why_im_on_strike_and_why/,"Hi folks! I'm Liam, a member of CS 170 course staff.

We are currently in the midst of the largest academic strike in US History – as many of you have likely heard by now, over 48,000 academic workers are currently on strike. As of today, bargaining teams from all four academic bargaining units are attempting to negotiate with the University, and this small window of time will prove to be a crucial moment that must be capitalized on. The contract we decide on will govern us for years to come.

**Why you should strike/picket/support your staff:**

Students:

We are fighting for funding, specifically a more livable compensation for our teachers and a dedicated increase in EECS staffing from the UC. This will lead to a better learning experience for you as students, giving you advantages such as:

\- shorter OH queues

\- more small group tutoring

\- with more staff, you will be able to get into the classes you want to take

In addition to this, the students who are most vulnerable are those who were not privileged enough to receive extra academic preparation beforehand; students with less experience often have a difficult time in computer science, especially here at Berkeley, and it frequently results in them being turned away from it. This manifests itself in the following ways:

\- students are expected to do exceptionally well in our massively sized and difficult lower divs, yet are left to drown, lacking adequate course support

\- if students cannot pass the GPA requirement, they cannot even enroll in CS classes

\- non-majors, e.g. CS-cluster applied math majors, are not allowed to enroll in CS upper-divs period

\- the poor compensation and long hours make the (u)GSI position much less attractive to those who have to pay for school themselves(they could engage in private tutoring instead, or some other job that pays market rate), reducing the diversity in course staff and limiting access to these important jobs(which can be a stepping stone for an academic career) for underrepresented students

It is not hard to see that it is those students who are the least groomed-beforehand for CS (i.e. underprivileged students, the backbone of our diversity) that end up suffering the most; *if the University of California wants to continue to lay claim to its storied diversity, it must deal with the fact that it can only do so by diverting funding to the aspects of the school that actually serve to constitute and nurture this diversity.*

**Background on the strike for EECS:**

EECS has the largest population of academic workers on campus. Teaching quality has suffered. The way we've adapted is by resorting to more ""scalable"" options that aren't very productive for your learning, or for our assessment of your learning. We have created mass auto-graders to check your code instead of having a TA present to help you go line-by-line; the latter is how it should be, especially at the greatest public university in the country. We've resorted to multiple choice and short answer questions, discouraging creativity and stripping away from students the ability to explain why they chose what they chose –  we've increasingly taken away the human aspect of teaching, the aspect of teaching that leaves permanent, endlessly inspirational impressions on students. Personalized feedback and guided assistance is the most effective way to learn. Without this, we might as well all go on coursera to learn from Andrew Ng and search up practice problems on our own and grade them on our own – keep in mind how much you’re paying to be here. Is it so much to ask that courses be adequately staffed, in a non-exploitative manner? Because we cannot afford to hire more TAs, the quality of teaching in our department has really suffered. I’m sure many of you can attest to this.

In addition, lower division courses often have to rely on unpaid labor to adequately support students. Since they don't have enough money to hire more tutors and TAs, they often will rely on Academic Intern labor just to serve the course. I was both an AI and a volunteer for computer science mentors; Computer Science Mentors (CSM), a volunteering club, is also heavily sought after for assistance in the lower divisions. *To put it bluntly, the University of California is relying on unpaid volunteers in order to provide only the most basic academic infrastructure for their students*. It would be hard to call this anything but abhorrent and exploitative, and it has the stark consequence that the more vulnerable students who cannot afford to provide unpaid labor cannot get the experience they need in order to be competitive for a paid position; again, we claim to be committed to diversity here.

**Why I'm on strike:**

This is my 4th time on course staff.

OH queues are ridiculous. For example, the course I'm currently serving has 2-3 people staffing an office hours that regularly draws 30+ students, each of whom is different and deserves their own individualized assistance. This is all that we can afford. The homework in my class is hard, and more likely than not, each person needs a lot more time than the mere 10 minutes we allot to each student to understand the material. But there are more people in the queue, and unfortunately we just have to move on to the next person before adequate assistance can be given.

Here’s some simple math: in each block of one hour, each staff member can talk to 6 students on average. Since we have 2-3 staff, that means 12-18 students get help in an hour. There are 30 students and people are continually coming into OH for help. We simply cannot reach everyone in a timely manner. *I have friends that are discouraged from coming into office hours due to what is regularly a 2-3 hour long queue.*

I was a student in an upper division EECS class last year. I was at office hours once with 20+ students. There was one TA, who was there for one hour. Nonetheless, when that TA left, most of us were left no better off than we were before OH started. There were simply not enough people to staff that OH.

What would we do with more money? Staff OH properly. Hire more tutors for group tutoring! My course (CS 170) is difficult and people would benefit massively from small group tutoring, such that we can go through the algorithms and strategies together, and provide personalized feedback. We could afford to hire more people to read through your code and suggest best practices – who doesn’t want this? We could get rid of the rubrics for design docs that make it hard for you to really learn. We could make exams that actually test your knowledge, in a manner that’s far more equitable and far more thought-provoking than a small fill-in box, or bubble-in circle.

The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring. This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. *This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.*

**There's another, arguably more important side to it:**

GSIs, ASEs, and lecturers are heavily overworked and underpaid. Due to a lack of staff, we often have to take up extra work – we have to choose between our students and our own personal well-being. I've been forced to choose between a break in between my discussion and my office hours after a long day of work, or helping my students. This is tortuous because every single one of us feels a genuine, human obligation to our students. There are so many great things about teaching, and the university expects us to quietly bear the unnecessary hardships (overwork, underpay) just so we can do what we love. We as an academic community deserve to work with dignity – we should not be told to keep our heads down and suck it up. It is a job.

Lecturers often have to cover for the lack of funding and it hurts them immensely, not to mention the fact that it just isn’t fair. For GSIs in particular: GSIs are rent-burdened, overworked, and especially underpaid. They are people like anybody else, and should not have to be living paycheck to paycheck, if they’re even managing that. They deserve a living wage, especially here in the bay where everything is just unthinkably expensive.

**What you as a student can do:**

\- Show support for your staff on Ed. Tell them you support them. Heart their strike posts on Ed, it means a lot

\- Make a post on Ed encouraging TAs who are on strike to keep striking, ans TAs who aren’t on strike yet to start striking

\- Show up to the picket line. Visibility is super important in a strike.

\- [Sign the community support petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/uaw-undergraduate-letter-of-support?source=direct_link&amp;).

\- Tell your friends who are indifferent about the strike why they should support the strike, and engage in proactive dialogues wrt the strike among your acquaintances.

**For those of you that feel that you have a duty to your students:**

Students are currently suffering, have been suffering, and will continue to face the consequences of understaffed courses until something changes. My heart sinks when I hear that my students are discouraged from coming into office hours because of 3-hour queues; I know, we all know that students greatly need more individualized support. Without any change, we will not be able to provide that which we know our students need. They deserve a better education than they are currently being provided, and in my opinion, fulfilling your duty to them means going on strike and picketing until UC can meet our demands. Only then will we be able to serve our students in the manner in which they should be served, as students at the #1 public university in the country.

**GSIs who are still going into work:**

\- You are likely overworked and underpaid.

\- There is little job security. For some PhD students, every semester is a new struggle to find funding, since not every PI has enough GSR funds, and GSI appointments are semester-by-semester

\- The quality of the education here will skyrocket with more funding. We will not have to resort to autograders and multiple choice questions – this means a more fulfilling, and more importantly less soulless, teaching experience.

EECS especially has had to deal with the brunt of the UC's unfair labor practices. Classes are universally understaffed, students cannot enroll in classes that they want or even need to take, lecturers and TAs are heavily overworked, and there is little job security for researchers and academic employees alike.

**Why we need to be out on the picket line:**

*Withholding labor is only half the battle.*

Picketing is so important because it gives us the visibility that is needed to make real change at the university-wide level. This visibility goes very far in showing the University how much power we, as the academic workers at the school, hold. We do a large majority of the work in the EECS department and the University must be made to understand how crucial we are as academic workers to the everyday-functioning of the school. No academic workers means no UC Berkeley. If we just sat at home and did nothing, the university would not care or notice. By making a lot of noise, it is unambiguously shown how many of us there are, and how much we are willing to do to be treated only fairly.

Plus! Picketing is fun! There is music, dancing, food, and all of your friends there along with you. You meet new people from different departments. You connect with others who are each there for their own reason. *These are valuable connections – anybody who’s friends with a grad student knows that it’s a great thing to have.*

**We are making history out there. There have been, there are, and there always will be many who would like to see the University of California made into a docile, lifeless machine – in the words of Mario Savio we must throw our bodies upon the gears, or we risk being enveloped eternally within them. See you on the picket line.**

yy6l4e,19,2022-11-17,The CEIBS Diaries - Another perspective,JustAnotherMBAGrad,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/yy6l4e/the_ceibs_diaries_another_perspective/,"Recent alum here to give my two cents. I'll break this reflection down into categories I felt most strongly about. 1.The candidates/cohort 2. The curriculum 3. The administration and 4. Employment outcomes. 

A little about myself. American went to a T-10 (US News) undergrad.  Undergrad institution is pretty prestigious thus never trouble landing a job in the US or China. Worked in both countries for 6 years. 3 in each country. Won't say what industry because it'll give away my identity. Decided to go to CEIBS because I wanted a long-term career in China, and I had a substantial scholarship.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Cohort

My cohort was somewhat a mixed bag. I'd break it down into 3 major categories. Local Chinese professionals, Chinese entrepreneurs and ""foreigners"". 

The local Chinese professionals consisted of roughly \~30% of the class. These people were generally somewhat accomplished. They were either associates or senior associates in financial services firms/ boutique consulting firms.

The second group are Chinese ""entrepreneurs"". Which is roughly another \~ 30% of the class. This is also where there is largest discrepancy in terms of quality of candidates compared to other groups. A significant portion of this group aren't successful entrepreneurs by any means. They're largely what people in China refer to as (wang hong). We call them influencers. They have no real professional experience and often brought nothing to the table in terms of group projects and discussions. **This truly undermined the overall experience at CEIBS.** 

The third group are ""foreigners"". This group is roughly another 30% of the cohort. However, this group is LARGELY ethically Chinese students holding foreign passports. The group had no shortage of impressive candidates. Their undergraduate institutions are all quite respectable. (Think T-20 in the US, T-7 in the UK, T-3 in Canada etc). The work experience of the group is also quite diverse. There were people coming from FAANG/ Finance/ Consulting/ Executive Search/ NGO. 

2.  The Curriculum 

This is where I find the original author was too critical. 

Courses were taught in English, albeit the English was difficult to understand at times. The core classes are largely the same from other MBA programs. The electives however are very China centric. For people who wanted to learn more about working in China, and how to navigate the intricacies of doing business in China; this is where CEIBS truly wins. The professors are generally well connected to both private and public sectors. 

If you're choosing to attend a China based MBA, I would hope that you were prepared for English lectures with heavy accents. The original author also said he learned nothing, and most electives were quite irrelevant to an MBA. My experiences differ from his as I took away quite a bit from my electives and networking with my professors. I think clear career goals should be identified prior attending an MBA like CEIBS. These goals should have a common denominator: Career/Entrepreneurship in China. It's not like INSEAD/M7/LBS/T-15 or even T-20 where you can figure out your shit during your program. If your goals are China focused, your takeaways will be beyond what any other MBAs can offer. **If your goals don't start with China, you're going to find it quite hard to compete with everyone else with MBAs from outside of China.** 

Regarding the Exchange programs. Wharton/INSEAD/LBS/Stern. Don't expect to get a place for these exchange programs. Highly limited, highly selective (I suspect some form of nepotism eg. If you have a good relationship with the faculty, you'll find it easier to get placed in the exchange). **People will literally do anything to get on the exchange as they want to leverage the branding of the exchange institution on their resumes.**

However, as I mentioned in the previous section. The classroom discussions and projects are hampered by the candidate quality or the lack thereof. 

3. The Administration

Admins are a joke; cohort quality continues to deteriorate, and they continue to accept more and more underqualified candidates. FT ranked CEIBS 16th this year, a drop of 10 places. Yet as a CEIBS alum, I know this is still too high for CEIBS. Despite this, I do think CEIBS is the best MBA option in China and the GC (Greater China) region. I know this will be controversial but IMHO it is comparable to other top Asian MBAs. (think NUS, HKUST) in terms of employment outcomes. 

The pandemic also means the admins have their hands bound as they can't attract high quality candidates from abroad. As the recession hits, I would expect CEIBS to be able to draw more qualified candidates that are seeking shelter from the recession. 

The career services are a joke. Career services will do the bare minimum when helping you land a job. If you don't speak Chinese fluently, the list of options you have are literally 2-3 companies. Which goes back to my previous point. If you don't speak Chinese, and don't have a China focused career mindset, don't attend CEIBS. 

4. Employment Outcomes

If you attend CEIBS you need to manage your expectations. If your goal is MBB or bulge bracket IB, you've come to the wrong place. CEIBS places 1 candidate in McKinsey and 1 candidate into BCG on average every year. I highly suspect that these are also incentivized placements. BCG's China recruiting partner is constantly featured saying they recruit heavily from CEIBS. However, the results speak louder than his claims. The fact is, even in China, MBBs have a strong preference towards schools like INSEAD, HSW, and the other M7s. I have a personal friend who is a current McK China recruiter, according to her/him the last batch of MBA hires came from: 1 from HBS, 2 from INSEAD, and 1 from CBS and 1 from Booth. The CEIBS candidate was offered a summer internship, but never converted. (However CEIBS adds this into their list of full-time employers list).

If you're aiming for Tech (Chinese Tech), Finance (Chinese PE/IB) and Healthcare, CEIBS will likely land you a job. Chinese tech like BAT, Bytedance, Sensetime, Red, Didi etc. They recruit heavily from CEIBS. Healthcare companies like Eli Lily, GE health etc. Granted you speak some Chinese. The employment rate of 95% is great especially during an economic downturn. 

I should point out that the outgoing cohort is only 140 candidates large. I don't think it took tremendous effort for the career services team to place 135 candidates into a role. Given the close working relationship CEIBS has with a lot of Chinese companies. The original CEIBS diaries author is right in the sense that if you lack Chinese proficiency, you'll likely not find gainful employment, and you'll be overlooked by the career services team. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion (TLDR):

CEIBS is for those that want a career in China. It does have its benefits and competitive edge, but those advantages can only be found in the Chinese job market. 

CEIBS does have a major issue with the quality of candidates in its recent cohorts. Many are unqualified and too young. The administration needs to address this asap. 

Curriculum is very China centric (however you should have expected this).  

I personally don't regret going to CEIBS, as the outcomes were in line with my expectations."

Currently deciding between two internship offers and would love some advice.

Company  A is a large fintech company that I interned at last summer.  It is my  only internship. Most people who are not clients/competitors to Company A  would probably not have heard of Company A.

The new offer is from Mastercard.

Company  A's offer has higher compensation and likely the fulltime offer would  be superior to Mastercard. However, I intend to apply for different  fulltime positions anyways after this summer to not just rely on a  return offer.

My question is,  would it be better to take the return internship offer from Company A  for the guaranteed solid fulltime offer or take the internship offer  from Mastercard to get a new company on my resume and apply to more  companies for fulltime. 

And also, would having both companies on my resume be better than two years at Company A?"

I have been getting mixed reactions from people around me on whether school I should commit to. SJSU is definitely incomparable location-wise for a career opportunity but VT seems to have more prestige for its CS program across the nation. I have been coding mostly in JAVA and my plan is to intern in the Summer of 2024 as a backend software engineer on the CPT status, graduate in Spring 2025, and be employed on an OPT status.

I am really focused on getting into the industry right after graduation without considering doing Masters in CS. Thus, I am personally preferring SJSU at the moment for its location and tuition, but I am also open to other thoughts and opinions that could change my mind.

Will I really be more exposed to career opportunities at SJSU despite the prestige title of graduating from VT? Which school out of the two do FAANG and other tech companies actively look for recruitment? Does my international status put me at a disadvantage when it comes to getting an interview? At last, which school would you attend?"

Background: 
I’m currently in the process of making a career shift into CS. I am working as an ME right now (with additional software development responsibilities) and have a year left of school for my second degree (post-bacc degree). I’m also mid 20s if that matters, so I have a long career ahead of me!

The situation:
I just completed the take home coding tests for two separate positions and I think it’s likely that I move on to the final interview for both. In the event that I get an offer from both, I’d like some advice on which would be the better route in your opinion.


**Position 1 (Internship)**:

-Summer 2023 remote software development internship for a medium size fast growth Fintech company.

-Their internship program has been around for about 10 years and sounds like the ideal internship overall and they have a 30% intern to hire rate. 

-All of their engineers/developers work remote permanently.

-Languages they use that I know about: Java, Scala, Rails, JavaScript.

-I don’t know the internship pay but I don’t think that’s too important, however their full time developer pay from what I can find is about $115k.


**Position 2 (Full time dev)**:

-A full time hybrid developer position to start ASAP for a small, very focused ERP development company.

-They use Mendix, which is a low-code software, for the vast majority of their development and have been for the past (4?) years. However, they expand the functionality where needed with Java and JavaScript I believe.

-Salary range from what I can find would be somewhere around 90k in the Portland area.



Based on what I know so far, I think the internship at Company 1 would be the better choice career wise, but from the way it sounds if I do get on offer from Company 2 it will be before Company 1 and I might be faced with a tough decision if I can’t delay my decision before I hear the final word about the internship at company 1.

I’d really appreciate your guy’s thoughts and opinions to help set me self up for success early on in my new career. Thank you in advance!"

I'm wondering if there's some kind of full time job, even if it's very low paying, that would hire someone with a CS degree and some web dev experience. Climbing the ladder into an actual web dev job from there, would be a lot easier on me mentally and financially, than putting all my effort on spending all day everyday working on full stack projects, grinding leetcode, and applying to grad roles for the next year."

I grew up with strict parents who essentially made even the idea of dating someone seem impossible. Only started to get a little freedom when I got my drivers license and started commuting to university on my own. Point is that dating was something I ruled out as ""too much of a pain to hide"" and essentially gave up trying until I was about 21. For the last two years I started opening up to the idea of dating, even if it meant hiding it from my parents for the sake of not needing to explain my every action to them (yes they are overbearing but an issue for another post).  But even accepting the idea that I want to date some seems so hard -- honestly it terrifies me. I have noticed a cycle in myself. I meet someone I like and we start talking. Initially, I am excited in the early talking phase. I like texting/snapping (etc) with that person and often find myself looking for thier messages. BUT the second the person mentions the idea of actually planning a date everything changes. I freak out and even seeing thier messages makes me sick to my stomach. The first few times this happened I just thought -- maybe I actually didn't like them and just enjoyed the attention and felt like I was a pretty shitty person for leading someone on. In the end I would slowly distance myself from that person until we stopped talking. This has happened multiples times and now I am starting to think I genuinely can't hold on to feeling at all. I can't even remember the last time I had an ""real crush"". The second I start to think I might like someone its like my brain does everything I can to convince myself otherwise to the point where I just find them annoying and exhausting to talk to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Flashforward to now -- this is the reason I am posting: I met someone and we really hit it of. We started texting etc... more and more to the point where we talked almost all day and late into the night. I was really excited. But I also started noticing some old habits. Every time they complimented me it made me cringe. They eventually asked me out and I panicked. I didn't want to say no because I honestly thought this might finally be someone I actually like! I said yes, but that I could only go out towards the end of the month because I am travelling for an internship (which is true). After that things where ok -- I was a little nervous but honestly thought it was because I had never actually gone on a date before. Finally I thought the cycle was broken, but I was wrong. I had an important meeting/presentation coming up and had mentioned in text I was stressed for it. In response they sent me a gift card for coffee (35$) to help relax. And in that moment I almost felt like a fight or flight response was triggered. It freaked me out so much -- and they then mentioned how they already ordered me a gift for our first date. It was like in the span of 5 mins I went from anticipating thier texts to dreading them. I just said thank you and went to bed because I couldn't handle what was happening. Now every time I get a message from them its like a pit drops in my stomach. It now feels like a task or an annoyance to message back. I feel terrible -- because I thought I really like them and they clearly like me. Normally, I would just slowly distance myself of send a text that ""I just don't think I'm ready for a relationship right now"" but after the gifts I feel like my ""escape plan"" is gone -- like I now need to go out with them.

I don't know what to do. Every time I even think of a date it makes me upset to my stomach and so anxious and frustrated. Why do I feel this way? How did everything change in a matter of minute? I know I'm the problem here and I genuinely don't want to hurt the other person in this scenario. Please anyone -- what's wrong with me?"

Hi all, I was just about to start my first post grad job as a data scientist in faang but was rescinded due to the layoffs. It’s been a depressing and confusing week trying to figure out my next steps. Here’s some context:

1. I studied statistics and data science in college and loved it, fell down the DS path but very much a product person. Had internships in both data science and product and loved the intersection of fields
2. Got a product driven data science job for post grad (really just a glorified product analyst role but the pay was great) and that’s gone now
3. With the economy down, the only roles being hired for are SWE and now I’m thinking about just switching 

I have experience in computer science but it’s been a while since my last algos class and the SWE route always scared me in college because I thought I was never smart enough. I started learning more about front end and actually really love the creative side to it. It seems like I’ll have more job security in SWE long term and that there aren’t really a lot of product analyst roles open outside the big tech realm. It also seems like there’s more career growth options for SWE whereas for data science there’s not a lot of career growth unless I go to MLE which I know I don’t wanna do (I’ve learned it and didn’t enjoy it). 

This is my potential plan
1. Get the best of any job I can get right now within the next 3 months
2. Continue to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and build a portfolio of projects
4. Learn React
4. Get better as data structures and algorithms
5. Start applying for entry level swe roles fall of next year


My questions are 
1. for those self taught SWEs how did you do it? I’m basically starting from scratch, don’t want to do a boot camp or go back to school. 
2. I know I’m only 22 but I already feel like I’m falling behind my peers who have kept their big fancy tech jobs and making bank. I know in the long run, this may end up being a blessing in disguise if I make a career move I enjoy but can’t help to feel like it’s a setback - any advice?"

Reasons to choose C1: high return offer rate (important to me given the economic uncertainty in the next year), bigger intern cohort / well-run internship program, good work-life balance, intern housing included. I'm also a bit concerned about Robinhood's recent layoffs and general instability over the past year.

Reasons to choose Robinhood: higher new-grad compensation ($200k vs $120k), might stand out more on resume, interesting projects, flexibility to be remote most days of the week

tbh, i could care less about what jobs my friends had (so many classmates are going to insane firms), but that's not causing me my negative emotions - i'm so angry and disappointed because i am not getting better. i am always missing a little bit, and despite what i do - day by day i'm at the same skill level. i try to put my anger into my studies, and there are days where i sit in the library for 17 hours with packed lunch/dinner trying to grind harder and harder. i don't think i will burn out because im so desparate for improvement - i just keep imagining what it feels like to have a future and that is the biggest motivator of them all, but it is not enough

if anyone has ever plateaued in life so hard, please share how you climbed out. i'm looking to any advice to get unstuck and make progress"

I graduated in May of last year and am working on a contract that expires at the end of December at a no-name company. I worked 2 summer internships here and worked part time during the school year, but that experience doesn't seem to be helping me much right now (C#, .NET). I have always aspired to work in the games industry and tailored my degree towards that, but my University's lack of classes/projects using C++ hasn't helped my case. I have game-related projects, but they mostly utilize C# and Unity, rather than C++ and Unreal. Currently been working on expanding my portfolio with some smaller C++/Unreal projects and a larger C#/Unity project.

I've lost track of my applications sent, and I've tried to cast a broad net, but have focused especially on games. I've had little to no success, outside of interviewing with a Montreal game studio for a Winter 2023 internship that was open to both students and new grads. I made it to the final round but ultimately I was not selected. After speaking with the hiring team, I was told they really liked me and that I would be contacted for their Summer 2023 round in January and fast-tracked through the interview process. 

I am currently living at home (no software prospects where I live) and am considering a YOLO move to Montreal to pursue a career in games. Maybe find a position in testing or QA while I focus on projects and application. I have friends that live there, but I'm terrified of the financial uncertainty and there's no guarantee if/when I'd find a job. Would this move be worth it, or is it insane? How much does being a local candidate help? Is hoping to hear back for the Summer 2023 internship unlikely? 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated :-)"

pros/cons for Google: returning intern, and since I interned last year too I can convert to a full-time offer without further interviews. strong company, good benefits, good wlb, likely bay area project match. Definitely the more stable choice and basically guarantees a good new grad offer since return offer rate is high. Overall, I had a good experience at Google last summer, but in some ways it didn't feel super fulfilling / I wish my work/project was more impactful. I did learn a decent amount but I was hoping to grow more as a software engineer.

pros/cons for Stripe: new experience, high hiring bar, midsize company/unicorn (want to try smaller company), really liked all the interviewers I had, interesting work and high impact projects. My offer letter is for Seattle though (they ran out of SF spots), and I really don't want to be in Seattle, so I'm trying to negotiate a location change. Also, I'm afraid Stripe isn't doing so well in the recession with the layoffs. Also have heard things such as low return offer rate, rescinding return offers, bad culture and wlb, so it seems like Stripe is definitely the more risky choice.

I want to consider both companies in terms of internship and new grad/future career trajectory. Would really appreciate people's opinions on this! Thanks for your input!"
yyeubj,5,2022-11-18,"I change my interests often, should I go for a Manager role for flexibility or should I focus on one field?",potatosweetlypieoats,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yyeubj/i_change_my_interests_often_should_i_go_for_a/,"I am really living the phrase ""Jack of All Trades, but Master of None"". I can do a lot of things but I am not a master in any of them. I really like exploring many different fields, I want to try a lot of different things. From writing to music to development, and everything. However, every time I apply for a job, I always fail at them. I would be lying if I say I didn't lose any of my confidence. 

Currently, I'm a computer science student. I have dabbled in Web Development, UI/UX, Data Analysis/Science, Game Development, and Mobile Development. My ""internship""-- in quotes because all it was is just working on my failed startups with colleagues-- roles have been all about being a Manager (e.g. Frontend Manager, Product Manager). Meanwhile, I also do art. I draw illustrations, do graphic design, and other. I feel comfortable enough to say that I'm good at them all but not good enough compared to my peers who only focus on one thing in their life. 

The reason why I am thinking to chase the Manager role (e.g. Product Manager) is that with these experiences I feel that I can understand the ""language"" of the Dev Team and/or Design Team for example. I don't really care about the ""domain"" where I will be working in (e.g. game, finance, e-commerce, social media, etc.) because I feel like the Managerial role can fit into anything.

Or should I just try to focus on doing one thing/field? For example, focusing on UI/UX because my thesis is about UX in XR. I honestly don't know what do to and I get discouraged every time when I try to apply for jobs or even open LinkedIn due to my peers already having good jobs and even earning a lot of money. I really do feel like I am falling behind.

If you ask me ""between all of these what do you like to do?"", I honestly wouldn't know for sure. I feel that I keep on lying to myself about what I really do enjoy and like about these roles. 

Any advice on what should I do?"

No, she is not a bad mother but doesn't know when to stop treating me like I was 6. Whenever I groom myself with hair, she will always take over from me cause I was bad at it or whatever. I try to tell her that I am 21 now but she still insists on it.   


Currently, my mother is super worried and does not allow me to go on a research field trip done by my university. Are afraid of me getting human trafficked into Cambodia, well I can understand this since I live in SEA and there is a rise of human trafficking that especially targets Mandarin speakers. I literally said that was she wanted me to not independent forever. She just cried and say it just worrying. Well, I ask again the other day calmly, and she just keeps asking why I have to go without giving me an answer about whether I can go or not until now. She probably needs some time to think.  


I have never drive for a long time ever since COVID came and the lockdown also I got a fender bender when I was driving alone that time and my mom keeps reminding me of that for a few days until I got pissed, yeah I have a huge ego here. Then things break apart and we got into quarrels, that was a long time ago but this was the incident that make me constantly plan of leaving the house.  


I can't say much, I am still a college student living rent-free at my parents' house and chore-free too, well my mother wants stuff to be done perfectly so I only do my own chore when my parents are not around. I was always told by relatives or neighbours when I was young that I am a super momma boi, at least they don't now. I always strived to be independent and Idk a lot of shit like I don't know how to trim my fingernail until I was 15 cause my mom does that but I took the initiative since then I consciously try to do stuff by myself. The only thing that felt like an adult is when I was doing my college assignment or whatever on the internet cause my mother has no control over it.   


I don't want to see my mother as an evil mom like many advice subreddit. She does allow me to hang out with friends until late at night with no issue, she does not control my dream or career-wise stuff as long as it is legal that is lol. Heck, she's the one who forced me to talk with customer service stuff on the phone when I was 14, so now I don't afraid to ask things from people.  


Well, so my question is **what can I do for now?** I will have my first-ever internship and last semester at my college in next year. Should I choose a far location so I can have excuses to rent a room for a job? Or should I wait until I got a full-time job then I rent it? Should I just stay at my parents' home but try to forcibly do chores? Should I find a friend who I can rent together with so my mother will be more peace of mind and more likely she will accept it? I don't want to leave on bad terms or like a huge quarrel drama, I think it is immature to do that. I don't want to vaporize randomly from my house and go no contact with my parents, that's just seen like a huge asshole moment. I need advice on step by step, like starting from intern or job and then slowly moving out naturally but I don't know how to start or whether this is the correct step.  


TLDR: Mom is overprotective of me and I want to be independent but slowly and naturally, not drastically or dramatically leave the house. I want to know if should I start renting during intern or full-time job. Should I get a friend on board on renting or should I start to forcibly do house chores even though my mother doesn't like unperfect chores which possibly could lead to an unnecessary quarrel?  


I feel like this is the right sub to ask since most other subs are more westernised and generally told you to not gaf to parents since you are an adult."

so i (21f) have always wanted to be a model, fashion designer, stuff like that. when i was younger around 13-14 i got put in modeling but it wasn’t for long. not enough time to work on any skill but just learning and a few classes. i believe i got taken out because my grades were slipping at the time but even when they were fixed i never went back.

now i started modeling again. i’ve walked in a couple fashion shows and i intern for an amazing designer who’s opened so many doors for me i thought were closed forever. i’ve done photoshoots, worked backstage at fashion shows, even did a radio interview!! recently i just got published in a magazine for the first time. and that’s when i realized that maybe they didn’t believe in me.

for some back story i guess, my mom and i always had a rocky relationship. i was a very emotional child and my mom didn’t know how to handle it i guess. she actually straight up told me she couldn’t give me the emotional support that i needed. so i learned not to come to her with emotional stuff even before because usually she wasn’t the most helpful. even when i’m excited she never shares the same excitement or even tries to fake it.

and my parents knew about me wanting to do this. but they spent more time trying to convince me to join the military or go to school for something i didn’t want to do. they said i had a small chance of actually making money, etc. honestly we’ve had this conversation so many times but i never listened to my parents telling me to basically find something better to do with my life. 

but i’m in a magazine! so of course i’m gonna call my mom. i call her and tell her, i’m beaming, smiling ear to ear, i probably screamed on the phone too. all i got was a “that’s cool.” and not a “my daughter’s in a magazine, that’s soo cool!” but rather a “oh, you actually got in a magazine, that’s cool.” i’m not expecting her to jump over the moon with me but imagine my disappointment when i told her that and it sounded like i told her i found a dollar on the ground. 


when i told my grandma she didn’t even try to sound excited. she actually consistently tells me why i intern and work for free and doesn’t understand my answer “experience.” when i told her she asked if i got paid, and i said no. she then proceeded to go on a little tangent about why none of this makes sense and i should go off and do something better to make money. literally could care less that doing what i just did is my dream. 

now i would like to say my parents and grandparents are very financially supportive. but when it came to the emotional stuff, or basically anything else besides money i feel like they could care less. i got the same reaction when i my first photoshoot, and my first fashion show. it’s gotten to the point where i actually would call them last whenever i got exciting news. 

i don’t wanna include my dad in this soo much. he’s actually a very calm laid back person so he’s definitely not the type to scream and jump with me. but he told me i looked great and immediately asked how much it was so he could buy one and put it up. when i told my dad it was $20 he said okay and asked me to send him the link. when i told my mom she “jokingly” said $20 is too much. i don’t think it’s a joke though because she keeps “joking” for somebody else to get it for her. 

it’s always been like this though. i just always wonder where i’d be if they spent a fraction of the time ACTUALLY supporting my dream and not trying to convince me i’ll fail before i start."

I have a problem, any advice would be great, it's not life or death, but its really weighing on my mind and guilt. 

So I'm 23 (f), I am living in Maine at my parents future retirement farm house while finishing college, working, and setting up the farm. My family is in NJ and still floundering on moving up, they keep pushing the date back. I have 6 of my mom's 20 chickens, a Kenyan sand boa, one of my mom's 18 love birds, and 2 goats. I have a job at a small business (retail) that asked me two months ago if I need time off for Thanksgiving if I need to go home. My mom assured me thanksgiving dinner would be in Maine so I could work the two days I'm scheduled that week.  So I went with her word and scheduled the shifts, I'm not working again till the next Monday after the holiday since my birthday is that weekend. 

This week I got a call that my family couldn't really make it up for Thanksgiving. I was wasn't shocked, but I was hurt and so very upset. They hadn't sent up their furniture or things or hadn't found a contractor to fix the various problems with the old farm house or barn. they've only asked me to work on fixing things for the horse and chickens. I've been digging post wholes and hanging hundreds of yards of fencing for a horse and working on the improvements mom wants for the chickens new coop. My mom wants me to just drive home for a few days and have my boyfriend take care of the house and animals while I'm gone or ask one of my friends to do it. 

Problem is, my boyfriend has no car right now since it's in the shop. He won't do it unless I'm here incase of an emergency with the animals or if more supplies is needed. Most of my friends live in different states right now, which leaves my friends from the railroad I volunteer at, but at this point I doubt anyone is even free to stop by twice a day for 3 or 4 days over a holiday. Then there's work. I can go, but it's going to be a mark on my work history for abandoning shifts that I agreed to months in advance. My mom hasn't worked in over 30ish years or more, so I don't know if she understands what I'm telling her, she thinks I can just go and once I explain the problem they'll agree. 

I can't abandon work and I don't know if I can find anyone to take care of my animals. Is it even worth driving down 9-12 hours the day before Thanksgiving to stay 2 days and drvlive up on my birthday? 

My partner thinks I should stay in Maine this one time and have Thanksgiving with his family. My friends agree for the most part and think my mom made her bed and she can lay in it. But is still feel guilty. My brothers and dad will miss me, ones in Florida for college and this will be the first I've seen him in months, I miss them so much. 

I'm also scared of what my mom will do in response, she is not known for being calm when things don't go her way. She may do something rash to see me, she's already mad that I'm looking at internships in other states or countries other than Maine. We have more fights than anything now, my partner thinks it's going to end in tears for me if I do go. He's not a fan of my mom for things she's said or done. 

In all honesty, I'd rather stay to care for my animals, fix more fencing for the horse, and work my job. I won't be alone for this Thanksgiving, but it'll be my first without my family. I feel so guilty and I don't know what to do. I'm scare they'll be upset with me too, like what if my mom never lets this go? Or what if she thinks this is further evidence that I'm ""abandoning her"".  I tried offering to zoom call them or Skype or discord chat during Thanksgiving dinner so I could talk to them all, but it's not a good enough option for mom. My youngest brother understands, but is still sad, he's asking me to stop by his college today at 4 or 5 to give me my birthday present early. 

What do you all think? I am I wrong to stay? Should I dig deep to find a pet sitter or friend to watch my animals? I could be over reacting in this IDK. Thank you for any advice given"

1. Finance operations analyst at a start up. The pay is the highest of the 3 but it is a very small company. Less than 100 people. Not sure of the exit opps in the future and if it will do much for my resume. But I also have a lot of student loan debt so that extra money sounds nice…

2. Market surveillance analyst for a very well known firm. Similar to Bloomberg. Pay is less than what the start up is offering.

3. Associate analyst at one of the big 3 credit agencies. Pay is the lowest of the 3 offers I received. 

Which is a better career path/ has better exit opps? I don’t really mind working in any of the 3 since I’m interested in all of them. 

Also not sure if I can negotiate my offers, since I don’t have any relevant experience."

yyrpmj,1,2022-11-18,Unpaid Internship - Is it worth it in my specific case?,Stuckatwork271,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyrpmj/unpaid_internship_is_it_worth_it_in_my_specific/,"Hello folks!   


Now I know what you're thinking if you opened this post. ""Your work is valuable, and you should never do it for free"" and I hear you! I even agree with you. I'd ask that you read through my post first before rushing to the comments.   


Heres the situation (I'll try and keep this entire post short and to the point): 

* I am a 7 (almost 8) year IT Server Admin for the Navy.   

* I got my A.A.S. in IT (Software Development and Programming)  

* I really want to pivot into a Software Dev / Programming role when I separate next year, and I'm worried I don't have the adequate experience. Most roles want a B.S. or 4+ years programming work experience

I have started throwing together a small portfolio of things I did in college. (Website I made for class, Apps I've made both in school and as my own little pet projects.) I even got accepted to attend a ""bootcamp"" of sorts through a tech company next year when I get out (If you're familiar with SkillBridge for military. It's that)  


When looking for jobs, so many of them want experience, and proof that I can do this. I want to maximize my time between now and when I get out, but the Military is fussy about working a second job without approval.   


My question is a two parter:   


1. Would it be worth it to try and find an unpaid internship for like.... I dunno 10 hours a week? 
2. Is it possible to find such an internship in the evening time, being remote?"

Now I have only two options for myself. Either I can go for B.Ed or for an MBA.

I am not sure about UGC NET because my interests do not lie in research as of yet.

Coming to MBA I am not particularly very good when it comes to quantitative aptitude, however I believe I could push through it. Last year I gave the MAT exam and all my marks as far as I remember were around 90 except quants which was in the higher 50s.

I have been thinking about B.Ed but everything on social media has been looking very demotivating because it seems that Teachers are not very well paid.

What if I go ahead and do an MBA ? I know I would not get a Top 20 B School but what about B School options in Top 35-80 ?

I really do not want to keep racking up degrees one after the other. I just want to get settled with a good job now. I am not afraid of doing hard work. I just want to know what would be better for me and more worth my time.

Also I did not do any internships because of covid. The work from home one's I tried from a popular intern website (you know which one), I mostly got shady scams asked me to pay to get experience and all which I did not do. The only skill I learnt during covid was linux, virtual machines and video editing in Premiere, Resolve, etc.

I am comfortable with learning new things. I just want to know what would be better for me from my two options. Kindly give your 2 cents. Thank you.

For a little bit of background, I’m currently a junior in college and I’m planning on applying for some T10 deferred MBA programs next year. Right now, I’m pursuing two majors (business administration and public policy), and one minor for fun (Indigenous studies). I plan to pursue consulting following graduation.

I’m currently facing a dilemma, though. I’m interested in studying abroad my senior year fall semester (most likely would be doing an international internship in London or taking business classes in Madrid), but unfortunately, I would not be able to finish one of my two majors if I choose that path.

My two options are:
1. Study abroad and graduate with one major (business admin) + two minors (public policy and Indigenous studies)
2. Don’t study abroad and graduate with two majors (business admin and public policy) + one minor (Indigenous studies)

I’m honestly not sure which scenario would look better on graduate school applications. I know there’s no “right” answer, but I’d appreciate any advice! I’m a first gen college student and this whole process is very new to me :)

Thank you!"
yyu55p,21,2022-11-18,Is my internship supposed to be this bad,lechevalquirit,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/yyu55p/is_my_internship_supposed_to_be_this_bad/,"I don’t know if this is the standard experience for internships or not.

Since the start of my internship, my boss has been stressing how important my work is and how I need to deliver results fast and well. That made sense, since I work at a big company and results are important.

However, I clearly haven’t been living up to his expectations of me. What started with comparing my struggles to the successes of his last intern (from 4 years ago) has now become constant reminders of how I’ve made no progress (despite me working tirelessly for 6 months on this project), how my work is useless, and how disappointed he is in me. 

He doesn’t treat anyone else like this - though I’m his only intern and everyone else is his equal, he is a completely different person with others. I’ve had to go into the bathroom to cry somewhere quietly without getting weird looks, and I honestly don’t even know what to do anymore. 

I see my friends at other companies getting to have coworkers their age, getting lunch together, and having positive experiences and even time off and I wonder if I’m the problem.

Did I just get massively unlucky, or do you guys think that there may be something wrong with me as an employee?"

Hi yall,

I'm the cofounder of a marketplace startup operating in Latin America with 75k MAUs (growing 50% MoM) and I'm looking for an unpaid marketing intern for the rest of the year and into next semester. I used to work at a L/S Equity hedge fund and went to UC Berkeley, and my cofounder is a successful multiple time startup founder. The role is remote

You'll be working on our SEO efforts and also social media efforts, mainly twitter.

Our ideal candidate:
Spanish fluency is a must
Basic understanding of how Google SEO works is a plus but not required
Preferably a freshman/sophomore who is just eager to work and learn and get their foot in the door.

Time commitment: 10-15 hours a week (job can be done in 10 hours/week, max). You can end it on your own terms if you give us 2 weeks notice and we can have you on til late next year.

If you're great, possibility of it turning into a paid summer internship.

Why this is a good gig despite being unpaid:

Lots of responsibility - I have a process already in place that i will hand off to you and is not hard to follow - from there it's up to you to optimize and make it your own beast - plenty of room to grow here, and can look killer on your resume.

Lots of growth - because of the way our marketplace works, it's extraordinarily easy to drive growth. If we work together well, I would like to hand off as much responsibility to you as possible, so you can claim responsibility for our growth. I think it won't be unreasonable for us to grow 2x within a couple of months, and even more afterwards (and you can claim responsibility for that). I'll work with you to craft something good so when you leave it'll look like you're a killer. 

This is the perfect opportunity for a freshman looking to get something that looks great on their resume with low hours, can look absolutely fantastic with a bit of extra hustle. 

I'm looking forward to meeting you guys - just dm me here and we'll set up a call!"

I’m currently a 3rd year CpE student, and nag pplan ako lumipat ng Canada to study. Medyo torn ako kasi mag sisimula ulit ako sa umpisa if mag aaral ako on Canada pero mas maganda naman yung quality ng education and mataas ang chance ko mag intern sa big companies.

I took the sat 4 times and still could not perform well. My parents tell me I’m a failure even though I tried. I let them down and it’s eating away at me. My sat score is a 1250 while my gpa unweighted is a 3.6. I took 10 ap classes and I think my essays and ecs are decent. I’m applying as a computer science major. My biggest thing is that I did a paid tech internship at Citi from my sophomore year to senior year of highschool. I’m applying to a lot of schools but I was wondering what you think my chances are of of getting into 
UT Dallas
Indiana University
Texas A&amp;M
University of Maryland
Penn State 
Purdue university
University of Connecticut 
University of Oklahoma
Rutgers
Virgins tech

I’m having severe panic attacks because my family does not believe I can amount to anything. I’m feeling super discouraged so I need some advice."

I'm a current CoE freshman who was lucky enough to get a summer internship here in AA. When should I start looking for summer sublets? I've started looking at the off campus housing website, but prices still seem high (like the lowest is $750-$800). Should I put off searching until next semester or try to secure a place at these prices?"

yz3g2d,4,2022-11-18,"Where I'm at , junior SWE looking for help",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yz3g2d/where_im_at_junior_swe_looking_for_help/,"2 years ago right after I graduated college in computer science I got an offer from Revature. Then it got rescinded because I have a misdemeanor for marijuana from 2014. Now its been 8 years since the misdemeanor and I thought it wouldn't show up after 7 years.  I have a little bit more experience as a full stack swe in tech since then but I don't really like interviewing and I have been slacking off all summer (smoking too much weed but I quit a week ago so my work ethic is improving).  Frustrated with the interview process at companies, I applied to revature again just so I could have steady employment and an easy interview and I got another offer from them. Apparently after doing some research I think the misdemeanor might still show up since there are only a few states that are 7 year bgc states for convictions and my charge is not in one of them.  My start date is in a little more than a week and then contract is binding a few days after December.  


I feel like I am going backwards since my previous job was 88k (although I was only there for 3 months) and this is minimum wage for 3 months followed by a year of 45k. I have not worked in tech since March but I still do personal projects occasionally. I am wondering if there are other companies that will hire mediocre devs such as myself who don't care about a marijuana misdemeanor from 8 years ago? For context I have approx a year of experience in full stack ( 2 years if you count internships and about 2.5 years if you count undergrad research). The biggest thing I am looking for is steady employment ( I have been fired due to poor performance twice I am honestly not that good since I'm a junior but I always try my best). After that I would like to work with people that are nice (those two places had a back-stabby office politics culture ). I have autism so I am not good at reading in-between the lines if the place will have a good work culture and I tend to get bullied once I show weakness. The third thing I am looking for is a chill work culture (I really don't want to work more than 40 hours , I'm not trying to be the worlds richest man or anything lol). One thing I learned to look for is the interviewers attitude when they interview me (but again I am not good at this because of aspergers but I learned that sighing may be a bad thing but laughing and smiling is good).   


I would also like to note that I have ADHD and in my past places of employment where I was fired I was unmedicated. I finally found a doctor who is willing to prescribe me the medication I need so I think my work performance will be a lot better.  


If anyone has any  tips or recommendations or a good place for me to apply I would appreciate it. I understand the field is super competitive but I feel like there is a place for me out there somewhere I just don't know where to look. I got to the final round at a few places this summer but didn't pass . My work experience has been in the financial industry if that matters.  I might just start spamming my resume again. I also could use emotional support and structure so I am considering programs like outco or pathrise or something.  


Thanks for reading my post , please don't be mean to me lol"

yz47go,4,2022-11-19,Future of Tech?,Saen_OG,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/yz47go/future_of_tech/," Currently in third year studying Computer Engineering hoping to peruse a career in SWE. With all the talks about the recession, culture resets, and yes state of Twitter I am getting pretty worried. Seems like saturation is at its highest levels I think for SWE. Is this the start where tech/swe starts to dwindle? Does anyone have any tips on how to focus on a niche or choosing one perhaps to help with the odds and maybe stand out? I am starting to even consider a post-secondary program because of this, but I am unsure how worth that is. I am currently in a co-op program where I have to do 6 terms=2 years of internship experience to graduate, which can help but the jobs I have only gotten so far were pretty general full-stack ones, nothing that can help me stand out super out of the crowd.

I am pretty passionate about SWE, and yes of course money is also an incentive. I am mainly interested in distributed systems and would love to pursue that. The whole web3 blockchain space interests me as well, specifically in the distributed systems aspect. But of course I cannot tell if this is just a fad and will last.

But yeah honestly not sure if I am just overreacting, I got another 2 years to graduate and stressing out for no reason. Any advice, input and reality checks are greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm an international prospective student thinking of applying for a Masters in CS in the US &amp; Canada. Looking at the macro economic conditions like Tech layoffs, likely _mild_ recession, the Ukraine conflict, I'm confused as to whether to apply or not.

I'm done with all my exams (GRE/IELTS), documents and everything. I just have to submit my applications and I think I'm getting cold feet.

So, my questions are:

1. What are the intern opportunities in Summer of 24 and beyond? 

2. What would be the state of hiring by 2024-25?

3. Is it worth it to let go of my current SWE job in my home country for pursuing this?

The other option I have is to wait an year out and apply for Fall 2024.

My ultimate goal would be to do as many internships as possible (helping me to understand various fields within tech itself) during my masters and land a good role for FTE."

I just have been extended a job offer for an Entry Data Analyst position for BoA Global Payments and am pretty excited for this opportunity. I have to make a follow up call to HR about compensation but what is a good ballpark to what I should expect or negotiate based on my experience.

I have a weird career path:

* Bachelors in Biology
* Masters in Data Analytics
* Summer Data Analytic Intern for a Major Manufacturing Company.

Reposted from 8 years ago with moderator permission.

While  in college, pursuing a degree in Information Systems, I got a job at  now defunct Western Pacific airlines. It was basically a paid internship  to do all sorts of computer related stuff. They were a small airline  based in Colorado Springs, CO, and then later in Denver. They attempted  to take over Frontier airlines and went bankrupt in 1998.

One  day before I left work, my boss gives me several long Ethernet cables  and tells me ""Go patch in the new modems into the computer network."" He  liked to test me in ways like this from time to time. So I head down to  the data room.

Now, I think it is  important that you know that I had only been in a real data room twice  before, and I had never worked in one. The boss knew this, and wanted to  see if I could figure it out on my own or not. For those that don't  know, data rooms have raised floors so you can run cables under the  floor tiles, lots and lots of racks of computer equipment, tons of AC to  keep it all cool, etc.

Anyway, I  walk in, find the modem bank, find several modems that have no cables  attached. I look at the ones that are wired in, follow the cables,  figure out what switch they are plugged into, and wire up the new modems  just like those. Power them up and see them connect to the switch on  the local network. Then I replace the floor tiles I pulled up and head  home for the day.

The next day I  come in to work after class is out and my badge doesn't work. The guard  tells me to wait. A minute later my boss and two security guards show up  and escort me to the CEO's office. No one will talk to me and I'm  freaking out. Inside the office, besides the CEO, are the CIO, CFO, my  boss and the two bosses above him. They start questioning me.

What  did I do yesterday at the end of the day? Did I get the modems working?  Did I remove floor tiles? Did I notice anything out of the ordinary?  Long story short, I had somehow kicked loose the power cable for the  main pyramid server that ran the entire airline. They had no redundancy  built into the network for that server. So for 45 minutes, WestPac could  do nothing. They couldn't sell tickets, make reservations, board  planes, take off, etc. Nothing. I inconvenienced thousands of people. I  was told I cost the airline somewhere around $200,000. I don't know if  that is accurate or not. Eventually someone noticed that the server had  no power and plugged it back in. The airline was back up and running a  few minutes later.

I didn't lose  my job over that. They all had a good laugh, and admonished me to be  more careful in the future. I suggested that they find a way to lock the  cable down, but they rejected that idea. Maybe that kind of thinking is  what led them to bankruptcy. I wasn't there at the end.

TL;DR: Disconnected a server by accident, the entire company went offline for 45 minutes."

I received a C$14,000 scholarship from Alberta and a C$5,000 scholarship from Calgary, thanks to my percentage which was north of the mid 90s, and after these scholarships, both the universities cost the same. Before someone runs up to me and suggests that I apply to Waterloo with a high percentage, you should keep in mind that it costs an arm and a leg to study at Waterloo(around 100k with living expenses), and the other two universities for CS (UoT and UBC) take a lot of money and don’t guarantee you a spot in your chosen major.  

However, in Edmonton and Calgary I can do the CS degree at a comparatively more affordable price, hovering at around $40k a year with living expenses. I’ve been wondering about the better option between these two universities and cities, in general, as Calgary in my opinion seems to be the better city, with more businesses around, proximity to some rather lovely spots in the Rockies, and quite a lot of folks of my color around to help with the homesickness, but UAlberta seems to be the better university, with its sheer size and history as the premier university in Alberta, and a somewhat better Science Internship Program (UAlberta allows 4 month coops, UCalgary doesn’t), and in general, a reputation for having a better CS program academically (although I’m not too sure on this).  

Would you please shed some light on which one of these I should choose for my undergraduate CS degree, and whether the points I’m mentioning are really that important, because its quite difficult gauging the ground reality about these universities and cities from a million miles away. Keep in mind, that I don’t really have any plans on following up my undergraduate degree with a masters, and would wish to work in the industry during my penultimate year with the SIP, and a rather well paying job after graduation."
yzi5os,47,2022-11-19,I used my connections to help a friend and I love that I could do that,kangarooler,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/yzi5os/i_used_my_connections_to_help_a_friend_and_i_love/,"During my final semester, I was able to land an internship with a small, private company in my city. The only reason I landed an interview with them was because my mom’s boss’s brother-in-law is one of the owners of this firm. She told him about me, and he said he would gladly see my resume. I followed up and emailed him, thanking him for it of course.

For context: I had been interviewing around for months and ghosted by other firms. You know, the usual.

I had been a ball of anxiety as graduation creeped closer; I had no real skills or internship experience (thanks to the pandemic and also focusing on doing my best academically as a student with ADHD.)

Obviously, I aced the interview and was offered an internship. It’s been the best environment and group I could ever ask to work for and learn from, and they took me in knowing full well I had zero CAD knowledge! I was also their first intern since the pandemic.

After graduating, they offered me a full-time position (which I am currently in!) and I feel valued. My department engineering manager also went to my same university and understood that this university unfortunately lacked in providing us valuable skill sets for the career. 

That being said, he takes every opportunity he can to teach me the real-life application of engineering concepts and I can safely say I’ve learned and understood more working under his guidance in ONE DAY than I ever did during a single semester.

Well, I graduated a semester before this friend of mine. He’s currently in capstone, in his last semester. He was my first friend at our university after I transferred there from community college, and is the only friend from school I have successfully kept in contact with after graduating. He was also one of the few peers who has always respected and NOT hit on me (unlike many other guys in engineering).

He has even has acknowledged me as a true friend because of this; all of our other engineering friends moved on and lost contact, which is a bummer because I wish more of us could see each other as more than a “semester friend” or “school friend”.

I asked my workplace if they were still currently taking on interns, because I knew of a friend who would make an amazing addition to the team. And I was told “Of course! Have him send us his resume!”

Long story short, my friend and I have been working together for a few months now, me full time and him as an intern. It’s been the best. He had been in a similar position as me before getting hired: no CAD experience, only one other internship under his belt, limited use of programs, etc. 

And now? He’s absolutely cracked at it. I see him drawing curbs on AutoCAD, picking up the ball quicker than I did at that point of my own internship. I am so proud of him. The best part? I was able to secure a future for him after school! He told me just yesterday HE GOT THE OFFER FOR FULL TIME!!!! (I knew he would, but AHHHH IM SO EXCITED FOR HIM!)

I’m just so happy to have been able to make this happen for him. The struggle is all too real…and all it takes is one person. I was given a chance, and I extended that chance. Instead of seeing each other as competition, we saw each other as potential colleagues. 

Now here we are :) He has been appointed my Best Man of Honor and is currently the godfather of my cat."

I think that the constant cycle of being close to getting a role and passing technicals and OAs to rejections made me develop anxiety issues that I've been noticing recently. It's probably a result of constantly going down rabitholes of thoughts on how the decisions were made about me.

I keep having paranoid thoughts about people hating me and I just freaked out at my friend because I thought he suddenly started hating me for some reason and it's all over a late reply to a text.

yzkpx1,70,2022-11-19,[IN] Intern seems oblivious to professional norms and it's hurting his job search and burning bridges everywhere,maximumspoilage,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/yzkpx1/in_intern_seems_oblivious_to_professional_norms/,"At my organization, I'm partly in charge of a man who's near halfway through his year-long paid internship with us.  He's not performing well and has alienated almost everyone, and the direct feedback we've been giving him doesn't seem to be making much impact.  Here are some reasons why:

\- he is given a list of tasks to do and instructions for how to do them, but he ignores these tasks and claims he was never told about them.

\- he is not a considerate officemate.  I have received a lot of feedback from people who sit near him that he is extremely loud, talks on his phone for hours in his native language while sitting at his desk, and isn't mindful that others need to do work (their roles are such that they cannot wear noise-canceling headphones while doing their jobs)

\- he doesn't respect his higher-ups.  My industry is pretty hierarchical, with deference expected while interfacing with people above you in the org chart.  He will knock on higher-ups' office doors or walk right in, ask if they have five minutes for a quick question, and proceed to talk on and on until he is asked to leave, about a range of topics that, frankly, he should be researching for himself.  He does this to me often.  I have stopped him and told him it's not a good time, and ask him to come back at a specific time later in the day, which he does not do.  Even when I send him a calendar invite for later in the day and he accepts it, he still won't show up at the appointed time, and does not apologize when I next see him.

This man was born and raised outside the US and is on a temporary visitor visa in the US.  In order to stay in the US after his visa ends, he will need a full-time job offer by an employer who is willing to sponsor him (at much cost to them) to eventually get a green card.  As it happens, we have an internal opening in our organization, which he interviewed for, but due to his performance so far, he will not be hired.  So, he has been interviewing externally, and while there's a lot of demand for his skill set, he's had no offers.  He will come talk to me after almost every interview and complain about the slightest things -- how someone made an offhand remark that offended him, how one of his interviewers told him that the role was quite busy and he didn't like that, how he didn't like that he had to interview with a specific person and he complained to the person organizing the interview about this (!!!), how a hiring manager asked him to meet her at a Starbucks for a preliminary conversation prior to a formal interview day and he felt that was inappropriate, how a hiring manager tried to sell him a job by talking about the generous compensation and he didn't like that (!!!), etc.  I have been listening patiently and offering impartial advice.  I have also tried to be very frank with him that no job is perfect, especially not the very first job you get right out of internship training, and that his visa status may be a hindrance for some employers.  As the months drag by and he continues having apparently negatively experiences everywhere he interviews, it's clear he's not taking my advice on board, and he's probably showing up to them the same way he's showing up to us -- basically, making a poor impression and torching his chances of getting hired anywhere.

My industry is pretty small, and I've heard unofficially from some other colleagues at different organizations that he's indeed not interviewing well and turning people off.  I've also heard indirectly that his references from other organizations are not giving him good reviews.  (Thankfully, he has not asked me to be a reference for him -- and I do not think I could be, in good conscience.)

I'm struggling with how to manage this situation going forward.  Any resources for how to instill professionalism and self-awareness into someone like this, since direct and pointed feedback isn't working?   (Sadly, I don't have the authority to put him on a PIP or terminate him -- the person who hired him is very unlikely to be on board with either of these plans.)  I'm also worried about my own professional reputation in this small industry, in the high likelihood that he won't change if/when he finds a full-time job and burns bridges at his next organization too."

1. In business, there is no such thing as being over-prepared.

Preparation and organization show dedication, commitment, and work ethic. To clarify, take action. Reframe the way you see “prepared.” “Perfect” is not prepared, it’s not an achievable metric. Don’t suffer from a perfectionist mentality— waiting to take action certainly won’t help. Show up to meetings with more preparation than others normally would. It’s unlikely for someone to think that you over-prepared.

2. No one cares about your business as much as you do.

Clients, leads, prospects, employees, friends, and family will not care as much as you do. So, care A LOT. Follow up early and often. Never expect anyone to work harder than you on your business. Be relentlessly involved with your business.

3. Talk is cheap.

Lots of people will say they want to hear more but do not have the desire to ever work with you or even need your product/service. Don’t take it personally. Move on, but take note of that type of person.

4. Pay attention to the words you say.

“Interested,” “just,” and “no problem” are all words I've made an effort to remove from my vocabulary. Speak with confidence. Never joke about your business or goals. If they're serious, don't bring them down. There are plenty of other people who can do that for you.

5. Have very clear goals.

Use numbers and deadlines, then find ways to gamify your goals. Without clear goals you end up exactly where you have headed; someplace you didn’t have the clarity to see. Running 100,000 miles in the wrong direction is far better than standing still. Pick a goal, and stick to it.

6. You don't have to work for your mentors without pay.

A good mentor should want to and have the ability to pay you. Be willing to accept lower pay in exchange for connections and knowledge--but working for free when starting a business isn’t sustainable, try to avoid it.

7. The first week of working with a client matters more than the first 3 months.

Within the first week or so of working with you, a client/customer already knows whether or not they will continue working with you. First impressions do matter. It's the nature of the beast. Get your customers a win as soon as possible.

8. A “No” isn’t a never.

It just means you didn’t articulate the value of your offer well enough. Ask questions to see why they actually don’t want to work with you. Use it to prepare for your other meetings and improve your offer.

9. If you truly believe in your offer, you’re doing a disservice to others by not selling it.

If you can actually help someone, there is no reason you should feel bad or weird about selling. Have confidence in your product. If you don't, stop selling it.

10. If you’re comfortable, you’re not growing.

(In life and in business) Your best experiences will come from running straight into discomfort. You'll learn the most by going for it. So... GO FOR IT!

11. Have contracts in place as soon as possible.

Don’t do handshake deals. Remember, a contract is for both parties and you put contracts in place because you do trust them. You wouldn’t be willing to hold yourself accountable to someone you don’t trust.

12. Put yourself in situations that create luck.

When you put yourself in situations and surround yourself with people who know more than you, make more money than you, and work harder than you, it'll look “lucky” to other people. Luck can be created by showing up every day and putting yourself in the right rooms. Find a way to get your foot in the door.

13. Be willing for it to take time.

Anything worthwhile isn’t going to happen overnight. It takes time. Persistent action, pivoting, and challenging beliefs will help you grow and level up in business. Break down your limiting beliefs. Focus on self-development and discipline. Your business grows when you do. But grow as fast as you can. Fast action day-to-day and long-term patience are key.

Thanks for Reading!

I still have a lot to learn! Before starting my entrepreneurship journey, I heard some of these lessons. However, looking back on the last year, I saw them in action. Maybe a few years from now, I'll look back on these and question how I was even making money. I would love your feedback."
yzorhg,8,2022-11-19,"Industrial engineer, started my first full time job in QA — I [22F] made a mistake, looking for advice to be able to switch to Data Engineer/Data Analyst roles",muse_kimtaehyung,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/yzorhg/industrial_engineer_started_my_first_full_time/,"Earlier this year, I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering from the #1 University in Canada. I had a dream job offer from a Fortune 500 top 10 company as a “Data Engineer + Business Analyst” lined up as soon as I graduated, despite having no work experience in the field. Unfortunately, I lost the offer because they were not willing to hire students who were waiting for a work permit (mine hadn’t arrived yet). 

I started applying to jobs again, 4 months passed and I had applied to 100s of roles with only 3 interviews, and 0 offers  — probably since the only internship I did during my degree was as a UX Designer one summer. Our university offered a 1-year internship program, but I couldn’t take advantage of that because I had a major surgery and had to take a year off instead of enrolling in the internship program.  

Since I was running out of money and unable to afford rent anymore, I started getting a bit desperate and applying to roles that I was not interested in, but felt that I would still have a decent chance at bagging. I applied for a Quality Engineering Developer role at a major bank, and ended up getting the job offer. To my shock, on my first day, they told me that the role was for a “Quality Analyst” (not the developer role that I was promised). I continued anyway since it didn’t pay much, but it was enough to pay the bills at the time, and I didn’t have any other options lined up.

It’s been 3 months since I started the QA job , and i’m realizing how little QAs are valued in the workplace. The company treats us like garbage, and this is the 3rd time I’m being asked to work over the weekend to make up for the project delays caused by the Dev team being unable to meet their deadlines. 90% of my QA coworkers are offshore hires working in the opposite timezone, and the Project Manager often yells and raises her voice at QAs. 

I feel that I made a big mistake taking up a QA role as my first job after graduation just because I needed to make ends meet. I am trying to apply to dev and data analyst jobs, but i’ve heard that QA experience is not valued, and haven’t been hearing back from companies. I also can’t call myself a “new grad” since it’s been more than 6 months since I graduated, which is also hurting my chances with such little work experience. 

I also don’t have a CS or ECE degree, but my other industrial engineering friends were able to bag jobs ranging from SDE, Process Engineer, Supply Chain Analyst, Consultant, and even Manager-level roles right after graduating despite doing the same degree. I am depressed and feel like an absolute loser seeing my Engineer classmates do so well in life and travel the world, while I work weekends in a dead-end QA job and barely make ends meet. 

I feel like I completely wasted my Industrial Engineering degree, and am so sad that I lost the Data Analyst dream job :( 

Does anyone here have any advice for me? How do I make myself attractive to employers as a Data Analyst or Data Engineer despite being a QA? Are there any certificates or other valuable things I can do to change my career path? I’m also worried that employers will think it’s a red flag that I’m trying to leave my QA job just 3 months into it… would appreciate your advice!"

For context, I´m a junior currently, and am looking to get into software engineering. No matter which of these two I pick, I plan on applying for new grad roles next year in the hopes of landing a more lucrative SWE role at a different company, as neither GM nor L3Harris pays too well.

This means the biggest factor for me is what would look better on my resume when I apply for full-time roles next year.

Details about the offers:

GM:

1. Title: Software Engineering Intern
2. Location: Warren (Detroit), Michigan. Global Technical Center.
3. Pay: Don't know yet as I have only received the verbal offer thus far. I expect it to be about the same as L3Harris
4. Starting TC for full-time role: \~95k

L3Harris:

1. Title: Software Engineering Intern
2. Location: Dallas, Texas
3. Pay: $29/hour, plus $3,000 lump sum housing stipend.
4. Starting TC for full-time role: \~85k--fewer datapoints to go off of.

I don't really know what I'll be working on at either of these two companies either. Just looking for any bits of advice, especially as to which one of these two opportunities would look better on a resume applying to full-time SWE roles at top companies.

yzv75c,0,2022-11-19,MIT Lincoln Laboratory or Merck for internship summer 2023?,HeHe9988,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yzv75c/mit_lincoln_laboratory_or_merck_for_internship/," MIT Lincoln Laboratory or Merck? (internship)

I'm a rising sophomore in computer science, and a few days ago I was offered an IT Emerging Talent Intern summer role from Merck for the Summer of 2023. Because the pay was pretty good in the offer letter ($27/hr), the office was not too far from my house, I had no other offers, and the offer would expire in a week, I quickly signed all the documents and accepted the offer.

However, literally a day later, I received an email from Lincoln Laboratory, stating they are very interested in extending an offer to me. I haven't received an offer just yet, but it does seem very likely that I will receive one. This was a shock to me, as I thought I did not do as well on the interview as I could have.

Now I'm unsure of which one to take. My friends tell me to take Merck (which I already did) since it is more industry-oriented, and I'm generally not looking to pursue research or higher education after my bachelor's. However, the MIT role looks very interesting to me, and I wouldn't even care if the pay was lower, as I feel like it would stand out more on a resume and would stand out more to future employers. I also heard that the program has a good amount of both research and industry experience, which would help me discover where my interests lie.

I am pretty conflicted, though, since I already accepted Merck's offer and I wouldn't want to tell them I changed my mind and potentially end up on their blacklist.

Does anyone have any advice?"

yzygyg,1,2022-11-20,dissatisfied parents?,kittybunnydolly,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yzygyg/dissatisfied_parents/,"I’m sure I’m not the only person who deals with this, in fact I think everyone does, but the way my parents act so dissatisfied and unhappy with my life choices absolutely infuriates me. it’s like one of the few things that really gets under my skin.

for background, my parents have never been satisfied with my accomplishments, or really ever proud of me. I was an honor roll student, 3.5+ GPA, sports, extracurriculares, gift en programs, internships, you name it I did it. 

I’ve also always been very free spirited, leading my own path. I’ve never liked people telling me what to do or how to live my life, it’s one of the few things that drives me insane, with that being said there are a lot of things I chose to do because I thought and felt it would’ve the right choice for me, I never take no for an answer if it’s something I really want.

Like many people in their early 20’s (22F), I’m still figuring myself out and figuring out what it is I truly want. I know I want to live a fulfilling life, travel a ton, experience all there is life has to offer, I want to look back when I’m only and be proud of how much I chose to explore and expand. My parents, however, don’t think of life or me that way. To them, they think having financial stability is like the pinnacle of success.

My parents grew up really rough, so I do understand. But I wish they didn’t look down on me so much, as if I’m like a loser or something? I have solid friends, I’m active in my social life, I have an aesthetics business I just recently put on pause for a bit while I’m figuring things out with my direction, but in general I get this like overwhelming sense of disappointment from them, when frankly I’ve done more than a lot of my peers and more than them too.

I love my parents, they’re very supportive and love me deeply, they just want what’s best for me, but they’re idea of “what’s best for me” would literally ruin me, I would hate my life if I followed what they wanted for me. 

I guess with this post I’m just trying to figure out what to do, I love my parents and I want them to be proud of me, but at the same time I’m still figuring myself out and I will not allow anyone to control my life. Thoughts?"

While applying for jobs, I have been spending time on web dev as it seemed to have more opportunities for new grads but I don't enjoy it. I would love to do a master's but circumstances don't allow it. Should I take online courses, do more personal projects and invest more time in learning more about this field in hopes to enter this field or is that a bad idea? Maybe it would be better to spend the same time learning some other skills?

Are there other fields I should look into? A lot of the entry-level positions, especially outside web dev, seem to require &gt;1/2 year of experience, which I couldn't get with internships alone (I did 2 internships as a software dev and game designer).

Lastly, where should I be looking for job opportunities? I have been spending most of my time on LinkedIn, glassdoor and the university job board but I was suggested to attend fairs.

Now the thing is ... I'm lowkey in a healthy routine but I can't digest the fact that she has moved on or will move on and I can't be with her...like I said our relationship was mainly based upon insecurities...soo I'm afraid I'm jealous...I feel like I should be happy for her that she's making good decisions for her mental state and is moving on from what we both knew was a harmful relationship for both of us...but I feel like relationship would have worked in desperate...I know the relationship won't work but my mind keeps making this up because maybe I'm afraid to move on 

Lately I've been reading subtle art of not giving a fuck .mwhich does make me feel good but there are instances where I feel that I hurt rock bottom.Im soo insecure that I'd rather hurt people around me than to accept that I'm insecure 

I mean I hurt people...which I dont anymore.
I used to contact her ...even when she clearly said not to ...ik I shouldn't have harrassed her but now when I feel like contacting her ...I come down to reddit and start reading people progression or just reread my own posts 

Ik I have insecurities...I can't figure out which one's as if now ...but I think I value sex and appearance as my values...since my ex was attractive I feel like I'll never get anyone like her ....but the thing is ...I'd never want to be with her since it's not all about appearance ...yea sure she was a good person too ..but she also had insecurities which contributed to our end of relationship.

And since this is a safe space ...I assume 

I feel jealous ...that she's doing good than me ...and that was my motivation to not stalking her ...it made me feel even worse ... Even when her and I are on lowkey same page of my I compare myself to her and I see her better than me .....now I know I shouldnt do this ... It's my own insecurities that makes me jealous and not happy for me ..I know that .

My goal as of now is to work on my internships ...learn new skills that will help my career ...keep doing my gym 
Be more social and more empath and just refuse to listen to my insecurities....

I've learnt this the hard way ....chasing your insecurity..in my case ...bought me 5 minutes of ""happiness"" and then even worse feeling of unhappiness ...not to mention u hurt my ex in process of this chasing my insecurity ...I kept contacting her even when she asked not to 

Now I know ....my insecurities hurt me ...but it's okay ... I won't hurt anyone ...and I won't get hurt chasing my insecurities...I have insecurities and I'm going to try my best to just accept it and not act upon it.


Also,I'm going to post everytime I feel like I'm gonna do something stupid ....like rn before writing I felt like reaching out to her again and beg for mercy...which I won't do now ...I'll now go and do my assignments

That is a more than fair salary, that being said I want to migrate to an IT role, I got my associate's degree while working and just finished my certification exams for N-008 Networking+ and A+ certification exams. I was wondering what should my next steps be in acquiring a job in the IT field.

I want to look for work but am unsure of where to start, should I study for Security+ as well or should the 2 certifications along with an associate be enough to find a position? Should I be looking for help desk jobs or what kind of job is the best first step to breaking into the field? Any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks for reading.

Salut, numele meu este Gabriel, am 20 de ani si sunt un student din Bucuresti la Facultatea de Inginerie Electrica UPB, anul 3 (din 4). In prezent, in urma unui internship lucrez de 1 an in testare automata la o companie de outsourcing. Visul meu dpdv profesional, este sa ajung developer, iar oportunitatea de a lucra intr-un domeniu apropiat m-a ajutat sa ma dezvolt destul de mult.

# Problema

Desi notele mele nu au fost cele mai bune, dupa ce am terminat liceul am zis ca, daca tot trebuie sa fac o facultate, as vrea sa fie automatica, insa ultima nota de intrare din 2020 a fost 9,85 si nu am prins loc. Din lipsa de alternative am ales o facultate la 'intamplare', zicand ca o sa fie bine cumva, desi stiam ca politehnica nu este cea mai usoara facultate.

Impreuna cu niste colegi am trecut peste primii 2 ani, (si spre rusinea mea, nu ma pricep mai deloc la electronica), insa acum simt ca nu mai pot duce inca 2 cu stres si invatat o gramada de chestii pe derost pentru teste/examene.

# Bun, si ce vrei de la noi?

Prin acest post as vrea sa cer o parere in special de la cei apropiati de varsta mea care lucreaza in domeni si nu au terminat o facultate, insa orice sfat este bine venit.

Problema este ca ma gasesc in situatia de ""a nu-mi parea rau mai tarziu"" daca renunt acum la facultate (sincer as fi facut-o inca din primul an), dar in acelasi timp nici situatia curenta nu ma bucura prea mult, practic sunt intr-un stres continuu cauzat de facultate. Singura motivatie ca sa continui facultatea este acea bucata de carton pe care o primesti la final si mai exact cam singurul beneficiu care vine cu ea, scutirea de impozitul de 10%.

⚠️ **Incerc de mult timp sa fac acest post, si chiar as aprecia daca s-ar posta doar raspunsuri serioase, va multumesc tuturor!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

✍️ **Edit (20/11 18:48):** Am citit si posturile mentionate in FAQ, si as vrea sa precizez ca nu am o problema cu invatatul si nu vad IT-ul ca si un job de duzina doar ca mai bine platit."

Now I have a degree no experience,tried applying for jobs but with no experience,eventually i got discouraged and stopped applying.I feel it was a waste of a good 3yrs in school.my current job does not pay well. Question to those with Business info System degree which area did you focus on? and what Job did you land?  I wasnt sure which area to focus on but i found out that am gravitating towards SQL.

im a CS junior. last year as a sophomore, I applied to 300-400 places and didn't get a single offer. it destroyed my mental health, especially seeing so many people in my school, so many people on Linkedin with amazing offers as sophomores. I didn't know what I was doing wrong and tried to talking to recruiters and career fair who said my resume was good. I figured I was just unlucky and put my head down and kept grinding leetcode... Since I didn't have an internship, I spent the summer trying to do personal projects and stuff to boost my resume.

now come junior year... I've just submitted my 600th application. I've done so many OAs (and done well) and haven't gotten a single offer. I come from a low-income family so seeing other students land these $13k/mo internships while I can't has caused me huge stress (seeing that these 3 month internships pays more than my dad's yearly salary). At this point my mental health is destroyed, i've destroyed my social life over trying to land an internship and now I'm giving up... maybe on life even

I don't know what to do. i've let my parents down and honestly just wish I never existed with how tough everything is. I wanted to improve my family's quality of life by becoming a software engineer and i won't be able to do that with how competitive this market is and probably graduating with 0 internships. 

It's been super hard man... i hope anyone reading could give me any advice at all, or whether i should just hope my kids will be able to be successful. Living in this cycle of being poor just sucks, all i wanted to was to help my family"

Pare ca toti din jurul meu merg pe unde apuca, la companii focusate in special pe embedded, automotive, sau chiar fe si be(care imi cam place, dar ajung si la asta)..toate astea pe motivul ca ""pfa ma umple Nokia sau Continental de bani de pe acum""..insa eu nu prea as dori sa fac embedded sau sa lucrez pe site-uri...am inceput de cv timp sa lucrez cu java spring pe partea de back end, care imi pare destul de interesanta, motiv pentru care m-as indrepta spre ceva cloud-based, sau chiar cybersecurity, care ma fascineaza destul de mult..insa, cel putin in momentul de fata, pare ca se cauta strict profesionisti pe partea asta(lucru care e logic) si cineva ca mine nu prea are loc de intrare :)) 

Asa ca adresez intrebarea asta celor care activeaza in domeniu sau care au trecut printr-o treaba asemanatoare..cum fac sa ajung sa lucrez in domeniile astea si, daca tot, ce mi-ati recomanda sa invat?

But i am having cold feet. My mum offered me to stud Finance at SIM-University of Buffalo or SIM- UOL. Both courses come out of family money. Interests is like equal in both . So I just wanna know which one is more likely to hire for employers for a fresh grad. 22 years this year.Poly grad

My Resume is like 6 months Business intern. 2 Months Marketing intern. Which was cut short by Covid &amp; then army. Just came out only &lt;1 month. Currently lost. But i kinda wanna go uni at this point of time. Thoughts?

The pros i listed for CS is that it will eventually pay off higher than Business. But no-lifing a bit. The reason i considered CS is cuz i realized all the banks now want to see your IT background before hiring when considering equal level applicants as well as they look for people who can code algorithms compared to normal people.

I’m also not sure how to break into finance without a finance deg either. But my friend say that’s too ambitious that i take a double deg"
z0aqio,5,2022-11-20,"Recent Grad, looking to plan an MBA journey",NewFreezer18,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/z0aqio/recent_grad_looking_to_plan_an_mba_journey/,"Hey all- I'm a final year university student from the UK looking to plan for an MBA in 4-5 years time. My current profile is as follows:

Education: MSc Development Economics (Oxbridge)- Predicted Distinction/Merit (Published Thesis in Economics), BSc Economics from a Top 5 UK University (Non Oxbridge)- 1st Class Honours (equivalent to 4.0)

Leadership positions: Strong extracurricular involvement at university particularly in social impact causes, with a focus on Education and pro-bono consulting (Leadership positions in 3 student organisations). Other ECs include sports/music at an intramural/collegiate level.

Test Scores: Have Taken the GRE and at 1st attempt got a score of 334 (167Q, 167V, 6A Writing), taking the GMAT shortly.

Work Experience: Several Internships in big-name companies (FAANG as a business intern, economic consulting) and volunteer experience in international development.

I'm currently looking to identify the best pre-MBA position between two offers. My overall goal post-MBA would be MBB consulting/strategy roles at foundations like Gates Foundation/Dalberg

The two offers I currently hold are:

1) Accenture - for a Consulting Development Program (London, UK)- non-strategy.

2) the UK Civil Service as an Economist within the Development and Diplomatic Economics fast stream (equivalent to a position within the State Department/USAID)

I am trying to decide which of these two would be most beneficial if I intend to go back to do a MBA. Accenture is more business focused but I think I might get pigeonholed into 'tech implementation' type roles, which I am not super keen on, as the scheme is not focused on strategy. I have also heard mixed things about the organisation. On the other hand, the FCDO is quite competitive which may impress adcoms, and more in line with my educational background - but less focused on finance/business and may mark me out as a 'non-traditional applicant'. 

Nevertheless, I think the overall experience I might get in the latter would be more compelling as the rotations would be focused more on my skillset (economics/research) as opposed to general management consulting, and I would potentially have more opportunities to have more 'unique' experiences for application essays (for example, international experience).

Which of these two sound like a better choice, in your opinion?"

z0dk2r,3,2022-11-20,Getting an internship,Montinyek,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/z0dk2r/getting_an_internship/,"I'm a second year Computer Science student. I've been coding for about 9 months, completely self taught. Started from CSS, built a website, moved on to JS. In JS I also spent a lot of time on data structures and algorithms. Right now I'm finishing up an in-depth React course. Overall I feel confident in my ability to learn and be up to standard as an intern. I also plan on getting a certification of proficiency in French and Chinese, which are my 7th and 10th languages respectively, and although I don't like boasting about it, I'm definitely putting it on my resume to help me stand out a bit. My question is, how many projects, if any do I need in order to have a chance at landing an internship? Would something like this [https://codepen.io/Montinyek/pen/WNzqZZa](https://codepen.io/Montinyek/pen/WNzqZZa) be suitable? I can clean it up a bit more. I'm thinking about building my own flashcard app with special features that involve my language learning methods, but I feel like it would take too long and it's an overkill for an internship. I need to land one as soon as possible. What do you guys think?

Anyways, the more I read through this sub the more I feel like I was an idiot for not at least trying for CS or even just an engineering degree, due to my fear of math (something I got over far too late in) and becoming a dev or engineer. 

The on-call/after/weekend hours, the complete disregard of a work-life balance, the being treated like trash, the ""one step above retail"", the overall high levels of stress, like holy shit this entire field sounds like absolute hell where everyone is miserable. 

I'm aware I sound like I'm giving up preemptively, I don't intend to switch fields (just yet). But goddamn I feel more dread then I do excitement for this coming month.

I'm not there just yet, but part of me wonders if eventually I'm gonna end up just pulling the trigger and doing another ~3 years of school for a CS degree. This could also just be regular college to career anxiety flaring up, so who knows. Thanks for reading my panic attack."

However, my goal is to move to the US asap.

As a new grad, I'll be graduating with 7 internships. RBC Amplify (Summer 2023), RBC Capital Markets (Winter 2023), IBM (Summer 2022), BlackBerry (Winter 2022), OpenText (Fall 2021), and 2 startups (Summer 2021, Winter 2021).

I was able to pull this off because school was online during covid, and I attend a shit-tier university in Ontario.


Having said that, how realistic would it be for me to land a role in the US as a new grad, or maybe 2 years out?

I'm leetcoding like crazy rn, so that when new grad apps role out in around 8 months, I'll be very well prepared. On top of that, I'm studying systems design.

I'm an international freshman at a T20 college in the US and am planning to go to graduate school.  (studying CS +cogsci).  


Trying to get a research position I emailed professors in the field that I was interested in, but all of them were too busy to reply. I sent a follow up email to each one, but they didn't respond. Later I stopped one of the professors after his class (that I am not currently taking, because its a junior / sophomore level class) and he basically takes students after they have done really good in his class OR if they worked with him over the summer through a research program (that I later applied to).  


So I don't have any research positions for the spring.   
My alternative plan that I am doing is taking a bit more classes and doing a TAship (which I've heard is sometimes required for grad school applications) and I wanted to do that either way. Right now I am also on a good track to finish with 4.0 or close to 4.0 GPA. Besides that I am applying to SWE internships for the summer, just to have a backup plan if REUs don't work out.  


My question just is: Is my current plant good? How much behind am I by not having research during freshman year (if I'm aiming for T10 grad schools)?   


PS: I do have some research internships from high school, but nothing major.

z0vg7k,5,2022-11-21,"Sa mga nakapagtrabaho agad sa IT after graduation, ano itsura ng resume niyo?",httpExceptions,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/z0vg7k/sa_mga_nakapagtrabaho_agad_sa_it_after_graduation/,"Two semester na lang ga-graduate na ako. After ng graduation, gusto kong mag-apply as a programmer. Kaso medyo hindi ako confident sa sarili ko dahil konti pa lang yung nagagawa kong project na matino. Ang mga projects ko na presentable is more on lang sa mga ginagawa namin sa school — capstone (by group ito, I'm the backend progammer) and yung system na ginawa namin sa research (by group din, backend developer din ako). In terms naman sa internship, wala pa din. Sa last sem pa kami magkaka-OJT, if mangyari yun, yun lang yung masasabi kong experience ko. 

Medyo nahirapan din kasi ako sa pag-build ng portfolio ko since nanghihiram lang ako ng laptop kapag nagpo-program. Btw, in terms of expertise, sa python ako mas maalam. Marunong din naman ako sa frontend (html, css, javascript). 

Sa tingin niyo, considering na masyadong crowded ang field na to, and maarte ang mga company, may tatanggap kaya sa akin?

Also, ano itsura ng resume niyo nung nag-apply kayo sa first job niyo sa IT industry as a programmer (or kahit sa ibang specialization)?"

I need tips on what to do. So my plan is if I don't get any internship programs in cybersecurity, I would continue on with programming for now.

And does it really matter what company I get for my internship? If yes, what companies would you guys recommend?

If in terms of programming I do have a bit of background and have built up a portfolio. The problem maybe is I don't have anything to show for in cybersecurity. Maybe create a technical blog? I watched a few videos and they say to work on ctfs challenges online to practice. 

Tips or recommendations for cybersecurity would be very helpful."

Last edit: Corsair offered a 15% discount store wide. Refurbished power supplies only have a 90 day warranty. I’ll be treating warranties like oil change stickers now.

Edit: I don’t fully understand the root cause just yet. I bring this failure up to see if there are ways to sniff catastrophic failures out before hand and to discuss how manufactures can implement preventative measures to make catastrophic failures closer to impossible in a general sense.

Edit: added another image  
Edit: more photos from today  

Note: Just dug up the receipt. The unit was a manufacturer refurbished model from Micro Center in Houston purchased in 2015. Definitely some suspect stuff. I don’t know who’s going to take the responsibility if anyone at all.

Edit: **It’s not the cord**. Cords don’t pop/explode. Also, the cord is rated for 10A 250V. The power supply developed an internal short causing the cord to burn up. Tried another cord on a different breaker, and tripped it no problem. I usually wrap my cords like how this new psu is set up now (unmounted to the case for now).

Unnecessary but maybe entertaining background story:

Imagine playing mwII domination and you’re about to smoke three dudes on B. Aim down sight and PAH. Everything turns off and a 3~4 foot flame shoots up from the back of your PC lighting up the room. 

The flame quickly subsides and you hear your UPS take over with a loud click. The back of your pc now is illuminated by a flickering yellow light and smoke starts to fill the room. You jump behind the pc to find the cord on fire and try to blow it out. No luck since the fire starts again. Yank everything out from the UPS to then find your table starting to catch. 

You quickly blow it out to find yourself sitting in complete darkness and silence in a cloud of smoke wondering who the fuck could help you. After calming down, you can’t help but laugh that you’re the one that got smoked."

What I really want to talk about is how to get off this technical skills track and into a more people managing side of the business without putting my current position in jeopardy. In this economy? Our company is medium size. It’s a tech company. There’s whispering of layoffs in tech in general. But seems to be relegated to very large companies. This is a topic I could also broach.

z15jaj,5,2022-11-21,I've been lying for years and now I have no clue how to get out of it,cheeseistheway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/z15jaj/ive_been_lying_for_years_and_now_i_have_no_clue/,"I'm from a country in Europe, and was considered smart and gifted in school. At the end of high school, I won a scholarship for a top university in another country. Everyone around me were so proud, and I felt pride, joy, and a huge responsibility to not let them down.

I thought I will move abroad, go to this school, and become a huge success- but I was very very wrong.

I didn't come there prepared enough, my language skills were not good enough and quickly I started falling behind.

My grades were low and I was in a constant fear that I would lose my scholarship. Quickly depression kicked in and I became suicidal, and completely focused on surviving, on managing to graduate without getting kicked out.

Then, as a 19-year-old I committed the biggest mistake of my life so far-

I hid the truth from all my friends and family back home. I didn't tell them I was failing school, I pretended that everything is still ok, just so that they will continue to feel proud and relaxed about me, and that my family who was dealing with other worries could use me as a source of joy.

Finally, graduation arrived and luckily I managed to survive and graduate, but I failed all my job interviews due to my low grades and no internships.

And so, I ended up finding a very basic job, low-pay just to cover the bills (something like a secretary) , and lived very frugally.

**However- I couldn't stop the lie. It took over me.** I kept lying to everyone back home that I work at a top firm in my profession (marketing).

I was a stupid 21-year-old girl with and for some weird reason really thought I could pull it off and 'we'll see what will happen later, anyway I’m suicidal’

And it did work- for the last 5 years (!) I've been living in the country where I graduated in, working in several secretary-type jobs, doing my best not to spend money, and fighting my depression, while presenting a perfect life while I visit home, talking about my amazing marketing job and making my parents proud.

At this point with the depression, I assumed that I would suicide later on anyway, so all of it didn't matter.

But a year ago during covid something changed.

I had some time at home by myself, and decided to try and fight the depression one last time before I truly give up. I worked hard on self-development and gradually started feeling better and better. I re-found my love for marketing, took some advanced Udemy courses from home, and started regaining faith in myself that I can really succeed and have a nice career in this field, this time for real.

At the same time, I started missing my home country, wanting to go back, live near my family, and restart my life over there.

But here comes my big problem-

Ideally, I would have come back home, use my saved money to settle down, and start applying for marketing jobs in my country, using at least the good university I graduated from as something nice on my resume.

However- the lie is stopping me from doing that. I cannot lie in job interviews- a quick background check will reveal the truth, and my entire life would collapse.

And if I will tell the truth- graduating and then working as a secretary and in a call center for years- it will be revealed to my friends and family that I was a liar, and could ruin my relationship with them.

Also, probably no company would like to hire a person with such big holes in their resume since college, and if I will explain that I was fighting depression it will probably only make it worse (my country doesn't have high awareness of mental health yet).

And so, I find myself stuck again, and knowing that there's no way out of it and I'm destined to always have it on my back. And the thoughts about death sneak in again.  

If anyone has an advice on how to get out of the mess I created, I would love to hear it

Thank you very much"

I will score very poorly on this attempt but I am sure I can achieve over 90 percentile next semester. Thus I am very confused If I should give this attempt.

It has almost been 6 months; in 2 days it will be 6 months. Yet I still feel stuck on her. In the beginning it was a depressed attachment, I was crying constantly, and I just felt so lost. I couldn't focus on anything. It was a shame because during that period of time I had so many things going for me: I graduated literally a week or 2 after she blocked me, then I began an internship which paid really well, and I made so many connections during that internship. I should have been having an amazing summer. But it wasn't. During my internship, I was unfocused and distraught. I was depressed and I would end up working overtime just so I wouldn't have to go home. I didn't want to go home because I would just end up thinking of her. It was really hard to focus on the tasks IO had to do as well, and sometimes I would find myself crying during work because I was thinking about her or remembered something about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Going forward to now, I am still not okay. There was a brief 2 or 3 weeks where I was starting to improve. I started working out and buying supplements and watching motivational videos to try to get me back to being okay. But this last week I got sick and stopped working out and stopped doing everything. Now, all these intrusive thoughts are back but the feelings are different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I remember all the wrong she did to me. I understand that during the relationship I made mistakes. I talked to people she didn't want me talking to, but I never did anything flirtatiously. I lied to cover it up, but I lied because she is an emotional wreck, and I can't have her exploding on me. I lied out of fear of her, not out of shame or guilt. Now, when I think back to it though I realize that I was never deserving of how she treated me.

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much more I could type, but I feel horrible right now. I realize that all I have typed makes me seem like the bad person, but I can't even finish typing the rest because it hurts too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be okay. I am starting to recover a lot now and I am going to start working out again to try to get back to where I was a few weeks ago. I am going to start eating better and working harder. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I want her. I want to talk to her. I don't know if I want a relationship again or not, but I want her to acknowledge that I was a good person. I want her to apologize for the things she did to me that hurt me. I always apologized and did everything for her and that is a fact that she knows she has to admit, but she can't say the same for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate feeling like I was meaningless. I hate feeling like I am a waste. I don't know how to get her to even talk to me again. I miss her and I just feel really hurt that she would even leave me. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now that I finish my writing, I realize this is a complete mess and just a total mind dump. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I hope you have an amazing day and happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate."

The only language I am confident in is C++ (learnt due to coursework and other projects in the syllabus); which is creating hurdles in my interview prep. 

When I am coding leetcode solutions, I am getting really frustrated due to the complex syntax of C++, and constantly having to go back to learn something about pointers and memory allocation to use in data structures like linked list and binary trees.  C++ is the fastest performing language; but the slowest to write it's code. I am learning this lesson THE HARD WAY !!

It is my mistake that I did not learn python. The YouTube videos of neetcode are really helping to understand the solution; but I don't understand it 100% due to the language obstacle. 

More than half of my time is wasted in mapping C++ syntax to python syntax in YouTube videos. The algorithm explained is easy to understand in YouTube videos but while implementing - C++ is a nightmare. I am close to giving up my interview prep due to this hassle. 

I have done my search about learning python; but the google searches only lead to courses and videos which are aiming towards numpy, pandas and other only python-specific knowledge. 

I am planning to deep dive in learning python and it's advanced concepts later; but I need something to overcome the language barrier of the interview asap. I am planning to switch completely to python in 1 or 2 weeks and then resume my leetcode prep. But don't know how to switch to python without the regret of learning in a bad way or learning all the things unnecessary for leetcoding. 

My questions - 
- Is is possible to learn python only up-to a certain level that it will be helpful to me for solving leetcode problems (without worrying about syntax)? I do not want to learn any advanced thing in python right now due to shortage of time.  
- If that's possible, please tell any resource which can help me for it. 
 
Please help, Thanks a ton!"

I feel like I have bouts where it gets better before falling into the exact same place. I take Prozac daily and I feel like that helps with the day to day (a lot actually!!) but it doesn’t seem to help with situational anxiety. For example, freshman year of college I was driving a girl back to school from break and we were talking and it made me so nervous I threw up (on myself, embarrassingly enough). I shadowed a dentist and couldn’t make it 20 minutes without throwing up (I made it to the restroom at least). When I first went to college with my parents I threw up in the dining hall restroom, and 2/4 of trips back to school I have thrown up during the drive as well. 

Today was another bad day. I’ve had an internship before, and took hydroxyzine before going and never threw up at it. But while interviewing today I had 2 back-to-back interviews and during each I had to excuse myself briefly to throw up (luckily the bathroom is not near anyone). I was nervous but not super nervous until each interviewer came in. Same for the phone screening- but that went great. I don’t know if it’s eye contact or what but I’m so disappointed in myself.

I hate it so much, it’s like an anchor hindering me from being me. I can be so well prepared for something and feel like it’s fine until it starts then I feel nauseous and can’t talk or listen to my full potential. When I was young I had an issue with throwing up frequently as well- but around middle school it went away and then around college it came back.

I didn’t take hydroxyzine as it makes me numb when driving- and I had to drive. And even when I do take it it doesn’t always seem to work (maybe not taking it soon enough before an event). 

I can deal with my anxiety- but I can’t deal with the side effect of vomiting (so maybe I can’t deal with my anxiety?). 

Does anyone else have this problem? How do you deal with it? Should I talk to my doctor about other/alternate medications? Should I send the people who interviewed me thank you emails with an explanation? If I get accepted it won’t happen all the time- it’s really from it being a ‘new’ experience."

I was able to pull this off because school was online during covid, and I attend a shit-tier university in Ontario.


Having said that, how realistic would it be for me to land a role in the US as a new grad, or maybe 2 years out?

My goal is to approach my future in the most optimal way possible. I don't want to put more effort into something than I have to. For example, I don't want the grade I will get from a class deter me from taking it unless it will affect my job prospect in the future.

So i just today received an internship related to computer science (yay!) but I am now wondering if I should accept it or possibly transfer early.
 So a little backstory. I was originally going to transfer in spring 2024 to a CSU (i go to a community college). Well I found out recently that more classes are required to transfer with an ADT which would increase my time here at community college by a whole year (i have been here for 3 years already and am dying to transfer). I could transfer into fall 2023 potentially to a CSU but that means I wouldn't be able to take the internship. This decision to transfer was made after I applied as I was not aware before. I am not sure if I would get in but I'm hoping I will? I am a local student to both CSUs I applied to and have a 3.9 GPA. 
Should I take an extra semester in community college for the internship? Or just transfer asap. If I choose to transfer I can also get a head start and take some summer classes as well which I like. Thank you for any advice :)"

Yes, and sometimes the cards are stacked against you. It's not easy to learn to code in university starting from 0 knowledge. But listen to me.

I got an internship in summer of 2022 (had to pass two code tests kinda bs)

Now, I've received five different offers for Summer 2023 internships. Only two of which required any kind of code test. Two of these companies are Fortune 500 companies. And 4/5 of them pay $30+/hr.

And I'm not some 4.0 Harvard student. Nor am I a product of nepotism.

If one internship can do this much to help a hopeless, discouraged, depressed schmuck like me, it can help you.

If you are struggling to break into software engineering work, seriously consider going after the internships hard. They can pay off big time."

I recently received an SoC DV Intern offer from Apple. On the flip side, I have a **return offer** from another well-known EE company. While I was there, I was on their DV team, which does both pre and post-silicon verification work and emulation. However, my main intern project while I was there was tooling (didn't learn much DV).

Part of the issue is that I don't know if I want to do DV and am nervous about getting stuck in it. All my interviews this fall have been with DV teams.

The Apple team told me that I would be assigned some project that would have a ""real impact""  on their team and be important (typical things said for intern projects). Apple's offer is about 35% more, and I imagine they pay better full-time. The company I interned at previously, knowing that I would be interested in other disciplines, said I could join any pre-silicon team I wanted, from system design to IP and rtl to physical design.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for advice on things to consider in this decision. I'm inclined to take the Apple offer, just to experience a new company and get to work on Apple's ARM chips. However, the other company is offering me a chance to choose what discipline I focus on for the summer, and do something other than DV.

z1l1m4,2,2022-11-22,CS vs Aerospace. Looking for advice as a first year uni student.,thomassd7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z1l1m4/cs_vs_aerospace_looking_for_advice_as_a_first/,"Hi, 

 I don’t know if this is necessarily the best place to post this, but thought I’d give it a try.   

I’m a canadian student and I’m currently in my first year studying Computer Science at University. During my college applications, I initially applied for Computer Science and Aerospace engineering at two different schools and got accepted to both. Although Aerospace really seemed interesting to me, I ultimately decided to choose Computer science instead as I thought I’d enjoy it more and I believed it would bring me more opportunities and closer to my dream of one day working amongst big tech companies and possibly eventually starting my own business.

 I’m quite enjoying it so far. Because of my course selection, my first semester is very math-heavy, which isn’t necessarily what I enjoy the most but I still find it interesting and the actual programming course I’m taking is very fun and I’m doing well. However, ever since the school year started, I can’t help but keep second guessing my choice. I feel like the tech market is becoming more and more over-saturated and I’m quite scared that I’ll have a hard time getting internships and getting a good job after college.  

No matter how hard I try, I am just not able to brush off this feeling. I understand that doing something that you love is important in life, but (call me materialistic if you’d like) having a high paying job is something that’s important to me as well. I am wondering if I should switch to Aerospace engineering instead and pursue that field, as, although more specialized and fewer jobs, salaries are often high and the school I would be applying to is very well seen in my province, so I doubt I'd have much trouble finding opportunities. The admissions to the Aerospace engineering program are, at least in my province, very competitive, so for me to be accepted and decline was kind of a big deal to me and took me a lot of courage, but now I wonder if I should have accepted instead.  

 Anyways, sorry If I rambled on or if this isn’t the right place to discuss this. I feel pretty lost right now and I just had to get things off my chest.  I feel like maybe some people here may relate to my situation. If any of you has advice for me or would like to help me deliberate, it would be greatly appreciated. Ultimately, I know it comes down to what I believe is the right move and my preferences, but perhaps the point of view of people in the field could enlighten me a bit. :)  

Thanks"

I would like to end up as a digital VLSI or ASIC design engineer somewhere like AMD, Nvidia, or Intel etc etc. The roles in both positions are very similar. Would either of these companies be a better choice for my career path?

I was being abused, bullied, and I had an eating disorder 
All of that caused so much pain in my life so I turned to self harm and even drinking at 15 to 16.
When I got into Junior year I honestly had no hope, I planned on killing myself, November 1st of this year until one mistake changed my life.

I'm in the atc, I'm in the Ready Set Teach program to become a libarian (I thought of this as my last hope since my passion for reading was the only thing keeping me going) and my class was preparing it's students to be set off into an elementary or middle school to be an intern for their future career. I was the only Libarian in the classroom. The elementary I got placed in didn't have a libary where you could interact much with kids so the principal placed me in a 4th grade English class. Of course I was bummed but hey, what can you do? I introduced my self and for the first 6 weeks of working with those kids, it sparked something in me that I never knew I had- A love for teaching. I had a reason to wake up every morning and I had students who expected to see me! My suicidal thoughts became nothing but a distant memory and I started to enjoy life again.

I still intend to became a libarian but I do have to teach first to become a middle school libarian, so a win win! These kids really saved my life, and I've forever grateful to them :)"
z1mr1p,1,2022-11-22,Ive done it all,Loxotron7,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/z1mr1p/ive_done_it_all/,"As the title says I've done it all. In the last 2 years of my life I have set myself a light to achieve what even I thought was impossible, but I really did it. Day by day and little by little before my eyes, before I even had time to noticed as to me I was just functioning it all came together. Honestly it's only up from here. 

For context got a job and a field that normally requires a four-year degree minimum just to get an internship and you have to play the game of who knows who to even get the job normally. But I got it without a degree and no prior skills other than the skills I taught myself I put everything i had into getting this position. Now I am in a pivotal position for this company and there are very few companies that do what we do. I got to where I am today in only 2 years after setting my mind to this goal. Every other person doing what I do at the level that I do it at has around 4 to 6 years of experience and a bachelor's degree or Masters.

But that's just it, I don't feel like I've succeeded I don't feel like I've achieved anything I see there are people who have done better than me and those who have done worse and I've seen them all receive praise. yet it seems as though no matter how much I work, how much I do, how hard I push I am endlessly second fiddle. It feels as though it is really expected of me to endlessly work harder and achieve more than others with less than others while simultaneously being compensated and rewarded less than others.

I do have more goals and I will achieve them I know this. But is this feeling of a lack of success or maybe lack of pride in myself common? Is this normal for those who chase success with everything they have? Is there something I am not doing properly? What is missing?

I know I may come off as a cock in this but I always enjoy seeing others succeed before me and more than anything I love helping others succeed. I want to see the best out of everyone around me that makes me happier than anything that will always bring a smile to my face. I have been able to bring so many of my friends out of poverty because of what I've achieved and I am so glad I've been able to give them a chance to succeed in there own ways.

I suppose I merely tired I'm working so hard anyways my apologies for the rambling I know this may fall under the category of ""soap box"" so if fit please remove this. And apologies for the poor grammer it's late and I am tired.

In closing I suppose my real question here is as follows:

Is this normal to feel as though you have achieved nothing, feeling as though there's no future despite full well-knowing that if you keep pushing forward, of which I intend to do, that the rewards will be immense."

I applied ED to Northeastern and now am starting to wonder if that was the right choice. 

A lot of my peers, coaches, and even some teachers have essentially looked at me weird when I tell them I applied ED as my stats are above average for NEU at my high school. 

For reference here are a few of my stats: 
- 3.9 weighted GPA
- 9 APs
- 1410 SAT
- ISEF Delegate 
- 3 Research experiences, relating to Comp Sci, Comp Eng (at NEU), and Hyperbolic Geometry respectively 
- 3 Clubs I ran, one of them with a very wide impact on my school
- Captain of Mock Trial
- Yale Moot Court top speaker
- Small business owner
- Highly involved in raising my two younger siblings while my parents work
- First gen/ Low income
- A really great rec letter from my coach/ the person who I did the math internship under

Honestly I can’t tell if my stats are particularly competitive but i’ve been consistently told they are and can’t help but wonder if i’m selling myself short by closing off to just NEU. Also I am low income but my family owns the home that was passed on to them, which means the aid NEU gives me on their cost calculator really doesn’t cover enough + i’m not to sure how generous their merit aid is.

I don’t hate NEU, I am just nervous about future opportunities i’m missing out on. I’ve been thinking about just sucking it up and giving NEU a chance and then transferring if I don’t like it but I heard transferring is really hard. NEU allows people to switch to EA right now so i’m wondering should I do it? Do I have a chance at more competitive schools? 

Thank You!"
z1r1yh,7,2022-11-22,PhD application questions,radicch10,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/z1r1yh/phd_application_questions/,"Hello,

I'm a aspirant PhD student currently involved in the application processes. As today I got rejected for the 4th time (once I was shortlisted and then rejected, the other 3 times I was directly rejected), some question started to come up in my mind.

1. How am I supposed to learn from failed applications?

Feedbacks received (after weeks/months of waiting) are usually something like ""Your application process ends here"" or ""You have not been shortlisted for the above position, so you are not among the candidates selected for assessment"". Now, I'm not expecting ETH to give me a detailed explanation on why my application failed, but I find it difficult to understand what went wrong.

2) Does being a ""pure"" bioinformatician represent a disadvantage?

Most of the PhD vacancies under the search term ""bioinformatics"" or ""computational biology"" regard both dry &amp; wet lab tasks. As I pursued a purely computational path in my career and have no experience with the wet lab, the positions that really suits my CV are very limited.

3) How much value do recruiters give to publications?

I feel like candidates with a publication are pretty advantaged. Fair enough. However I think, *with due exceptions*, publishing during the bachelor's or master's years is more a matter of being in the right place at the right time rather than being a better PhD candidate.  Although my CV has some strengths (highest graduation score, some individual projects in the portfolio and period spent on a quite known institute as an intern), I do not currently have a publication.  Should I spend some time in a lab to get one and then go back to PhD applications?

4) Does the Motivational letter really matter? Do you have any tips on how to write a good one?

I thought this was the most important step. I try to apply some guidelines based on what I find on YouTube or blogs. For example I write a specific letter to the institute I am applying for, rather than having a standard motivational letter used multiple times. However, I am afraid that given these multiple rejections, my letters are missing something.

I think I need to change something with my applications, otherwise I'll keep getting rejected.

Note: I do not want this to be a complaint post, but I am genuinely trying to understand some of my doubts concerning the selection of PhD candidates."

Currently, I am a 4th year Computer Engineering student from Pam@nt@san ng Lungs0d ng M@ynil@ and I am looking for internship, I tried applying on some well-known company but I got rejected and it kind of discouraged me to apply further. I thought I must be doing something wrong. 

Tried P&amp;G, got rejected possibly because of their PEAK assessment; Globe, got rejected as well; Lazada, rejected; Shopee, got rejected here as well; Accenture, rejected, no available position daw, and some companies pa. Too many to mention. I looked around and it seemed like these well-known company are mostly accepting those in big 4 universities. 

Wala akong parents or any relatives that could help me about this because no one in my family are in professional field, and ang school namin ay not that ""hands on"", wala kaming list of partnered company for internship, more on kami ang responsible for our own internship company as long as it's not owned/related to one of us.

Since then, I could never get another sexual partner again. This gives me massive mood swings and more often I feel depressed than not. I'm highly confident, make friends with ease, have diverse interests - and yet, it's not enough. Apparently, I'm not enough to be desired.

My first sex was a casual one with a best friend - but my friend was too worried about how badly I wanted to do it again, and didn't want a second time. Beforehand, I had a girlfriend twice: for the first time, 4 years ago, it lasted a month and we didn't even kiss. The second time, 1.5 years ago, lasted 3 months. We made out a lot, but my girlfriend became slowly disengaged after I said her ""I love you"" at the 1.5 month mark, when I mistook passion for love.

I often feel worthless and inferior to all the people around me who are in relationships, committed or casual, or simply have casual encounters. They're often average-looking and yet they can do it. For me it's more about physical intimacy and desire than love right now. I don't care if it happens within a relationship or is casual, I simply long gave up on the hope of ever being loved. However, I want playful sex that stems out of desire, there's absolutely no way I'd have sex with a sex worker.

I used to be a socially withdrawn nerd with no friends 8 years ago and I slowly opened myself up. In particular, I started going to parties 1.5 years ago. I'm very intelligent and can hold conversations about a broad range of topics. I play the guitar. I'm average-looking and I have a very good job prospects as a software engineer. My hobbies, career, academic achievements, all come with ease. However, at the college I'm doing my degree the women are a minority, with most of them already being taken, so I try to look elsewhere. 

I have no social anxiety whatsoever. I had no problem joining a group of complete who were partying, and they liked it enough to offer me a joint they were smoking. I make friends with ease, but this doesn't help me with dating whatsoever. 

I initiate conversations with girls in many different places: on the street, in the supermarket, on a train or a bus, during gigs or  - whenever it feels natural. For the last 8 months, I talked to hundreds of girls. Quite often, the conversation flows very nicely. Sometimes I impress them with my intelligence or wit. At the end I share the intent of meeting up for a coffee or wine. I get her phone number, and this is where the good things end. We say goodbye... and usually I end up being ghosted.

A few times the girl would text back, but I'd get a date only twice, at the end of June, just before leaving for a 3-month internship at a prestigious company abroad, and ended up getting ghosted during the summer. I kissed a girl I met online, with whom we barely had anything to talk about, and this didn't really survive the summer either.

Online dating doesn't work. I get a few matches for the first week or two and nothing afterwards.

I feel I'm fundamentally broken. I feel like garbage, I don't believe I'll ever going to feel physically desired again. Like a matrimonial waste no woman would want. Good enough for being friends, not good enough to be sexual with."

I'm (24F) currently thinking of moving to live on campus to do my masters full time. I have saved almost \~100K (55K in savings and 40K in investments) from working a few years in my field and living at home after graduating from my undergrad. My original plan was to move out of home and experience living on campus for a year and come back home or move into a cheaper rental. I live relatively close to my university (1 hr by train and 30-40\~ mins by car) but the reason for the move was a combination of mental health, independence, and to fully focus on myself. I have a decent relationship with my parents but it has been a struggle for my mental health since starting full time work.  I will be made redundant from my work soon and I thought this was the best time to fully commit to my masters full time (I also found an internship on campus for my field). 

However, after talking to a few friends and family (50% say go for it and 50% say live with your parents), I worry that living on campus will hit a huge dent on my savings, especially since I won't have a job. Calculating all my costs, rent (inclusive of several meals, wifi, gym etc) will be around 19K (studio room, so I will have my own kitchen and bathroom), additional costs such as food, entertainment, buying a new laptop, invisalign would be around 10K. So all up I will probably spend around 30K for just one year. 

Keeping this into account, I feel like I still will have a sizeable chunk of my savings after I move back into my parents and once I start a new job after finishing my masters, I would be able to save quite abit and built it back up and have a good deposit for a house with stable income for repayments. 

I guess the biggest worry are the financial costs worth it for a year (im leaning towards my original plan...I'm a pretty frugal person, I don't have a car, my biggest purchase would probably be food)? Any advice would be appreciated!!"

**Coursework:** All AP's/Preap's or Honors, College Courses (community/state colleges). As for AP courses, I have a 4 in APWH, 4 in APCSA, 5 in APCSP. I probably would've benefitted from not taking the hardest classes possible, but it is what it is lol.

**Extracurriculars:** Varsity on Mountain Biking Team, Varsity on Debate Team. I was accepted into my school's professional studies branch for technology which meets at a separate building. Not sure how to describe it. Also, National Honors Society.

Unpaid internship with largest company on earth (don't want to name name's here but you can probably guess lol)

I've worked for a grocery store and an ice-cream store over several summers.

I know Python, Java, Unity, Godot, basic Electronic Theory, and some C++. I started when I was 13. I used to build robots and projects in my free time, but I no longer have free time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I can get pretty good LOR's. Teachers like me. According to my English teachers, I'm very good at essays. (Also, I write dozens of speeches yearly for debate so that helps with my writing)

**Schools:** Worchester Polytechnic Institute. 

I'm considering taking a gap-year to travel abroad using my grocery-store-money. If I do, I'd apply for colleges with my senior-year GPA, which would be 3.73 (Not made-up: I use a google sheet that allows me to predict/calculate my GPA). I want to see the world. (Not tourist places. Slums, nature in the middle of nowhere, and dangerous places.) I might join an international volunteering organization. We'll see.

this",throwaway_sunrays,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/z1wcwc/big_messy_story_would_be_nice_if_someone_could/,"im gonna post a big rant here, i hope its okay. im f22 and i have a boyfriend for over a year now. when i was 15 i had my first relationship with someone i didnt love, i was just happy someone wanted to be with me. it was nice the first few months, after that it turned out very toxic and i didnt have the courage to break up until after 4 years. 2 years later i became close to my current boyfriend and i really thought he was very genuine and meant what he said but it turned out that he is not good for me either. hes just stopped being nice to me at all since february gaslighting me that its just all in my head which i believed at first because im very insecure and been going thru a hard time. he lives in a different country (netherlands) so our plan was to move together during my internship in his country which i did, even tho things were going bad between us. a while before my internship would start in summer i went to see him for a weekend to see if its still worth going thru this so i came to visit with the thought of ""either he says he still loves me or we break up and i kms"" which i guess sounds pretty stupid but i was pretty tired of it all already by then. we had that weird talk in his car and he started getting really emotinal and said he doesnt wanna break up so i thought its still worth trying to get things right again but he just treats me like i dont exist and every single rare occassion i come to tell him something hes so insanely annoyed and i cant open up to him about anything because he gets so visibly upset and completely shuts down trying to avoid every issue with just saying ""i dont know"" or ""nothings wrong"". i planned to suicide a few weeks before my internship started in his country but i chickened out and called the ambulance so since then i was under emergency counseling and about to get an intake for therapy which had to be cancelled because my insurance doesnt cover this expenses abroad and i got declined for a health insurance here. the counseling is going to cost me a lot of money as well because i have to pay it myself. my boyfriend doesnt care im suicidal, hes cried in front of the nurses saying he didnt know and when he drove me home hes just been too bothered because i was distracting him from playing his online games. in august an online friend came to the netherlands for vacation which was a surprise and i was happy to meet him and meeting him was really such a great time which i didnt have for a long time. since then we've become really close friends which we weren't before and hes helped me go thru all this bullshit and helped me realize that i deserve more than what my boyfriend is doing to me and that i need to leave so ive been looking for rooms to move out into so i can break up and close this chapter but the country is in a housing crisis. being stupid and all, this friend and me got really close and i fell in love with him and he with me, hes come to visit the netherlands several times to see me and ive never felt this close with anyone before and it just felt so good to be understood and held when i was crying and just losing my mind but still talking to someone who has his feet on the ground. im a horrible person for cheating on my boyfriend and still living a his house with his mom, he doesnt know ive met him. my friend also guaranteed me hed never hurt me the same way as my boyfriend did and i believed him because he just always seemed so genuine and im such an idiot. now im here in his country visiting him for the second time whereas i meant to just visit for the weekend and now i got covid and have to stay longer and i feel that hes maybe not serious either. hes doing similiar things as my boyfriend now, playing online games perma saying hes busy, being physically distant very much which is usually not common for him at all but i guess he does like it when i sexually please him then he seems happy. when i turned to him yesterday saying ive been thinking for a while being worried about certain things between us he says im just imagining things, things that we used to talk about so much now seems like he doesnt want to anymore at all like hes changed his mind, we used to chat and cam everyday all day and it was normal and it just stopped completely and im such an idiot for always getting myself so attached to the simplest kindness. he knows im suicidal, its because of him im not been trying, god he was crying because he really didnt want me to and hugged me really tight and ive never had anyone care so much about me before. but ive decided that i cant take this anymore. ive got attached again and im living with the consequenses of it again and im too tired to be hurt and hurting myself all over again. theres so much to this which i cant put to words and this is kind of such a fucked up situation now so i dont expect anyone to understand but i just really needed to let this out because im sad and scared and im just so fucking scared. im planning on drowning myself like ive wanted to in summer but i dont know if i should say goodbye to anyone, leave a note or just leave for the better. if i should do this here at my friends country or if i should go back to the netherlands first and drown myself there. i really dont know what to do. going back home to germany i wont be able to get to therapy because i will just be put on an endless waiting list again. i have a really bad relation to my family and my home in general and i was so happy to move away from there technically but now everything is just a living hell. im hopeless. im not loveable. i dont want this anymore. every choice i make in life just fucks me so bad. every person i meet just ends up leaving me or hurting me. and im the worst because i am hurting everyone in my life as well. i got nothing good to me. people say and think im nice and cute but thats it, then they see im a fucking mess which im not even hiding, everyone knows, but they just commit and leave me hanging in the worst way possible without any notice whatsoever. i dont mind being thrown away, it just hurts no one tells me their feelings have changed, that they dont want this anymore. ive got no one anymore. quite literally. id rather die than be alone. ive tried going under people but its so exhausting and im so not normal i dont fit in with anyone no matter how hard i try."
z1x25j,13,2022-11-22,"Want to move on, not sure if I should",CherryPieAppleSauce,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/z1x25j/want_to_move_on_not_sure_if_i_should/,"I work for my Moms business - I know that makes me a pariah in this sub because of nepotism. I joined because I felt it would be the best fit for me after working retail through HS. I interviewed for an internship, and alongside working I went to College, got student loans up to my eyeballs and learnt everything from the ground up to reach where I am. Which apparently is nowhere.

I am now in senior management after getting my Post grad degree, 10 years later and I am constantly fighting the board for better pay and benefits for all staff, at least an increase in line with inflation. 

My mom however, runs the business like its still 2002, I truly think she believes her staff are blessed she employed them, I'm on the other side of the coin, I feel she's lucky to have them.

However, my brother joined the company 2 years ago. He is an example of nepotism, dropped out of HS at 15, did nothing but game and gym for 3 years, then joined with no HS diploma at 18 because he couldn't get a job elsewhere.

My brother is now 20, he earns a minimum of $1000 a month in commission plus his basic because my mom gave him the easiest sales job in the office (b2b selling at discounted prices to established long term customers). 

I am the operations director, with a masters degree and am on a big fat $15.50 an hour, no commission, no bonus. The average salary for my role in my state is $67k, and a senior HR executive with my education is between $80-110k, so I am at a minimum on a salary half of expected, and almost 4x smaller at the higher end.

I originally accepted this because my mom claims the business will be mine when she retires, if i can wait a few more years, she claims she only has 3 more years till she'll go, but she's already said that for 5. 

""Wait and it will come.""

My brother recently decided he wants to set up ""on his own"", buying our stock at discount and retailing it out. My mom has offered him payment terms in the company to do so, essentially that he doesn't need to pay us, until he's sold his stock.

I spoke to my mother, asking if once he leaves, I would be able to take over the role in sales on top of my duties, the role essentially sells itself because the prices are unbeatable. 

With the cost of living increasing, My husband and I are struggling to afford our mortgage and bills because my wage has been stagnated for so long (no pay rise for 6 years now) on the promise of the future.

I've set up an etsy shop and am actively applying to work in warehouses and as weekend admin for small companies just to get something in - Apparently I'm over qualified for that so I'm not doing well.

My mom said yes, so I told him a few days later. 

He became silent and was tapping on his phone, then walked out fast. A few minutes later he stormed back in and in front of our office declared he had spoken to ""Karen"" and he would be keeping his sales line to continue earning his commissions despite his leaving. 

It was embarrassing for me and awkward for everybody, the manufacturing team were looking forward to him leaving because he's entitled and doesn't listen to his superiors because ""Mom told me I can do this"" they were looking forward to the new relationship we were going to have working together because I am a long established manager and don't do nonsense and excuses. 

She chose him, to keep him happy despite him leaving.

I don't know if I'm even allowed to be angry at the obvious nepotism and favoritism shown  at that choice because I think it makes me a hypocrite, despite my mom not helping me in any way to get my education and experience. 

**If anything, she's been a block at every opportunity because ""I can't be seen to have favorites"" - I have learnt she can, I've just never been hers.** 

I'm now looking to leave, I don't know if it's the right move because I feel in my heart I should be here and I could do better with this company and it's staff *if* I do take over. 

I would find out what they need to be happier in their jobs because I am so miserable and worried about money and just want somebody to listen to me who is willing to make a change. I *want* to be that person and keep this business growing and I've proven I can do that.

However, I have no written guarantee that will happen. 

She *could* leave it to me, she could leave it to my brother or just sell and then I've wasted a decade being underpaid because of who I am when I could earn my worth elsewhere with no ties to the top blocking me.

I can't complain too openly at work because I'm her daughter and people think I'm on more than I am so who would I be to moan? 

I do our pay roll, I'm on the least of all senior management by half despite being better educated with more experience in our sector. My wage is the same level as the accounts clerks, who i still think are underpaid for their role.

I am the company idiot and I'm being made aware of it more every day.

I look like the complaining sister but it's about more than that, if i wasn't related it would be equally as aggravating. 

My colleagues complain about the obvious favoritism all the time - 4 members of staff have resigned since he began stating his attitude as the reason.

I'll put it another way:

My boss's son has left the company, but is still being paid $1000 a month in commission to keep a sales line that could be redistributed to other staff members because she doesn't want *him* to suffer.

I'm angry and can't talk about it because of my relation to the CEO. We barely talk outside of the office now, I've lost my Mom to my boss.

I know the specifics likely wont be the same but, has anybody else dealt with a similar situation, and what did you do?

I need validation that I'd be right to run away."

I am 26 with basically no qualifications. I did a workforce development program that was 6 months curriculum and 6 months internship. I interned in a big company and have stayed there since (as a contractor and recently an employee)

I know for a fact I am not qualified enough for this position. I don't understand anything and I am clueless when it comes to IT. In fact, I never liked being in IT. However it does pay well.

I am constantly afraid I will lose my job. My manager and director are very demanding and this is stressing me out so much. Today I just felt like crying because I tried explaining what I was doing but kept getting interrupted and being implied that I wasn't giving enough information.

My question is.. if you ever hated being in IT, were you able to manage and get through it in your career? How were you able to manage?

I feel like 3 years of my career have been wasted since I have no qualifications that will allow me to get another job if I lose this one."

I've been fortunate enough to get numerous offers this season, nothing crazy but just one is more than enough. However, there are two competitive offers where I am having trouble deciding which path to go. FYI I live in Houston TX.

Walmart: 115k salary, 15k taxable signing bonus, 15k in RSUs, various other benefits, however I'd have to move to Sunnyvale,  California from Houston. The cost of everything is gonna be a lot higher than Houston, but I feel like the Walmart name could be worth it. My job title at Walmart is as a SWE, so it seems the job will be more explicitly software engineering. However, moving to a new city where I don't know anyone is a bit scary, especially an expensive one. Being close to the Bay Area is a benefit as well, with the number of large companies in the area.

Local Company: 85k salary, no signing bonus or RSUs. The benefits are that the company is based in Houston, with the office being literally 20 minutes from my house. I'd be able to save lots of money on rent staying at my parents, and the cost of everything is lower in general. I'd be able to stay with my friends and family. My role is a Technology Anaylst, but this company has a rotational program where I'd work with different fields over the course of a couple years and see what I enjoy. I've also had friends intern at this company, and they loved it there.

I'm really torn on this decision, as I think the Walmart name could be a big boost for my resume and future career. At the same time,  I love my friends and family, and I don't know how I'd adjust moving to a new city, considering I'm more introverted. I'd like to hear y'alls opinions and see what y'all are thinking. If there's more information I could/should provide, let me know.

After the internship ended, I was offered a position at a new location because management thought well of me. My friend didn’t receive the same offer, and they also refused to be her referral for future opportunities because they were not satisfied with her attitude and performance.  

My employer is really close to me, so she gives me tips on how to get promoted, how to get a referral, and a lot of career-related advice. Knowing I am close to my best friend, my employer told me I could share those advice so that she can be successful, too. 

My friend told me before that she worried about finding a job after graduation because she lacked work experience, and her degree is not a practical one. 

I was eager to help her, so I gave her advice on how she can improve her performance, attitude and work relationships. She got offended and really stressed out after I talked to her. I realized that I was wrong for giving unsolicited advice and apologized immediately. I apologized several times after, which she said it was fine. But for months now, she refuses to hangout with me and we don’t talk as much anymore. 

This was the first time we ever fought and the first time I ever gave her advice on work. She’s older than me so I’ve always been the recipient of advice in our friendship. I felt thankful towards her, so I thought it was my turn to help her now. I wanted us to succeed together.

I went through a lot as a kid, so when I met her I was so grateful. I had always been really careful to cherish her, be gentle in the way I talk to her and be supportive of her. This is the first time I ever hurt her, and I apologized several times. 

Even though I was in the wrong, I can’t help but feel a bit disappointed that she has ghosted me. I’m not sure what to think or do. Will she ever forgive me? Should I reach out and apologize again?"

z20158,1,2022-11-22,Should I pursue Nursing or a Tech internship?,InfamousToast93,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/z20158/should_i_pursue_nursing_or_a_tech_internship/,"
[29 yr old M] I am in a process of being selected for an IBM internship as an application developer apprentice. My friend did this before and it worked out well for him. Although he was a few years younger than me. 

I am also currently working as a dialysis tech for a company who is willing to put me through nursing school. (I just started). My other friend is a clinic manager and has always spoken highly of the company. Employees have been here for years and they all seem to really like it. 

So I am at a crossroad of opportunity and I am not sure which one I should take. Am I too old for tech? I know everyone says nursing is horrible right now, but these nurses seem to be happy? Is an internship in tech worth more than a BSN degree paid for? 

Pay isn’t too different. Where I am located, programmers make anywhere from 60k-150k depending on experience obviously. Nurses start around 70k with the regular 40 hours and the mangers start at around 85k and get raises each year with the ability to promote even higher. Yes, the nurses work anywhere from 30-40 hours a week. No, they do not have to do overtime unless they want to and if its even available.  

My background is fire and EMS, and tech was a hobby for me. There are pros and cons for each. 

Main pro for programming is WLB and no patients. Main con is I’m not in a very tech rich job market and I’m scared I would become very lazy with a mentally challenging engineering job and do nothing but veg out after sitting and thinking all day. 

For nursing main pro is I get a free degree and I have the opportunity to work for a very good company. I also will have a 3-4 days of 10 hour work schedule and be considered full time with benefits. Con is the patients lives are in my hands, and healthcare can be draining. 

I’d love any feedback you guys have for me. Thanks!"
z20io9,1,2022-11-22,Group that excludes me suddenly wants me to make food for their potluck lunch,LukeFloof,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/z20io9/group_that_excludes_me_suddenly_wants_me_to_make/,"I'm a 26 yo woman at work and it's a company where most people are in their mid 30s and upwards. I thought it would be easier to gel with these people than people at my old company where people are getting ready to retire.

Apparently not.

These people STILL think they're more mature and experienced than me, so they treat me like some intern.

During lunches, I used to go around calling people (mostly the ladies around my space) for lunch because I knew I had to make the first step to getting them to include me. But they started going for lunch without me. I once pointed it out and someone said, ""Oh that's because you went for market visits for months on end and weren't in office. People forgot about you."" Ouch. Good to know I am ""forgotten"" because I'm doing my job.

So slowly I stopped calling those people who excluded me. Anyway the conversations were about kids and diets and exercises for back pain. I don't mind. It's not like I didn't have other friends. And I don't mind eating alone either, as long as I have my phone to read from.

Today, I kept my food on a table in the cafeteria, went to wash my hands and came back to see these ladies at my table. They probably didn't know it was my table. They would've eaten elsewhere had they known. I know this because whenever I'm in the cafeteria, even with someone else they're ok with, they avoid my table. Even if the other person invites them to sit with us, they say there are too many of them. The other person tells them to pull up some chairs. They still refuse.

Today, I was annoyed because I got to know right off the bat that me and another woman my age were both not on this group chat that was meant for ""all the ladies of the organization"". Again, good to know I'm not their favorite. Yay. Oh they actually pointed it out too. ""Oh you're not on this group? But ABC made it. You talk to ABC? Then why didn't she add you? Oh must be because you're not good enough friends with her. You're fake friends.""

Then I was dragged into another mindless conversation about diets when this other lady joins the table and they're suddenly discussing a potluck lunch. Apparently it's her and another lady's birthday on the same day and they're celebrating. Suddenly, this lady points at me and goes, ""You bring rotis!""

So I'm Indian and my parents live with me. My mom cooks for me because I don't get time in the morning. I never ask her to make anything difficult for me because I think it's inconvenient for her, especially when she hates cooking. She has always followed a routine for cooking ever since I was a kid. And making rotis is tough. And these people have dumb standards about rotis that I know neither me nor my mom could give a rat's ass about. I am not about to ask my mom to wake up early to make n number of rotis just to get them criticized for having a little bit too much of flour dusting on them or whatever.

The bigger thing is, I know that come this Friday, if I bring a buttload of rotis to office, they're going to eat them. But that's it. It doesn't guarantee a better treatment for me. They'll go back to ignoring me, excluding me at lunch, excluding me from group chats and everything. I know this isn't going to make a difference. Fuck, when I heard this lady say this to me, the first thing that came to my mind was, ""Do you even know my name?"" That's how much they don't involve me in their little chats. And honestly? All these rotis just to get an entry into their boring world of, ""What did you put in this curry? It's out of this world!"" and ""So I sit up everyday after waking up and stretch"" isn't worth it, even if they make me feel like it is.

I cried today because of this and I already detest that I cried. I shouldn't be worrying myself about these dumb things! I've gone through worse at my previous organization. Actual issues that these softies wouldn't last a day of. And I'm crying because of these snobby women trying to emulate socialites?

I'm sure one day in the future,  I'll be laughing at how I cried about some stupid lunch table group. But right now, I just feel like shit just because I'm different from everyone else. I don't know how to bridge the gap. Like I don't even know what I did wrong in the first place. Because I used to be so chatty, used to ask questions and engage in the conversations. Apparently that's not enough."

All throughout middle school and highschool, we would have screaming fights about everything from what time I wanted to go to school, to what I'm wearing, to what instrument I want to play in band class. She could not fathom the idea of me deciding things for myself, even if it was just what instrument I wanted to play. Everything had to be her decision and everyone else's decision was mediocre at best in her eyes. When I was in 6th grade, I wanted to go to school 20 minutes before bell time because I wanted to have breakfast with my friends. She could not process this small act of independence. She screamed at me telling me that I was ""going to grow up a prostitute and a drug dealer."" All this anger because I wanted to have breakfast with my friends in school at 11 years old.

Come college and I got an invitation to go to a top university in my state. The only problem was, it was about 5 hours away from where we lived. Both my parents had extreme separation anxiety. Anything that did not involve them was subject to scrutiny, doubt, and suspicion. So naturally, I was forbidden to even entertain the thought of going to a university that was more than an hour away from home. I had to settle for a state university about 15 minutes from where we lived and this is when my career problems began.

Before I go into the meat and potatoes, I'd like to give you a bit of background. My dad was able to succesfully work in the US and gradually started making more and more money as the years went on. My mother, however, had extreme difficulty finding a job. Mainly because she was so concerned with the reputation of that job and the bragging rights that it hold. It felt as if she would much rather do nothing than work a job she could not brag about to her friends and other family members. Because of this, we were poor. I was fine not having the trendiest clothes or a nice expensive backpack, but my mother was not. I would hear her long for a ""coach bag"" every time we would go to the mall. Every single day she would tell me how she couldn't wait for the day I would become a ""pharmacist just like your cousin"" and make 6 figures so that I could ""buy her any purse she wanted at Macy's."" I heard this constantly growing up. From when I was 11 years old all the way to 18 as I entered college.

Any aspiration that I had was stomped on hard during this time of my life. I wanted to major in the sciences and become a professor, but this was not good enough for my mother. She said that it took too long and she believed there is no money in academia. We would have screaming fights about what classes I should take even for my GED classes. Any elective classes I took was subject to her intense scrutiny and doubt. She believed I was lying about what time my classes ended. She had absolutely no trust in me.  I graduated college with a science degree but average grades. Luckily enough, I got accepted to a post-graduate program that is related to the medical field. Not pharmacy, but enough to calm down my mother during this time. I graduated from said post-graduate university with average grades. I had no drive. No personality. My only personality was to appease my mother and avoid her wrath.

After graduation, I said enough was enough. I studied for exams and did a lot of volunteer work to make my resume look better. I applied for internships all over the place and landed one far away from where we lived. At this point, my mother was showing  a lot of doubt and suspicion because many of the choices that I was making was without her. After hearing that I accepted this internship that was far away, she was in full blown wrath. She made it clear to me that she thought I was lying about getting accepted. I was so angry at this accusation that I told her ""okay well I emailed them telling them that I no longer want the internship."" (which was a lie. I only said it at the heat of the moment). After I said this, she exploded. ""How dare you do that to me. Don't you ever do that to me.""  She even tried to take credit for my success in college and post-graduate school. At this point, I exploded as well. I told her everything that I have felt throughout my time in highschool and beyond. How the only reason why I'm in this career, was to please her. How she always questioned everything that I'm doing. How just 5 minutes ago, she expressed doubt about the validity of my internship. She, of course, denied everything that I said and claimed not to remember ANYTHING about doubting me. For the first time, my father stood up for me and took my side, which was surprising.

This happened yesterday. My internship is still going to happen. For the first time, I have my own drive, my own goals, and my own truth. I want my truth to shine, even with all of its flaws. For the first time, I no longer feared her."
z20pef,2,2022-11-22,Am I doing a mistake by selecting a startup instead of corporate?,hopeful_dandelion,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/z20pef/am_i_doing_a_mistake_by_selecting_a_startup/,"The scenario: 
I got offer from a automotive company which makes embedded systems for vehicles. 

I also got a PPO from startup where I worked as an interns and apparently did a really great job that they offered me EESOPs. The startup is really close to launching a product, and have made some pretty insane breakthroughs in medical embedded systems. 


The facts I have no guidance about:

Is it advisable to work at a startup, instead of an established company right after college?

What will be my stand if I leave the startup after a year, vs if I leave the big company?

Should I go with stable income at corporate, or risky time investment in startup?



What I feel : 

I feel I am still young(22) and can take risks which I wont be able to take after in my career. I am all in for startup, but my friends and family are concerned that I am making a bad decision, and stable high pay should be priority. 
Corporates come with politics, which I hate, and dread the most. I CANNOT in any way be a kiss ass or talk my way through the levels. 
Apart from that, hands on, learning, and all is fine. I am fine with all. 


I would really love to hear thoughts of you guys who have been through such crossroads. Do you regret any of the choices you made? Coz i feel like i will regret if I took the high pay automotive job and let go the startup."

It is a mandatory internship term. I feel so hopeless. Even before I got the offer I would get so anxious while applying because I always feel under-qualified. It doesn’t help that I also tested positive for Covid today and felt like shit all day already.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice is appreciated.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has encouraged me to still keep an optimistic outlook. I have been unable to reply because I’ve been extremely sick. As advised by many here, I’m trying not to take on too much stress.

As for choosing a crypto startup, it was a difficult situation, this is my first internship and I wasn’t getting many interviews so I applied to as many places as I could. My school makes it mandatory to accept once you get an offer. I am also international and a little financially distressed so I can’t be too picky. I suppose I should look at it as a learning experience. 
Life can be unfair and setbacks like this will continue to happen but I get to decide whether I give up or take what I’ve learned from them and continue trying."

Pros

I know there's pros and cons for each, but the main reason I've been thinking about Java is just because there's so many resources. I know there's a really great DSA course that's made by Princeton that is taught in Java, and also Cracking the Coding Interview is also in Java. Obviously Python is also a good choice because the syntax is so simple, but I'm just not sure. The idea of having complete resources for Java is really enticing to me, and I'm not able to find other resource that are as comprehensive for Python.

20F. I quitted my full time job 1 month ago, even though I am currently ""living the life"" being at home everyday working on my hobbies/side jobs. Despite that, situations keep popping up in my brain and I still find myself very angry and hurt by the people from my ex company. 

Some context:
I converted from intern to full time in a creative agency. Internship was not bad and I actually left on a good note and grades, mostly cuz i stuck to my mentor during it. It was only until full time where people show their true colours. An example is the mentor and a suck up playing office politics, where they bring down people to climb the ladder. An incident was when my ""Mentor"" told my close colleague gossip and when I confronted him (because they said communication is key) he act blur say ""where got? Got meh?"" In which afterwards he sent a long paragraph to my colleague saying she tryna stir gossip by telling me what he say. I did bring this up to my boss in a talk afterwards but she told me im ""victimising myself"".

Things went downhill when I failed my probation and my boss thought I was against them, since I asked the other bosses out for lunch to seek opinions (as I worked with them more). During the talk she kept making blown-out of proportion accusations and I felt very wronged. I tried to reason with her but she kept putting me down, insisting on her narrative. Since this was my 1st job, I thought failing probation was a pretty big deal and felt really disappointed.The next week she called me, and a bunch of other colleagues upstairs where she screamed at me such that other colleagues downstairs could hear. I felt very embarassed. Afterwards I chatted with my close colleague and did decide to work harder to make them proud. However, shit just kept getting absolutely worse from there. I felt absolutely burnt out as I OT everyday, some days till 5am. (No OT pay though) They sensed that I ""wasnt happy"" and kept assuming shit based of it even though I just want to do my work and go home. I once had a meltdown and one of the bosses asked ""i dont get why you are so burnt out"" and compared me to another co worker which was damn fucking irritating as its not a competition.

The rest of my time there was just being screamed at and gaslighted. It took me a month after leaving this toxic workplace when I realised how fucked up some things are. Phrases that came out of her mouth like ""why are you so sensitive?"" ""Get over it"" ""im getting the impression you are victimising yourself"" ""you are being toxic"" ""dont go around telling people [ex company] is a shit company"" I WAS JUST A 19 YEAR OLD WORKER, THE LOWEST OF THE FRY! I actually doubted myself many times. I now learnt that these are textbook signs of gaslighting. Of course I screw up from time to time, but if they keep screaming and blowing up matters, it really takes a toll.

My mental health was the worst during those months and everyday otw to work I thought how nice would it be to be banged by a car with many intrusive suicidal thoughts. The only people who kept me going are my colleagues and some of the projects. Sometimes took up to 5 xanax a day to prevent breakdowns.

Anyways a month has passed by and I still feel intense resentment towards them which I know I should get over. It just sucks that there are so many things I want to say but will never get across to them. This will never work against narcissists. As much as I hate them for this, there are still good parts such as learning lots about the industry and I appreciate my intern days and the chance for a full time job.

If you read till the end, really appreciate it. I just need to rant

TLDR- 20F, Still feeling angry from 1st job (converted from intern) after quitting a month ago. Boss kept screaming, there are many office politics and gaslighting which I only realised how fucked up some of the situations were 1 month later. Now I feel very resentful and hurt by the people there which I know is not worth and just needed to rant."
z27bvq,1,2022-11-22,Interning in a field you don't want a career in while your career path is still undecided. As bad as it may seem? (Finding Your Path),UnwrappedGlacier,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z27bvq/interning_in_a_field_you_dont_want_a_career_in/,"**tldr:** title (the post is long, but might be worth the read idk)

Potentially a stupid question but before you comment, here's some background info: I'm 22 and studying computer science at a small, in-state school in the US. I'm a community college transfer who's technically just a junior and I should be graduating in the Spring of '24, although I still don't know what I want to do with my comp sci degree after I graduate.

Regardless, though, I've been looking into doing an internships next year. In spite of my school's size and location, I surprisingly found that there are a number of internships available in my state for two game development studios (both big studios).

While game development is a hobby of mine, I've long dismissed the idea of working in the game dev field as a career. Imo the crunch culture + bad hours for not as great of a paycheck as one can get elsewhere doesn't seem worth it to me. Furthermore, being a woman and queer, I kinda have apprehensions about the game dev field as a whole (and stories like with Blizzard certainly don't help any).

At the same time though, the other internships I'm coming across are either A) not in my state (and idk how I would feel doing a 100% remote internship), B) Requiring a MA/PhD, or C) are in fields that I have less of an interest in than game dev (namely web dev).

Here's my thought process: While I don't want to work in the game dev field, these internships either use C++ or Python, both of which I like, am familiar with, and would love to work with in the future. On top of this, my thinking is that, because I still am interested in game development as a hobby, maybe I'll still get something out of it. Does anyone know though if experience such as this is worthless to a company in another field (like data analysis or ai/ml) or is any experience (significantly) better than nothing?

Furthermore, is game development as bad as it seems? Is working on the engine side of things (which all the internships for these companies are) ""better"" than working on games themselves?

Any tips about finding your path in general would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

To answer any potential follow up questions, I have a small interest in AI/ML from getting into AI text adventures over quarantine which is another field I'm considering, but afaik I would need a masters or phd to go into this field (in fact, even just to intern in this field) and while I *am* considering it, due to me having a not-so-good home life, I'm rather eager to get out on my own already (as you might imagine)."

I applied ED to NEU because frankly I thought it was the best school I could get into. Now I am being told by my peers and even a few adults in my life that my choice may have been a mistake- they say I could’ve “done better”.

 Thankfully NEU allows you to switch from ED to EA but only for a short period of time. 

My intended major I put for NEU was CS and Criminal Justice, I’d like to do something similar for other schools. I know Cornell has something similar (that’s a school i’d be quite interested in).

I am really really really struggling with getting a sense of what schools I could get into. I like NEU but frankly it’s really the only school i’ve gone to in person and again is the top school I’ve been assuming would accept me, so my question is should I switch to EA for NEU and apply to “better” schools? Could I even get in? 

Here are my stats for reference:
- 3.9 weighted GPA (I think like top 25% at my school)
- 9 APs (Highest Rigor in my high school)
- 1410 SAT 
- ISEF Delegate 
- 3 Research experiences, relating to Comp Sci, Comp Eng (at NEU), and Hyperbolic Geometry respectively 
- 3 Clubs I ran, one of them with a very wide impact on my school (guest speakers that came included two state reps) 
- Captain of Mock Trial for 3 years
- National Yale Moot Court top speaker
- Small business owner (sustainable fashion, 10% of proceeds go to the autism science foundation)
- Was student council president and was a student rep for my schools hiring committee 
- Highly involved in raising my two younger siblings while my parents work (including my brother with autism)
- First gen/ Low income 
- A really great rec letter from my coach/ the person who I did the math internship under
- My essay uses the a metaphor regarding the game Chutes and Ladders, the game I recall playing in the doctors office when my brother got diagnosed with autism. I talk about how my brother has shaped me and how I've he has indirectly taught me things that gave me the privilege to climb ""up ladders"" and also how I've overcome going ""down chutes"" throughout my life- I tied the essay with my love for math and STEM. 

Any and all advice is highly appreciated 

Thank You."

Intended major(s): International Relations/Studies &amp; potentially East Asian Studies/Lang &amp; Lit (Japanese emphasis)

Standardized tests: 1470 October SAT (770 verbal, 700 math), probs retaking in March to try for 1500+. I’ll take the ACT in March as well - I’m not a fast worker and I’m not great at the science section, so I anticipate that the SAT will be my main test.

GPA: My school uses a weird scale that gives me close to a 5.0. But based on the CollegeBoard website’s (unweighted) scale, I have around a 3.9 - mostly As, some A-’s. Have maintained all A’s so far as a junior. A B+ from middle school will show up on my transcript, but it’s not counted toward my GPA. I have no estimation of my class rank.

Course rigor: I was in standard biology (as opposed to honors) my freshman year; aside from that, I’ve taken the most rigorous courses available to me. Honors geometry, honors English, honors world history, and honors Spanish II freshman year; honors chem, honors Algebra II, honors English, honors Spanish III, and AP Euro (one of six in my class of \~70 nominated to take Euro) my sophomore year; AP Lang, APUSH, AP Chem, honors precalc, and honors Spanish IV my junior year. 

ECs: 

\- Attended a very selective 5-week leadership program last summer

\- Peer mentor student leader 

\- Co-president of Sexuality &amp; Gender Alliance and Politics &amp; Ethics Club

\- Editor-in-chief of the school newspaper

\- Gold medal on the National Spanish Exam consecutively from 7th to 11th grade

\- Self-studying AP Comp Gov &amp; Japanese w/ a 670-day Duolingo streak (as of Nov 22, 2022) 

\- Choir and track all throughout high school (though I’m not super skilled at either)

\- National Honor Society

\- Eagle Scout (finished shortly after 8th grade - led a historical preservation project that involved 100+ service hours)

\- Participating in my school’s Public Policy &amp; Social Change capstone program and will present a research presentation on a topic my senior year

\- Helped plan an 8-hour charity event last year - I applied for a leadership position in the smaller event this year and have not heard back yet. Definitely plan to apply next year, too

\- Applied for a selective Japanese studies intensive course through Stanford that, if admitted, I’d do second semester. Am also hoping to do a selective summer fellowship in Japan in 2023

School Preferences:

\- I’m gay, so any school with a homophobic/otherwise conservative reputation is off-the-table. Especially with my interests in mind, I feel like this list is small and shrinking

\- To date, I’ve visited Georgetown, GW, WashU, and UPenn. Georgetown felt rather dreary, but the weather sucked and my first college visit was a bit of a sensory overload. Would’ve preferred a more defined campus, but I got all-around great vibes from GW. WashU had nice architecture and very nice people but just felt mid, especially since the PNP major does not interest me. (It’s also in mf St. Louis.) UPenn was fantastic - near-perfect campus, location, size, and academics. Student culture seemed not ideal but manageable.

\- I’ll probably apply to U of SC and its honors college, but I generally want to leave SC. Happy to go far away from home.

\- Exceptionally small (&lt;2000 students) colleges are not preferred. Medium-size schools are ideal, but any size is okay if the school is strong enough otherwise

\- I cannot stand brutalism but I can sigh and endure it if the school can make up for it otherwise. Gothic architecture is a plus

\- A defined campus in an urban area is ideal

\- Greek life predominating campus is a BIG turn-off

\- Qualified and impressive faculty who also form relationships w/ students (really liked this about Penn)

\- Ample research opportunities for social science undergraduates

\- Props to all STEM majors, but I really don’t want a school where STEM just predominates the student body and few students major in social sciences/humanities

\- On that note, I would love some active international affairs-focused student orgs

\- A well-funded, reputable Japan/East Asia program

\- Strong internship prep/career center services

\- Strong alumni network

\- Fairly flexible study abroad opportunities

I already have a tentative list, but would really love to hear this sub's thoughts. Thanks in advance!"

About a year ago from this time, I was moved from one intern position to another from IT intern to developer intern. Back then, I really showed my interest in the things the development department was doing and I basically showed so much interest that they took me in instead of trying to find a junior dev.

For a couple of months while I was at school. we did not have any work because our department was brand new and the senior dev was still pitching the implementation for our project to the higher ups.  I was getting paid an intern's salary to study the very unique tech stack that we use (I was ""working"" part time). For the upcoming winter semester, I want to go to school to pursue an undergraduate degree, I currently have something like what Americans consider an associates degree.

I believe that my boss was under the impression that I would stay longer term because their plan was 3 years long and I showed interested in it (you know sometimes you have to show interested to get ahead in your career as messed up as it may seem). I really hope to get a letter of recommendation from him after I give him my resignation letter.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I go about doing this?  ...sorry for the long post"

sometimes i dont even know what i did wrong, the interview seemed to go well and when i ask for criticism it's just 'you were fine, we just had someone else have more experience' how am i supposed to work with that? i need a job to get experience but no one will hire me?? im underqualified or overqualified or the jobs that i apply for are all scams. people keep telling me to go get a job...

I never did extracurriculars in high school... I just got good grades, but lots of people have good grades.

I am so behind in my intro CS class. I can't focus because I have been dealing with a lot of personal things outside of school. I am trying my best and working hard yet here I am still trying to learn material we already learned in class a long time ago.

It's so intimidating and stressful and daunting seeing so many people in my class who have already been programming for such a long time. There's so many smart and intelligent and successful freshman already.

And everyone is already preparing and thinking about internships. I really want to get a cool internship one day. I really do.

I know that in order to get these cool internships at Google or Meta or Microsoft or Apple, you HAVE to start preparing and applying as soon as possible. But how am I supposed to do that when I can't even keep up with the intro CS class? I know it's stupid for me to be thinking about internships when I don't even understand recursion when I'm supposed to be analyzing algorithms. But I *have* to think about these things as soon as possible right? If I wanna actually do it?

And there's also having to worry about what extracurriculars to do. What do I spend my time on? What projects do I make? What clubs or organizations or programs am I supposed to join? What competitions do I have to win? When do I start LeetCoding? There's so many things to worry about. There's so many CS clubs at my university and I don't know what I have to look at. But at the same time... how am I supposed to join anything when I have nothing to bring to the table? I'm literally not even doing well in intro to CS... why would any club have use for me?

Everyone seems to be doing all these extracurriculars right at the gate too.

I don't know if my post is coherent at all or makes sense. But... I was honestly just looking for some wise words or advice or any comfort (if I deserve it) from any CS majors on this sub.

The company I have accepted is going through some pretty massive layoffs right now. I am worried that whatever team I am assigned to will no longer have a need for an intern / the whole company takes away offers. The other company I was offered at is a bank and most likely is not very affected by the current economy the same way tech companies are. Nothing is guaranteed and I would much rather have to renege an offer then have nothing come summer time.

What are the consequences to doing what I am proposing?"

I tried calling her and sending her voice messages about the topic, to which she said ""hey i'm not listening to that, go away"" so ya. In the past few months, she's quickly turned into someone I cannot recognize, one that is closeminded, harsh, and cannot compromise on anything (she literally said, friendship is not about compromise or feelings its about facts).

So my new question is whether to speak to her ever again. I was hoping to at least ask her if she wants space for now or if she wants a clean break total, but of course she won't even respond to that. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend (21F) and I (20F) have been best friends for 12 years, and have gone through the works together. While going to different colleges has meant we aren't as tied-at-the-hip as we used to be, having some periods where we only check-in once every week or two and others where we talk every day, we have remained very close and true best friends.

But, around July, I realized she had been acting odd, cancelling plans last second, making no bother to reschedule or contact me for plans, and just saying she was busy every time I brought up the odd behavior (which I did two or three times). I racked my brain thinking of anything I did to offend her, bother her, take up too much of her time, or any other reason she might not want to see me, and even asked her if any of these things occurred (to which she denied). Despite knowing that I was equally as busy with a new job, new internship, and summer classes, she never seemed to care that I was also dedicating my time to her or that I felt hurt when she blew me off. She also seemed to strongly prioritize other friends and do vacations, trips, events, with them but shut down the idea of even a little road-trip with me.

After literal months of trying to give her space, talk it out, give her space, talk it out, offer plans and get rejected, repeat - I finally had enough and was so emotionally raw I just called her and spoke as plainly as I could. Told her the pain and rejection I felt, that despite the fact that she calls me her ""best friend"" that she hasn't even done little check-ins for months despite knowing that I myself was having an extremely hard time (work abuses, school overload, and major family emergencies, in what was literally one of the worst periods of my life) and also that I need certain securities in our relationship to feel maintained and happy. While she was pretty defensive, I thought we had worked and cried it out together and could move on. She did say some hurtful things during this conversation, but eventually admitted that she was having some mental issues while switching medications but that they were passed now and that she would try to be more present/considerate in the future. She repeatedly mentioned that she loved me and wanted to stay as close best friends.

But in this past month of trying to repair our friendship and get over the rough patch, things are sliding right back into how they were. She recently got a new girlfriend (romantically), and can only talk about her at all times. Every time I ask if we could call or hang out, she can't because of the girlfriend or can only talk about how in-love she is with the girlfriend the whole time, and can't understand why I shift the conversation back to our plans, relationship, common interests, etc. Each time I propose making plans to see each other, both whenever she comes back to our hometown or if I could make the 2+ hour drive to her, she refuses and never makes alternative plans or options. If I don't reach out to her, she mostly ignores me except to send me a meme, have very surface level small talk, or talk about her girlfriend. When she is in our hometown or near me, she still never reaches out to see me. I tried to make plans with her even today to go to an event she mentioned she likes going to out in May to give her time to plan, that is both affordable and in her college town so she wouldn't have to commute for a band I thought she might like, and she immediately shut it down with no alternative.

I'm sorry this is so long-winded, but hopefully you can see the pain I feel over this and how much I do love her and miss her, but also feel so obscenely lonely and rejected by her. Talking to her almost makes me anxious because I know she will reject me 9/10 times. But how can I keep bringing up my feelings of hurt and rejection and anger when they clearly make no difference on her? She says that I'm her best friend and that she doesn't want or mean to make me feel this way, but then her actions have not changed at all? Am I just meant to be the low-maintenance friend or fully relegated to an acquaintance she calls her ""best friend""? Do I keep struggling to get through to her or do I just fade off and hope one-day she might come back? Do I bring up my feelings for now a fourth time? I don't want to lose her, but I know I can't change her and I'm not sure if I can avoid losing our relationship at this point.........."

Here's a little background info abt me just for you to understand.

I'm doing well in E/A Maths and Physics in Sec 4. Not because I have a interest in it, but I'm just doing well because I find it a little easy. I usually top the class but do note that I'm from a rather low tier sec school, so more ppl in my school are talented in arts than academics. This means I'm good in my school, but nationwide I may not be in the top few. 
I want to take a computing-related course in UNI, so if I were to go JC, my subject combo would be H2 computing, Physics, maths and H1 Econs.
The listed points below are the positive (+) and negative (-)  for JC and Poly respectively.

JC
- Larger percentage of ppl qualify to go into UNI than from poly (+) (The main reason i wanna go JC)
- More subjects to cope with (Esp Exons and gp coz i suck in them)(-)
- Idk if I'll do well in Physics and Maths, just because I'm doing alright
in Sec 4. (-)
- If I go to JC, I have more opportunities to go abroad to countries like India or Australia for UNI. (The qualification criteriafod these Unis are lower than that of local unis)(+)
- there's early admission into UNI from Poly, like dsa into uni. (+)

Poly
- Less stress and lesser subjects to cope with (Main reason I want to go Poly)(+)
- If I were to go to poly I'd take computing related course for sure. I have no background experience in computing, so idk how ill do in computing or if I'll even be interested in it. (I'm starting to learn coding now, so I can have an idea before applying) (-)
- need to be in the top 20th/25th percentile to qualify to go into UNI iirc. (Main reason im scared to go into poly coz i may not qualify)(-)
- Still have opportunities to go overseas, but have lower opportunities especially to lower ranked UNIs. (-)
- Better portfolio due to internships and stuff(+)
I also want to go to Poly because I feel like ill have a better social circle. In sec school I focused completely on academics and not on making memories so my sec life sucked :( I want to try and fix it in poly.
-------‐----------------------------------------------------‐---------------------------------------------------------------

I could just count the number of pros and cons, but some points carry a higher weight age. I definitely prioritise getting into UNI more than just having fun or a more relaxed learning period. 

I could use advice right now, so any input is much appreciated.

I’m currently a full time university student working two part time jobs. This is an issue pertaining to job #1. This job is every weekend 9 am - 5:30 pm and it pays pretty well for the area I live in. I’m afraid of divulging a little too much in case my boss happens to be on here 😭

So basically on the weekdays I have school and a part time job timing for sports meets that has inconsistent hours. In my free time I take care of my physically disabled mom. I work weekends to make enough money for basic things like food and my family gets rental aid from the government. 

This job needs people on the weekends and I mean they are desperate. My first interview was a phone interview with a hiring manager and even though I said I could only work weekends they said that was “very optimal” because no one wanted to work weekends. In my in-person interview with my manager I told him I could work weekends indefinitely and I could work school breaks if I didn’t have anything come up such as an internship or study abroad. He knew my limited availability and still hired me. 

Lately he has been bugging me about working full time again. He said “when are you going to work a normal 40 hour week again” and I said “probably around winter break” and he said “girl I know you can do earlier than that.” Which frankly made me a bit annoyed because, since he is pursuing his masters rn, he should know that finals are before winter break. And it’s not like I don’t want to work, I like making money and I don’t hate my co workers but I need to have a work life balance especially considering university and my mom. I want to explain this to him but I don’t know if bringing it up first will make it seem like I’m being immature and asking him to pity me in a way. But whenever we have a text conversation pertaining to my shifts he asks about when I can work full time again and even in person he asks me. 

I know I will be able to work winter break but I am unsure about spring break and summer quarter. I might be studying abroad in the spring and I might have a full time internship during the summer. This means I would just work weekends quite literally the rest of the year. I will always value my school opportunities and things like internships over my entry level job. 

My main fear is getting fired after the holidays because the company recently made changes to their work model which now involves the use of AI. Long story short we don’t need as many people on the floor now. I’m scared that I’ll be fired because of my availability but my supervisor told me that the place is so short on people that the boss wants the existing full timers to work 6 days a week instead of 5. The boss refuses to hire more ppl until we “really need it”. He wants to focus on making everyone who’s already existing super good workers, but the thing is we aren’t robots. We can’t meet the demands of work now that we lost a person. He used to be in the army so he acts like we can move heaven and earth.

My supervisor said no one should worry about getting fired but I have a gut feeling that if my availability doesn’t change soon I might be the first one lol. And the thing is I need this job because as a college student I also need to pay for books and stuff.

So should I wait and see if he does fire me and then scramble to find another job? Or do I find another job right now and quit when I get it? The only problem is that this job pays $23 an hour and minimum wage in my area is $14, so I would basically be taking a paycut. The pros of waiting until he fires me is finding out like oh I’m actually not getting fired? But if I do then at least I got paid a lot but now I need to find something that pays just as well as this job to keep up with my expenses and it’s kind of hard to search. If I just quit with another job in hand that also accepts my availability then it would save me the fear of being fired but in exchange for that stress I’m getting paid less and there’s no guarantee I won’t face these same problems with my next boss. 

Thank you in advance for answering. If you have like a different solution like me talking to my boss about it I’m open to what u think!"

1st offer: Big 4 consulting company with an offer of a tech consulting internship. My assumption is that it wont really be a technical intensive role compared to other cs internships, but it would be my 1st in tech.

Offer 2 is from a smaller and more niche company in the industrial software industry, and are offering me a Software Dev internship. I've been told I'll be coding most of the time and will be using the .NET stack and or C# (if that makes  a difference).

I'm not really sure what to go with, my thoughts are offer 1 has big name which could help on my resume but ill likely have less technical experience once its over. Offer 2 is not really a recognizable name, but I'll definitely have more technical experience under my belt. Part of my consideration is coding isn't a die-hard passion of mine but I do enjoy it at times and I don't really know how tech consulting stuff really works. My goal is to get a SWE internship at a FAANG or similar company after grad (if it isn't too late or just a SWE role). Given that this is likely my last chance to intern before full time, if swe at FAANG doesn't work out, then probably full time at each company is what I am trying to weigh next. I'm not really sure how the job market will be for each industry/role and how that could affect potential fulltime offer, idk if I'm looking too far into it. Just really confused and looking for some advice here on what I should do, thanks!

tldr: Big company name not as technical role vs small name technical role."

I’ll be starting an internship this January, and this will be the first time I’m working 40 hours a week. I know generally this doesn’t actually mean 8 straight hours of coding, but it’ll still require significantly more focus than anything I currently do. 

I think part of my problem is that I’m getting burnt out from my busy schedule of work + school + hobbies, so after this semester, I’ll be done with my work, and will have no homework, so I plan on forcing myself to relax completely for at least 1 full week, maybe 2, before this internship starts.

I'm looking to move into a SRE/DevOps role where there's more scripting/programming involved, and in a more stable sector (interested in finance/trading right now). The problem is that in my job I haven't learned many things that job postings are looking for even in Junior DevOps positions.

I've done quite a bit of networking, scripting, programming (I've also been developing apps as a freelance on the side, mostly Java for Android). But in my company we don't do CI/CD (there's only one major programmer, so everything goes through him), Terraform/Ansible (there's a bit done with Ansible and I did very little during my internship here, but not much else to do with it), cloud (I played a bit with GCP when we were looking into changing the webhosting, but not enough I'd be confident in adding it up to the CV. We use Glacier and other storage in AWS, but nothing else) and Docker/K8s (I do have docker and I've used it a lot at home in a server I'm hosting, but as a user).

I've worked a lot with bare metal, virtualization (vSphere), pure scripting with PHP/Bash mostly, obviously Linux OS and all involved with it...

Now I'm at a point I don't know how to proceed. I bought the [Docker-Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/) and [Kubernetes Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetesmastery/) from Bret Fisher in Udemy to get me started with this, and I have a server at home hosting various services, so I'm thinking of practicing Ansible/Terraform somehow in there.

But I have no clue if this is even worth it and will count in the eyes of recruiters that the experience is self-taught and not from the industry. Not even mentioning I have no clue how I can even practice AWS or GCP, or CI/CD (was thinking Github Actions). Or should I just look for a simple Junior Developer and try to do the switch later on?

[This is a redacted CV for reference](https://imgur.com/a/yO2HmOR)

On top of all this, ideally I'd like to move to the North of Europe (UK, Amsterdam, Dublin, Scandinavia) from the South (I am an EU citizen), so I imagine this doesn't help at all. Thank you all very much."

Liberty Mutual's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$26/hr, have to find housing and transportation to NH office with 3k stipend, great work life balance, full time pay \~$70-100k entry level??? (on the internet it was highly variable), can choose between 7 tech tracks like backend, full stack, etc.

Vanguard's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$42/hr, housing already provided and near transportation to office, stress-free culture, culture of ""long term stability"", old legacy code, full time pay \~$80k entry level???

I'm leaning towards Vanguard just based on the current information, but I couldn't find much information about the actual intern experiences or a constant full time SWE entry level pay for either company, so any advice or past experiences working for either company would be appreciated. Thanks!

This degree covered all my basic college classes and about 4 extra education classes. At the university I will transfer to, I am a history major with secondary teaching licensure. I also am a substitute teacher for our local public school system while I am finishing college. I live off campus with my spouse who is in the military and they plan on staying the service for a long time, which means we may have a duty station overseas in our future. 

With my current college degree plans, that would leave my only career options if we end up overseas being a remote teacher or working at a school on the overseas military base through the Department of Defense. These are solid options, but I believe computer science may be a better one for me. 

The cost per credit hour at the university I will attend is $1,039 (Out of state). So I am looking at a good $30k in debt for a history degree (about 2 more years of school) and teaching license. 

**HOWEVER**

This same university I am attending offers a 100 percent online computer science bachelors degree. **The cost? $407 per credit hour (out of state).** Also, nearly all my credits would transfer into the program and I would only have about 2 years of schooling to be done in this program, like the history one. I've always had a deep passion for computers since I was a kid. I know I am fully capable of the workload and intenseness of the degree, when compared to just a history one. Between the potential remote job opportunities in the future with a CS degree - if we end up overseas and the cost of the degree, it seems like a no brainer to me to switch. The only downside is that I will be unable to do any sort of internship, as I need to stay with my spouse and support our family. 

I'm stuck on what to do. I really like history and teaching, but the smarter option all around here seems to be switching to a CS degree. I am looking for peoples opinion on my situation. What do you guys think? Should I switch career paths? Thank you!"

First of all, it's my first post ever on Reddit and I'm cutting straight to the topic. I recently got accepted for a 6-month internship in a big company operating in the automotive sector (a real powerhouse in this field)  and I was at least delighted to start!

Important notice that will prove to be useful later in the story: The offices are in a European country and although there are many international people working there, my teammates speak only the local language while they're working. They asked me if it's better to speak English with me but considering that I was staying in this country for a year already (doing my Masters there) and I put a lot of effort to learn the language. I can understand almost everything and I can speak in a decent level so as to maintain a normal conversation. So I told them that there was no real need to communicate in English as I thought it would be a good chance to improve even more. 

So first week and it was even better than I thought! Everyone was very friendly from the supervisor to the other intern who entered the same day as me, in the same team but with the advantage of being native and being a woman (To clarify: I'm saying that her being a woman was an advantage because there are only women in my team and my business division in general consists of 85% women).  I was feeling already a bit of outcast but anyway, they at least seemed welcoming...

Of course I was not fluent yet and because of that I had to ask a lot of questions to my supervisor who seemed very friendly in the beginning. At the same time, I was feeling like the other intern was trying to outperform me in many ways. For example, the supervisor gave us a task to do it together and check both files after to see if everything's okay, but the other girl when she finished she didn't even ask me to check and she sent that file directly to the supervisor. She's also very cold sometimes and she's trying so hard to be the ""good kid"" in the eyes of our supervisor and the other two seniors. It's worth it to mention also that the supervisor seems to like her a lot more than me and she rewards her every time she does or says something right, while with me on the other side she became far more cold than in the beginning. Every time she talks to ""us"" about an assignment or how to do something at work she looks ONLY at her and only if I make a question she turns her look at me. 

The other intern now is completely ignoring me in every task we are assigned to do and her performance gets boosted with every ""bravo"" she hears while my performance gets worse day by day... If I don't understand something regarding the assignment, because as I mentioned before I have the disadvantage to work in a very difficult job without being fluent, she doesn't help me to understand better and only when she finishes all the work and she sends it to the supervisor she asks me hypocritically ""what I'm doing now"".

In conclusion, I'm very disappointed with my new internship and I'm there for only 1 month and a half. I seriously don't have any idea how I'm gonna survive this for 6 months, feeling more useless day-in day-out. It's just sad for them to behave this way because I'm sure if I was in their position I'd do anything to make the foreigner who doesn't speak 100% fluently the language feel like home. If I was in the other intern's position I'd do anything to help her and do the work together even if sometimes it would make US finish the assignments a bit slower. 

Anyone that felt she/he has been in the same position? If yes, how did you deal with it? In general, any advice from anyone would be extremely useful in the situation I'm in now..."

No Backlogs either.

About me: Currently I'm on track to graduate next year. I had an internship at a small non-tech company last year and received an offer from a F500, but still non-tech company this year. I'm still looking for other offers but based on current results I don't expect to get anything better.

Currently I'm considering three options for my future:

\- Interview for new grad positions next year, graduate and start working

\- Graduate next year and do masters

\- Double major to delay graduation by one year

I'm considering the latter two mostly because the current job market is pretty bad and I don't know if I'll be able to get a desirable offer next year. I'm pretty lost at the moment so any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
z30ayf,1,2022-11-23,Feels like going backwards,MrRealWhiteWolf,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/z30ayf/feels_like_going_backwards/," I’ve graduated last month and finally became a software engineer, I’m 25 years old close to 26 (In my country software engineering is the equivalent of a master in computer science in other countries). During my studies I’ve always done extra internships and worked on extra personal projects, I have made around 45 projects also for fun on my own because am so passionate about coding and I love learning new things and technologies. My dream was to always land a job abroad preferably from my end of studies internship (In my university as part of our last semester and in order to graduate we re asked to work on an end of studies project for 6 months, the best way to do this is by working for a good company during an internship to learn as much as possible) I’ve spent months searching for a good opportunity abroad for an end of studies internship but nothing instead I’ve settled for a good project idea in a really mediocre company that doesn’t even have an IT department.

And during that time I kept on seeing my friends going abroad finding internships then jobs and starting their lives and really living meanwhile fast-forward to now I’m stuck here at the same position I was in last year still.

However, I thought it’s okay things will get better for sure and I’m still working hard and learning new things to improve my chances. After graduating, I’ve set this goal, if I couldn’t make it in a good company abroad I’m going to try and aim for the best companies so I’ve started grinding LeetCode (which is a website that offers you a lot of programming problems to solve to train you for interviews in big companies like Google, Amazon and such).

Anyways, sorry for the long introduction, but I wanted to say that I just feel so behind and I'm just venting because despite all of my efforts to be a great software engineer and learn as much as possible, I mean I’ve graduated with 2 years already of experience and I was one of the best at my university and it hurts me to see that some friends of mine who works abroad now have found their chances so easily and these exact friends who in college I used to do their projects for them and help them with studying I’m not jealous of them am happy for them but still somehow it feels unfair, sometimes it feels like it will never happen to me and I don’t want that because it was my dream for 6 years, and I worked for it so hard and I’m still doing so.

But sometimes it feels like I’m going nowhere if anything it feels like going backwards.

I was holding this in for so long, thank you for anyone who read this and I really will appreciate any advice, I know I'm already 25 and I should already know what to do but somehow I feel like I have no idea how to make the right decision or what to do, any advice about anything I've said above or anything I should be doing or maybe open my eyes for something I'm doing wrong would be much appreciated."

Hi, I am transferring to a 4 year university in the Spring after recently completing an associates degree in K-12 Education. This degree covered all my basic college classes and about 4 extra education classes. At the university I will transfer to, I am a history major with secondary teaching licensure. I also am a substitute teacher for our local public school system while I am finishing college. I live off campus with my spouse who is in the military and they plan on staying the service for a long time, which means we may have a duty station overseas in our future.

With my current college degree plans, that would leave my only career options if we end up overseas being a remote teacher or working at a school on the overseas military base through the Department of Defense. These are solid options, but I believe computer science may be a better one for me.

The cost per credit hour at the university I will attend is $1,039 (Out of state). So I am looking at a good $30k in debt for a history degree (about 2 more years of school) and teaching license.

**HOWEVER**

This same university I am attending offers a 100 percent online computer science bachelors degree. **The cost? $407 per credit hour (out of state).** Also, nearly all my credits would transfer into the program and I would only have about 2 years of schooling to be done in this program, like the history one. I've always had a deep passion for computers since I was a kid. I know I am fully capable of the workload and intenseness of the degree, when compared to just a history one. Between the potential remote job opportunities in the future with a CS degree - if we end up overseas and the cost of the degree, it seems like a no brainer to me to switch. The only downside is that I will be unable to do any sort of internship, as I need to stay with my spouse and support our family.

I'm stuck on what to do. I really like history and teaching, but the smarter option all around here seems to be switching to a CS degree. I am looking for peoples opinion on my situation. What do you guys think? Should I switch career paths? Thank you!"

Palantir Deployment Strategist: I withdrew after phone round. I had concerns about the work they do/the role and their interview process was LONG.

Jane Street Business Dev: I initially applied for PM but they placed me on business dev track. I withdrew after take-home assignment. The role did not align with my goals.

Capital One Business Analyst: Ghosted after OA. 

Oracle: This was weird, I applied for PM but recruiter tried to push me through for a security engineer internship even though I have zero experience in cyber security. I was ghosted after I asked to be placed on PM track.

Mastercard PM: I declined their offer. Pay was low and honestly the interviewers did not do a great job selling their company culture or project. They seemed miserable and that scared me. I asked one interviewer how his experience was working at Mastercard and all he said was “it’s okay”. :/

Expedia PM: I got an offer. Interviews were great and company culture seems stable but I’m declining. 

“That” FAANG Business Intelligence Engineer: Rejected after final rounds.

Anyways, I think I have a  pretty good situation, but I am still pretty torn about what career path  I truly want to get into. I have a major passion for technology and  always wanted to work at Meta or with the emerging technologies,  particularly VR/AR or getting into AI. My current goals are to find a  hardworking technology job that can get me working really hard around  intelligent engineers as I develop my lifestyle with amazing  technologies going into the future.

But  as an analyst making workflow documents, would I be better off than in  an engineering position, trying to implement lower level functions? I  always considered myself as a solid engineer but never actually worked  beyond making POC apps during an 8-week internship (was very fun!). But  now I really want to decide if I want this analyst position or to find a more suitable job that will: A) Help me get into a company like META  and work on emerging technologies, or B) Help me to  become a valuable worker in any particular domain and make lots of money  as I work my ass off (happily) for the next 10 years where I can then  easily transition to any gig I want or make my own startup.

The coffee was almost too hot. I hoped it would be strong enough to keep me awake for the rest of the night.

The sun had just passed over the horizon, but its pinkish orange light still glowed over everything I could see. A busy intersection right at the corner of a train stop and several other buildings-mostly apartments, but some coffee shops and restaurants too.

Further in the distance and to my right, I could see the dense bundle of downtown’s skyscrapers. I could just barely make out one of the buildings in the financial district-which would soon be my home for the next 8 hours for the 7pm to 4am shift.

A cacophony of motor vehicle sounds filled the air traveling both to and from every location I could see through my window.

I settled into my seat and took another sip out of my cup. Enjoying the brief reprieve between my day of working assembly at a local factory and my night of trying my best not to doze off at the front desk of the 90-story investment bank downtown.

I didn't even get 15 minutes to myself before I heard several knocks coming from my front door.

“Mmaintenance” called a mellow, soporific voice.

‘A day late’ I thought to myself as I made my way to the door and let the man in. I was a little put off by his appearance.

His lanky frame was dressed in a brown pair of khakis and a tucked in flannel. A tool belt was wrapped around his waist containing an assortment of ordinary looking tools. His skin was a pasty white shade and his eyes were covered by a black pair of sunglasses, disguising his facial expressions almost entirely.

I'm not a very tall guy but he absolutely towered over me. Maybe 6 foot 7.

I wasn’t sure exactly what it was specifically that had me on edge about his appearance, but I couldn't shake the small shiver that passed through me.

“Your water heater is in need of repair, correct?” The man continued. His voice had a formal cadence. Like he was addressing a royal audience.

“Umm… yeah that’s right. I can show you where it is” I felt an uneasy feeling as he walked into my apartment.

“Would you like me to take my boots off?” He asked as he took his first step in.

“No, that’s fine”

“Ah yes, that isn’t customary in the United States”

He followed my lead over to the mini boiler room in my living room. He had extremely light footsteps considering his stature and his heavy-duty work boots. Though he was just a few steps behind me, I could barely hear a sound coming from him.

“Oh shit.”  I said remembering my upcoming shift.

“Hey, I have to head out for work in an hour. Maybe you can come and fix the water heater tomorrow or later this week?”

I looked to see he still hadn’t taken his sunglasses off.

“That is no problem. I should be done well before that”

‘You don’t even know what the hell is wrong with the water heater’ I thought to myself. ‘Whatever, I guess the maintenance guy knows better than me.’

After dropping him off at the boiler room, I returned to my room to finish my coffee and stare out my window some more.

I found the practice relaxing. Just zoning out, watching the lights, cars, people, buildings. It was the only time I could just relax and not think about my 14-hour workdays.

My eyes moved from the sights outside my window to the picture on my desk. My parents and I in front of the family home. A reminder of what I work so hard for.

I checked my watch to see almost 45 minutes had passed. I begin to turn around to get an estimate on how long it would take the maintenance man to finish his repair….

I saw him in my room. Sitting on my small couch. Looking right at me through his sunglasses.

My stomach dropped as I yelped and jumped out of my chair.

“What the fuck are you doing here” I gasped, my heart still thumping in my chest.

“Please, have a seat” He said in a calm, but commanding voice, completely unbothered by my reaction.

He looked ridiculous with his limbs practically spilling out of the small loveseat.

I cautiously looked around the room as I lowered my body into my plastic chair.

“You need to get out of my room, how long have you been in here dude?”

He ignored my question and proceeded to unbutton a pouch in his tool belt and pulled out a pristine stack of hundred dollar bills. A paper sleeve wrapped around the cash read ‘$10,000’

I just stared at him in confusion as he continued to pull out another identical stack. “What’s going on here?”

He held the wads of cash up for me to see with his pale, hairless arm. “What would you do with this money?” His voice remained polite and calm…monotonous. Almost like he was reading off of a script.

My mind immediately flashed to what that kind of money could mean. A good portion of my parents’ debt could be wiped out on the spot. I suppressed the instinct to stop asking any questions and just snatch the cash from the pale man.

I stayed quiet, confusion and fear keeping me from speaking much.

He continued, “you have an opportunity to win five of these” He waved the twenty thousand dollars in his hand with a small robotic motion.

I felt dizzy from his words, it was as if he knew just how badly I needed the money.

I tried to calm down and then asked the question, “What do I need to do?”

He smiled. I really wished he didn’t. It was so unnatural, with no sign of humanity in it. As if he had never smiled or even seen someone smile in his life. The forced motion stretched his pale, expressionless face far too much.

“It depends, do you want twenty thousand dollars or one hundred thousand dollars?”

My desperation for the money outweighed my apprehension if just barely.

“What do I need to do for the hundred thousand dollars?” I asked slowly.

“All we need you to do is find something and bring it to us.”

I think my confusion and anxiety boiled over into an agitated outburst.

“What the fuck does that mean? What do I need to find? Where do I need to bring it?”

He had no reaction to my anger. His expression was stoic and his body perfectly still. His long, lanky limbs protruding from the couch like a brown recluse. He reached into his pocket and produced a small silver piece of fabric, decorated with hundreds or even thousands of small symbols radiating from a central point in a fractal arrangement. It was about the size of a small scarf.

“There is another one of these. We want you to bring it to a specific location for us. The address will be provided”

His strange offer was stated with another smile, making my skin crawl.

“Um… where is the scarf located?”

“All of that information will be provided to you shortly”

“And… what if I don’t want to participate?”

“That is your choice, Ivan” My stomach dropped at his mention of my name.

“Even if you don’t complete the task, you should receive twenty thousand US dollars. You will, however, be missing out on a chance to earn a lot more money.”

I thought for several seconds, this seemed too good to be true. twenty thousand dollars to do nothing?

I was lost in thought for several seconds more, growing more and more unsettled by the stranger sneaking up on me and the massive sums of money he seemed to be so ready to part with.

I sided with my gut instinct.

“If you’re not going to fix my water heater, then get the fuck out of my apartment. I’m not playing your game. If I see you again, I’m calling the police.” I tried to hide my fear of this strange man behind my words.

He nodded and slowly stood up, almost grazing my ceiling with his black hair in the process.

“You are free to do whatever you choose, Ivan. I will leave this here in case you change your mind” He opened another pouch and placed a small envelope on the couch, along with the silver scarf.

“Here, let me walk you to the door” I sneered, ignoring his words.

He complied with no resistance and made his way out of my apartment- I followed closely behind.

Just before I closed the door in his face, I hesitated. A hundred k would be life-changing for us. It would do so much to ease our burden. The stress of working like a dog for so many years and watching both my mom and dad do the same was weighing on me like a ton of bricks. Though still very suspicious, this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity; the lucky break we so desperately needed.

“Hey man, actually, wait up.”

He quickly turned to look at me with a blank expression. Almost as if he knew I was going to have second thoughts and was just waiting for me to voice them.

“I’m reconsidering your offer, could you tell me how to start playing this game?”

My stomach dropped as I heard his next words

“I think you misunderstood, Ivan. You are already playing…please keep your flag close. It is your ticket to twenty thousand dollars.”

“Wait…what…do you mean?” I stammered

He didn't reply, just offered a small smile and polite nod before turning around.

“Wait up, man!” I shouted but he was already gone.

I closed my door and stared forward, absent-mindedly, the implication of the strange man’s words radiating through me…

There is someone else playing this game… and they win the hundred grand if they take my silver piece of fabric… either we both win 20 thousand… or one of us wins the 100 thousand, leaving the other with nothing.

I locked my door, quickly ran back to my room… and stared at the envelope he had left me. It was white, sealed with a small insignia that I couldn’t recognize. In fact, I wasn’t even able to see it very well. Every time my eyes attempted to focus; a blurry image would be all I could see.

‘Shit’

I noticed the sun had just set and completely forgot about the odd encounter. I hurried to grab my things and head over to the office. Just as I was going to head out the door, I stopped. I decided I might as well take the scarf and envelope with me to work. Just in case.

My job was just as boring as usual. I sat at the front desk of the large building staring at a small grid of security cameras that were pointed at several entrances throughout the building. Occasionally, I would have to let in some overworked analyst who forgot their key.

Once per hour, I would have to do my rounds. Walking the square perimeter of the building to look for any signs of trouble. Besides that, I had plenty of time to think. Tonight, there was only one thing on my mind.

Was this wager real? Could I really get a hundred thousand dollars just to steal a piece of fabric from someone? What is the catch here? I took the envelope out of my backpack and placed it on my desk, along with the piece of fabric.

After staring at it for another minute, I decided it was at least worth it to open the letter and see what was inside.

Inside the envelope was a small page of printer paper folded three times. The header read: “Justin”

Underneath it had some basic information.

**Occupation**\- Auto Mechanic

**Age- 25**

**Height**\- 6’2”

**Weight**\- 195

**Motivation-** Medical treatment for daughter

Underneath that description was a picture of another piece of fabric, nearly identical to mine. Except for the fact that it was an emerald green rather than silver.

**Please bring this cloth to \[Redacted\] prior to the end of the game to win the reward of $100,000**

**Game Ends: Three weeks from today**

The full picture of this game finally hit me. Justin is on the other side of this game. My goal is to capture his flag… and he is out there somewhere…. staring at a page with my information on it.

I heard a loud knock on the glass window in front of me and nearly fell out of my seat.

“Hey, let me in” I heard the muted voice of one of the Banking Interns as he flashed his employee ID and pointed at the front door into the building.

My heart still beating in my chest, I pressed the red button on my console to let him in.

I could see the look in his eyes as he gave me a small nod of thanks and began to head over to the elevator.

He was young, maybe in his early twenties, his tired eyes and disheveled hair made him look twice as old. Though he was dressed far nicer than me with a 3-piece suit, I could almost see myself in those eyes. The unspoken bond we shared from the long hours of work through the night, just to wake up early and do it all over again.

It was now time for my next set of rounds. After one last swig of my Red Bull, I put both the note and the ‘flag’ away in my bag and got up to walk through the square perimeter of the building.

Besides the main entrance, there were three others. One at each side of the building in order to provide access from each street on the block.

As I made it to the second entrance, I briefly saw a shadow passing by the window. It seemed like whoever was there moved immediately as they noticed me, almost like they were trying to hide.

A bit alarmed, I grabbed a small flashlight and shined it out the door.

I couldn’t see too well but someone was there, walking quickly away from the door.

A chill ran through me as I imagined that strange guy from earlier staring through the window in the building lobby. Or maybe it was Justin following me around.

‘Shit’ I had left my flag at my desk unattended. Ignoring my patrol, I quickly ran back to my desk and grabbed my bag.

I took a deep sigh of relief when I immediately saw the silver glow of the fabric.

…

“Hey Ian… can I tell you something?”

Ian didn’t look up from his task at the assembly line as he answered.

“Sure, Ivan. What’s up”

“You promise not to laugh at me?”

“Well… I can’t do that unless I know what you’re gonna say”

“Okay” I started, “So there was a guy who came into my apartment last night. Pretending to be with maintenance… and he inducted me into some sort of game”

I proceeded to detail the events of the night, starting with a description of the strange man, before detailing the ‘rules’ of the game and the information about the other ‘player’

By the time I was done, Ian had stopped folding his perforated sheet of cardboard into a box and was staring at me.

I lifted up my shirt to reveal the fabric that wrapped discreetly in my waistband.

He didn’t laugh or even express any disbelief. He simply seemed lost in thought for several moments.

“You’re in a bit of a dilemma I see” he finally said, returning to his work on the assembly line.

“What do you mean?” I didn’t know where his train of thought was after that pause.

“Well, let's assume this is a real game someone is trying to make you and Justin play,”

“Yeah, I mean I could really use the money, man.”

“Your best option is to do nothing for the next three weeks, hold onto your little scarf thing, and walk away scot free with twenty large.”

“Exactly, and that is Justin’s best option too, right?”

“Yup, that’s right…” Ian hesitated; I felt a pit in my stomach start to form as I predicted what he was going to say next.

“We have no idea who the fuck this guy is though” I said before he could, and he nodded in agreement.

“Bingo, the only real thing we know about him is why he might want the money. To pay for his daughter’s medical expenses. And that’s a pretty damn good reason to steal your flag for himself, isn’t it?”

My blood boiled for a second, “Not if I don’t take that bastard’s flag first” It was just as the words left my tongue that I realized my problem and quickly calmed down.

Ian continued, ""How can you trust a stranger to look out for your best interest? He has a strong motive and financial incentive, it seems, to screw you over?”

I began to realize the situation I was in… it was a stalemate. Should I strike first or wait for Justin to track me down and take my flag for himself? Would he be desperate enough to do it?

My head began spinning at the possibilities as I tried to plan each move I should make, while at the same time, trying to predict how Justin might act himself.

“Dammit Ian, what should I do!?”

He thought for another minute before suggesting, “Well, you have a bit of information on him already, right? First name, his job? Maybe you could try to get some more information on him? Try to find out if he’s the type to double-cross you?”

I took his advice. That night, I called in sick to my shift at the bank and spent the time looking for any information I could find about Justin the auto mechanic.

Assuming he was located at least somewhat close to me, I set a 5-mile radius on google maps and began searching for every single auto body shop I could find.

I ended up with a list of about 15 stores. One of which happened to be just a few blocks away. Slightly alarmed, I peered out my window.

It was right there within my sight. The bright neon sign read ‘UFO Auto Body’ with a cartoon drawing of an alien, complete with bright green skin and black eyes, sloped downwards.

At this point, it struck me that if someone in that building had the right angle, they could see me perfectly through my window.

I shuddered, feeling many eyes following my every move through the window and quickly closed my blinds.

Continuing my search, I moved to social media. Searching for combination after combination of ‘Justin’ and ‘auto repair’. No luck. Without the last name, I got far too many results and none of them were obviously the guy I was looking for.

By the time 1 AM rolled around, I was ready to give up and get a head start on my night of sleep.

Before I could however, I had a breakthrough by way of a website review on the Tires Plus website

It read: ‘Very Bad experience here. The mechanic seemed inattentive when I explained the issue with my battery. Two days after I was serviced, my battery died again! If I ever come back to Tires Plus, I sure won’t let Justin anywhere near my car.’

My eyes widened and I nearly jumped out of my chair. I immediately pulled out my phone and dialed Ian.

He was understandably angry to be woken up so late but still remained patient as I told him about the angry review I found.

We made a plan for Ian to go into the store and try to find Justin to see if he matched the description. After that, the plan was to try to get a last name so we could get a more detailed picture of who this guy is. A criminal record, education, anything that could clue me in on who Justin is as a person and how he might act with so much money on the line.

I agreed to pay him for a missed day of work while he went to ‘get his car serviced’.

I cringed to myself as I transferred him 100 dollars, further pushing myself into a financial hole.

Two hours after I get home from work, I finally get the call from Ian.

“Cook!” He said in a hushed yell.

“Is that our guy? How did you find out?”

I immediately jumped to my laptop and started searching for ‘Justin Cook Tires Plus’.

“I saw a plaque on the wall with his name. Don’t worry though I stayed pretty low key. I even got my oil change to make sure I was as inconspicuous as possible.”

I kept searching until I finally found a facebook profile. His page was private but I could still see the small circular profile picture.

“What did he look like?” I asked while attempting to zoom into the screen on my image.

“Pretty average looking dude, I can’t say anything really stood out about him. White guy, dark, hair, maybe part Asian. I think he had brown eyes too.”

I stared at the old, blurry picture as I heard the description.

“I think we got our guy.”

The internet didn’t have much more information about him, even with a last name and workplace.

I found an old college directory from Stanford. I found he was previously employed by one or two other auto body shops.

I finally decided to search for the one thing I was dreading the most: ‘Justin Cook criminal record’

“Fuck” my heart caught in my chest. He had been previously charged with armed burglary. From some related news articles, it turned out he walked away with just a misdemeanor since he was only 17 when the incident occurred.

My mind whirred as I tried to piece together how Justin would behave in our game.

Okay, he’s 25. He at least went to Stanford for a while so he has to be smart or hard-working enough to get in. He has a daughter. Maybe that was what forced him to drop out of school? That could also have made him desperate enough to commit a crime?

Despite trying to understand how Justin would think and behave, my mind kept circling back to one thing. He has a fucking gun. Or at least he had one. And he’s broken into a house before…

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I imagined him silently crouched in my closet or hiding under my bed. I quietly got out of my chair, scanning my bedroom. I walked into my hallway, looking for anywhere someone might be hiding. I opened the door to my boiler room… nothing.

After scouring my apartment, I made sure my door was locked and then pushed my bike in front of it.

Regret weighing in my stomach for involving Ian in this mess, I picked up my phone and gave him yet another call.

“Hey, Ian…. I’m going to need to borrow a gun.”

“Dude, are you serious? I’m not going to help you kill someone.”

I tried to explain the situation to him. “Look man, Justin has a criminal record for armed burglary. I’m sure he still has a weapon of his own. I swear I won’t go looking for him. It's just for self-defense.”

“Look Ivan, this is just too risky for me to let you borrow my guns. If anything happens, I’m screwed too, not just you.”

“What if I gave you some of the money? Maybe a few grand?”

“No… sorry I can’t. Good luck Ivan”

After some deliberation I decided to take the next best option. A non-Lethal weapon. I had seen an ad or two for these little self-defense weapons that shot projectiles filled with pepper spray. After some searching online, I landed on one I liked and several rounds of the ammo for it. The total cost, around a thousand dollars.

I silently cursed myself for adding to the already enormous pile of debt when I pressed the buy now button. By this point, I was further piling on debt with no promise of ever seeing a dime from this stupid game.

I stuffed the pistol into my waistband, right next to my silver flag, before calling an uber to work. When the car arrived, I took a look in the backseat as well as at the driver before quickly shuffling in.

Hundreds of shapes stared through the glass surrounding me, just to disappear when I would turn to face them.

I had never been so focused on my job. My eyes were trained on my grid of screens as if my life depended on it. I made sure to track anyone who even passed into their lines of sight.

My patrol of the building was accompanied by my pistol and my silver piece of fabric. Both of which I kept as close to me as possible at all times.

I heard a polite rapping at the door, causing me to flinch and shoot my eyes upward…

It looks like Justin did find me.

He held up his hands through the glass as if to indicate there was no malicious intent.

I cautiously pressed the red button before declaring loudly from my seat:

“Take off your outer layer and sit on the couch over here. Keep your arms where I can see them at all times, or I will shoot. Do not fuck with me Justin.”

He nodded quickly and followed my instructions, leaving his flannel shirt on the speckled granite floor. He walked over to the couch, about six feet away from me, his hands face down on each thigh.

“Okay, what do you want Justin? How did you know I was here and why did you show up?”

He looked nervous but determined when he spoke.

“I’ll be completely honest here. I did some research on you. I’m sure you did the same for me. I just want to have an open and honest conversation. If we can find an agreement here, we can both walk away as partners, each with an extra 20 grand.”

I cautiously studied his face, looking for any sign that he wasn’t telling the truth. I couldn’t find any.

“What’s stopping me from kidnapping you right now and forcing you to tell me where your flag is?”

“Well, I came to your work for a reason. I’m not just going to let you take my flag. There’s cameras everywhere in case you try to take it by force. I know you can’t afford to lose your job or even face criminal charges for shooting your weapon in a gun-free zone”

I growled and gripped the base of my weapon, “You don’t know what I’m capable of Justin.”

He continued to plead, “Can we just talk? I’m not here to steal your flag.”

I took a deep breath to try and calm my nerves.

“You committed armed burglary, right? What’s your side of the story?”

He flashed a sad look at the ground. “It was a few years ago. I was barely 17 years old when it happened. I know I fucked up but you don’t have to guess what my intentions were…it was in your letter. I did it for Kristy, my daughter.”

My heart dropped as I saw him begin to tear up.

“She was born with some pretty serious health complications. I was broke. I made a shitty decision and almost got a felony from it. But I’m sure you know what I’m doing now. I work at a car shop. I’ve changed since then man, I haven’t stolen anything from anyone since then.”

I felt sincerity coming from his shaky voice. An earnest plea that made his eyes water more with every word. I hated to say it, but I believed him.

“I believe you Justin… But I’m struggling too. My parents have been in debt for a long time. The burden is almost too much to bear. If I won this money, my parents could finally live in peace. They're almost in their 70’s man.”

He looked at me with a solemn expression. “Look Ivan, I understand that. You don’t know me and I know you need the money. Lord knows you’re in a tough spot here too. But the thing is, I’m not asking for your flag. I’m not asking you for anything. All I want is to know you won’t come after me. If we both agree to forget about this game and just go about our business for the next few weeks, we’ll both walk away with a shit ton of money!”

I stayed silent for a while lost in thought. Could I trust this guy? He told a great sob story and even the criminal record seemed explicable given his circumstances…but how would I know my trust wouldn’t come back to bite me?

I let out an exasperated sigh.

“Fuck, fine, Justin. I’m going to go about my business and so will you. You promise to never look for me or my flag ever again?”

“I promise, do you?”

“...ye-yeah I do”

He seemed visibly relieved. “Thank you for understanding Ivan, good luck with everything and I hope you put your money to good use.”

I nodded, “get out of here Justin.”

He stood up and began his exit. I noticed his tall athletic frame and thought about how easily he could take me out if he wanted to. He was the bad guy here. He was the one who committed a serious crime, not me.  A combination of fear and opportunistic glee hit me like a freight train. I knew he was unarmed. He had my ticket to a hundred grand.

It was at that moment when I made the decision that will haunt me for the rest of my life.

I watched as Justin shuffled out of the glass double doors of my building. I waited even longer for his shadow to finally escape past the view of the building’s outdoor cameras.

I felt sick. And jittery. Any final doubts left me as my body seemed to move by its own will. I quickly got up and walked to the door. Slowly opening it and locking it behind me.

I could see Justin had just passed the corner and was turning around the block. I quietly slipped off my boots and sprinted towards him.

It worked, Justin didn’t see me coming in the dark until I was close enough to point and aim my gun directly at his head.

My heart was thumping so fast that I didn’t (at the time) feel the aching guilt, screaming at me to put the gun down and just walk away.

“Hands up” I whispered as I slowly closed the distance.

He didn’t offer any resistance. Just repeating, “Please don’t do this Ivan” as I checked his body for any sign of the flag. I found his phone and wallet, pocketing them both for the time being.

“Where are you hiding it?” I tapped the barrel of my gun to his forehead as I spoke, silently praying he didn’t realize it wasn’t real.

“Please… Ivan don't do th-” He let out a choked scream as I slammed the barrel of the pistol into his head.

“If I have to ask again, I’m shooting.” I began to feel my humanity draining from me. A deep chill that sank into my bones. A visceral reminder of who I was becoming.

“I left it at home. My daughter lives with me, please stay away from her.”

“I just want one thing, Justin. You drive here?”

He nodded as a few more small tears fell from his face.

Justin lived a few miles away from the city, I sat behind the driver’s seat as he tried his best to calmly focus on the road.

Despite his facade, I could see the slight tremble in his hands and deep breaths he was taking.

My heart broke, but I had to keep moving forward.

Around 15 minutes of silent driving later, we slowed to a stop in a small Cul-de-Sac.

“Is anyone home besides your daughter? I whispered” I had tucked my gun away, but he knew the threat was ever present.

He quickly shook his head.

“Then let’s go”

I watched him fumble with his keys for a minute. I waited for any sign of a double move.

None came as he swung the door open.

“It’s in a safe in my room. Just please let me go up there and get it down, man. My daughter is sleeping right there in the next room.”

“No” I snarled in such a cold, merciless tone that even I couldn’t believe those words had come out of my mouth.

We slowly walked up the small staircase. I could feel him tense up as we walked past his daughter’s room. It was his protective instinct firing up. He was ready to assault me at the first inclination that I would be heading towards her.

Having no interest in activating Justin’s parental instinct and potentially starting a fight, I didn’t even look towards his daughter’s room.

We made it to his room. I had my weapon pointed at him as he slowly opened his bedroom drawer.

“Remember, if you try anything funny. It’s over.”

He nodded and I heard the soft tap and electronic click as he opened the small safe box.

And slowly reached in for a green piece of fabric. Even in the dark room, I could tell what it was. It glowed slightly, illuminating the same fractal pattern I had on mine. A high-pitched hum seemed to emanate from it.

I reached my right hand to grab the green fabric. It had the same soft touch as mine. I quickly pocketed it.

“Are you happy?” He let out an exasperated whisper.

“Not yet. This never happened, okay? Do not come looking for me.” I already knew he had no plans to ever seek me out again.

“I am going to leave your phone at the end of your street inside the mailbox. Wait five minutes before you leave to go get it.”

He nodded before crumpling to the floor.

The final words Justin said to me as I walked out his room are forever burned into my memory.

‘Yo-you’re a fucking monster’

The words bounced around my head as I left the house and began running as far away from the scene of the crime as possible.

After making it to a nearby shopping area, I quickly grabbed my phone and called an uber to the pickup destination for the game.

I felt both of the flags in my hand and a surreal, out-of-body sensation as I remembered what I had done.

I felt disgusted beyond belief at my actions…At least part of me did. The other viewed it as survival of the fittest. I needed the money… and I did everything possible to make it mine.

“I have a hundred dollar tip for you if you sit here and wait 5 minutes” I said to my driver as I shuffled out of his Prius. I had no idea what was in store for me and wanted at least one person nearby in case I needed help.

He looked up and nodded. I could tell he had no interest in my situation, just making his money for the night and going home. It was almost a relieving feeling.

I walked into the main door of a large warehouse. My entrance led me to a small office room that was connected to it via a large double door.

Greeting me was my unnamed maintenance man sitting at the receptionist desk. Instead of the outfit I had initially seen him in, he wore a black suit this time. He did still have the same pair of sunglasses…..

He was staring exactly at the door as I walked in as if he was expecting company.

“For you” he said in a monotone as he motioned to the briefcase sitting in front of him at the desk.

He clicked it open to reveal it was filled with crisp dollar bills in several stacks.

“That’s it? How do you even know I have the flags?” I was taken off guard by how nonchalant he was.

“Well, Ivan…” He started in the same voice that made me shiver like an ice cube was dropped in my shirt.

“We made a prediction…and it turned out to be correct.”

I stood there in confusion.

“What was your prediction? You thought I was going to win? How did you know I was going to be here right at this second?”

I continued, further enraged by his lack of response, “tell me what the fuck is going on here? You predicted I was going to rob this fucking dude at gunpoint? What did you predict, you asshole?”

He remained expressionless, the same smile stretching his pale face apart.

I pointed my gun at him with hands that didn’t even feel like my own. I was consumed by rage. Fuelled by a deep sense of self hate and shame.

I couldn’t blame myself… he was the one who made me play this game…he turned me into a monster.

“Did you predict I was going to do this?”

He simply nodded and said, “Go ahead, Ivan. Shoot”

I took the bait and fired two of the pepper spray rounds right at his head. They both missed, hitting the back wall of the room.

My eyes were wide, I backed up to the door.

“You didn’t have much time to practice with that, did you?”

I steadied my aim and fired again, this time, hitting directly on the right lens of his sunglasses. The force was enough to blow them right off of his face.

That was the worst decision of my life….behind those lenses…was just smooth, pale skin. No eyes… no eye sockets…nothing.

The cloud of pepper spray from the shot had no effect either. I quickly began to cough and wheeze as smell entered my nostrils but didn't even hear a peep from him

I shuddered violently, my brain working overtime to find a logical answer as to what this thing was. He had no eyes, but I could still feel him looking at me…studying me as all my senses were assaulted by the pepper spray.

“What the fuck are you?” I screamed.

No response. My voice fell to a barely audible whisper.

“Ho-how much of this did you predict?”

He answered this time.

“All of it”

…

My parents were grateful beyond belief to receive the money. They knew nothing of the game I played and what I had to do to win it. I simply told them that I had won the money in the lottery.

Despite what the gnawing feeling in my stomach told me, there was no catch. The money wasn’t counterfeit. I was never caught by the police and Justin never came looking for me. The only repercussion I faced was losing my job at the bank for abandoning my post, but that hardly mattered to me anymore.

My dad chastised me for a bit about the lottery being ‘an idiot tax’ but was still immensely grateful to receive the money. The relief on his eyes when he saw the money almost made everything worth it.

Almost.

I spent a lot of time pondering what it was that happened to me. What the game was for and who that creature was that was organizing it.

I could only come up with one explanation. One that filled me to my core with a lingering sense of dread.

Whatever that thing was…it was testing me. Every move I made. Every move Justin made. My paranoid descent into a cold-blooded criminal….down to the exact moment I walked into that building to collect my money.

But why would it go through all the effort to organize this game when it already knew every move we would make?

It's the exact same reason why scientist runs an experiment even they're sure they know the results...to confirm a hypothesis.

z3da2x,1,2022-11-24,Dad doesn't want me to delay graduation to do an internship,Just-Reindeer3269,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/z3da2x/dad_doesnt_want_me_to_delay_graduation_to_do_an/,"Hello all, 

I desperately need advice on this situation. 

I'm currently a college student studying engineering and currently I am in a co-op program ( essentially a multi-session internship program) with an engineering company and have finished the first session with them this summer. If I continue with the co-op program, I would be working next semester, and I have already promised them this summer that I would be continuing. 

However, my father doesn't want me to continue the co-op program because he believe that if I graduate even a semester later, I'll be at a way bigger disadvantage because he believes that there are less jobs available for winter grads ( I personally don't believe this to be true since a lot of companies, especially for engineering positions, start hiring as early as before the start of school). The thing is though, he doesn't really understand the engineering field but believes that he does and thus doesn't understand how important real-world experiences like internships are for engineers. 

I think the root of this problem is that he doesn't believe that I'll succeed at this field, and thanks to him, now I'm having doubts about my decision too. 

To most, this might not seem like a very big deal. However, my father is unexplainably stubborn and uptight about little things like this. And when he gets upset, he can get violent. So while I'm 70% sure that I'll continue with the co-op program even with his opposition, I'm afraid of what he would do once he finds out that I'm disobeying him. He might even disown me. Again, I don't care too much about cutting ties with him to be honest, it's my mom and my siblings that I'm worried about. I'm afraid that he might blame my mom for me disobeying him and get violent with her in front of my siblings. 

With that said, I'm seeking ways to convince him that doing the co-op program is the right option here and honestly any insights on this situation would be appreciated. 

Thank you!"

I'm currently in an international A-Level school and would probably like to study economics since I enjoy learning and understanding the theory behind different, well, theories on it, though I'm really not certain about it yet (hence why I chose Dartmouth for ED- open curriculum).

Demographics: International :P, come from two under-represented european countries and until recently lived in a small urban-rural area. Though I recently had to move in with my grandparents because of a really tough family situation, so now I'm in a RURAL rural area in eastern europe. Both where I used to live and where I live now are pretty under-represented countries, though the first one (where I listed as my permanent address) is seriously under-represented (something like less than 60 students in the US).

Academics

A Levels: Math, Further Maths, Physics and Economics with A and A\* predicted

SAT: Applied test-optional since SAT isn't offered where I am right now

&amp;#x200B;

Extracurriculars:

* Career's Ambassador for Sixth Form: basically an elected role where I worked with my school's career department to organize meetings between professionals involved in different fields and our sixth form. I also talked in a supplement about organizing meetings for people who had interests the school never provided help for before (eg getting a meeting with a UK army officer- kind of uncommon for an international school focused on getting people into unis).
* International Economics Olympiad Team Captain: Not the actual International Economics Olympiad (since it's not organized where I am 😥). It was an EU wide national competition, we got into the quarter-finals
* M3 Mathworks Competition Team Member: Represented my school at the MATLAB M3 competition,  developed graphical approximations using MATLAB and Simulink to solve real-world statistical analysis problems in 5 person team for 12-hr competition (that was a painful day, though actually really fun). Sadly we didn't win.
* Head and Mentor in a Peer Mentoring Program:  Developed a peer mentoring system guiding 14 younger students in maths while also providing safe access to personal mental health resources.    I mentioned why I started it in my supplemental (pretty personal reason don't want to say it here), but now I see that a bunch of people already do this and it kind of seems like a common ""thing"" for people to do to look good for AO's? I really don't know if this is good now as I was actually serious about making the mentoring system at the time, since my school didn't have a system in place to help people who were struggling, though it now seems that a ton of people do it without actually being serious about it. Would that dilute the importance of this in an AO's eyes?/ 6hr a week
* Informational Head of Student Leadership Team: Launched 3 workshop events per month; 60 student average attendance; 14 UK + EU university seminars; Professional meetups withupwards of 30 guests (a bit like icebreaking sessions where everyone went around meeting different professionals- and basically trying to secure internships :P)
* Head of Economics Discussion Society:  Launched out-of-school club with 5 classmates; Developed candidate articles for newspapers; Debated current events to expand economicsunderstanding. This was just a fun little thing me and some friends did to nerd out about econ,
* Swimming: Swam at competitive skill level, currently preparing for open-air competition at the local regional level.
* Volunteer on Local Community Farm (owned by neighbour): Provided physical and logistical assistance; Preparing supplies for 20 households in need over the winter; Initiated cultivation of 6 new crop species. It's owned by my grandparents' neighbour and I got involved since the region where I am is incredibly poor. I listed \~9 hours every week, but that's probably an understatement due to the sheer amount of work needed all the time
* Ukraine Aid Drive Volunteer: Worked at a hospital's donation checkpoint as a physical labor and organization volunteer for a month after the invasion. We sent around $80,000 worth of aid, and it meant a lot to me on a personal level even though it wasn't for very long.
* STEP Club: Informal lunchtime meetings with a few classmates and a teacher, we did Cambridge STEP problems to better understand mathematical theory with concepts taught at a university level

Some other stuff:

Summer 2021: Attended a summer program at Imperial College London on physics

Speak 4 languages? (it's nothing that interesting)

Essays:

My Common App wasn't anything special, I didn't do anything quirky just wrote about how I developed the confidence to grow closer with my grandparents and the community they live with after not seeing them for two years. I didn't go into the whole ""admiring grandparent"" thing either, I kept it focused on myself and how I developed through my time here.

I thought my supplementals were good (but now kinda meh after seeing this sub), wrote my self-introduction about my love for economics and hiking while the impact essay elaborated on the extracurriculars I did which involved helping others. The ""why school"" was pretty standard too though personal to me, I talked about getting involved in farming and economics discussion clubs at Dartmouth if I attended.

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher recommendations also good I think (though I didn't read them):

1. From my old English teacher at GCSE, we're really close and kept in touch even after I moved away
2. My old Maths teacher for A-Level, she seems to know the US admissions process so I'm pretty sure she wrote a good one? We weren't too close but still vibed pretty well outside of lessons so I figured to ask her

Peer rec 9/10 all I remember is crying while reading it and now I don't have the confidence to look at it again 😀

&amp;#x200B;

I applied since I really like the school but it seems like a far stretch since my EC's aren't impressive or detailed at all- I just did what I was passionate about and interested in at the time (didn't even think about US admissions at that point). Though I still feel like my profile is lacking a bit for a school of Dartmouth's caliber. Any thoughts? (and thanks for them!)"

At the start of this week I was assigned a task that involves optimizing one of our Python scripts that interacts with Redis. Now I want to mention that I was originally hired with the expectation to mainly work on C/C++ code and my only experience in Python has been writing very rudimentary programs in freshman year classes. Nevertheless I was open to doing this task because I saw it as an opportunity to get more familiar with Python as that could never hurt.

Anyways as I started getting more involved I found that I am absolutely out of my depth with some of the stuff going on within these Python modules. I think I have a solid understanding of OOD but I just have no idea wtf is happening with a lot of the syntax. I started reaching out to the senior dev that wrote these scripts a while ago for help explaining some of the elements and he has been very helpful indeed. He has been giving me pointers here and there as to what to write and what some of the components are doing, but I still feel super lost. I try my best to google stuff on my own before going to him for issues but I'm afraid it's starting to come off as if he's doing the task and I'm just writing the code that he comes up with.

I'm wondering if my behaviour is considered annoying, and if I should just nut up and figure this out on my own or give up the task for someone else to do. Thanks."

z3h1vk,1,2022-11-24,Should I switch jobs for the sake of getting more experience?,Top_Bodybuilder8001,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/z3h1vk/should_i_switch_jobs_for_the_sake_of_getting_more/,"I was a late bloomer and graduated from college at 28 yo with an engineering degree. Then I spent a few years working odd jobs while taking care of a sick family member in a small town. Finally, needing to move on with my life I got the job I have now.

It was initially hard getting a job in my field with the professional gap from college to then, but I had some good research positions and a couple of Fortune 500 company internships.

The job I found was at a very small company. I only planned on staying a couple of years to acquire experience and move on. However, 2020 happened and no one knew what was going to happen. During this time, I worked on myself personally and professionally, gaining so much ground I'm barely the same person I was before. This growth was not unnoticed by my employer, who gave me raises and a promotion as the business grew. I've been there a little over 6 years now.

Has the business grown. We've quadrupled in workforce and tripled in revenue. It's been a deep learning experience and I've grown to like my job. I'm in a leadership position of a company expanding from a tiny local team to one spread across the US. I get paid a fair, livable wage of $75k plus annual bonus, and am developing the company tech systems, managing regulatory operations, and am a technical leader of standard operations.

My jobs is incredibly flexible, I set my own schedule, have a nice corner office facing a wooded area and a small lake, and the work info is meaningful to the success of the company.

Still, I wonder if staying at this job is killing my professional future. Will companies even look at my resume if I stay with the same company for 10 years? Especially since it is my primary experience outside of college. Do I need to switch jobs for the sake of switching jobs even though I kind of like mine?

A corporate job will likely offer better benefits and lateral growth. My boss will likely be more professional, encouraging me to grow so even more. The tech and systems will be more complex.

Even so, if I knew I wasn't killing my professional career and helping it by staying at this company, I wouldn't consider leaving. I really like the freedom and meaningful impact.

Do I need to switch jobs to stay professionally relevant?"
z3h7wi,63,2022-11-24,Is PhD level recruitment for non-research job bound to disappear (soon) ?,FallUpJV,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/z3h7wi/is_phd_level_recruitment_for_nonresearch_job/,"Let me explain my situation : I live in western Europe and am about to graduate for my master's degree in AI from a big university.

My biggest strength would be software engineering. Also with the many math courses I had in uni I can definitely work with graduate level calculus/algebra/statistics. 

I landed a ""research intern"" internship (internship is mandatory to complete graduation) in a big company, let's say FAANG level. 

I don't know if I will be willing to continue in research after that though. But from what I've been told about the company's recruitment policy, most of their machine learning engineers also have a PhD.

When I read opinions on Reddit (so I assume mostly from America), most people advise not to go for a PhD if I don't want to do research. So my question is, both for Americans and Europeans, do most big companies ask for PhDs for MLE jobs ? Or is it a barrier that tends to disappear these days ?"

I graduated computer science at the start of 2020, right when the pandemic started and couldn't get a job, let alone an internship since. I started an MBA in 2021 that I'm almost done with now(it would take too long to explain but I had no choice).

Other than a couple of internships before the pandemic, I have no experience. I'm still looking for internships but even they reject me. I don't know what to do or if there are some programming language certificates I should get to be employable. I have no one to advise me about this in my life. I want to work in tech and use that 4 years that I spent in uni.

Any advice would be appreciated.

tl;dr, graduated CS right before the pandemic, no experience since then, almost three years now and I need a job."

z3jyry,50,2022-11-24,Rant: SCALER is becoming annoying with its phone calls day-by-day,siiingintherain,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/z3jyry/rant_scaler_is_becoming_annoying_with_its_phone/,"Not sure if it was posted here before, but I wanted to share this.

I had attended a hackathon organized by Scaler a few months back. We did decently well and were in the Top 10. Since Scaler was sponsoring the event, they gave discounts to their courses for each of the top teams. There were people in the event who we could approach for career guidance if we needed.

Fast forward 2-3 weeks, I got a call from them. They verified my name, college, where I work (I don't remember if I shared it with them during the hackathon, but let's leave that aside for now). They asked what I was working on, tech stack, job satisfaction, short-term and long-term goals and what not. The conversation went like an interview and towards the end of the call, they started to market their courses and persuaded me to join one of them.

Their whole point was I was not working in a FAANG/MAANG or equivalent company. I told them I like my present workplace and am satisfied with what I am doing in life. I work in a growing startup (4 year old) with \~100 people. I get to learn new stuff, own a lot of things (I was owning the entire backend of the core systems of our major product). For reference, I have \~1.5 yoe. Pay is also pretty decent and I have no complaints about it.

Now, after I told all this to them, they were pushing me to join their courses and that I'd have a dedicated mentor, work on a lot of cutting edge tech and that'd be helpful in ""getting a high paying job in MAANG"". Yes, this was their only premise and they were trying to come to that point in a few different ways.

They made statements like ""People with similar experience as you are making more"", ""Devs with 4-5 yoe are making 50lpa working in MAANG"" and were trying to make me think that I am underpaid (I don't feel that way) and I can't make good money if I continue to do what I'm doing.

I didn't want to sound harsh, so I refused in the most polite way I could. I declined their offer to join their courses and told them I'll get in touch in them if I would want to sometime in future.

Few days later, someone from their team calls me and starts asking the same thing. I told them I spoke to someone in their team just a few days back and also told them that I don't have interest in joining SCALER nor MAANG companies. The call ended quickly.

Fast forward to today, a different person called me started asking the same stuff. My current workplace, where I studied, how much I make etc and I asked them why is that needed and what are they going to do with that. They told me they're trying to make an analysis based on study place, yoe and pay. I told them I would not like to disclose my pay. Then the good old ""What are your short-term and long-term goals"" question. At this point, I was annoyed and didn't want to take the conversation any further. I told them I haven't thought about that much and currently doing good and not looking for any switch.

They started calling out my ambitions/goals and asked me ""How come you don't have career goals? Everyone has it these days"", ""Everyone wants to join MAANG, it's surprising why you don't want to"". I told them I didn't feel like applying and I had applied to Amazon for an internship in college but haven't got back (of course, that's the norm xD). I then interviewed at my current workplace and since then I've been working here till date.

Now that I gave this answer, then the conversation took a different route. They started telling ""People are predicting recessions in a few months, tech layoffs and freezing is happening and people want to join big product companies(they were referring to MAANG here, of course) and make good money"". I was getting frustrated and wanted to end the call abruptly, but I held on and told them, ""I'm fine now, haven't thought about my future a lot and have no interest applying to MAANG right now"". The conversation ended right there.

I slighly regret going to their hackathon (that's where they got my info) now. Why do they think it's okay to continuously keep calling people from different numbers when someone shows absolutely zero interest towards them? Nothing personal against them, but I'm thinking if their managers even realize this could endup like BYJUs if they keep pushing their staff to make calls like this?

End of rant. Thanks for making it till here.

TL;DR: Getting annoyed by calls from SCALER asking them to join their courses to get a high paying MAANG job

I am in the end of 5th sem (exams starting in a couple of weeks). I have recently been looking into MS options abroad. It seems I need research papers published and research internships to get selected into good schools. 

My main problems are:

1. I have no idea how to get into research. I don't know of any researches in my college. I wanted to apply to Indian Academy of Science for summer internships in research, but missed the last date. How do I get into research? Are research internships during the summer the only way, or are there other ways to go about it too? I literally don't know anything at all about research, so please help.
2. I feel that I am too late. People start preparing for higher studies abroad from their 1st year and here I am in middle of 3rd year not knowing where to start. How late am I and how do I make up for it (if it is possible to make up at all)? If it is too late already, I'd rather start focus on getting off-campus placements.

Thanks a ton!"

Intuit: 

       $46/hour

       Mountain View

       12 weeks

       NOT LEGALLY CONFIRMED (but historically Intuit covers):

                 Corporate housing

                 Relocation

                 Transportation

        My recruiter has told me they are still sorting through this and historically interns get these benefits but he told me he is using a certain language as to not 100% guarantee.

Capital One:

       $55/hour

       Dallas/Plano

       10 weeks

        Corporate Housing


If all of the unconfirmed benefits are offered, I would definitely choose intuit because I would have slightly more money after tax at the end of the summer and I would be in California. The thing is my recruiter for intuit says they are still sorting those benefits out. I don’t want to sign the offer until I have all the information but I am afraid I will have to. In this case what should I do? The safe bet would be to sign Capital One because without the intuit benefits I get more money. A good bet that could pay off is signing with intuit and hoping that that will continue to offer the same benefits they did before covid. Can anyone offer some takes?"

Another question I have is that apparently if you have a p\*ssy, then you can get an extra sum of money (I think 3k?) from Concordia itself not Quebec government. Do I need to apply for that as well? If so how? Or is it automatically given to me?

I'm a student in Sweden and I've been offered a part-time internship at a large financial institution. It is more or less only known in Scandinavia. This will be a software engineering role during 3 month or 6 months. I really enjoy the company and I am a customer so the work would feel meaningful.

Since I'm a freshman I have no previous experience. They job is 20 hours a week. But the pay is 11,5 USD / Hour. Which feels like working for free. 

Will it be worth it? Will the experience be something valuable for recruiters outside Sweden?

Ever since I was little I loved computers and the way they worked so when I had to choose a bachelor my choice was clear back then. I started my IT study and now I am almost graduated. But ever since I did my first internship my love for this field has been slowly dissapearing. I think I am not the first person to post that they lost the love for their work, but the thought of continuing this career makes me anxious and depressed. I feel like a imposter among professionals and the whole personality that comes with this type of work just isn't me.

I've been getting very interested in psychology and physiology. the thought of becoming a psychologist or something in that field sounds exiting to me. Ever since I had my first doubts I have been looking into this field. The problem is that it's a complete 180 from what I am doing now and will require years of studying. I also want to move out and that brings responsibilities.  And how do I know I won't lose my love for this field as well?

I was wondering if there has been anyone in the same position as me and did either do the change or sticked with it and made it work out?

I have to clarify, as of now I'm not thinking of quitting, as I am very close to getting my diploma. I have considered getting successful in my own field and then hoping for fewer workdays or early retirement. I'ts an option but I find having a fulfilling career a important part of life and I think becoming good in psychology is a thing I would really like to achieve.

z3ny8s,216,2022-11-24,"3 internship offers, 2 WFH and 1 in person hybrid",imnotrishi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z3ny8s/3_internship_offers_2_wfh_and_1_in_person_hybrid/,"I need help deciding what to do because I am at a loss. I have an offer from 3 different companies. 

Company 1:
-Fully remote 
-pays 24/hr
-seems like a good company to work at for a career but not really for internship 
-1 week at the end of summer where we have to go in person to present 
-super helpful and everyone loved their job
-super communicative throughout the interview process
-mobile dev most likely 

Company 2:
-Fully Remote
-pays 27-29 an hour based on how many credits I complete by summer
-one week where I go in person at end of summer
-company does not seem too capable as the entire interview process was really unorganized and confusing
-solutions engineer

Company 3:
-in person hybrid (around 2hours from current home)
-35/hr
-big investment/banking company 
-interviewed through a referral 
-hires around 200-300 interns a year 
-no housing assistance
-unknown yet possible fullstack development?

All are around 40 hours a week. 

I do not know what to do as I’ve said yes to company 1 and 2 and company 3 is waiting on a response. 

I really like company 1 but the pay is extremely low compared to others and money would be really useful

Was thinking of possibly doing company 1 and 2 at the same time as opposed to company 3 alone since it’s in person. 

What’re your thoughts on this and what should I do?


Edit: My referral at company 3 really enjoyed the position and highly recommends I do it but the only issue is having to move to a brand new location where I know no one. Also having to buy all new appliances, driving around more, paying bills like internet and housing seem very unappealing to me. Although I feel like I will most likely learn the most at company 3. 

How do I combat the anxiety/fear of going to an unknown place leaving all my friends, family, and gf behind.

My parents are also highly against me moving out as opposed to WFH."

This is also my last internship before I graduate. I was wondering what others would choose, given the following details:

**Arista Networks**

* Pay is $43.27/hour with $2,000 relocation
* Location is Santa Clara, CA (HQ)
* All the usual workplace perks like intern events, snacks, gym access, etc
* I enjoyed networks in college and wanted to apply my skills or gain valuable knowledge in industry. Feel like this would give me a broader skillset in Software Engineering (previous internships did full-stack, web development, etc) I also see Arista as a great company that is doing well in their respective markets.

**Intuit**

* Pay is $44/hour with company provided housing
* Location is Mountain View, CA (HQ)
* All the usual workplace perks like intern events, snacks, gym access, etc
* Feel like I would be doing the usual cloud and application development, so not super excited about the work (although this is just speculation). The Intuit name brand is pretty good though so idk about this one.

Essentially I feel like both are great opportunities and not sure what to choose. Since I am looking to work in the Bay Area and hopefully get a return offer, both are great for that as well. Seeking outside opinions.

z3q0wf,310,2022-11-24,"A Summary of My Internship Hunt for Summer 2023: Profile, Timelines, Thoughts, Application Process Difficulty Ratings, and What I Have Learned",kunriuss,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/z3q0wf/a_summary_of_my_internship_hunt_for_summer_2023/,"Hi csMajors!

I have found these types of posts very helpful during my internship hunt, so I decided to share my very own internship hunting journey this season. I hope that this will be helpful to shed some light onto what you can expect of the interviews of the mentioned companies or other companies in general!

I was planning to dive into more details (wrote like 4,000 words lol but I think that is too risky and can be doxxed) for each of the application process, but I was wary of NDA-stuff so I am just going to provide the timeline for each and rate the difficulty of the process (behavioral, technical OA, technical interview, math if applicable) from 1 to 10, 1 being the easiest and 10 being the hardest. For example, a “1” behavioral question is like “Why us?” type of questions, and a 10 behavioral question is like “If you are put on Mars for a day, what kind of technology will you build (and with what tech stack and why), how would you choose your teammates, and how would you handle the conflicts with aliens?” type of questions. Likewise, a 1 technical question is like a fizzbuzz question, and a 10 technical question is like a leetcode DP hard question. Not the best way to shed light onto the application processes, but I will try my best (note that these are my personal experience, YMMV). For the offers, the compensation packages are the same as the ones listed on levels.fyi.

# Background:

**Education**: Junior majoring in honors math and CS at a T15 school (originally math, decided to add a second major in CS in sophomore year), not particularly known for its CS program. I have taken classes like discrete math, data structures, and software design along with quite a few upper-level math classes for my honors track.

**Experience**: 1 paid internship with a local startup in my home country (I’m international, so I do need sponsorship) that specializes in AI/ML products (I was on the NLP team), 1 unpaid internship with an organization that promotes the education of CS to young people (I was on the AI team with a bit of leadership responsibility), 1 paid research position at my university (leading a team that does computer vision research), 1 paid TA position at my university for 2 math classes.

**Projects**: 2 data analysis projects that revolved around video games (1 is a Discord bot, the other one was a deep learning model that I made from scratch), 1 fullstack app (a phone-calling app) using MERN, and 1 game/simulation that I made in Python.

**Edit:** Since someone asked for me anonymized **resume**, here it is [https://imgur.com/4gRBxKm](https://imgur.com/4gRBxKm). Note that it is a bit different since I slightly modified it since I applied at the start of the season.

# Statistics:

For this season, I applied to around 200 internship programs, got around 20-30 OAs, had around 10 interview callbacks, and 8 “virtual” onsite interviews. In the end, I was able to get 5 offers.

**Mandatory leetcode stats**: 124 easies, 217 medium, 18 hards, knight badge. I exclusively used Python for leetcode and interviews. I mostly used Neetcode to guide my prep.

**CodeSignal**: 843

I was able to get all test cases passed for all of my OAs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Application process for companies that I got quite deeply into the process:

# Bank of America

**Position:** Global Quantitative Summer Analyst

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (6/21) → video interview invitation via Hirevue (7/6) → complete video interview (7/9) → final round invitation (7/20) → superday interviews (7/27) → **offer** via email (8/12)

**Thoughts:** I was surprised at the interview process because it was almost entirely behavioral (with just a few soft technical questions about my projects during the superday). This was my first offer of the season, so I was ecstatic, and it had definitely helped boost my morale.

**Behavioral:** 6/10

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** 1/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Palantir

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (7/14) → Karat interview invitation (7/15) → Karat interview (7/21) → Karat interview redo (7/22) – virtual onsite invitation (8/1) → virtual onsite (8/11) → **rejection** via email (8/15)

**Thoughts:** This is one of the more “technical” interview processes that I had had so far, so I was pretty nervous. There was system design involved, and I was not fully prepared for it. It felt bad when I got rejected after being able to get to the onsite, but I had to learn to be numb to that feeling and try my best for my upcoming interviews.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** 7/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Two Sigma

**Position:** Quantitative Researcher Intern

**Timeline:** Apply online without referral (6/28) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/8) → OA completed (7/14) → data analysis interview invitation (8/5) → data analysis interview (8/18) → virtual onsite interview invitation (8/31) → virtual onsite interview (9/8) → **rejection** via email (9/8)

**Thoughts:** I was hoping that I can get a quant internship, so I was very nervous yet excited about this one, but I got grilled by the math questions. It was quite demoralizing and I regret not studying enough to be prepared for the core statistics, but at the same time, it made me realize the knowledge that I lack so that I can focus on studying them the next time around.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** 6/10

**Technical Interview:** 5/10

**Math:** 10/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Amazon

**Position:** Software Development Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (6/24) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/18) → OA completed (8/1) → virtual onsite invitation (8/2) → additional availability request (9/14) → virtual onsite interview (9/22) → portal updated (10/4) → **offer** via portal (10/5)

**Thoughts:** Man, this was a wild ride. This is the only FAANG that I could get an interview from (I know, I know, it’s Amazon, but still) so I was very excited and did not want to let this slip away. I still remember frantically refreshing the portal and the reddit thread to check for any portal updates lol. Very proud of myself for this one since compensation is fantastic!

**Behavioral:** 7/10

**Technical OA:** 4/10

**Technical Interview:** 2/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Iron Galaxy Studios

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Career fair (9/22) → on-campus interview (9/23) → **ghosted**

**Thoughts:** This is one of the booths that I came to introduce myself during my school’s career fair, and the recruiter there was incredibly enthusiastic about the company! I did not plan to apply in the first place, but the recruiter’s incredible pitch about the company convinced me otherwise. Overall a unique and fun experience, but I never heard back from them.

**Behavioral:** 5/10

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** N/A

&amp;#x200B;

# Goldman Sachs

**Position:** Summer Analyst, Engineering Division (Quantitative Strategies)

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (7/1) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/5) → OA completed (7/12) → Hirevue interview invitation (9/2) → Hirevue completed (9/4) → virtual onsite interview invitation (9/21) → virtual onsite interview (9/28) → **offer** via phone call (10/7)

**Thoughts:** This is a rather lengthy process as the gap between the OA and the interviews were more than 2 months, but it was easy to navigate overall. Was definitely very excited to get the offer, since I felt like my math preparation had paid off and that I was at least somewhat prepared for quant roles.

**Behavioral:** 5/10

**Technical OA:** 3/10

**Technical Interview:** 4/10

**Math:** 6/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Roblox

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (8/4) → CodeSignal and Cognitive OA invitation (8/5) → both OA completed (8/19) → virtual onsite interview invitation (9/7) → virtual onsite interview rescheduled (9/30) → virtual onsite interview (10/17) → **offer** via phone call (10/20)

**Thoughts:** To be honest, this is a very streamlined and straightforward recruiting process (lowkey enjoyed the OA), although I did not prepare much for the onsite because I had already got Amazon at the time and was burnt out quite badly. Was quite surprised to get the offer, and the compensation as well as perks absolutely blew my mind!

**Behavioral:** 7/10

**Technical OA:** 5/10

**Technical Interview:** 7/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Hudson River Trading

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (8/3) → CodeSignal OA invitation (8/16) → OA completed (8/19) → interview invitation (10/20) → interview (11/9) → **rejection** via email (11/10)

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to get this one since I wanted to break into HFTs, so I spent a whole week going through OS and networking concepts without previous exposure to them. Got grilled hard in the interview, so rejection was expected. At least now my OS class next semester will be easier to deal with.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** 5/10

**Technical Interview:** 11/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Tiktok

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern, Search Engine Team

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (9/9) → Hackerrank OA invitation (9/30) → OA completed (10/7) → first interview invitation (10/13) → second interview invitation (10/17) → first interview (10/28) → second interview (11/7) → **offer** via phone call (11/23)

**Thoughts:** The interview was quite late into the season and I was busy preparing for HRT’s OS and networking interviews, so I did not prepare that much for Tiktok’s interviews. I didn’t think my interviews were good honestly and was not satisfied with my solutions, so I was really surprised that I got the offer.

**Behavioral:** 8/10

**Technical OA:** 10/10

**Technical Interview:** 6/10

&amp;#x200B;

Phew, what a crazy rollercoaster of emotions, especially after getting 400+ rejections last season without a single interview offer from U.S. companies! In the end, I have decided to go with **Roblox** for its amazing work culture, interesting projects and tech, great WLB, fun internship program, and incredible compensation/perks!

Things that I have learned along the way:

* The hardest part is to pass the resume screening process. I have revised my resume many times, and I settled with a resume that uses Jake’s Resume template in LaTeX. Using a simple format like that allowed me to focus my time on buffing the meat of the resume (i.e. the textual content), not the layout or design. I used the STAR method, fancy words, and numerical metrics to make the bullet points stood out.
* Previous experience is not required, but it really helps tremendously. I populated my resume with positions that I could find within my university, and they really helped.
* Cover letters are pretty useless and a waste of time
* Referrals can help indeed, but without them I could still get far into the application processes, so don’t sweat them too much
* International students have it rough, but I wouldn’t let that kill my American Dream. Automatic rejections because of the sponsorship question happened a lot, but I tried to compensate for that with a well-crafted resume with relevant work experience and personal projects.
* Applying early (mid-late June) has been the biggest factor that helped, especially in this troubling economy since many companies like Amazon and Roblox had reached headcount earlier than usual
* Behavioral interview preparation is underrated. I spent a lot of time preparing for my behavioral interviews (I legit have 20 pages worth of notes for my behaviorals and I practiced them frequently in front of a mirror lol), and it surely made a difference especially when I am not the type of person that feel comfortable talking to new people
* Neetcode is an incredible teacher and leetcode mediums were my best friends
* Rejections hurt, but I have grown to feel numb about them which actually helped a lot. Waiting for that email from a specific company every day might do more harm than good
* My GPA has tanked a bit, but that’s okay
* A leetcode a day keeps the unemployment away
* Leetcode premium is a very good investment if I can afford it
* Leetcode assessments are very good for practicing OA under time pressure
* Having a leetcode study buddy is incredibly helpful to keep myself and my motivation in check
* Getting familiar with the coding environment of the OAs helped a lot with debugging
* For CodeSignal specifically, the first 2 questions are fairly easy, the 3rd question is implementation-heavy (i.e. have to write a lot of code, not necessarily hard), and the 4th question is algorithm-heavy (to avoid TLE). The recommended 1 then 2 then 4 then 3 order of solving helps since I ended up using half of my completion time on question 3.
* I commented my code in my OAs, not sure if anyone took a look but I don't think that would hurt
* Keeping the communication going even when I’m stuck in technical interviews. Some interviewers really appreciated the fact that I conveyed my ideas clearly and continuously, and they were willing to step in if my ideas were not in the right track
* If possible, use the whiteboard feature in Zoom or Coderpad or Hackerrank to explain my ideas to the interviewer. A picture worth a thousand words as they say
* Asking a lot of clarifying questions before diving into the implementation to clear up any miscommunications and/or traps in the question’s wording. It also shows that I am engaged and thought thoroughly about the edge cases, which is always a good thing for being a good engineer
* Weight the upsides and downsides (time complexities, space complexities, etc.) of different implementation approaches before coding
* Take the interviewer’s hints and suggestions constructively, they probably know more than I do
* Try to be personable and come across as a person that the interviewer wants to work with in the future. They might not admit it outright, but subconsciously they might have more inclination to vouch for me favorably
* Ask good questions at the end to demonstrate my interest in the position. I prepared the questions by reading about the company as well as the job description of the role
* I always wear my lucky suit for my interviews, maybe it helped as I felt more confident and calm

Thank you for taking the time to read my post in its entirety, and I hope that it has been somewhat helpful to you! Keep up the grind, and don’t give up."

I’m in my second year and it got me thinking that I am not good enough for CS, and I worry that I won’t get the higher marks for the upcoming assignments, even if it was after January, or third or fourth year. Not to mention that I’m also worrying about internships.

z3sz1j,12,2022-11-24,Looking for advice,MartinMegazord,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/z3sz1j/looking_for_advice/,"Hello there,

I am actually python developer with some knowledge about the world devops. I am writing this post for share my situation and maybe get some advice.

I started as intern in this little company ( i am still an intern after 8 months ), literally i started from zero all the cloud world ( azure cloud ) and learn all alone Devops, Docker, Automatism ecc.. and i have to say, i like this stuff, i created pipelines for my project that deploy over the development and production enviroiment,helped to deploy the apk of our product on the appCenter (all alone so maybe someone more experct could do a better work, but hey at least it works) and toher stuff like that. 

The fact is i wanna learn more and maybe be good like some folks in this subreddit ( i love it), but my company is old style and is hard bring all the stuff i am learning ( yes, tons of theory and little courses/tutorial ). So i am trying to change my job and join some company that actually need a devops figure ( junior obv).

Now the real question is, if you are a devops senior that want hire a junior figure, what did you expect from him, like what attitude is a must have,or tecnology in the field? 

Thank you"
z3szob,9,2022-11-24,Giving my thanks.,sk_dastaan,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/z3szob/giving_my_thanks/,"After months of applying, giving OAs, interviews, and getting rejected, realize I should be thankful that I was able to get internship offers in this market.

Being an international student with 2 years of FAANG experience, I was quickly humbled when got rejects left and right, or worse, was ghosted.

I guess what I'll say is keep going at it, and apply as much as you can. Getting offers is a right balance to talent, effort, and luck, so you never know when these 3 are gonna align. (almost) Every OA makes you smarter, (almost) every interview adds value.

It's still a long way to summer. Keep trying. But don't do it because this subreddit said so. Do so because you want to. It's more fun that way.

z3udsa,7,2022-11-24,Should I go to grad school? Or take the job?,throwaway_gradhelp,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/z3udsa/should_i_go_to_grad_school_or_take_the_job/,"I'm an undergraduate student graduating in about a month. I accepted an offer to join a rotational analyst program with a very high Fortune 500 company in July. I want to explore/learn more about the subfields of my ideal field, and a company like this is perfect to do that in as a stepping stone to my final eventual goal, working at one of the big tech companies. Also, being qualified for this is absolutely insane and mind-blowing to me.

However, I got the F500 offer about two weeks ago, and until then, I had focused my applications about 70% on graduate school and 30% on work, believing that with the current job market, giving myself a little extra time and more knowledge was my best shot.

I just received an offer from one of those graduate programs the other day, they're offering me about a quarter tuition merit scholarship. The grad program is one of the top three in the country for my field, ranked only under one Ivy League school. They have a 95% placement rate with average starting salary being 12K more than what I was offered by F500 and I have intimate familiarity with the campus and culture- it's a good fit for me.

So my question is, what now? As I see it my options are:

1. *Ask F500 if I can defer to next year's analyst cohort to complete the graduate program and offer to sign any extra paperwork they would like to make sure I'm committed to ONLY them*\- this grad school is an 18 month program I would start in January so I would finish the degree right on time to be a part of the July 2024 cohort. I would think ""let me come back, just as a much more capable professional but for the same pay"" shouldn't be a tough sell but I will admit that this company has a reputation for being somewhat traditional in their ways so I have no clue at all.
2. *Ask the grad program if I can do one semester full-time, in-person and then switch to the part time online program when I start with F500* This isn't as ideal because I'd lose a fair amount of scholarship money + I don't know how the work of part time graduate school and a full time job would balance out or if I'm even capable of it, but I would be able to achieve both a degree and work in this truly amazing program. My parents think I should do one semester full time and use it to decide whether grad school is right for me, but I know myself- if I complete 1/3 of the program, I won't want to leave the full time program until I've finished it all.
3.  *Renege on F500 for graduate school* That 95% placement rate gives me some confidence, but this job application cycle was so soul-sucking and so difficult to handle that I don't necessarily want to take the risk that I invest my time and money for anything less than I have now. However, I would be hitting a market different than the current one and with that degree + ideally another internship or two, which will make things different, and I will admit, although I initially didn't want to go to grad school, I really grew to fall in love with every program I applied to- the classes, the potential, the research- just the idea of being in school for longer just to specialize on my admittedly broad major appeals to me. I think this is also a good place to add: the program's cost isn't a concern at all.
4. *Decline grad school, stick with F500* I feel like if I do this, I won't ever go back to graduate school, which I'm alright with if I end up being happy with where my career is, but I don't know that for certain. However, it is an INCREDIBLE program so of course, I'm somewhat attached to it and the possibilities it could lead me to because I never thought I'd receive an opportunity from an organization like this until maybe ten, fifteen years down the line!  
Essentially, I'm stuck in the best trap ever- which opportunity do I give up on? If I go to work, I may never get into a grad program like this one again, or at least not with merit money. If I go to school, I have no guarantees I'll end up with a job like the one I have now. Is it even worth asking both of them about deferring F500 or part-timing grad school? Help!"

If I don't manage to get one, then I'll apply to normal entry-level jobs (non-schemes) towards the end of my degree, or after I've finished my degree.

I have applied for 12 graduate schemes so far and got rejected by 4. No offers yet. Actually, if you include being considered for the graduate scheme after my summer internship, I've applied to 13 graduate schemes and got rejected by 5. 😭

I'm planning to apply for another graduate scheme tonight, plus there are a few more companies that haven't opened their applications yet that I'm planning to apply to.

If you're applying for grad schemes, how many have you applied for so far? Is it normal to get this many rejections? What's considered a ""good"" number of grad schemes to apply for?"

I am a freshman pursuing a computer science degree and have two offers for an internship. One internship is more of a SWE internship while the other seems to be leaning into cybersecurity. Looking at the job description of the cybersecurity one, there seem to be expectations that I haven't learned yet such as application protocols or security technologies. As a freshman just taken data structures and soon taking computer architecture, I myself have no idea what I want to do yet.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there is a chance I can work both internships. The SWE internships runs from May to August while the Cybersecurity internship runs from June to August. If I want to try both fields, I can work at the SWE internship in May, quit, and join the Cybersecurity internship from June to August. However, the risk with that is if I decide I liked/felt more experianced with the SWE internship but can't turn back. Also, I have no idea if good or bad implications would be made in the future if my resume shows I quite an internship midway through for another one.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I stick to one internship, or should I try going for both?"

Class of 2024 CS student here. Good GPA and school, TA job, but no real projects/experience, so the internship search has been a bit difficult. I very thankfully received an offer for an internship from a reputable company (large legacy hardware/services), but the internship is not software engineering specifically. It's listed as ""engineering"" only, for computer science majors, but based on the job description it won't involve coding as much as technical consulting/design for clients. I'm not super opposed to this, and I'd love to have a bird in the hand in this climate of layoffs, but I'm worried that this will screw me over next year if I want a software engineering job. Of course, I have a long career and plenty of time to switch things up if I continue to feel that software engineering is my main goal (and I love coding), but I also don't want to shoot myself in the foot by getting in the wrong subfield of computer engineering.

Should I take the internship, relax for the rest of year, and focus on the networking/experience that I can sell on a resume? Or should I reject it and keep looking? FWIW, this is the only company that I've even got an interview with. The offer is generally fine with me other than the role. (remote, good pay.)

Thanks."

Hi.

A few months ago, I applied to Google SWE internship, and passed the resume screening to get coding interviews.

I had two coding interviews in September, and both went very well. And the second one was really good. There were two interviewers, and they were both very satisfied. My code was optimal in time complexity, I had a good communication with the interviewers, and I finished well before time.

Then, about two weeks later, my recruiter sent me an email that the decision is taking longer than usual, so I might need to wait for about a week more, but they will get back to me asap.

That was 6 weeks ago.

I sent a follow-up email 3 weeks ago, but did not hear anything back.

  1. They (usually) look for people that double major w/ math, stats or physics/
  2. Have good projects
  3. College you go to absolutely does matter.
  4. Honestly idk what else exactly other than obviously good grades and i’m guessing leadership positions in CS related clubs.
Anyways, I am just concerned that being at UF my chances are not exactly the best even if I am an outstanding student since I am competing with Ivy kids and whatnot. Any advice regarding this? Things I might have been wrong about? Thanks in advance!"

I’m currently a sophomore CS major at a top5 school. Last summer I was a software development intern at amazon. At school, I’m involved in CS research and a coding project team, along with some other smaller things. This fall, I applied to over 40+ SWE opportunities and was rejected by literally all except only had one interview where I was rejected afterwards. google gave me a candidate questionnaire like over a month ago but have ghosted me since.

I guess as a sophomore with internship experience, I somewhat expected not to have been ghosted/rejected by almost every company before receiving at least an interview. This is to say it in an honest feeling. Prior to applying, I had my resume reviewed by some technical career center and they gave positive feedback.

I’ll likely be returning back to amazon, which I’m fully grateful to be able to say. My point is, things aren’t all positive rainbows, which I expected for this recruiting season but not to be ghosted this badly.. 

I’d like to hear from others in similar spots to see where I could improve for next year?"

It causes immense fatigue and pain, making me a zombie. It's gotten to the point where I can hardly leave the house. Last summer I had an internship at a restaurant, it was so difficult and painful but I made it through it. I recently got a job a few weeks ago as a market research associate and I lasted two days. Even though this job was less physically taxing, the minimum hours were much more demanding. Most teens get a job a fast food restaurant like McDonald's or a retail store like Old Navy but I'm afraid my body can't handle that. I am struggling to work and focus on school. I've been told to give up looking for work but I have no choice, if I don't get a job then I won't be able to afford to drive and the bus routes in my town are practically non-existent. My dad has given me no other option but to work to pay for my car insurance and honestly it's stressing me out so bad that I don't see any hope."

\-----

The Captain waited as the curious hat seemed to run his hands across the new map. Finally, he spoke, ""As I said, time plays many tricks. We pulled you out because you have spent a thousand years bouncing around in the Between. Welcome back.""

The Chancellor found himself lost in the expanse. So many, so much. He couldn't stop his hands from tracing all the new knowledge, all these new people…In a whisper, he spoke, primarily to himself, ""But this is wonderful! I always knew the galaxy was bigger than I would ever see but this…"" His head raised in defiance of circumstance, ""I see your people have spent your time well."" Then his eyes narrowed, ""Or do you just expand at any cost?""

All the HDF tech in the world didn't make him feel any better. He was too old to feel this young, he reasoned. Now he held back a smile as the Chancellor glared at him like an errant pupil. He shook his head slowly, “We are not everybody's friend but we are no one’s enemy. We hold no ground by force and any are welcome to come and go as they wish.”

His smile was genuine this time, “The Library Ships taught us well in our early days. I meant every word about our respect for your calling, indeed most of your kindred have a human with them these days. Someone has to know how to fix, for instance, a broken field generator and temporal-guidance-fixed points.”

The tinsel seemed to nod, then sagged a little. “I confess I know little of such things. This ship has been in space since before it found my people! It is inconceivable that it could fail…” he looked at the map, “...yet I am a Scholar. That it was inconceivable is a fault in me, not in a vessel that has served us so loyally. Very well.” He pushed his sagging hat back into place, “Captain, I am in your hands.”

The Captain wiped the map for a moment and approached the Chancellor, opening his briefcase to reveal a bottle of whiskey and two glasses, “We are going to need this as I tell you a story. If it helps it has a sort of happy ending, sort of. The best bit is you get to be the hero and this little lost ship of yours is going to be encased in diamond and sent to orbit the worlds for eternity as an example of why your mission is important to us all.” He began pouring, “Forgive me for checking but my AI tells me that your people can drink us under the table. I’ll be going easy because this is one hundred and eleventy-one years old and I want to enjoy it.”

He finally sorted out the seating by stacking a couple of the hobbit chairs together and raising his glass, “To you Chancellor, may you find the future everything you hoped for.”

The Chancellor took the glass carefully and let the scent teach him. Smoke, ethanol…age. No not just age. Care, love. Respect. It smelled of passion, it spoke to him of humans far more than a translator could. It held stories. “Tell me. How bad was it? This thing you are dancing around?”

The Captain sank his whiskey in one and refilled it. “Bad.”

He brought up the chancellor's map. “We had never gone to war in space. We had squashed a few pirates and smacked down a few smugglers but this was something else. We lost an entire world.” A quick smile crossed his face, “It’s a world that seems to attract the unlikely.” Then his face grew still.

“Then we lost more. The Swarm worlds had declared war on us without warning, our type, any single-minded species. At first, no one believed us but we armed up and we went to war.” He pulled out the sword and laid it across the map. “There is a reason we carry these. We began defending ourselves and anyone that was willing to take our help. Too many dead to count. One of their kind had been betrayed and helped us change their nature. It took a miracle but we won after a couple of hundred years. The swarm worlds were altered to think for themselves, no more slave fleets and fanatics.”

He looked at the tiny dark eyes hiding behind the whiskey glass, “This is not just a story. Many swarm planets died. Entire species and spacefaring civilisations died at our hands. We don’t answer for what they did, we saved what we could. But it was a sin, an affront to our soul, an evil we endured so that we could live in peace. And you have nine of them on your ship, Chancellor. And I have orders that go back that far.”

This time he just sipped at his glass, “Chancellor, people are coming. Only a trickle, for now, those few that are allowed to penetrate human Intel and my Fleet but soon everyone will know of your ship and its crew. I guess you have questions.”

He waved his hand at the map again and it played out the war, years turning into seconds, the flickering and dimming a terror to all involved, now all forgotten and forgiven but still a horror.

The Chancellor watched as the future played out on the map, all his worlds expanding and thriving and then…hell. Suddenly an entire arm turned red, then another... The centre collapsed and everything held until it began to fail. Slowly, then all at once. Years passed quickly as he watched everything he believed in fall apart. Then it pushed back, reclaiming space for whatever remained of his people. Then victory of a sort. He saw the community regrow but familiar names, entire worlds that he had known and taught disappeared forever.

He carefully took off his welcome hat and summoned his porter “I will be wearing something else. Please put this somewhere safe.” He then shuffled over to a cupboard and began hurling the contents on the floor until he found a box. It was unmarked, save for a ribbon holding it closed. The porter moved to help but a stern hand was raised, “No. This is for me alone.”

The porter leaned in, “Sir you can’t put on a hat to save your life and this one is heavy. I’ve served you through this incarnation and I’m damned if you’re going into the next one looking like a fool. I’ve got my own eternity to worry about.” He tore away the box and broke the ribbon, revealing an impressive black cap. He lifted it carefully and placed it with precision, adjusting the bells to ‘formal mourning’ and then with a slight nod stepped back. He looked briefly at the alien. Honestly, it needed a tailor. Maybe two. With scaffolding.

Captain Gaynor watched as his new Xeno contact watched his future burn and then heal. He could have gone a lot slower but he was going to run out of time. Exactly like that stupid war, slowly and then all at once. He needed this nailed down and the ‘good guys win again’ out of the way. He was slightly surprised when it became an issue about hats. Then again, the HDF had rewritten his base code to fit a fucking uniform. A different hat would have been a lot simpler.

He sensed that the black hat was formal, so he stood up and waited. If it meant what he thought it did… then he would have to explain why he killed one of Santa's elves. He carefully picked up the sword that he had laid on the table and replaced it in its sheath. He bowed again. It never hurts.

“Chancellor, this is your ship and we are currently trying to establish it as a Library Ship, under human protection. They are all under our protection, it shouldn’t single us out that much. The galaxy is filled with lost ships and paperwork. But this is your ship and I will treat it as such.”

He watched the Chancellor that now appeared to be wearing a Halloween decoration shake his head solemnly. The bells made a nice tune, sort of don’t-go-in-the-cellar vibes and then he spoke in that dark voice that any headmaster could raise at will, “You will not hunt my people for the sins of their descendants. I will not part with any crew member for your revenge on history. Not to you, not to anyone that seeks it. I will return the ship to infinity rather than lose my crew to such injustice. I have Spoken.” His voice stayed solid even as everything else seemed to shrink.

The Captain seemed to think about that for a while and then nodded slowly, ""Good. That puts us in agreement."" 

He waved at the display again and it focused on a section of space, ""This is what used to be called 'Dark Space'.  It was planned to be used for human colonies before the war happened—lots of clever techs to terraform them into something nice, ready for when we had the numbers.  We then repurposed some of it as a refuge for the rescued, the rest as a bastion just in case we lost the war. Anyone we could save we gave them one of those worlds as soon as we could terraform them into suitable habitats.""  He shrugged, “Most of our Terraforming ships were trapped there anyway, it gave them something useful to do.”

He paused for a moment, his eyes lost in the swathe of worlds that had hidden so many secrets. ""Then we won. The planets were turned over to allies and former enemies."" Some ancient distaste ghosted his voice.

The Chancellor heard the bitter ring of victory in the human's voice and bowed, ""That all sounds suspiciously like a happy ending."" He waited for the bells to stop ringing and added, ""I am a Scholar of history… even though I suppose ancient history might be more accurate now.  The Victors don't generally admit to the horrors they inflicted along the way. I will not part with my crew because you wish to rewrite history."" He looked up at this apparently reluctant warrior as his hat gave a frustrated ring, ""So what are your plans for us?""

Captain Gaynor poured himself another finger. Or two. His glass frosted automatically as he poured and the AI would probably have something to say about his drinking. He was well aware that she checked. Then he sat back in his uncomfortable seat and said, “Well, Captain, it's up to you, really. We can let you go your own way or we can upgrade your ship so that it doesn’t fall through the cracks in space again and let you do your own thing. The problem you have is that some species have very long memories…the sort of memories that means they will burn your ship out of space the moment they see some of your crew. We will recover what we can afterwards and probably avenge any such an attack on a library ship, but I’m not sure how that would help you in the short term.” 

He took a deep drink and savoured the taste. Time, smoke and alcohol trying their best to create a moment. The Chancellor looked on, his curiosity peaked regardless of the circumstances, “Why would you choose to drink something so valuable on such a difficult day?”

The Captain raised his glass and his eyebrows and replied, “Memories in humans are best reinforced by scent and taste. It's what we do when we want to ensure that any memory moves from short-term to long-term. Strangely, we also use it to move long-term memory into temporary oblivion but that won’t apply unless this goes terribly wrong.”

He put the glass down and looked down at the small and worried creature, “Or there is our way.” He centred the map onto a variety of systems. 

It had footnotes:    *Swarm Bastion 3 (Archaic) Swarm Destroyed. (Extinct)* 

*Swarm Bastion ‘Plentiul’ (Archaic) Swarm Suicide (Extinct)*

*Swarm Memorial World, ‘The Withering’ (Multiple Extinction Event)*

The screen hesitated for a moment and then…

*….Temporal Anomaly Declared. Mapping is currently unavailable…*

The Captain grinned as Earth took off the gloves and showed an ancient iron fist. Information is power. So is blowing shit up, but he preferred confused friends rather than well-informed enemies.

“We will take those that are again under threat and then we will bring them to the old hive-worlds and let them become something new in the universe. The Queens can engender a female clone, a new beginning for them and then we will give them a world, supervised by their own kind. 

Their memory is mostly genetic, so at least they can build a future even if they have lost some of their past. It’s the best we can do for now, but bringing nine species back to life under a new sun will help heal my people and add to the universe. That is what I meant when I said that you will be a Saint to our people and a miracle and triumph for the Library Ships. You are about to save worlds so buckle up” He poured the sad dwarf another drink. It looked like he needed one so he filled the glass.

The two of them fell into silence. Then the planning began.

\------

“The humans are up to something. Their maps have just wiped eighty systems from my system. “

“Are you sure it wasn’t the intern? He lost the sun on Tuesday.”

“If he could do this shit I’d pay him. I want us full speed in the other direction right now. I still haven’t finished repairing the ship after they got pissed at smuggling. Nav, get us the fuck out of their way.”

\------

“Sire, I’m afraid they have used their accursed spell. They have declared that all their actions are within the ‘Terms and conditions of using their beacons. You will have to find a higher-level Sorcerer to dispel that magic. I cannot even read the runes. I believe we need at least ninety-five windows and an upgrade to service pack two? Perhaps a bag of holding?”

\------

Rocky sat at the foot of a rather grand table and listened. He had already picked out the ones that were in for a serious change of career and gender but he relished the conversation of those from his childhood. The galaxy had become so big, he had almost forgotten when a handful of worlds had been his everything. If it was one lesson that the humans had taught him it was that it was huge. He still wore his ‘Don’t Panic’ T-shirt on poker nights. Even the disrespect felt strangely comforting, as he sat knowing that his people now owned the stars alongside the finest allies they could ask for. Human AI changed the game when immortality had become commonplace. The organics were fine if they would stick around long enough for a proper conversation. They never did, but still.

His Captain quietly sent him a message and he looked at the Engineer. Their eyes met and a slight nod passed between them.

Rocky started, “So, my new friends, your Chancellor told us you had many questions. Perhaps you would like to ask them?”

One of the Scholars raised a hesitant hand, “Forgive me, I know only a little of your people and nothing of the humans you travel with. Are you a symbiotic species? I have no record of any stone…any silicate species travelling as a crewmember. Perhaps you shared a planet?”

The Engineer piped up at that one and seemed to take a good look at Rocky, “You're made of what?”  Then he grinned and looked at the Scholar, “Just kidding. We were delighted to meet a Silicon species, even one as stubborn as Rocky's people are. It proved all our science was wrong, it was awesome.” He looked around the table with his now familiar grin, “Bet it came as a shock to you lot too. My people threw parties for a week.” He grinned again as he attempted to pick up some of his food that seemed to be crawling away.

The Scholar had come from the deeps of Central space, surrounded by a million inhabited worlds. He tried to imagine what it would be like if he came from the depths of nowhere, only vacuum and spinning rocks for company. It still made little sense. “So...you had a party because everything you thought you knew was wrong? Did I understand that correctly?”

The Engineer had cornered his escaping food under some salad but he looked up, “Hmm? Oh yeah. Best day ever. Well, that and the Library Ship. But it was cool.” He laid his fork over the leaf, hoping to hold his prey in place as he spoke. “That's what you guys do right? New knowledge means new options, new science and new friends. Bigger worlds, bigger ideas. Science is always going to be wrong until the heat-death of the universe is complete. We are all just trying to keep up…” He stabbed the fork into the salad leaf with satisfaction until he raised it and discovered that his salad had moved and was now trying to pick up his knife in self-defence. He looked around at the table, “Uhh…your food is trying to use tools. I think it's sapient. Can I have it to go?”

Rocky had to say that his Engineer was one of the finest examples of humanity that he knew. If you boiled the whole species down you would be left with … very angry soup probably, but metaphorically you would be left with several billion people agreeing with each other violently.  His people had lived on the edges of the ‘civilised’ worlds for millennia until the humans had arrived and opened every door, sometimes even using the key. Humankind remained happily oblivious to their actual power until someone pushed them too far. Then you had days like today as they bent the entire galaxy around them to repair some perceived ancient evil and heal some dark wounds in their history. 

He remembered the Swarm wars. He was just slightly surprised that the humans did.

No one else would care that any species from hundreds of years ago had failed in their attempted genocide but…humans. Do no harm. Leave only footprints. Radically change the political and military balance of the entire galaxy, crush all the enemies before you and then just shrug apologetically like you had just farted at the dinner table. Humans. His dark eyes held a certain gleam when he turned to the company.

He smiled at the Scholar, knowing that the whole crew was listening, “We are not symbiotic. My people are old and we tend to stay that way. What you have yet to discover is that there is more than one kind of human. You need to throw a party because everything you thought was true…isn’t. We were the first to meet their immortals but now…” He looked at the ceiling, “*Untested Ideas,* could you make an appearance?”

A voice echoed across the room. “Fine, but I’m taking my shuttle. And you can tell the Captain.”

\------

Sir, a human Fleet is assembling! They claim they are dealing with a ‘Temporal Incursion’ and are wiping maps and Intel. I count over seven thousand human trading vessels now marked as *late/unavailable/cancelled*.” He looked at his boss, “It's what they did when the smugglers pissed them off. Shit is going down.”

The Xeno sat back into its bath, “Well they don’t tend to lie on such an industrial scale. What the hell is a ‘temporal incursion’?

The crewman hummed to himself for a moment… “Something from the past is biting us in the ass or they have another dragon poking its nose in.”

The Matriarch absorbed this and raised a hand, “Withdraw all our ships from human space and send them…how much have we got in the Emergency fund?”

The crewman spent another moment going through the numbers, “Enough for about three fleets without crew.”

The Matriarch nodded, “Present it to the human ambassador as a gift. They will build six with the money and crew them for us. If it gets through the humans then we move into the Dark. We better start planning. After my bath.”

\--------

The XCC offices were never silent as the quickly-ageing silent heroes of humanity juggled a million conflicts, emergencies and morons every minute of every day. If one of the thousands of AIs sent it to your desk, well the shit had already hit the fan. To get to this particular desk the fan needed to have exploded and then turned into a sentient fan-monster and then be running for office in a politically sensitive region while wearing the corpses of a human ally. Godzilla would have needed to take a ticket.

“Why?” He asked, “Why am I suddenly being sent money from” the Director looked down at the list, “everyone?”

The AI tried to be sympathetic, “Sir, You called a Temporal Incursion and they have absolutely no idea what that is. They see a human fleet assembling and they want us to fight whatever war is on the way while they dig deep and stay out of the way.”

The Director frowned. “I haven’t even called the Fleet. These are just some tourists. It's good for everyone that we recover those swarm species but that's not a war… it's social engineering with some heavy lifting.”

The AI smiled at him, “Sir, most species have never seen us assemble more than thirty ships at a time. This one was redlined and we have slightly more than that moving right now.  Six-thousand, nine-hundred and one more to be exact. All moving to HDF beacons and built to HDF standards. Right now it looks like we are invading the seven hells.”

He didn’t get his position by remaining oblivious. “Fine. Recover the Swarm and when we are done announce that the Incursion is resolved and thank them kindly for their support. It's now classified as the I-Will-Kill-You-Myself level of security. No one stands down until the mission is complete. We will run this as if it was a real threat and our skittish friends are going to fund the entire exercise.” He looked inwards for a moment and then announced, “I want a new Dark Space. We needed it before and the Galaxy is as bloody stupid as always. Take whatever budget you need and find us another eighty worlds. Bury the numbers in this stupidity. Thank you.”

The AI silenced the Comms and took a moment for herself. She was a human and proud to be one but the organics…they saw patterns where there were none. Until suddenly it was obvious. Eighty worlds? Level Nine… ‘The Director will turn up in your office with a knife’ level…Cool.

We spent a lot of time together and we seemed to click pretty well. I was able to connect with him WAY better than ppl my age and he told me I was quite mature for my age. I was one of the younger interns and I felt like he did a good job looking out for me in kind of like an older brother way ig. My family really liked him as well and they talked about how good looking he was (I don't think they were trying to set me up tho). In hindsight, I definitely think I had a crush on him I just buried it down bc he was 5 years older than me and he had a gf (I met her once and I didn't think she was a good fit for him, but I'll take my assessment with a grain of salt) Srsly tho, if he was closer to my age I definitely would've been like head over heels for him. 

I haven't talked to him since May and I started another internship over the summer and fall with a lot of the same ppl I worked with in the spring. He wasn't there tho which really disappointed me. Nobody seems to know where he went either.  Idk what to do. I've considered following him on Instagram, but I'm worried that might be a little creepy."
z4en6p,0,2022-11-25,Where to find companies that view employees as assets and not expenses?,cybernetics_engineer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z4en6p/where_to_find_companies_that_view_employees_as/,"Not sure what every one's philosophy on how companies views employees, but I feel like majority of companies want get as much value from you as an employee for the lowest price. Hence companies low-balling offers.

This has just been my experience, like every time I negotiate I can see that they are trying to get me to work for the lowest possible dollar amount. This is viewing me as an expense.

But then, watching my friends or other people, they seem to be interviewing companies that view them as an asset. Aka, they get paid double or even triple what I make. I used to think they were just better at negotiating, but one scenario (many years ago) my friend fresh grad at the time was asked what salary he wanted on interview. He said $50k, company was like nope we are paying you $80k first job.

Another friend also changed industry somewhat, and he actually got a raise. He didn't have the skillsets, but he just going to learn on the job. When I apply to companies where I have 7/10 of their wishlist. They keep focusing on the 3 skills I don't have and seem upset that I don't have that skill even if listed as a bonus. Also this is also his dream company big brand and got a response. I apply to thousands of company and rejected daily.

Me on the other hand, when salary negotiating with two interviewers in room asked what I wanted, and I lagged a bit. One of interviewers said $25/hr immediately. I had $40/hr in mind. When I heard $25/hr I was taken a back. So in response, I really needed a first job, so I didn't say $40/hr, but said I was looking more like $35/hr because if difference is too high you can lose offer all together. Then they were like how about meet in the middle $30/hr, unfortunately accepted. They were like this is a junior role! But even junior don't get paid this low. People in internships get paid more than this.

After couple days, they said I am now the frontend lead. I thought I was a junior? But didn't want to say no because its good for growth. Been at this job for several months. Anyways, not once during this job yet did I struggle or had to ask someone how to implement something. I am highly independent. Literally zero hand holding or any onboarding.

This was only one scenario, but had many others. Like one job did say $80k, but in NY. So thats really bad.

How do I find companies like my friend, where the guy was not smart for saying $50k initially, but then company was like no we want to pay you $80k (they view employees as assets)...while I'm finding jobs where companies just want me to work for nothing.

I'm a career changer by the way, so I am almost 30 years old making $30/hr. There are 21 year olds making triple what I make. All my friends are just coasting doing 3x better while I spend majority of life all in at career and still not winning. I know comparison is the thief of joy, but honestly haven't been able to enjoy my life since I graduated college about 8 years ago. Doing everything to make as much as possible yet almost 30 making $30/hr. Every one else not taking the job seriously at all and making 3x...

**TLDR;** Where do I find companies that view you as an asset and are ok with you learning on the job?"

z4jrie,1,2022-11-25,Feel like lack of communication skills is really holding me back + Looking for some practice,edcantcommunicate,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/z4jrie/feel_like_lack_of_communication_skills_is_really/,"TL;DR - I bitch about life a little bit. To improve my communication skills I find having hour-long conversations with no distractions pretty beneficial. If you wanna try this send me a dm.

&amp;#x200B;

Some Background:

I don't think I'm debilitatingly antisocial - all considered, I can behave fairly normally in any given situation. I have an ok amount of friends, I get out and do new things often enough (but not as often as I would like), I am generally pretty happy with my appearance - I like how I dress. I do ok in terms of finding and developing romantic interests - I currently have a relationship taking shape that I am very happy with.

Despite this, I still feel like my communication skills are really lacking. I think I've always felt this way - I'm missing something important that allows everyone else to communicate and connect so easily. As a result I think I've missed out on a lot of things in life - friendships and relationships I could've developed to more meaningful depths, jobs and internships I struggled to interview for, cool opportunities I've missed out on due to a lack of confidence to put myself out there. I think I'm quite smart, but it never feels like this materializes into anything useful beyond good grades - I feel like I need something more to really get the most out of my life - I think this is almost certainly a result of my lack of strong connection with other people. There have been so many key life events that I feel like would've meant more to me if I was  truly able to connect with the people around me. I wish I mattered more to my friends and the people around me.

A big cause of this problem is, from what I can tell, my parents. They're just so introverted themselves its almost suffocating - they don't have friends, they avoid family gatherings, they seem to avoid social situations as much as they can. It feels like they never really pushed me to be outgoing at all when I was younger. I think the result of this is that I have nowhere near the social 'mileage' the average person has, and as a result haven't learnt a lot of the rules and mannerisms people intuitively pick up from social situations that they will typically be immersed in as a child. I  feel like I have a lot of catching up to do in regards to being present in social situations and just talking. Of course, I don't think its fair to fully blame them - I'm definitely disposed to being introverted, and don't think I help myself in a lot of situations.

I think, essentially, my opinion is that everything in your life is enriched if you have the ability to connect with and influence others. I don't think I can do that - not really.

I guess I've identified two main things I need to improve on socially to go further with my life:  
\- My self-confidence and resulting ability to take social responsibility - to be a leader, to initiate, to be able to put yourself within potentially uncomfortable social situations that could be rewarding  
\- My ability to connect with and engage others when I talk - to be someone that people want to start and keep talking to, to be able to rapidly build lasting and meaningful connections

&amp;#x200B;

So solving these problems?  
I guess you could consider this post and the practice I've come up with to be the first step in taking some social responsibility. Reaching out to more people through it will hopefully develop some self confidence.

I think, as I've discussed, this inability to instantly connect with others is simply a problem of lack of experience - I guess I want more practice - the more conversations you are part of; the more stories you hear and can share further; the more examples of people who are good communicators you can learn from; the more you will shape yourself into someone who is themselves an effective communicator. That's the idea at least.

I've been trying to figure out how to best do this. Random interactions with strangers are ok - talking to people physically and having to initiate yourself is good - but quality and duration of these conversations are a little variable. Instead, I feel that for now, the best way to practice is through a guaranteed longer conversation. I also think doing this daily is of pretty high priority to me. Developing my communication skills is the most important thing to me right now - I think it will benefit my life in pretty much every dimension. As such, high volume of practice on a regular basis seems necessary.

With that in mind, I think a pretty useful daily practice is:  
\- An hour long conversation a day - this can be about anything, and can be longer, but must be timed to be an hour at least  
\- Can be with anyone - someone you've known for a long time or someone totally new  
\- Must be done without distraction - no playing games or doing anything else in the background - focus more on what you're saying, paying particular attention to the clarity and cadence of your voice, and spend more time thinking about what you actually want to say  
\- Aim for an even split between all participants in terms of words spoken - the goal of this exercise is really just to increase the volume of words you say in a day

I've tried this now with a couple of friends and it's pretty simple - I just bought it up and we set a timer and just talked. It was awkward at a few points as I don't think we would normally just talk uninterrupted such long of a period of time usually without doing anything else, but honestly it wasn't too awful. It feels pretty good - the volume of words you speak in the time period is much higher than you would otherwise say in a social situation where there are other distractions - you're forced to think a little more about what you want to say and also be willing to say things you might otherwise not bring up.

I think it could turn out to be a pretty useful practice if I end up doing it everyday. I also think talking to some new people could be beneficial, so, if you feel like giving it a shot maybe send me a dm and we can chat for an hour sometime? It will probably be horrifically awkward as most social practice is in the beginning, but maybe learning to be ok sitting with that feeling and just accepting it might do us some good. 

(A little background, if you wanna talk - turned 20 pretty recently, from the UK, down to talk about films/games/manga/whatever, self development, or relationships or just about yourself - love hearing what other people are up to with life)"

z4kvod,0,2022-11-25,Retaliation against an employee here on VISA.,verkilledme,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/z4kvod/retaliation_against_an_employee_here_on_visa/,"Let me preface this by stating that I do not understand what a visa is or how it works beyond knowing that someone on a sponsored visa can come live here and work, legally as long as their visa is active.

I recently left a company because the environment became too toxic. The company is going down the drain, large tech company. Anyway, I had to get out. At the same time, I was working with a good friend of mine who happens to be in HRIS because I was trying to understand my options for left over vacation time, etc., for myself when I was ready to put in my notice. Well she had gotten into a situation herself that she couldn't really discuss because legal had gotten involved, but now that I'm out she told me what happened. Now shes being retaliated against by the company and she doesn't know what her options are. I'll try and keep this short and just provide the necessary details.

The short version: I think she is being retaliated against by the company because another employee complained to legal about the way her new manager was treating her. Basically, new manager came in, didn't like her, wanted to hire and intern that company said ""we have no more budget to hire the intern"", so they wanted to get rid of my friend as she was last hired on the team. Her old manager (we think) is the one that took it to the legal dept. After the conversation with legal, she had a call with the manager in question and they said ""there will be no more changes to the org"" but immediately started bullying her and trying to get her to leave voluntarily. Since then, she's started the process to apply to her husband's visa as a dependent and get out from under the company's sponsorship. --advice? Where does she stand. 1st generation immigrant - what are her options as far as her visa? What if they do force her out the door? She has another call with legal on Monday - advice for that call? I suggested she tell them in a respectful way that she and her husband are looking to speak with a lawyer and that hopefully help get the right eyes on the situation.

The more detailed version:

1. A few months before I left, this employee was working in a different dept but she and I had to collaborate almost daily. My professional opinion of her (and I share this opinion with others in the company) she's a great employee. As far as her work with me, she was excellent. On time, good quality work. She grew tired of the role, there was no where to move up, her manager (at the time) was known for not promoting and he's lost several employees over this.  Her ultimate career goal was to become an HRIS business partner, but he was stalling her because she did such a good job (I know this is heresay). So she started applying within the company for a role that would allow her to advance in her career. 

2. She found a role and changed positions. For the months between her changing roles and my departure, we continued to stay in touch. She was so excited about this new position and the opportunity it was presenting. She told me consistently how much she was learning and well she thought she was doing. she reported up to an HR manager and an HR business partner. Well, a week or so before I left a new hr manager came in. With her, she brought and intern that had been working with her for the past 6 months and she wanted to find a place for her on the team.

3. My friend, subject of the post, was the last person hired on this team and immediately became a target to ""get rid of"" so this new manager could hire the intern. None of this was blatantly stated like this of course, these are just some of the conclusions we're drawing as the story unfolds. The new manager stated several times that she was going to try and get a budget for the intern, but the company was pushing back due to big tech layoffs, recession, blah blah. You know the drill.

4. On the very 1st day this new manager came into play, she had a 1:1 with all members of the team, to get to know them, learn about their roles, etc. She immediately started berating my friend, telling her how she was under qualified (and she is, but she was hired with that full knowledge because she was a great employee and had plenty of experience and they knew she would develop and do a good job in this role. They took a chance on her), and should have never been in this position. My friend started crying in the meeting she didn't understand, none of her previous managers had complained. She has been in the role for a couple of months now and seems to be catching on - until this new lady shows up.

5. My friend was very upset, took a sick day the next day. She sort of told me about this, but to the extent that I'm explaining to you, that came later. What she did do was speak to her previous managers who she trusted to give her some advise. Well he was absolutely appalled and took the situation to legal (we think, we're not sure who complained to legal but I wasn't me or her and there are only a couple more options)

5. Legal opened a case. No information here. Basically her managers had a call with her a day or so later and explained that they wouldn't be modifying the current department it would remain as is (no intern being hired, no one being laid off). 

6. She's on a company sponsored visa, her husband is here on visa as well. She's currently (since this started happening) working to get on her husband's visa (so that she can be out from under the company) but that takes time. Since legal has gotten involved and her current manager ""is not modifying the department"" - they have started bullying her into quitting. They're making her work life hell. They've told her repeatedly that she needs to voluntarily resign. 

I feel like they're retaliating against her for the legal situation, and also still trying to find a place for the intern.

And I also don't know they're side of the story. Maybe she was performing badly, but she deserves the chance to do better especially knowing that she was hired WITHOUT having the necessary full experience. They knew they were taking a chance on her and all was well until this new manager showed up. 

Is this retaliation? She asked me as a friend as an American who lives here and understands the culture better and I'm not sure what to say to her. Except yes, I think they're treating you very poorly and I would fight back. I suggested she tell them in a non-threatening way that she plans on speaking with a lawyer. She has a meeting with legal again on Monday and I felt like saying that might escalate the situation a little more? Which she needs at this point. I'm just not sure, I don't want the situation to get worse. 

What are her options as far as her visa? She wants to ride it out until she can get on her husband's as a dependent, but that will be April-ish. She can't be this stressed and in that toxic environment for another 6 months. 

Thanks for any and all help, sorry for the length of the post."

This write up is just my experience with interviewing this season, and sharing everything I wish I knew before hand. Realistic or not, just take what u think is helpful from it

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, since this 2023 internship hunt was god-awful for me, I wanted to make a post detailing my experiences to help others out in my shoes for the future. There's a couple of these posts already up, but I want to make a post that isn't just humble bragging. Also I stole this format lol.

To get it out the way, I accepted an offer with Microsoft in NYC for summer 2023.

# Background:

**Education:** Junior at a t50 school (t20 cs program) majoring in mathematics. I took the intro cs track as a freshman.

**Experience:** 2 Internships at Google, 1 at Nasa, and a couple of volunteerships with local tech nonprofits.

**Projects:** None, lol

If anyone wants my resume, lmk and I can post an anonymous one. But its literally just Jake's Resume. **edit:** Here's an anonymized version -&gt; [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ShNWgBmqzur1h00WulsbdQur41VpXWrg/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ShNWgBmqzur1h00WulsbdQur41VpXWrg/view?usp=sharing)

# Statistics:

I applied to \~100 internships, got like 20 OAs, received 10 interview invites, and 2 offers

**Leetcode:** 53 easies, 15 mediums, 0 hards (to be fair I did a ton on [binarysearch.com](https://binarysearch.com) before that site closed down)

**Codesignal:** 750(ish)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to be very clear as to what each company asked of me and how long the processes were.

&amp;#x200B;

# company that I cant type out

**Position:** SDE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 09/21, interview/oa invite 10/04, interviews 10/24, waitlisted (lol) 11/15

**Thoughts:** Hated the process, and it increasingly became clear after \[redacted\] started freezing hiring and laying people off that I wouldnt get an offer no matter how well I did. Recruiters were not transparent about hiring freezes.

My interviewer, however, was real about the fact that I probably wouldnt get hired due to the freezes so W interviewer.

**Technical Interview:** He asked me invert binary tree and grilled me on java stack/heap

&amp;#x200B;

# Klaviyo

Got this interview from a campus job fair

**Position:** SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 09/28, interview invite 09/29, interviews 10/01 and 10/12, rejected 10/14

**Thoughts:** I appreciated how quick and blunt the process was. I was kinda burned that I went through 4 hours of interviews for an automated rejection lol, but thats life. Interviews were fine tho.

**Technical Interview:** Altogether I had 3 technical rounds.

\- First and second round they asked questions that involved me learning and applying json and react knowledge on the spot. If you interview for this company, you should learn json and react in python lol.

\- Third interview asked me to break down nested json data. The solution was a recursive method.

&amp;#x200B;

# Squarespace

**Position:** SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 10/03, interview/oa invite 10/03, interviews 10/20, rejected 10/24

**Thoughts:**  Process was quick as hell, super transparent

**Technical Interview:** I was asked to implement a tiktok algorithm similar to my OA. The solution was to implement a doubly-linked list using a hashmap in order to make every needed operation in constant time complexity. I needed alot of hints to get to this point, so its understandable that I was rejected lol.

System Design round, I was asked to design a blog site.

&amp;#x200B;

# Netflix (In process)

**Position:** SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 10/08, interview/oa invite 10/21, interviews 11/09 - 12/??

**Thoughts:** There are 3 rounds to the Netflix SWE internship, 1 is technical, 1 is system design, 1 is behavioral w a hiring manager. The technical portion was easier that I thought, and I passed it and moved on to system design. My interviewer told me that the intern program next summer would be fully fledged, including intern events and return offers(?).

**Technical Interview:** I got a Shortest Path in Maze problem. I used dfs to get a working solution (they make you run your code), and he asked me a couple of extensions that, if you understand the general dfs solution, were pretty ez. If you study the blind 75 easies/meds, youll be fine.

I have yet to do the system design portion.

&amp;#x200B;

# D.E Shaw

**Position:**  Systems: Technologist Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 09/25, interview invite 10/06, interview 10/13, rejected 10/27

**Thoughts:** God damn they took a while to reject me lol

**Technical Interview:** They grilled me on the networking portions of my resume (I did a CISCO routing/switching magnet program in hs, did like 1 internship out of it), and quizzed me on tcp vs udp, java garbage collection, and handling large amounts of data

&amp;#x200B;

# BNY Mellon

**Position:**  START dev intern

**Timeline:** Applied 10/03, interview invite 10/19, interview 10/26, verbal offer 10/31

**Thoughts:** simple process, oa and technical were relatively ez

**Technical Interview:** They asked me to verbally solve two sum, and asked me surface level questions on oop fundamentals and data structures. Also asked to explain recursion and edge cases to someone who wasnt in tech.

&amp;#x200B;

# Microsoft

**Position:**  SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 09/22, phone screen invite 09/26, final interview 11/02, portal update w offer 11/17

**Thoughts:** It took so. damn. long. to get an offer. Worth it doe.

My first technical interviewer was 30min late, and I had to email my recruiter to get him on the phone (apparently his teams link wasnt working, which is honestly fair lol).

ALSO, I was kept in the dark for a while in between interviews. I emailed my recruiters twice after my final rounds and the only update I got was 2 weeks later via the portal. I had to email my recruiters for a bit to actually get a phone call to discuss the offer. I got the feeling that MSFT recruiters are overworked though, so all in all I appreciate them.

I was surprised to learn that I went thru team matching after my phone screen and that my final interviewers were my potential team managers lol.

**Technical Interviews:** For the phone screen, I got grilled on multithreading/processes, recursion, and OOP.

For the final technicals, I got grilled on java memory management by the guy who was 30min late (he was nice about it tho), and the second interviewer gave me valid anagram via codility. I couldnt figure out how to work the ide to make my code run, but she told me that my code looked perfect and they I impressed her. She was actually super nice, and we talked about wlb at microsoft vs twitter and her work on netflix ad servers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This season was brutal, even with a decent resume. I suck at leetcode and failed so many OAs and interviews. I'm grateful to have gotten Microsoft, and if you dont have an offer yet, the recruiting season is far from over.

If I had to give some crucial tips:

* Use Jake's Resume format, oh my god. It's meta. If ur not using it, ur resume is (probably) ugly.
* Its a numbers game. Use the pitt github internship list and apply to every listing possible.
* Blind 75 is (mostly) all you need tbh, dont stress too much on lc. This is probably a hot take lol.
* Alot of companies don't use leetcode! They expect you to be able to learn practical frameworks on the fly and solve problems with them in interviews. Which, imo, is harder than leetcode. So.. get good at that.
* Most of you guys on r/csMajors and blind are fucking insufferable lmao. Go outside!! TC and FAANG aren't everything. These companies care little about you, and the purpose of the job hunt is to get a comfy salary so you can live your life with a good financial base. If you're on here asking what to do with your life after getting a decent offer, you need to reflect..

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this post proves useful to people interviewing at these companies who need interview prep.

Good Luck! :D"

Right now I've transferred all the data for my internship to the group of my organization. I've also started working on an arcgis hub website for a interactive database. I have a few questions:

* When I leave my internship will the data that I've added to the arcgis online group still be there or is it only being hosted on my account?
* For arcgis hub, I've tried seeing how to add core team members, but it says to contact an administrator, I'm assuming that means talking with the licensing team for my organization.
* Again, I pretty new to Arcgis hub, but I think that I should be able to make the site public while keeping the content on it view only. My supervisor wants something a bit easier for people to access data on than having them create an esri account and trying to find the group. Could there be a way of making it so the data can have some invitation based privilege?
   * If not I would assume that I would just need to tell people who want data to wait to request membership for the content group that the site creates, right?

Any help is appreciated, thank you"

&amp;#x200B;

I had an IT offer at the Quebec government but they require me to be in a coop program. The problem is, to be in the Industrial Practicum (IP) or the Internship Year in Science (IYS) in the science department, the department of science ask internships to be full time. My offer starts with part time (14h) during winter 2023 semester with full time (35h) during march break and Christmas break and only offer full time(35h) during summer. 

I really want this opportunity as there is a recession and IT jobs are harder to find, but if I do not have the status of coop student then I am not eligible to this work. What can I do?

z4nxaz,1,2022-11-25,Left out of family business,CardiologistEarly483,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/z4nxaz/left_out_of_family_business/," I'm younger than my older brother by 7 years. An IT Engineer just like me, but he studied in a private university, where the fees were paid by my parents because his scores in high school final exams were average, but not good enough. I, on the other hand, walked my way alone until now. I got good scores, got into a university by my own choice, passed other exams and got second best university for software engineering studies in the country. Academically, I am head and shoulders above him.

Even professionally, I got my internships and my 3 jobs in 3 different companies all by myself, through LinkedIn and interviews. He, on the other hand, had known no other company besides my uncle's, the one where he did his two internships and where he finally works.

But back when I was still in university, I wanted to work in my uncle's company. It's a luxurious company, has offices in Tokyo, my dream city and where I started considering moving to, or at least try the experience for a few years. The company is paying for their employees apartments. But my brother, being the spoiled short tempered proud guy he is, he got into arguments one after the other with people in the company, including the CEO and our uncle and almost got himself fired, but he made it out. He keeps warning me not to come because of the 'toxic' environment.

My father, on the other hand, sucks up so much to my uncle. He likes so much, more than us, his own family. When my brother wanted my father to visit him in Japan, he rejected the offer but he went when my uncle was the one who invited him. I proposed a family trip to him and my mother to Istanbul, but rejected it to later, accept an invitation from my uncle to Singapore, where he lives.

I wanted to have the opportunity to work in the family business, but my older brother and father made me hate it and back off, because of their trashy behavior. However I still can't help but feel pissed off when I hear them on the phone, discussing how is life in Tokyo and the work is going and how now after several years of his employment, my brother is being promoted. The bad part is that my brother never tells me about the good things, but never hesitates to whine about the cons.

Now, I will be moving to Germany. I got a 'not so bad' offer to work there. I am willing to give it a try, but nothing fancy. I have to look for my own apartment by myself, in a country going through energy crisis and housing crisis, which is a nightmare there. The company is offering a relocation package, but I asked employees about it and they don't do much except booking a temporary serviced apartment, that I will pay for myself obviously.

I understand it's hard to land something very well paid in my early start of my career (25 IT engineer), but well, through nepotism anyone can. Now when I'm facing the doubts of my first ever move abroad, in a country that is considered a good destination, but never was not favored in my list. I look back and see how things could have been much easier, had my father and brother been mature enough and guided me, the little brother in a better way."

I’m a senior college student studying Human Development and Family Sciences. My ultimate career goal is to be an airline pilot so while in college I initially didn’t pay too much attention to my major and how much money it would make. But unfortunately I’m realizing I need to work for a few years first to save money for flight school. I’m an independent student who paid my way through college so I used my summers to work full time instead of doing internships. 

I’m a little scared now that with my social science degree and lack of internship experience I might not be able to land a job by May. I’m currently researching corporate airline jobs so I can still stay in the field before flight school. I’m looking to apply to recruiting or human resources jobs. Usually how long does it take to land a job before graduation? I’m graduating May 2023 and don’t have parental support so I’m really worried about 6 months not being enough to find a job. If I don’t have a job lined up it would be terrible since I don’t have that financial support/backing while I job hunt further. I would appreciate any advice or thoughts you have for me. Thank you!"

I started working at a Non-profit as an intern a few months ago. It's a 100% remote. I love what the org stands for and fully support the cause. 

So whats the problem?

My f\*ing boss. 

When I first started, he was great. I had so much respect for him as a human being. Man went through so much trauma as a child and is now making a change. I've read the bad reviews former employees left on Glassdoor but genuinely thought they were exaggerating. Because of my work and initiatives, he openly expressed how fond he is of me and wanted me to take on more responsibilities. No problem, I'm a workaholic so that served me well. As more time went by, I started noticing things that are congruent with the bad reviews. 

My first red flag was when I casually told him that I bought a massage machine because my back has been hurting. He then said ""I can't wait to hear you groan"". I was grossed out by that statement, especially he's like my grandma's age. Back then, I didn't take it serious. I knew it was inappropriate but I also knew that it didn't come from the intention of sexual harassment. But yes, this should have been the first and last red flag.

The next red flag was him constantly yelling at a coworker. Imagine a brat child who doesn't get his way and throw a tantrum, exactly that. 

The third red flag is him constantly talking about how he's a big advocate for the Black community. Sure, it's good to know that your boss is not racist, but there is a thin line between making a stance and portraying white guilt. I honestly feel bad for my black coworkers who have to listen to him preach about BLM or the Black Panthers. I once teased him for having just one Asian person on our book (I'm Asian btw) given he talks so much about equal representation. He told me that it's not as important because Asian people aren't marginalized and that we're practically ""white"". Now, I know that our experiences are different but I don't think that's an excuse for the lack of representation. Something about that statement just doesn't sit right with me. 

He does not take criticism well or at all. If you have a different opinion, he’ll spend an hour making sure that you agree with him. Three Psychology interns once told him how most of their friends are familiar with the word complex trauma. He spent an hour trying to debunk the statement and later got upset that “we know more than he thought we did”. His words not mine.

He's also very old. I don't have a problem adapting to his age and maybe going above and beyond to help him out, but it's hard when he doesn't seem to acknowledge his condition. Today, he told me not to ever say ""I already told you"" because it makes him feel bad for being forgetful. An hour later, another colleague came on Zoom and made a statement about something work-related and my boss was like ""No, that's not what happened. I have a sharp memory. This is how it happened...."".  This kind of thing happens a lot. It's like his words don't really mean anything. He'll say whatever to prove his point at that moment of time.

We had a new manager last month and she came up with a few good ways to organize the place. She's very straight-forward and would point out unethical practices. My boss hated her so much. Instead of listening to her point, he took offense in everything that comes out of her mouth. He even had a secret meeting where he told every employee to disagree with her or else he would consider them on her side. I find this so childish and unprofessional. 

Today was pretty much my last straw. Nobody is working because of Thanksgiving but I decided to come in. I later realize that I have to leave early and he was so upset with me. He said that there were so many thing we were supposed to do even though he just made me spend 4 hours typing personal emails for him and listen to him talk his life issues. This is another reason why I hate working with him. He always makes me type emails for him, like a speech to text but manually. I keep telling him that there is a speech-to-text function on email but he refused to use it. He also requires me to be on Zoom with him for the entire 8 hours that I work, which I find so exhausting. 

Anyone ever been in a similar situation or have any suggestions for me? A little empathy helps too. 

Oh and the position is unpaid."

These results also give some credibility to a Leetcode spreadsheet I created and which has received positive feedback from friends and internet strangers:

[The Kirb 350 Leetcode Spreadsheet](https://tinyurl.com/lcTrackerv2) 

* 350+ LC Problems
* Broken down by topic
* Includes Neetcode, Blind75, Grind75, LC Top Interview Questions, Sean Prashad
* Includes often-forgotten but essential topics: OOD, binary search
* Do *not* do all of these; it's merely for your record-keeping and to work on particular topics
* I genuinely believe this is the best-curated list for interview prep

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Search Results**

* 165 job apps
* 66 initial resume screens or OA's (includes automated OA's)
* 29 phone screens
* 26 finals (cancelled 4+)
* 6 offers

**Offers -** Meta, Amazon, Redfin, VMWare, Expedia, Liberty Mutual

**Final Rounds** **Failed -** Asana, Bloomberg, JPMC, Robinhood, Google, Affirm, Pure Storage, Twilio, Pinterest, Flatiron Health, Netflix, Microsoft (failed phone round here)

**Final Rounds I Cancelled -** Indeed, Doordash, Oracle, Capital One, etc.

**Other companies I passed resume screen:** Two Sigma, Datadog, Twitter

&amp;#x200B;

**My Background**

* public state university with 40-50% graduation rate and ranked below Top 250 in US News
* CS major, 4.0 GPA
* Hispanic male
* TA for one semester
* one internship at a financial services non-tech F500
* Club leader (I was extremely active here)
* 2 average CRUD personal projects, mobile app and full stack

&amp;#x200B;

**Common questions:**

*Did your minority status help, in terms of diversity as a candidate?*

* Yeah, pretty damn likely. Many of my opportunities came from diversity fairs, such as Colorstack, SHPE, Tapia. My interviews were just as difficult as any other's, is my personal claim.
* Because *many* internet strangers like to argue on this topic...just focus on yourself, make every interview count, and you also have fairs (CodePath, Greylock, Hackerrank, Contrary, school fairs)

*How much Leetcode did you do?*

* All of Blind 75 and about 3/4th of the Kirb 350 linked above

*What are common interview topics?*

* Graphs and trees, **by far** (Medium level mostly)
* Object Oriented Design (tagged as ""Design"" on LC)
* Binary search problem at Google (Med level), worth saying because people ignore this topic
* only got asked DP in some phone Karat rounds, my advice is just do the Blind75 DP problems, DP is not common at all and should be low-priority
* I didn't do any quant/HFT interviews, so I can't help you on that

*What other resources do you recommend?*

* [https://hachiyuki8.github.io/tech/job-hunt-advice](https://hachiyuki8.github.io/tech/job-hunt-advice) \- friend's blog, would've been amazing when I was hunting
* [CSCareers.dev Discord (not affiliated with this sub)](https://www.cscareers.dev/) \- changed my life, so useful and helpful

*Why did you fail so many interviews? How can I pass interviews?*

* I didn't prep enough and was new to interviews as a new grad, had barely any experience when I was intern-searching. 
* I didn't focus on important topics like graphs and trees, I spread myself too thin
* A complete, **working** solution is #1. It's more important than anything else in your interview performance. The caveat is that being optimal helps, but for some especially hard-problems, just *get your code to work.*
* Use Python

*Why is your spreadsheet called Kirb 350?*

* I like Kirby
* Kirb 350 sounds better than Kirby 350, idk"

z4xbdk,1,2022-11-25,"If the Google Data Analytics Course is not enough to help me up my chances in the job market, then what is?",YuzuYellow,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/z4xbdk/if_the_google_data_analytics_course_is_not_enough/," Hi all,

I'm currently a senior at an undergrad majoring in Economics and am expected to graduate in 3 months. I started the google data analytics course and I'm still at the middle of course 2 and there really is no other excuse other than my lack of time management and trying to bump my overall GPA to a 3.0 as I am right under that threshold right now.

Now, I'm in a very lost spot and wanted to seek some advice.

One big reason that I think I am not progressing in my Google Data Analytics course is that I don't find the early lectures to be all entertaining as it is mainly going over what a data analyst tackles and the teaching you the soft skills and what specific questions you will be asking once you do become an analyst. I came into this course expecting to dive fully into the hard skills and start learning them. But, I guess I just need to power through and get to course 4 ASAP as I heard that is where the fun begins.

I am not expecting this to be a free-pass to land a job in the data analyst/business analyst field, but I thought the capstone project at the end would be a huge plus to add to my resume to up my value, but I remember seeing posts here that that alone is not enough.

So, this brings me to my actual question. **What else should I be doing? Should I only focus on the google course and aim to finish ASAP and do school simultaneously and once that is done, should I start learning a Python course since the Google DA doesn't teach (maybe preferably with a certificate) and another SQL course to strengthen my learnings?**

I have a background in Excel and I obtained the Microsoft Office Specialist Excel Expert certificate to prove that on my resume but that was also 2 years ago and to be quite frank I am a bit rusty right now. This also led me to slacking on applying to internship positions as I know I am not actually skilled for the jobs. This is bad and I need to fix it.

Along with GPA and one leadership position I am holding in an extracurricular org in school, I'm still going to finish the Google DA course as soon as possible, **but I want to know what else I need to be doing right now that I can achieve in the next 2-3 months so I can transition smoothly into a full time position as an analyst role? (I do not have any internship experience)**

My post was a bit all over the place as I am a little overwhelmed, but I hope you got the message to whomever is reading this.

I'm going to trim this down for time sake.  I got my bachelors in 2014, got a few quality engineering positions in manufacturing. Decided it wasn't for me and went for my Master's in IT but I have not been able to get anything within the field.  It's either I don't have enough experience or someone with more experience takes it.  Not sure how to get a position in this field.  I got into quality positions after my bachelor's due to getting an internship that gave me some experience...was not successful getting one during my master's.  I have had many ""experts"" look at my resume so not sure what is going on.  I won't even get a call back most of the time.  Not sure why my Master's isn't even helping me get a basic entry level position.  What should I do?"

**Interview:** I just had my Yale interview today (interviews have been pretty late this year) and it couldn't have gone worse. We had scheduled it at a local Starbucks and I arrived a couple minutes early, so I ordered a small latte. On my way back I caught my interviewer so I guided him to our table. That's when (I don't even know how) I tripped over something and most of my drink spilled onto him (mostly on his pants but a good amount got on his shirt as well). After this incident the interview was super awkward, and he would seem upset with any of my answers. It ended after 15 minutes and he just left without saying anything. This has made me seriously doubt my chances of getting in. I've known about this sub but didn't create an account till today since I'm honestly worried if this will screw over my chances. Am I screwed?"

I don't know if solving 2 questions are good enough as he may have intended to ask 3. I was caught totally off-guard as I was preparing for ML concepts.

What is the turnaround time for Netflix? Also, how many questions do they ask in their intern interviews?"

I do think they at some point I’ll likely get some offer, but certainly not up to the standards that I had previously imagined. I have two good internships on my resume and yet still have struggled to get interviews at big tech (from my understanding this is common this cycle). I am fortunate to have the opportunity to get my master’s in only one additional year. As many know, a master’s in cs doesn’t exactly up-level you, but It will give me an extra year of eligibility for new grad roles. I wonder if Reddit could give me, advice on whether or not to do a master’s.
I am also wondering,in the case that I do a master’s, how important securing an internship for the summer in-between is, or if I could just chill and grind leetcode."

She is required by her college to do an internship now but she hasn't found any companies. She's studying in a good college in a nearby city. Ever since she's gone to college she's been blaming my parents for sending her there because it's not a metro city. At the time of her admission she got admission in another college in a metro city but my dad advised her not to go there because it wasn't as good as the one she's currently in. She has been blaming my mom for that decision since forever. So now she's saying that she wants to do internship in my city which is also a small town. Now my dad is too busy with his work to care about it so he hasn't said anything. But my mom wants that she should go to a metro city because she'll get more exposure and this is the only time she can go out of our city. My mom wants her to settle down in a metro city because we have more than adequate funds and our city isn't very good. But my sister says that she's too tired after college and wants to relax now so she wants to take up an internship in our town. My mom has explained to her that after internship if she doesn't get a stable job in a couple of years she'll have to get married (that's how it works in my country)but if she goes to a metro then there are more job prospects there. But my sister wants to freelance which is going to be very tough. So they've been fighting all day and all night about this. 
Now, my friend gifted me some m&amp;ms she ordered it from the usa and me and my sister are crazy about them. So I was eating them very slowly and then she came back from college. I told her that I'd eaten a bit of them and that she could have them. So she finished the whole packet. Now this kind of stuff has happened before so I ignore it but my mom scolded her even when I didn't say anything to my mom. So now she's also mad at me and I kinda feel bad for her. She says my mom always sides with me. Which is partially true because she's obese and has been having health problems because of it and I'm in okay health so she doesn't stop me as much from eating junk food. Now I think my sister is mad at me. So What should I do?"

My Elementary school principal and teacher told my parents when I was 7 thst I didnt want to do my work. They suspected ADD or slow mental development, the year was 1993. My parents didnt beleve in it. My dad took me in to get a PET scan and a CAT scan. I remember because I had a cat as a pet and thought it was funny they did not have a dog scan. They found me to have a working brain, so I was not mentally delayed. I was given iq test and was seen as gifted. I kept struggling and got bored with the workbooks snd board work. My mom did most of my homework because i could not sit and do it. 

Fast forward to middle and high school. My dad tells me ""i know you are not an A student, so just bring home Bs and Cs. He actuslly got mad when I made a 100 on a big exam. He said it wasnt hard enough. But my 98 exam score he really got upset that I missed one question. I went to college and one class I just didnt want to do the stupid borung work of making a portfollio. I went to the class, but never turned in any work. My graduating gpa was 2.8. I could not get into any internship, so my degree is useless.

My family is telling me to do a master's from JNU, DSE, etc. but it's kinda too late to start studying for entrance exams now. Beside my grades are low and I already have two backlogs. Our syllabus is bad and outdated and compared to DU colleges it is a total joke in terms of rigor and/or developing preparedness for employment opportunities. I have no interest left in my subject and because of, but not only, the pandemic shitshow I now realise I have learnt absolutely nothing. And I'm really lost and scared about my future.


I was wondering if I could begin studying CS stuff instead and hopefully becoming competent enough for any entry level jobs or even internships, by the time I graduate, which will be like in May next year. The IT jobs boom is probably not cooling down anytime soon and I just feel like maybe I have a chance yk.

Family is toxic and controlling and very against me becoming my own, functional, healthy, normal adult.  I need to move out if I want to be anything.

Geocomply is one of those annoying companies that automatically send you a link to a one-way interview where you have to spend an hour recording your responses. I did it anyways.

After that, I received a (non-automated) email asking me to take their OA. I aced the OA with perfect scores.

Then I was ghosted. I followed up multiple times - now it's been more than two months and no reply.

Severely disappointed in the process of this company that makes you spend hours on their process and then ghosts you without so much as the courtesy of a rejection email.

I'm Yassine from Tunisia. I'm currently studying in my final year of a Software Engineering degree. I'm looking for a graduation internship degree in web or mobile development for 4-6 months.

I have worked as a freelancer in web and mobile development with MERN stack and React Native. I also have huge experience with web scraping and automation in Python ( Selenium and Scrapy).

I've worked in a summer internship for a US financial company in which I created a complex multi steps survey to collect data from their clients and summarize them into a pdf report and then route it to Monday.com board using their API.

I have recently worked on an inventory and team management app with Firebase and React Native for a UK clothing shop.

I'm truly looking for a remote or on-site paid internship as a Fullstack Javascript developer in a reputable IT company in which I'll be able to gain more experience and help the company in its projects.

I'm looking forward to working on an interesting project and delivering quality work as usual.

I went into this recruiting cycle thinking that as long as I got an offer, I'd be very happy. I already feel very grateful to have gotten the opportunity to interview and be thinking about this in the first place.

I had a Bloomberg offer deadline that was set pretty early. Was also in late stage for SWE intern at a trading firm. Three days before my deadline, another recruiter reached out to me for Citadel Launch, an internship program for sophomores.

Both recruiters knew of my deadline and asked me to get an extension since they couldn't expedite the process any further. The time I asked for an extension happened to be the time my Bloomberg recruiter was transitioning to another role. She said that she would put me in touch with my new recruiter, that she couldn't promise an extension but would forward the message along, and in the meantime, treat the deadline as the original.

I accepted the Bloomberg offer as the deadline approached, as I wanted to have a guarantee and hadn't heard much follow-up about the extension. Clearly, accepting offer = no extension

The recruiters asked me for news on the Bloomberg extension request. I didn't want to lie about my extension, also felt icky about reneging. Given the job market situation for CS internships, I'd rather not burn any bridges, especially since I'll be interviewing again next year and the year after. After learning more about the nature of the work, I've also become less certain that I'd enjoy HFT as a long-term career. I'm interested in trying, but not enough to outweigh the cost of reneging.

Among the offers I had, I narrowed it down to Bloomberg and two Big-Ns. My reason for leaning towards Bloomberg was that it would be a very different experience. I want to see more of the East Coast, as I grew up on the West Coast, previously interned at a Big-N, and think that the other two Big-Ns wouldn't be too different (both are either based in my hometown or near the place I was at last summer). I'm also curious to explore outside of pure tech companies and learn more about finance as a domain, including finance outside of trading.

Am I sacrificing career opportunities by making this decision? I'm fairly confident in my reasons, but a few people whose opinions I trust have asked me why not renege, or take the more well-known options. I'm willing to reconsider if it's worth it. Thank you!"
z5m6s6,1,2022-11-26,Haven’t Secured a Winter Co-op - How Should I Adjust My University Schedule?,XerevoFaris76,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z5m6s6/havent_secured_a_winter_coop_how_should_i_adjust/,"Hello.

I'm a Canadian university student with a year of studies left, currently on a co-op. I chose to join my university's co-op program which extends my graduation by a year (May 2024). I've learned a lot from the past three internships I had, so the delay was well worth it in my opinion.

January-April 2023 is a scheduled co-op semester for me, but I've had no luck in getting even an interview (I've made 65 combined applications for Winter/Summer + postings with no date listed - admittedly avoided web development ones in hopes of trying something new). Winter postings are drying up and the Summer ones are rolling in. Assuming nothing changes (which is likely), I will be back in university on a study term with Summer as my final co-op placement.

To my knowledge, I have two options on the table:

Option 1:

* W23: Full Course Load (+ applying to summer co-op positions - and New Grad? I don't know how early those postings pop up - I read 12 months somewhere)
* S23: Co-op (+ applying to New Grad for Winter 2024)
* F23: Full Course Load (+ applying to New Grad for Winter 2024)

Graduation: January 2024

Option 2:

* W23: Lighter Course Load (+ applying to summer co-op positions)
* S23: Co-op (+ applying to New Grad for Summer 2024)
* F23: Lighter Course Load (+ applying to New Grad for Summer 2024)
* W24: Lighter Course Load (+ applying to New Grad for Summer 2024)

Graduation: May 2024

* Lighter Course Load would range from 3-4 courses

For reference, the expected calendar was

* W23: Co-op
* S23: Co-op
* F23: Full-Course
* W24: Full-Course

Graduation: May 2024

My Notes

* Using current rates, Option 1 charges less tuition - $600-900 less than Option 2

* In Option 1, it would be my first full in-person semester with a full-course load and applying to co-op/NG (W22 switched from online halfway - but I already got my offer right before returning to in-person). The sore spot here is it limits time for networking and meetups, especially since my subway commute takes up 2-3 hours of my day.

* In contrast, Option 2's extra free time from less schoolwork and commuting can be used towards networking/meetups and side projects/learning I'd want to do (my two resume projects are with data analysis and all my internships were related to web development in some manner - I want more breadth).

* With less courses to be done in 2023-24 in Option 2, I can enroll in some subjects that are considered difficult but I find interesting - ML, Graphics, and Compilers for example. I do not think I can manage an extra two courses with at least two of the three present.

* Of course, Option 1 has the advantage of entering the market four months earlier. If all goes well, I may land a New Grad position.

So it really boils down to whether I should:

1. hit the fast-track to graduation and go for a Winter New-Grad
2. stick with the May 2024 graduation date with a larger network and more varied experiences (side projects/courses/clubs) and go for a Summer New-Grad

Of course, This can all be scrapped if I miraculously get a Winter Co-op offer (I am/will be still applying to the few Winter positions that caught my interest). I'd like to know your opinions.

If there's any factors I haven't considered, please let me know.

Thank you."

Maybe I have a lot more expectations of him because he is a higher rank than I am, which causes me a lot of frustration.

He does a lot of stupid stuff like not paying attention in standup meetings and then ending up redoing my work. When he did that recently, it took him 8 days and he mentioned how he was confused why there was already code and a user story for it (he used my code to reference and finish his code). So essentially 8 days wasted. I've also had to finish his user stories because he failed to finish them before he left for vacation..

I know I'm not the only one that notices this because when we had an intern she would often go to me towards questions she had with work and my manager would ask me to help him at times. It's just very frustrating doing much more work because of this guy and being a lower rank then him doesn't make sense to me in conjunction with that.. Does anyone have a similar experience or advice how to navigate this in order to not get triggered/frustrated at work?

EDIT: For context I am &lt;1 year out of college and do not have prior experience with navigating workplace situations like this."

I’m [22F] a senior applied math major with an applied area in CS.  A/B student. I used to want to be a math professor but I’m thinking of going into industry instead. 

I realized a lot of math jobs depend on technology and I’m thinking, I could probably get a better paying job if I got a CS degree too. I’m on a full merit scholarship that I could use to get most of the CS degree too, but I don’t know if I should get a BS in it, or graduate from the math degree and pursue a MS.

But anyway, I feel like I’m just really… not gifted when it comes to computers. I can write basic programs and do basic Linux commands but that’s about it. I don’t even know how to debug (besides manually). Additionally, my job experiences are mostly tutoring math.

I have a friend who has lots of stuff on his GitHub and job experience. I have a friend who is doing PHD research on memory. I have yet another friend who has a tested IQ of over 170, who knows just about everything to solve everyone’s problems. He also said it hurts to watch me use a computer :(

These are the kinds of CS people I know. I’m not technologically gifted like they are. Would I have a chance of getting a good job if I just work hard? (As in, do a CS degree, get a personal portfolio, get an internship, etc.)? 

PS: I’m sorry if this post sounds whiny, I just feel really insecure about my computer abilities."

z5r8la,3,2022-11-26,Is programming right for me?,InfiniteDegree2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/z5r8la/is_programming_right_for_me/,"I’m sorry to bother you with this here but this question has had me mentally paralyzed all day and I didn’t know where else to ask this question. Side note, this is going to be a long one

First though, there’s a couple of things you should know about me and how I got into programming. I’m about to get my Associate of Science next semester and I’m in the programming track that I’ve been in for the past couple of years. I like it so far but I realize that Im a newbie to this and there’s a lot to learn. Secondly, I was initially in the IT track where I would be set up to be something like an IT technician after graduation. I loved working with hardware(still do), but then I took an IT Internship and I found it to be totally monotonous and realized I would be doing roughly the exact same things every day, for the rest of my life. I saw myself still working as an IT tech at 40 and still asking people if they had restarted their printers and doing the exact same thing I was doing at 20. I realized that, though I loved working with hardware, I could not do this job as a career. I just couldn’t. I saw programming  not as a money grab, but as a way out of that monotonous life. Sure, there would be some repetitive tasks here too, but I didn’t think that it would be doing the exact same thing day in and day out and it would be exciting and new. There would constantly be new projects to work on and new ways to apply myself. 

All of this said, Programming was hard at first but it really did grow on me. There are times where I can sit down and code flows from me to my computer like water from a mountain spring. Sometimes when I have a vague idea, i set it down in code just to see my thoughts on a screen.I also like to sit down and just write whatever code comes into my head sometimes for the hell of it to see what happens. I’ve also taught myself other languages on the side.

But recently, I’ve been working on a project where I just feel like a deer in the headlights. There are bugs in the code and I absolutely cannot for the life of me figure out how to fix them. I’ve reached out to the internet I still feel like Im flailing. I look in the mirror and I’ve been asking myself, am I cut out for this? Am I just kidding myself?"

z5vjjt,4,2022-11-27,What do you think about switching from being a Senior Mechanical Engineer to starting fresh as a new Software Engineer? and how would I do this in the least amount of time?,Acrobatic-Courage758,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/z5vjjt/what_do_you_think_about_switching_from_being_a/,"Hi Everyone,

I am a Senior Mechanical Design Engineer, and I graduated in the top 10% of my class back in 2015.  I am currently working in Los Angeles, CA, with 8 years of exp, I am getting paid a salary of $125K. However, recently I have been seeing a lot of interns and entry-level software engineers, many without any experience, getting paid the same or higher salary (starting at over 100K right out of college), and people with just about 2-4 years of experience can make way over $250k, and I've also seen many people making over $400K as a senior software engineer, whereas I have not seen any mechanical engineer making that much unless they are the V.P or Director of Engineer.

Computer Science was actually my first declared major in my freshman year, although I was doing great, I was the top student in all of my coding classes but then I decided to switch over to do Mechanical Engineering (bad move?) because it seems more fun to me and at that time there wasn't a big difference in salary between the two. 

So I've been thinking about going back to Computer Science because I don't think I can ever make that much as a Mechanical Engineer. I was looking back at my old community college transcript and it looks like I am only 3 classes away from getting an A.S Degree in Computer Science, but it had been more than 11 years since I completed the courses, so I am not sure if they still count. Or can I use my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering to apply for a Computer Science Program at the same University or at another University and spend another 2 years to get the new degree while working? 

What do you guys think about this? I really need some guidance. Is it worth it to drop my M.E Career and try to at least double my income as a Software Engineer in about 3-5 years (2 for the degree and 3 for the work experience)? 

Thanks for all the advice.

Best regards"
z5vs8c,16,2022-11-27,CS modules with ATAP,Mouse1347,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/z5vs8c/cs_modules_with_atap/,"Hi, I will be doing ATAP internship in sem 2, hoping to also clear 2 modules at the same time. 

I'm already decided on clearing CS4225 as the workload is relatively light. Can't decide on what the other module should be, currently looking at:

**CS3223:**

Concerns

* Have a project component. For the past CS mods so far, I'm not quite lucky with groupmates and ended up having to contribute to the majority of the project most of the time. I'm not very sure if I would be able to handle the workload if I end up with those groups again. At the same time, I also don't want to be a burden to other group members if the project workload requires high commitments. Would really appreciate it if someone could provide insights into this!
* It's a prereq for other DB mods like 4221 and 4224 which I would not have a chance to clear anymore if I don't clear 3223 in sem2 (only offered in sem2)
* Any preparation that I could do beforehand? 

**CS3230:**

Concerns 

* the workload seems to be really really high if I want to do it properly and do well
* I'm not sure if trying to study the content beforehand in December would help, any opinion on this?

Or actually is it not even advisable to take 2 modules and I should just stick with 1 module instead?

I'm wondering if anyone who has taken these modules before (especially during ATAP) could provide some insights on this, thanks!"

Hello everyone,

I am currently on my last month on internship in an administrative intensive role. In the beginning, I thought that I was doing well, despite making careless mistakes. Near the middle of my internship, I had a performance review with my mentor and was made known that I was doing badly. No matter how slow I went or double/triple checked my work I still tended to miss things out. When I verify documents, I tended to see them as correct even though they were wrong despite my mentor teaching me. When I have meetings with my mentor I tend to zone out despite trying to pay attention. My mentor and colleagues told me they didn’t know how to help me anymore.

I feel really disheartened- I tried to stay up late after work to sort my mistakes out, but nowadays my motivation has taken a hit and I’m just doing basic levels of work and it shows.

I know I’m not cut out for the job. I only have a month left and I do not want to leave such a terrible impression before I leave. Has anyone underperformed at their work/internship? What did you do or how did you go about it?

(I am able to identify areas I am lacking in, such as taking notes and asking questions. When I try to take notes in meetings I tend to miss hearing what others are saying. And I’m afraid to interrupt them, as well as asking after bc I do not want them to think that I’m not paying attention as usual)"

\*\*\*

\[ **13** \]

Dash sat in his quarters, sipping on a stim, and frowned at the headlines on his news feed.

The waves of unrest sweeping through the known galaxy had intensified into multiple flashpoints. Spats of violent corporate espionage. Increased propagandist campaigns by extremist groups. Shows of force between independent states and corporate entities. There was even a member system that threatened to withdraw from the Human Coalition. The fact that the eight ships constituting their entire fledging navy were present to turn back a light HuCo fleet consisting of an assault frigate and an interdiction gunboat probably had something to do with their rebellious spirit. It would be a different matter when the HuCo returned with one of their fleets sporting heavy cruisers or even a battleship.

Commercial ships were caught in the middle of the chaos, with the blame given to a multitude of parties including loyalists, rebellious factions, pirates, anarchists, and the conspiracy theorist favorite of mysterious sentients from beyond known space. There were unconfirmed posts on GalaxyNet hubs of freighter crews slaughtered and spaced, the cargos stolen, the ships scuttled or boobytrapped and left behind.

It was a mess, and growing worse by the cycle. Legit work was increasingly hard to come by. Dash shared a tight beam chat with one of his captain acquaintances on their journey to Praxum. Captain Chaktakara relayed the latest backchannel rumors: a salvaged commercial hauler had been towed in from the Atan channel region stitched full of holes from kinetic weapons. The official story was the attack had occurred in a transfer system between commercial routes, space rarely patrolled by governments or security forces. But the rumors said it occurred *within* Atan. Dash couldn’t believe that to be true. It had been some time since the system experienced something of that nature, and even the connected routes had been relatively safe for years. But Chaktakara—despite his storytelling prowess over mugs at a pub—never exaggerated the real threats to the hauler way of life.

Someone pinged his hatch. “Come,” he said.

The hatch opened to reveal Wesley. He stood at attention, a slim but pleasant smile on his face, and outstretched hands holding a datapad. “Captain, I have some housekeeping items to discuss, if you can spare a few minutes.”

Dash gestured for Wesley to proceed. He began his report with the ops crew status (tired, overworked, complaining about shares), the environment ratings of the ship (spots of subpar air quality measurements), warning signs of the latest flu to make its way around Atan (symptoms now included bleeding orifices), and scheduling a maintenance appointment for the life support system (to correct the subpar air quality). Dash rubbed his brow when the medtech finally stopped talking. “I see you’ve taken to your new duties quickly. Was that all?”

“Well, there is one more item,” Wesley said as someone else pinged the hatch.

“I’ve got something for you, Cap,” Gaius said. Dash waved him in. The pilot entered the cabin holding a covered tray. It held the hearty scent of baked goods.

Dash’s mouth watered instantly. “Is that what I think it is?”

“You bet,” Gaius said, and removed the cover to expose the three plates within.

Wesley looked over the contents. “Those baked discs smell appetizing, but I must say, they look odd.”

“It’s Draug’s version of pancakes, with whipped cream,” Gaius said. “The captain here loves them, so I figured I’d bring some leftovers by.” He handed a plate to Dash, then Wesley. “Here, try some. And don’t tell Draug it was me.”

Wesley took the plate and held it at eye level, examining the pancakes as if they were a lab sample.

“Trust me, it’s delicious,” Dash said, and took a large bite.

Wesley shrugged and tried one. “Oh my, this is good,” he said, wiping a dab of the cream from his lips. “Captain, to continue our discussion—”

“Oh, right,” Dash said as he finished his first pancake. “Gaius, if you don’t mind.”

“It’s fine. He can stay,” Wesley said. Dash nodded, and the medtech went on. “Captain, as we’ve discussed in my brief time aboard, I know my presence, even uncompensated, has placed an additional burden on the ship’s finances, so I want to help offset that. I’ve analyzed our past contracts and local sector postings, and I believe I may have found a way to get more profitable contracts.”

Dash held up a firm hand. “I’ve been doing this a long time, Doc. I know how to look for work.”

“This is not an attack on your abilities as a freighter captain. It’s simply a matter of investigating new angles in a galaxy that has been flipped on its head by the loss of Auturia.”

“Fair enough. Proceed with your pitch.”

Wesley smiled and went on. “As you know, post-Auturia, many independent systems, habitats, and corporate entities have enacted protectionist policies against the wishes of the Commonwealth and most governments, including the Human Coalition. Many of these smaller entities have pushed the limits to see how much they can get away with before they are penalized with sanctions or even military intervention. This has worsened the refugee crisis, as relief efforts are bogged down in red t—”

“Yeah, I’ve read the news too,” Dash said. “Get to the point.”

“The Atan system government, headquartered on Praxa Prime, is a small but rapidly rising independent state. Anyone with a functioning brain knows this is in no small part due to the political and economic influence of corporate entities. I’ve done some digging and discovered a series of contracts buried on the listings board,” Wesley said, and shared his datapad to the display.

Dash skimmed the details. After perusing the usual legalese, he said, “I never looked into these before because they require a licensed medtech for insurance reasons. We’re eligible to apply now.” He eyed Wesley intently. “What’s the catch?”

“There’s some added requirements. In reality, that means more forms and a longer payment processing period—”

“Hold on,” Dash said. He eyed Gaius’s plate, then Wesley’s. His gaze shifted to Gaius, whose expression resembled a teenager caught doing something they weren’t supposed to be doing. “You said you stopped by my cabin to bring me some pancakes. Why did you bring *three* plates then?”

Gaius’s face froze mid-bite. “Uh, well, I figured an extra plate wouldn’t hurt.”

“You lie worse than a politician. You knew Doc would be here.”

“I told you it wouldn’t work,” Gaius said to Wesley with an embarrassed huff.

“You should’ve only brought *two* plates,” Wesley countered.

“Then I wouldn’t have had a plate!”

“You could’ve gone back for more,” Wesley said, and rubbed his brow in frustration.

Dash clasped his hands, basking in the smoldering ashes of their scheme. “It didn’t take long for you two to team up against me.”

“I’m friends with anyone who wants to make me more creds,” Gaius said, and ate another bite off his plate.

“You obviously wanted me in a good mood. That means there’s something you’re not telling me. What is it?”

Wesley opened the full list of contract requirements. Dash scanned through the numbered list and groaned. “Requires corporate-sponsored license officer? I knew this was too good to be true.”

“Captain, please—”

“The Commonwealth licensing standards are bad enough. These CSL programs are nothing but a money-making scam.”

“Told you he was set in his ways,” Gaius said in between bites.

“Set in my ways?” Dash said. “What the hell does that mean?”

“What he means is you have opinions that are not open to change from self-reflection,” Wesley said.

Dash crossed his arms and tilted his shoulders back defensively. “That is true, but only on the things I’m right about, which is a fairly sizable number.”

Wesley gave a frustrated sigh. “To be frank, Captain, I’m disappointed in your response. My profession has numerous licensing and certification requirements, all for the purpose of improving health and standards of care for all life.”

“I am also disappointed,” Gaius said, and nearly choked on a large bite of pancake.

“You only want me to say yes because of the pay,” Dash said.

“And now I am also offended,” Gaius replied with feigned smugness.

Dash narrowed his eyes. “Listen, you two, it’s about principle and practicality.”

“All hands, prepare for rant,” Gaius muttered.

Dash went on, ignoring his pilot. “On the practical side, these licensing programs don’t teach you what you really need to know. It’s hours of vids and discussions of corporate propaganda. That’s not how you learn the real world of commercial cargo operations. Sure, there’s the internship, but most of the participants pay off some unscrupulous old-timer to sign off on the forms.” Dash left out the fact of his own participation in such a scheme several years prior and continued with unabashed certainty. “That’s where the principle comes in. I don’t need some corporate stooge telling me how to run my ship. Buzzwords and fads can seem great in a meeting, but they don’t do any good when the engine craps out in the dead of space, or some half-wit broker tries to stiff you on the contract.”

He highlighted a contract on the display. “Look at this one here. It requires a Cephaodia crew member. Guess what? They require a separate atmospheric environment and pressure suits. I’d have to modify their quarters and upgrade the sustenance station in the galley. It would cost more cred to take the contract than we’d make. This is the type of starry-eyed thinking I’m talking about. It doesn’t work in the real world.”

Wesley’s glazed eyes cleared as Dash finished. Gaius continued to munch with noisy satisfaction, having heard similar tirades many times over.

The medtech breathed deeply, then said, “You said it yourself, we need the creds. What if I can find us a qualified candidate? Some contracts span multiple cycles. They only require a CSL officer when the contract is *signed*. If the person doesn’t work out, we can terminate their contract and still finish out the full term. There’s no downside.”

“You know we really need a first mate,” Gaius added. “Besides the solid backlog of work we can get, they will also handle the ops crew.”

Dash leaned back in his chair. He glanced between Wesley and Gaius, then settled on the pilot. “I’ll admit that’s a compelling argument.” He sighed heavily as he mulled the proposal over. “Fine, I’ll consider it. But you’re doing all the legwork. We don’t have the cred to hire someone outright. You’ll need to get a contract lined up so that when they come onboard, we can pay them.” He checked the ship’s navigation status. They’d cleared the outer system, well away from Terminus and any potential SecForce interdiction. “We’ll be at the Depot in a few days. You have until then to come up with a list.”

“Doc will take the lead since this is his pet project and I’ve got flight training taking up my spare time,” Gaius said.

“Sure you do,” Dash said. “Does that work for you, Doc?”

Wesley smiled. “I accept your terms. I won’t let you down.”

Dash nodded at their plates. “Give me the rest of your pancakes, and then you have yourself a deal.”

Gaius frowned, and watched mournfully as Dash took his remaining pancakes. Wesley did the same. Dash stacked the pancakes, then chomped down on them in one indulgent bite. A smidge of cream stuck to his face. He smiled at them, his cheeks puffed with delectable pancake. “Who’s stuck in their ways now?”

\[ **14** \]

Wesley returned with Gaius to Dash’s quarters hours later. “I’ve assembled the list of candidates,” he said as they entered.

“Have a seat and we’ll take a look,” Dash said with a bemused expression.

“Don’t sound so excited,” Gaius said as he and Wesley sat.

“I know how this goes, and so do you. *But* I’ve promised to keep an open mind, and now we’re sitting here, aren’t we?”

Gaius shrugged and said nothing else.

Holding a cautious optimism, Wesley shared the first candidate to the display. He hesitated before expanding the candidate’s details. “I must warn you, to be perfectly honest, the quality of the candidates was not what I hoped for.”

Dash smiled. “Welcome to life on a freighter. People of your pedigree are rare among the stars.”

“Thanks, I guess,” Wesley said, and revealed the four-eyed and elongated head of a Cephaodia.

Dash looked between Gaius and Wesley, neither of whom could maintain a straight face. Wesley smiled and nodded toward Gaius. “Apologies, Captain. He made me do it.”

“You haven’t been around long enough to earn the privilege to tease the captain, but since you’re trying to earn us more cred, I’ll allow it,” Dash said.

“Here’s the real one,” Wesley said. A brown Tunisi appeared on the display. He was much younger than Boran, based on his coloring. Dash read over the profile.

“This one’s fine except for the class two arrest record. It’s nearly impossible to get government work with a class two.”

“We all have arrest records,” Gaius said, “except maybe for Doc.”

“That is true. I have not been arrested,” Wesley said.

“*Yet*,” Gaius added. “You haven’t been around us long enough.”

“Our arrests were minor infractions. Drunk and disorderliness, that kind of thing. That’s different than,” Dash leaned in to read the text, “multiple assaults and resisting arrest. That’s an abnormally mean Tunisi. Granted, the arrests were over a year ago, but it’s still on his record. Next one.”

Wesley dropped the next candidate, a Puntoo, whose leathery brown skin and eye bands were barely visible through his environment suit visor.

Dash shook his head. “Pass on this one too. You don’t want a Puntoo working on your ship.”

“They wear a breathing assistance device. They only need a minor atmosphere supplementation to breath in our nitrogen-oxygen-argon configuration.”

“I’m not worried about them. I’m worried about *us*. Puntoos have this unpleasant smell you don’t notice until locked in close quarters with them. It’s like a bad aftertaste. You can’t do anything about it. Even the air system filters can’t remove it. Ask Henrik. It’s one of the few things he’ll agree with me on.”

Wesley sighed and moved on. The next candidate appeared. He was on the fence about this one, but decided to present her to Dash.

A furry head appeared on the display, with two large bulbous brown eyes and a short rounded snout. They were an interesting species, the Gyhera. Despite their evolution to higher level sentients, they still held many traits serving a more primal existence. Beneath their pudgy snouts lay teeth still proficient at tearing flesh, while each fingertip contained a claw designed for climbing trees and latching onto prey. Their kind was stereotyped to have a superiority complex, despite being the newest race to formally join the galactic community years after the Auturia Incident. Supposedly rogue Gyhera forces destroyed the Ferrulian colony ship as it attempted to land at a secret HuCo outpost. The Commonwealth still dealt with the consequences to that very day.

But the candidate held a valid license, and a few recommendations on her profile. Wesley glanced at Dash, and saw the captain’s face tense with animosity. He said, “No, absolutely not. No Gyhera.”

Wesley looked at him, then Gaius. “What’s the problem? She is perfectly qualified.”

“In the captain’s experience, the Gyhera are best left to crews of their own kind,” Gaius said.

Wesley could hear in Gaius’s tone that it wasn’t an issue to be pressed. “Moving on, then.”

A Pree female appeared next. Her coloring was light blue, with darker purple-tinted streaks on her limbs and outside edges of her thin head. Human-like in many ways, their svelte frames, lustrous skin, and seemingly universal sensuality gave their small population a favorable reputation. Wesley had met a few Pree at university, and agreed with that sentiment. Unfortunately, their regressive homeworld had grown more totalitarian since the destruction of Auturia. As vocal opponents of these changes, the Pree living among the stars leveraged their agreeableness to place pressure on their leaders to reform their ways. Wesley believed in the cause, and would’ve placed himself in service of it had he not been in his precarious situation.

Dash shook his head.

“What’s the problem now?” Wesley asked.

Dash pointed to Gaius. “Him. He’s the problem.”

“Why am I the problem?” Gaius said with the youthful innocence of a child who knew perfectly well why they were the problem.

“Seriously? You’re obsessed with that Pree singer on the display in your quarters. You’re always listening to her music.”

“You mean Lady Starlight? The immensely famous pop singer topping the charts galaxy-wide as she stands against her oppressive homeworld overlords?” Gaius said, and saw Dash’s blank expression. “You need to get off the ship more.”

“I don’t listen to pop music, and even I know who she is, Captain,” Wesley said. “She is a major player in the battle against sentient suppression across the galaxy.”

“She sounds like a wonderful lady,” Dash said, then turned to Gaius. “I don’t need you fraternizing with fellow crewmembers again. It never ends well with you. You don’t have to return their affections. I don’t need the awkwardness, crying, and fighting that accompanies all your relationship drama.”

“You’re being dramatic,” Gaius said.

Dash held his hands out. “You got into a shouting match while attempting to land in a heavy storm. We almost crashed into the control tower.”

“First off, that wasn’t *my* fault,” Gaius said. “That was one time. And she wasn’t Pree, so I don’t see why that is relevant.”

Dash looked to Wesley. “You see my point?”

“All too well,” Wesley said, and waved the candidate off his rapidly shrinking list. “This is the last one.”

The Crekzel’s short torso sported four tentacle-like arms and a head with wideset eyes. Despite their evolution on a heavily-aquatic moon—and a reliance on a thin environment suit to regulate humidity and temperature—they were quite adaptable to a variety of working environments. Wesley had read an article in a trade publication about the Crekzels’ ability to slip into all sorts of tight spaces on ships and complete maintenance tasks that even bots would have difficulty doing.

“No way,” Dash said. “He’s a Crekzel. They don’t get along with Ghuptos. Crekzels resemble an aquatic delicacy on the Ghupto homeworld. There’s been too many instances of altered Ghuptos trying to snack on Crekzels.”

“My goodness,” Wesley said. He swiped the last profile away.

“See? Like I said, not so easy.”

“No, it’s not,” Wesley said, and sat back in his chair, defeated. “Those were the only viable candidates I could find on the Praxum Depot hub.”

“Now you see what I get to go through,” Dash said. “It was worth a shot. I appreciate your effort.”

“Captain, I ask you to reconsider the Pree candidate,” Wesley said, and shot a firm stare at the pilot. “I’m sure Gaius will promise not to engage in any sort of non-professional relationship should the candidate come aboard.”

“Listen, I’m a consummate professional. I don’t need to promise anything. But I can’t be held responsible for other people’s feelings toward *me*,” Gaius said. “Besides, I’ve got a lot going on in my life right now. Galaxy Battles is taking up all my free time. And I need to prep for my follower event.”

“You mean flight training is taking up all your free time,” Dash corrected.

“That too.”

“Please, Captain. Can we speak with her? There’s no harm in that,” Wesley said.

Dash chewed on his lip. “Fine. But I’m not dealing with any drama. If she ends up coming aboard, she’s your baggage.”

“That’s acceptable,” Wesley said, trying to contain his smile. “Providing counseling on interpersonal relationships among the crew falls under my duties anyway.”

“Set up a meeting with her when we arrive at the Depot,” Dash said. “Now, both of you get out of here before I change my mind.”

Gaius left. “Thank you, Captain,” Wesley said, and followed. When they were out of earshot, he asked Gaius, “The captain was very adamant about the Gyhera candidate. Do you have any insight into his strong feelings about that?”

The pilot paused in the passageway, and turned to Wesley. “All I know is he had a bad experience in the past. It’s not something I’m inclined to bring up.”

“I have to admit it’s a little troubling to me. Discrimination is a very real problem in the galaxy—”

Gaius held up his hands. “Hold on. One thing I’m certain about Cap is his morals. If he don’t like you, there’s a real good reason for it,” he said. “Let’s start with our new hire scheme. Then we’ll move on to conquering any supposed social ills among the crew.”

“It’s an initiative, not a scheme.”

“Call it whatever you want,” Gaius said, backing away towards the lift. “You want guaranteed peace and harmony among the crew? There’s an easy answer for that.”

“And that is?”

Gaius said over his shoulder, “Keep the creds coming in.”

“You know, you might be the most ungrateful sack I’ve ever known,” Rosalie said. She tipped back the shot glass of luminous purple liquid, then chased it with a glass of beer.

“Why’s that?” Henrik asked, unfazed, while the rest of the ops crew gaped at Rosalie. He shared their admiration, but refused to let it show.

Draug eyed its still-full shot glass and beer. “I give up. How do you do it?”

“Practice and genetics, honey,” Rosalie answered Draug with a wink.

The Cranky Crate pub was boisterous and crowded. Sparse lighting, randomly placed sustenance kiosks, and a makeshift dance floor made its ad-hoc origins apparent. But the ragtag origin gave an air of authenticity that appealed to its most frequent clientele—the hauler crews rotating through Praxum Depot.

Henrik found the music unexpectedly refreshing, with songs of real instruments and vocals instead of computer-generated noise. One of the few things that brought a smile to his face nowadays.

Orbiting Praxum, the lone moon of Praxa, the station served as a distribution hub for three intersecting trade routes. Merchant guilds held a lucrative monopoly on ferrying cargo destined for Praxa Prime. The massive ring-shaped orbital habitat had seen an influx of wealthier residents since the loss of Auturia, and as such, this led to an increase in demand for goods and services.

The ops crew had been saving up for leave on Praxa Prime, then they arrived to find the ring under a temporary visitation restriction. Only residents and cleared personnel were allowed to dock. Henrik repeatedly pointed out that if the *Stardancer* hadn’t been forced to detour to Terminus, they would’ve made it back in time.

“You going to answer my question?” Henrik said to Rosalie, his bottled-up anger seeping into his voice.

“Listen, I know you’ve had a few, but don’t get snippy with me,” Rosalie said, then smiled at the chief engineer. “Dash isn’t our favorite, and you blame him for Terminus. We get it. But it’s not Dash’s fault Praxa Prime has temporarily limited visitors. We’re at a pub now, and soon Dash will have us more work. This system is relatively stable, and still growing. In general, our life isn’t terrible. Why can’t you enjoy the night like the rest of us?”

“You just admitted Dash is subpar. Why do you keep defending him?” Brock said, much to Henrik’s delight.

“If both of you are so unhappy, then cancel your contract and find another ship,” Rosalie said. Henrik wanted to reply, but decided against it. Brock’s jaws flexed, and he remained silent as well. “That’s what I thought. A subpar captain is better than no work at all.”

“Speaking of our glorious leader,” Brock said, and nodded toward the entrance.

The ops crew followed the big engineer’s gaze to the flight crew standing by the door. A bot host led them to a booth. Dash and Gaius sat while Wesley scanned the crowd.

Henrik sank in the booth. “Please don’t see us,” he said as the medtech met his eyes and waved excitedly. Wesley navigated through the tables and booths, ducking between a rowdy cluster of cantankerous station techs, and came to a stop in front of the ops crew.

“Greetings, fellow crewmembers,” he said with a broad smile and glazed eyes. “This place is quite lively. Are we enjoying ourselves tonight?”

The temps all eyeballed the medtech like he was an escaped mental patient. “Have you been drinking?” Rosalie said.

“I had a glass of wine during the interview, nothing more. It was actually quite good, considering it was from a vendor,” he answered, and received a unanimous barrage of eye rolls.

“How’d the interview go?” Henrik prodded. He exchanged a knowing glance with Brock.

Wesley’s eyes lowered to the scuffed floor. “Um, well about that—”

Brock met Henrik’s gaze with arched eyebrows. “How’d Dash screw it up now?”

“It was Gaius, actually. The conversation was friendly until the candidate determined she’d had a prior encounter with him.”

“Good Lords, don’t tell me they bunked,” Rosalie said.

“No, nothing like that. She was serving on another ship when it had an incident with the *Stardancer* while docking at a station.”

“Let me guess,” Henrik said. He could picture Dash and Gaius scrambling on the bridge as the disaster unfolded. “Gaius clipped her ship, and once she found out, she wanted to throttle him.”

“Technically, he didn’t hit her, but she did clip the station in avoiding him.”

The ops crew let out a collective sigh of frustration. Henrik looked at each of the others, held his tongue, and turned back to the medtech. “Are there any other candidates lined up?”

“No,” Wesley said. He shifted on his feet, his cheer all but gone. “But we’ll keep looking. I promise we’ll find someone.”

“We’ll hold you to that,” Brock said, and gave the medtech a hard stare.

“If you’ll excuse me.” Wesley left the table before anyone could stop him.

No one spoke. After a minute, Henrik turned to Rosalie. “Still think I’m an ungrateful sack?”

“I do,” Rosalie said, and ordered another drink. “But one with a valid point about the captain.”

\*\*\*

“What’d they say?” Dash asked once Wesley stumbled back to their booth.

Wesley caught his foot as he went to sit in his seat and fell atop the cushion instead.

“I told you he’s a lightweight,” Gaius said to Dash as Wesley righted himself.

“I’m perfectly fine,” Wesley said, adjusting his shirt and smoothing his hair. “The ops crew said it was good to see the flight crew out enjoying themselves.”

“You’re a horrible liar,” Gaius chided the medtech. “They’re clearly annoyed we’re here.”

“They can go back to the ship if they don’t like it,” Dash said. He wasn’t leaving. “I want to know what they said about the interview.”

“They were disappointed,” Wesley said, and paused. “As we all are.” He slumped into his seat, letting his head fall back to rest against the cushion. “This evening did not turn out as I imagined.”

“On the bright side, that’s not the worst interview we’ve had,” Gaius said. “All she did was curse us out and throw her drink on you.”

“It’s close,” Dash said. “She didn’t try to stab us with a fork.”

“Look at it this way. It’s better she found out now, before we hired her and she flipped out in the middle of a run. At least we avoided dealing with the consequences of that.”

A retrofitted maintenance droid stopped at their booth and placed a drink order on the table. Dash distributed the drinks, placing a glass of clear liquid in front of Wesley. He sat up and eyed the glass in front of him. “I will continue to search for candidates. I know we can make this work,” he said, and drank from the glass. “Is this water?”

“Trust me, you need it. I don’t need you with a hangover, unable to treat my hangover,” Dash said. He noticed a commotion across the pub behind Wesley. A crowd gathered. “Looks like somebody’s causing problems.”

Gaius stood on the booth seat for a better view. “I think there’s a fight.”

“Don’t go over there,” Dash said, but Gaius had already left the booth.

Wesley stood as well. “Captain, I will accompany him.”

“That makes me feel so much better.”

“Someone may need medical attention—”

“Just go. I’ll be right there,” Dash said, and watched the medtech leave. He enjoyed one last swallow from his drink before following them. On the far side of the pub, he pushed through the growing congregation of onlookers to find two people wrestling on the ground. One of them, red-faced and angry, was his forever-irritable chief engineer. The other was a dark-haired woman, clinging to Henrik’s back, her arms wrapped around his neck in a choke hold. They grunted as they struggled against one another.

“Captain, we must help him!” Wesley said.

“No way, let them roll,” Gaius said over the growing chorus of cheers.

Dash surveyed the crowd surrounding the ruckus. “Where’s the rest of the ops crew? They know they need to babysit him.”

Gaius nodded toward the pub entrance. “Bouncers incoming.”

Dash spotted the thick-necked heads of two men approaching. He barged through the front row of onlookers, in no mood for this nonsense after the disastrous interview. He ignored the complaints of those he’d jostled and bent down next to the combating forms.

“Any reason you’re trying to pop the head off my chief engineer?” he said to the woman. “The bouncers are on their way over, so why don’t you two knock it off.”

Henrik and the woman paused their tussle, eyes scanning the myriad of strangers standing around them. Self-awareness dawned on their faces, and she released him. Henrik rolled away, coughing and cursing, while she stood up with the slow stretch of someone who’d drank too much.

“Show’s over,” Dash said to the crowd, who grumbled in collective disappointment.

“Toss off, freighter jockey,” said a short man with a comically high-pitched voice. His overalls were covered in the dirty metal specks of a salvage crew. His rudeness also befit the salvager reputation.

“Somebody’s been breathing in too many fumes. Go back to scraping a waste tank,” Dash said. The squeaky little runt and his equally rough-looking crew froze in stunned silence at the insult. When he recovered, he spit on Dash, regretting it immediately when Dash smacked him upside the head. Dash suffered a retaliatory punch from one of the runt’s crewmembers before the respective crews pulled the combatants apart.

“Captain, please, this is the last thing we need!” Wesley pleaded as he clung to one of Dash’s arms.

“He started it!” Dash said, knowing it sounded ridiculous as it came out. He noticed an unfamiliar set of sturdy arms wrapped around him. The woman had joined with Gaius and Wesley. He shook them off, and stumbled back into a thick body. He spun around and came face-to-chest with the walking tower of muscle that were the hulking bouncers. Their bad-tempered stares locked onto him like point defense turrets.

“Listen, I came here to break up the fight,” he said, and pointed over his shoulder at the salvage crew. “They wanted more.”

“You touch the staff, then the staff touches you,” one of the bouncers said. The other jabbed a stunner into Dash, who went rigid as burning pain rocked his body. The room tipped, and he fell into blackness."

I needed a source of income to just survive… I have credit card debt building from living expenses, school payments soon, I want to help out my family financially, and I want to be able to afford to buy Christmas presents for my loved ones, and most of all I want to stop feeling completely worthless for doing nothing with my life when everyone else my age are starting their careers.

It’s not an ideal position to be in, I‘ve been working a lot of unpaid internships hoping to get a job doing research/policy in non-profit issue advocacy but haven’t had any luck. However, I’m grateful that I have a roof over my head and my family has a spare old car I can use to work with some autonomy. I know that’s a privilege that a lot of people don’t have in my position, so I try to count my blessings… Back to the point of the post-&gt;&gt;

I was out dashing today, 7pm-12:30am, in a “very busy” city market (Downtown Baltimore) on a Saturday. Through that entire time I made abt $16 an hour on what’s supposed to be the busiest day of the week in the busiest market near me. I rarely had any orders come in (maybe 1-2 an hour) and the ones that did were far below $1/mi. I made $87 tonight and only $23 of it was from Door Dash, plus I had to buy $68 in gas so there goes what little money I did make.

I’m really frustrated because the previous Saturday I went out the same time and made $130 and had steady orders. I stay in hotspots, I constantly refresh my app when I’m not getting orders, and I always deliver on time with good ratings.

The only difference was my acceptance rate dropped below 50% since the last Saturday I was out. I thought it meant they wouldn’t give me priority on the diamond orders. I had NO IDEA that it meant they retaliate against you for not taking sub minimum wage orders by eliminating 90% of order offers you previously got. This isn’t the first night like this either, I’ve been out 3 other times since my rate dropped below 50%. Every night since Door Dash went from the main service I was delivering through when I had a higher acceptance rate, to giving me 2-3 orders a night remotely worth completing ($1.50/mi or not less than $12.50 an hour).

It’s very disheartening going out there and making less than minimum wage after fuel costs, unable to receive work even though I’m eager to do as many deliveries as it’ll give me. It just feels like shit. I’m trying to do all the right things but I feel like Door Dash threw me to the side once I stopped accepting orders that were essentially paying less than minimum wage. Uber eats wasn’t particularly fair in its pay either but at least it been giving me frequent orders. I try to follow all the DoorDash tips I find online. Idk what else to do.

Could anyone possibly help me figure out what to do? Anything would be extremely appreciated.

Thank you! And happy holidays everyone!"

I have tried to secure internships but have had no luck so-far, so I don't really have any experience ""in-the-field"" other than working summer jobs at restaurants.

I am part of a consulting organization on-campus where we offer pro-bono management consulting services to local businesses, and I have really enjoyed that. However, I am not a fan of what seems to be relatively low work-life balance in the world of consulting, and am unsure if I want to proceed with that route. I'm sure work-life balance varies company to company in the consulting world, but from what I understand as a whole it is pretty intensive time-wise.

As far as what I DO want in a job, it is admittedly vague, but I know I want a good work-life balance, like helping people, and don't like to travel that much (maximum I would prefer is once a month).

I'm also interested in data analytics, but know next-to-nothing on how to get into that field.

I know this post is kind of vague, but I'm just a naïve college student wondering what options there are for me. Thanks!"

Last year in September I started a one year masters in CS and when I went to (and continue to) apply for internship opportunities, practically every single posting says something alone the lines of “to apply, you must be in your penultimate year of study”.

But my course is only one year, there is no penultimate year. I imagine that this is targeted towards those who are doing a 3-4 year undergrad. 

So my question is, do I just apply anyway? Or are there internship opportunities that don’t care what year you’re in, as long as you’re studying CS? 

Due to a death in the family, I deferred my final project submission and thus, will be graduating September 2023. Just adding this detail in case it’s relevant.

- Is there a way I can spin my retail/customer service experience to make me more attractive to employers?

z6b6sx,3,2022-11-27,Received my first engineering job offer,Angelic_Acid_0301,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/z6b6sx/received_my_first_engineering_job_offer/,"TLDR:

Got my first job offer as a systems engineer. Offered 70K but not sure if that's standard for entry-level engineering jobs. This job is also not related to my major (biomedical engineering) but offers me the chance to continue my interest in computer science (something I began focusing on during my last 2 years). Not sure if I should take up this offer or try and find a medical company, need some advice.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm currently a Senior in college finishing up my bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering. Recently, I interviewed and received a call back from a pretty large company offering me a job as a Systems Engineer.

A little background on me. As biomed engineering student, I learned a variety of topics, with the majority of the courses being very similar to what electrical engineering students take. I've also come to really enjoy learning computer science topics and have taken advantage of a couple of courses where I've learned about machine learning and data science. I also had an internship over the summer where I focused on researching neural networks. 

With all that in mind, this job offer was very unexpected but also thrilling since it's been really hard to find any company that would hire me because of the major I choose. 

They offered me a starting salary of 70k, tho they aren't a medical company the role will also allow me to learn more about data science and I'll be in a team where I will be working on data coming from their product. On one hand, this feels like a great opportunity where I can continue to learn more about computer science topics plus they also offer tuition reimbursement and I'm interested in pursuing a master's in computer science. 

On the other hand, I really was hoping to find a position where I could work on medical imaging and use AI tools to improve the medical field. I just don't think I'm at that level and from the looks of it, many positions I like to require experience and higher education than what I can offer.

I need some advice regarding this job, should I accept it (this is my first offer and I've applied and interviewed at other companies but have been either rejected or ghosted)? I've heard for biomeds that very few make it to a medical company with most taking up quality engineering, or doing electrical or mechanical type positions. I need some advice on what to do and if also the salary is good for an entry-level position."

z6irgn,1,2022-11-27,Considering moving from my comfy big tech job to startups - is it a foolish idea for salarymaxxing?,SentineL-EX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z6irgn/considering_moving_from_my_comfy_big_tech_job_to/,"I have 5 YOE as a programmer and started my latest job as a mid-level engineer in October of last year. Big Seattle area company, 50/50 guess which one. A good chunk of my salary came from stocks, except my vesting schedule was calculated on a day when the company stock price hit an all-time high so that's been a little... underwhelming. With the current price and my bonus I made 200k this year. I don't think 2023 will be a good year for the market fwiw but that's a separate point. Suffice to say, I'm starting to feel the urge to shop around again, maybe a little earlier than I previously expected but at least to see what options I have and how they compare to my current gig, even if I ultimately decide to stay for longer.

The question I have for myself, and also for the community here, is where I should start looking for opportunities. The natural first option is other big tech companies in the Seattle, but it's a short list even including the ones with smaller satellite offices here, and I'd like to get a bigger picture. The other choices I'm considering are smaller but established companies, which I've had some internship experience in; startups both inside and outside of tech, where I have no prior experience; and looking for another industry altogether that either has a local presence or is looking for remote hires. This post is about the second one.

I have no passion for my current job and this has been the case for all of my previous jobs. That's not to say I don't find the work interesting, or that I don't put effort into my work, but this is something I do purely to draw a paycheck and that I can do indefinitely long without burning out, and nothing more. Of course I'll do my homework on both the company and any prospective positions I'm eyeing so that I can have something to talk about during the interview, but really as long as I'm confident in my ability to do the job, I don't care too much about what it actually is I'm doing.

Startups seem like the exact opposite of what I'm looking for in that regard. They usually pay less compared to established companies, aside from equity in the company which may all turn into dust if the startup goes under. They demand longer hours and because a small number of people can make or break the business they can often require their employees to actually be driven. That said, I don't lack the drive altogether - for a project with the right motivation I have and will pull an all-nighter to see it through to the very end. And although I might not get the glamorous TC I dream of, my thought is that by being part of a smaller group I can get more of the comprehensive experience - managing a bunch of moving parts - that I can use to sell myself as a worthwhile mid-level and eventually senior developer elsewhere.

I also think that if either I go to work for a company that crashes and burns or I myself do, I can always go do something else without any long-term damage to my career prospects.

On the subject of hopping industries, there are quite a few financial startups in the Seattle area (or fully remote) hiring for quant roles that I feel like I can fill, at least with a little studying to refresh my skills, compared to established outfits that mostly hire in NYC and Chicago and don't have much in the way of remote work. My educational background is in mathematical finance - I got a master's in it in 2019. In the meantime I've been interested enough to maintain most of the knowledge I gained through that program, even though I haven't really had any opportunities to apply it. Maybe I'm even a little passionate about it - I do follow the markets in the spare time - but I think this is because for now it's a hobby and not something I do 40 hours a week. I have a feeling that if I got a finance job I'd just flip to being dispassionate about finance and having a mild but persistent interest in certain fields of software.

So, long story short, I like my current job but I am very greedy. Are startups something I should seriously consider as a career route into future riches, or should I stay the course and look for opportunities at big companies including my current one?"

I have been coding since March of 2022 and taught myself HTML, CSS, JS, React, and C#/.NET.  I am currently halfway into my 6 month internship for software engineering that ends at March.  I will have a good sized blazer server project that will be pushed into production. 

I wanted to ask for advice on what I should do to increase my chances of getting a job without a CS degree (I posses a bachelors in biology)? I have thought about doing Leetcode, learning the MERN stack, and build another decent sized project.  Also, wanted to reach out and hopefully connect with some recruiters.

z6k3rm,10,2022-11-27,Does the reputation of the company you work for matter when looking for new opportunities?,AlliedOrphan203,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z6k3rm/does_the_reputation_of_the_company_you_work_for/,"I just graduated from the University of Maryland with a CS degree in May, and I immediately jumped into an internship at a small, not too well-known defense contractor. I was then offered a full time opportunity as a software developer with them and have been working in that role since September. 

I took that job because it was the better offer out of the two that I had - I started at 72.5k with decent benefits and I really liked the people and work environment of the internship.

I’ve heard especially from this subreddit that once you have your first full time dev role it gets much easier to find future opportunities. However, I’ve also heard that that’s mostly the case for well-known companies. Not to say that the company I work for has a bad track record or is frowned upon, it is a navy contractor and has a good contract and great job security, it is just not very well-known like a lot of other contractors mostly due to its size.

I guess I’m just trying to gauge whether or not it might be harder to sell myself when it comes to recruiting and interviewing in the future."

I have just attended a university careers meeting which wasn't overly helpful, so I am now turning to reddit to get some advice on my situation. 

Current situation: Completed 2nd year of a 3 year BSc Physics. However, 90% sure I will not take it to a higher level (MSc, PhD etc.). 

So, in searching for a job after university, I will be looking to 'apply' my skills to another field. Fields I have applied for internships within are involve Data / Business Analyst, Software Engineer, Finance, Quant roles. I was unsuccessful in getting an internship, and whilst it could well be because of a weaker application, I am also anxious that I am competing with those who are enrolled in degrees within those specific fields. 

If I know I will not be doing Physics to a higher level, is it worth taking an extra semester / year to pursue a degree such as Data Science / Computer Science to make me more competitive in those fields? 

Please let me know if you would like any extra details. Thanks in advance for the help :D"

However, my GPA is not necessarily the best (&lt; 3.2/3.3). This was from my first semester in college and this can certainly be increased a decent amount (although I list my graduation date only as 2024 as I have the credits to do so which I'm assuming helps me out a bit).

Also, I noticed none of the companies I applied to except for Google even asked me to send in the transcript along with the application. I'm wondering if most companies will ask to send it in after I receive an offer. Perhaps I'm just overthinking this as this is my first application cycle."

I (25F) graduated in 2018 from a great school. Since then it's been a shit show, lost my first job, weeks after moving to a new state for the job, then ended up in a traumatic toxic job environment, then worked a bunch of menial jobs to make ends meet, then a bunch of family shit and a traumatic relationship. Then picked myself back up and got a $15 an hr internship in my industry. I was proud. Then i got promoted after working my ass off, then I got a job on wall street in my indistry, then got laid off a month ago. Things started to finally look up after 3 years. Now I've been laid off for over a month, i didn't tell anyone except my best friend. I'm sooo tired. I'm with my folks for thanksgiving now and i see how hard they're struggling to make ends meet.

I’ve gotten a good scholarship at both unis, but UNSW definitely works out quite cheaper. I’m concerned about coming here mainly because I’ve heard that coops and internships are almost impossible for intentional students to land. Is this true or do I have my facts wrong? 
Also, how do you all find the courses and the whole uni experience? Are you happy with your decisions or do you have any regrets?
I’d love to hear from both domestic and international students at UNSW!"

Really sorry if this seems to come off in a negative tone, but it seems like people with better credentials, resumes, gpas will automatically be viewed in a better light, and I can't land an interview or internship anywhere, not that I feel like I know anything useful about how to do so, or that my efforts matter even a bit. 

I want to do something to get better. But that's the thing, I don't ever feel like anything matters. I have all these fears and anxieties, yes, and a hopeless want and need to get something, and even probably the raw skill to learn many things, but it works against me. I can't do it. Certainly I don't have social skills or connections - please, please, please tell me, what can I ever feasibly do to get out? To give myself a future? 

I can't 'try my best.' I can see and observe that there is no 'best' to be found in anything I do, and reaching for it would only harm me because it's impossible. But there's always something I'm missing. Every day it haunts me to no end how I can't ever be as good, how I can work for all this while, and in the end it'll all probably mean nothing because I failed that one course in the beginning and tanked my gpa, or I missed out on one project or thing or bandwagon and have to live in regret forever, sinking in the what-ifs. But I just don't know. What can I do? 

Case in point, I'm an overly introspective, hopeless overthinker who would rather do this than tackle my problems. Because due to my fearfulness, I don't have enough information to figure out what I can do that matters - and as for my question before, well, I gave no info on that front. I just live in this shameful, helpless way with no end in sight, isolated and hopeless. I guess I want to feel less alone. I guess I've always just *wanted to know* what everyone else knew that I didn't. Because I'm sure if I only just *knew* then I'd be able to learn how to be good enough for just a bit too... Fat chance I'll get anything useful doing this, but whatever.

I try to leetcode daily and learn about javascript/python on the side but I can only obligate myself to do just a tiny bit, while I have a deathly fear of studying and apparently real 'effort.' My grades are utter trash; I'm behind on everything including code knowledge and I don't know what projects to do; does it even matter? I don't know how long I can consistently do anything, especially since I literally don't find anything very pleasant and have absolutely zero meaningful human contact; I'm basically just waiting to die if I can't be useful. I'm also always on the edge of complete mental breakdown, and have no money, and no information and resources, an avoidant personality, also clinging onto the edge of the black hole of school assignments I can't do; because they're too hard and I'm too behind, and because I feel like everyone else is better so it doesn't even matter how hard I try here. So yeah, that's my vent. If you read this whole thing, I hope you can read something more pleasant/useful/interesting next (or provide me with it, or a reality check, or anything? I actually don't even read this sub so uh, sorry if this is the wrong place to post)"

I’m in my third year of mechanical engineering and have done an internship at the same company the past two summers doing product development testing and I’m trying to decide if I should do a long term 12-16 month internship at this same company in between year 3 and 4 or if I should just do another summer internship and finish my degree faster or go to a different company to get a wider range of skills before fourth year ?
 
I really enjoy the position at the current company I’ve worked at but I’m not confident I can work there out of school so doing a longer term internship ensures I get the experience there while I can because it’s a great company and pays well but just wanted to see what other people think about extending their degree by a year to do longer term internships in between year 3 and 4 and also what people think about staying at the same company compared to going to multiple different companies for internships throughout the degree. 

I’d appreciate any opinions or advice thank you."

z6r9t7,115,2022-11-28,Pouring my heart out! A long post ahead.,superadminahah,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/z6r9t7/pouring_my_heart_out_a_long_post_ahead/,"TLDR: I lost my early 20s due to lots of family issues. Had no support from anyone. I kept going on my own, but now I'm losing my mind. Do I have a future, or should I just end my suffering? I don't have anyone else to share this with and seek advice to improve my current situation. All your honest opinions are welcome.

I recently turned 28(M), and I have reached the conclusion that my life will not get any better. Chronic depression and anxiety have completely ruined my mental and physical well-being. I'm tired of micromanaging everything in my home. I just need a break. I lost my early 20s due to my mother's illness and the past 2 years due to this fucking covid. And now I'm just a living corpse. Every time I try to change my life, something terrible happens.

In February 2014, I cleared the Intermediate Group-1 exams of my professional degree on the first attempt. I was over the moon. But little did I know that my life was about to take a complete 180°. It was the year when my elder sister left us to marry someone from a different cast without saying anything or thinking about our mother. I don't want to go into detail, as it was a very complex situation. My sister later realised her mistake and returned to us, but the damage was already done.

This whole scenario ruined our lives to a great extent. My mother and I were forced to leave the house we had been living in for the past 20 years (my maternal grandparent's home). Instead of supporting us, everyone rejected us. It was mentally a rough phase in our lives. As a result, I couldn't able to study for the whole year.

Early 2015: We shifted to a rented apartment in a different place (for obvious reasons). I finally started preparing for my exams. Earlier my mother's office was within walking distance, but now she had to commute via public transport, and that's when she had an accident and got diagnosed with AVN in both hips. The doctor advised the surgery on both hips: Core decompression and Total Hip Replacement. I again had to take a break from my studies, as I had to manage everything from pre-surgery preparations to post-surgery care.

1. Standing in queues in a government hospital for countless hours for radiology and blood tests. 
2. Weight loss for both surgeries. 
3. Diet management. 
4. Physiotherapy for pain management.

I did everything. In return, it took everything from me. All this took 2.5 years of my life, but it was all worth it in the end. My mother was finally pain-free.

August 2017: Fast forward to 2017, and our life finally had some stability. Both operations were successful, and we again shifted to a rented apartment near my mother's office. I also resumed preparations for my exams. I appeared in December 2017 term and cleared them in the first attempt. When the results were announced in February 2018, I cried like a little kid. It was an emotional moment for me. Right after that, I started applying for internships and was fortunate enough to get an internship in the finance department of BHEL (2018-2019). I was earning 12k per month and was extremely happy with it.

April 2018: My sister wanted to get married again, and we agreed and told her to give us some time, as financially, we were in no position to afford it. But she was adamant about getting married then and forced our mother to take a huge loan. Thankfully, I was also earning at that time, so we survived somehow. But I couldn't able to save money for my finals registration fees.

April 2019: When my tenure was over in BHEL, I again started applying for internships due to obvious reasons and was fortunate enough to get selected in IOCL (2019-2020). I was earning 22k per month there, but most of my stipend went towards EMIs. I didn't want to do it, but I had no choice.

Mid 2019: This was the worst period of my life. I lost my uncle (mama) at a young age. He was the only brother my mother had. He was like a father figure to me. He committed suicide. I can't explain how hard it was for me, mentally and physically. I was in so much pain. I was doing an internship in IOCL then, and it somehow helped me keep going through this situation.

March 2020: My internship with IOCL ended in March 2020. I saved some money for my finals registration fees and coaching, but covid had other plans. Like most people, we also faced financial difficulties at that time—one thing after another. I was unemployed, and bills were starting to pile up, so I had no choice but to use my savings. On top of that, lockdowns and isolation deeply fucked my mental health. I went into depression. Sleepless nights, overthinking, and suicidal thoughts engulfed me.

2021: Hell of a roller coaster ride so far, right? But it isn't over yet. In April 2021, I got severe covid. My mother admitted me in a private hospital because she was scared of the situation in government hospitals. She again had to take a loan, this time because of me. I survived covid, which I didn't want to. The after-effects were just too much for me. Brain fog, chest pain, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, dry eyes and so on, and I'm still experiencing a few of these symptoms. Long covid, maybe? Covid completely broke me in many ways. In August 2021, after much deliberation, I finally registered for my finals. My mother had to take another loan for that but couldn't able to sit for exams due to wrecked physical and mental health.

2022: Started this year with positivity. I wanted to clear my finals asap so I could start applying for real jobs and finally give my mother a much-deserving break. But the sister's husband had other plans. My sister was going through a tough time in her married life. A lot of bad things happened. She wanted a divorce, and that jerk was giving her death threats for the same. He knew how vulnerable we were and took advantage of it. We did file a police complaint and were in constant touch with Delhi Mahila Aayog. But ultimately, It was all sorted out with lots of apologies and documentation. We supported her throughout this, but it took a lot of time, patience and resources. Now, she's living peacefully with him and expecting a child.

Current situation: I feel completely lost at this stage of life. I'm mentally not well. It's badly affecting my job prospects in many ways. I'm not able to think clearly at times. Chronic depression and anxiety have ruined me. I have left no confidence in myself. I have no social life. I want to get better. I want to complete my finals, as it will open many opportunities for me.

My mother is in pain and taking painkillers every day. She needs Total hip replacement surgery on her right hip. Due to my unemployment and outstanding loans, we are in no position to afford it. I'm so puzzled and overwhelmed by all this. How do I get my life back on track? I'm sick and tired of faking a smile every day. How much more do I have to endure? I just want normalcy for once in my life.

Thank you."

\- I am a computer science student entering the last semester of my bachelor, studying in Montreal, QC.

\- I have about \~1.5 years total of internship experience in QA/software development, and \~0.5 years as a PM intern (my last job), at a high growth Canadian startup. We can call this company, company X.

My boss at company X recently reached out to me to offer a full-time position at Company X, starting in January 2023. Problem is, I still have one semester (4 classes) left of school, and am thus only set to graduate in April 2023.

I really enjoyed my time interning at company X, by Canadian startup standards, the company is very reputable, they are well funded, and I was able to immediately jump into high visibility work. Admittedly, the hours were very long and the job was quite stressful, but \*to a degree\* I kind of enjoy that.

Since they are a startup, they really only hire based on need at a given moment, so despite my boss really taking a liking to me, he could not guarantee a position would be available for me once I graduate in April 2023.

With New Graduate PM roles being so rare (I have yet to see any posted on LinkedIn for my city), would it be a terrible idea to just take the job now, and then either finish my schooling part time, or preferably, do my last semester sometime in the future between jobs?

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, if I go with the option of finishing my last semester all at once, how much would not being graduated hinder me from switching jobs in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:**

Wow I did not expect this to blow up, all your responses have been super helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, I requested to my boss to work 3x/week until May, and he seems open to the idea and has said he will contact HR and get back to me. (thank you u/newidentity1 for the suggestion)

&amp;#x200B;

If the part-time option ends up being possible, I will take 3 classes while part-time, and then 1 in the summer while full-time, fulfilling all my credits.

&amp;#x200B;

Else, I will just graduate next semester taking all four courses, and search for other opportunities (or go back to my employer if they offer me something in May).

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up deciding against working full-time immediately as I think it's best at that point to finish my degree all at once, and take what I can get in the short-term, as noted by others."

But I simply want to share this experience ups and downs of the past 6 months of my life,

7 months ago I was running an advertising agency which I had started alone with my savings from working at entry-level jobs so I was excited I was planning to move to Delhi and get a job as a Frontend Developer even if I would have not found it for a couple of months.

But there was n old woman one of my employer's mothers who I used to help and she's rich so she said let me help with starting a cyber café kind of business where you will be able to do your computer work and at the same time run the shop, I said I don't have that much of money to start that kind of business so she said she would help me buy a pc and printer, although I didn't want to do it because of the unknown outside world I didn't move from the city.

But little did I know she got me a shop which was a storeroom for her son's shop and it was off the side of the road, she made me reconstruct, and renovate it and my all savings were gone and once the business was about to start her son who had a good business mind with ideas demanded that we don't make it cyber or a web development agency or anything but n ad agency and I had no idea how to design or market or any of that thing so then he said he would like to take 50% of my business profits plus rent and all...

I was alone powerless and felt I am in debt, I was away from my family and living alone and it was shitty I ran the business and was able to get 15k to 20k a month but it wasn't enough to cause every day that old lady used to call me to multiple errands(go to market and get me these long list of stuff, come to court with me, wash my dishes, etc).

I counted continued after 3 months with no savings or profit everything I had earned I lost eventually I returned all the pieces of machinery and the debt was over.

I forcefully said I don't want to do this shit anymore, and she used to say to other ppl that I have made this boy's life and shit if you do n act on something good is it really necessary to advertise it? It isn't

after that, I returned home and did n internship at a Chennai Based company remotely after working for 3 weeks where I wrote tests, made landing pages, and completed other projects one of the managers who doesn't have fucking experience with code said I am too young and that I should join them later, I mean what the fuck the internship was 5k a month and they didn't even give that...

It's fine then for some months I learned online did some interviews and made some good friends who are successful software developers some of them helped me get a freelancing project and I was doing it but somehow that client didn't make money to continue so I had to drop the project.

Then, again I was doing interviews and stuff many of them were learning steps and many of them rejected me because I ain't got a degree...

During that period 2 months ago my father got serious about alcohol withdrawal and he lost his mind, and was acting weird and agitated all the time, So I was in the hospital with him after the rehabilitation and stayed in the hospital.

Again a friend of mine referred me to a start-up where I started working as a senior software dev under the contract that, I have to work for a year without leaving and if left before that i have to return 3 months' salary which was amazing right? 

I made 2 projects for them, an E-commerce site and a Blockchain site after that he asked for my bank details and never paid me, kicked me out of the group...

So, Now I don't know what the fuck should I do, do I continue chasing this path to get paid as a software dev, or maybe I should give up and start another endeavor?"

Spent like 5 mins fiddling with the boolean algebra on the whiteboard trying to make it work. Couldn't do it.

""So the problem is I need an inverter to implement this term"", I said.

Interviewer stayed silent.

""am I allowed to use them?"", I asked. What a stupid question, in hindsight lol.

""no. that's the point of the question"". I was feeling quite stuck and would have appreciated a hint at this point. At previous technical interviews they would usually help you along the way, but they didn't give me anything.

I somehow did not think of the concept that it is possible to also build an inverter out of a NAND gate. They must have thought I would figure that out if I stared at the board long enough, but nope, I did not. We moved on from the question with me feeling very stupid, and me feeling doubly stupid the second the interview finished and I immediately realised the answer.

Ugh.

On the bright side I answered most of the other questions pretty well imo. There was a C++ question with pointers which I had to bs my way through (I barely know C++, it's on my resume purely for keywords) and my coding question passed 13/14 test cases which they said was ""good enough"". The issue is I have no idea what the standard for this kind of thing is. Is it fairly common to 100% every question and the decision is really made on who can explain their methods the best? If that's the case I'm screwed.

So what do you guys think? Should I just look for more internships?"

Opportunity 1: is internship at Yong Loo Lin SoM doing Oncology Research with Dr. Alan Kumar (https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/1091-alan-prem-kumar/about). 

Opportunity 2: following a MD with her daily work. 

Opportunity 3: is internship at A*STAR. 

Opportunity 4: is internship with Oncology Medical Doctor.

I will be doing job shadowing at one of the hospitals before my medical sch interview. 

Which opportunity would help me to stand out during my medical interview? 

Please help me by giving me some recommendations. Thank you!

Edit: If anyone from NUS Life Sci has been taught by Dr. Alan Kumar, please also give me some insights about him. Thank you!"
z72ukt,8,2022-11-28,"Microsoft Remote NYC vs Redmond, Wa",mansamusa02,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/z72ukt/microsoft_remote_nyc_vs_redmond_wa/,"So I’m contemplating between taking my microsoft offer remote to be with friends in NYC or just doing it in person at Redmond and these are the points that I’m considering. Also important to note that this is my last summer internship: 

NYC 
- Get to be in NYC
- All of college friends will be there and potentially my gf 
- No access to Microsoft office 
- WFH would make it harder to focus personally. Could also get bored at home 
- Would have to make all meals 
- Could potentially pocket some of housing stipend if I find housing for decent price 


Redmond, WA
- No college friends in the area
- Location doesn’t seem to interest me
- Would have access to office and would be able to work one on one w team (important for return offer) 
- Would receive 1.2k transportation stipend 
- Get to meet other Microsoft interns 

Would really appreciate feedback on what I should do especially if someone has had the same conflict.
