iedv9,1,2011-07-01,[2nd attempt] First time rooming with 3 girls! I need reddit's advice (and plenty of it). ,sohardtoget,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iedv9/2nd_attempt_first_time_rooming_with_3_girls_i/,"Let's try this again:


So I've got this amazing internship that required me to relocate (I'm not going to say where) but it ended up so that I'm finding it ridiculously hard to get a place to rent out that is within my meager student + internship stipend budget.

Luckily, my sis has a couple of friends in the area, and she really pressured them into temporarily accommodating me. The only places opening up are a good 3-4 weeks away which means I'll be crashing with my sis's friend and 2 of her roommates in a 3 bedroom/2 bath apt. The only thing my sister warned me was that they're going to give off major hippie vibes, whatever that means.

Clearly I'm going to be crashing on the couch and there shall be no shenanigans, I hope so, and I'll definitely be putting the toilet seat down. But I'm completely clueless and super-shy to ask my sis what else to do (she's probably on reddit, that's why the throwaway). I've just moved in and it already feels super weird. I've already seen one of her roommates cleaning the house in a towel and a bunch of girly paraphernalia all fucking over the bathroom.

Oh, also, for various reasons, I'll be working from my this place 3 days a week, including weekends, and that is only probably going to make things more awkward. I tried scouting around for coffee shops and what not, but they're a good mile or so away and not very cheap. So clearly for now I'm stuck here and for the forseeable future 3 weeks.

So what does reddit recommend I do to make my stay as painless to them as possible? I'm 19, in case that matters (I believe they're around 22, but I never asked -- guessing from my sis's age).

All together (including a small fee for assembling) that's about 700€, which is about the budget I have as well.

As it says in the title I mainly want to use the computer for gaming (games like Portal, Fallout 3, Half Life 2 etc.) and maybe some basic graphical things (drawing, photoshop...). And I'd love for it to last a bit, meaning I don't have to buy a new one/add components in a year or something if I want to keep playing the newly published games (if that is possible... See? I really have no idea, duh.)

So I'm wondering - is this a suitable build?
Do I have to add something are their better options for certain parts and so on. Thanks A LOT in advance!"
ift0a,4,2011-07-03,Not sure where to go from here with ex-girlfriend. Any insight would be much appreciated!,bmars801,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ift0a/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here_with_exgirlfriend/,"Hey everyone, I'm hoping to get some post-relationship advice. My situation requires a somewhat lengthy backstory, so bear with me.

I became good friends with a girl during the fall of 2009. I didn't have any feelings for her at all; she was just a nice person to talk to.

The day she moved back into her dorm room for spring semester of 2010, we chatted on FB and she asked if I wanted to hang out. Thinking nothing of it, I said sure and brought a movie over to her place. We sat and talked for a bit, but after we started the movie, she started cuddling up to me, and eventually started making out with me. I had never done anything like that before, let alone been in a relationship, so I just let it happen.

Before I go any further, I want you all to know that we never had sex. We're both loose Christians, but we both wanted to save ourselves for marriage.

Anyway, a few days later, she became my first girlfriend. This lasted all of three weeks.

One day we met up and she told me she didn't feel ""that way"" about me anymore. I was shocked because things were going PERFECTLY, and this came completely out of nowhere. There was NOTHING to indicate that we were even close to being on the rocks. She said it was nothing I did, and said she just woke up the day before and didn't feel that way anymore.

We met up again the next week, and she told me she already got into another relationship with another guy, and it started merely TWO DAYS after she broke up with me.

She later told me that this guy was a total douche. He was very judgmental and would yell at her a lot, leaving her crying herself to sleep on some occasions. Yet she still stayed with him for three months. He finally broke it off with her at the end of the semester because he didn't want to do a long distance relationship. She vented this to me which only made me feel worse because I was more than willing to keep our relationship going throughout the summer.

I broke off contact with her completely that summer, but the damage was done. I was DEVASTATED about this. Not a day went by where I didn't think about the whole situation, and start beating myself up about it as a result. I started working out, I started working on a website outside of work, but NOTHING I did could take my mind off of it. It got to the point where I was having suicidal thoughts almost daily.

Once fall semester started and my life once again became more dynamic than working a 9-5, I really started feeling better emotionally. I ran into her outside of work one day and we started talking again. We became pretty close friends during that time, but I still had feelings for her.

I eventually made a move on her after we watched a movie at my place. We cuddle for a bit (her words: ""cuddling is harmless""). After we cuddled for a while, I said ""fuck it"" and kissed her, and she kissed me back. We made out for a while and then I left because she had to get up early the next morning.

Later that week she told me to come over. She knew I wanted to get back together with her, but she said she didn't want to. She didn't feel that way about me, and she simply didn't have time for a relationship. The latter made sense because she's going to school for nursing, and that's pretty much a 24/7 studying commitment. However, she said she would have no problem cuddling from time to time if I wanted to. So we became ""Friends With Cuddling Benefits"".

The next few weeks went alright. She turned 21, and spent her 21st birthday at my place. She had never gotten drunk before, and I was someone she trusted to do that with. More cuddling, more making out, etc.

During this time, I was in a break-up therapy group, and I told them about the situation. EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the group said ""get out right now, you're going to get hurt if you keep this up much longer"". After a lot of thought, I realized they were right and it was time for this to end. But I didn't want it to end abruptly for me like our relationship did, so I decided to have one more night with her.

We met up to watch another movie at her place, and I went into it mentally prepared for it to most likely be the last time we do anything like this. After the movie, we were cuddling again and I brought up what I was thinking about what we were doing. She agreed that we may be leading ourselves down the wrong path, and one of us might get hurt.

We kept cuddling for a few more hours before I left. Sure enough, she called me the next day and said we shouldn't do it anymore. I was prepared for it, so it didn't hurt as much. This was in December of 2010.

Ever since then, I can count on one hand the number of times we've hung out because we've both been so busy with work and school. The last time we even talked was when she came to my 22nd birthday (2 months ago). We got along fine, even though I still had some lingering feelings for her.

But three days later, I log onto Facebook and see the following on my news feed: ""&lt;ex-girlfriend&gt; is in a relationship with &lt;new guy&gt;"".

WHAT. THE. HELL.

She told me, in her exact words, ""I don't have time for a relationship"". She LIED to me. All this time she kept reiterating that it had nothing to do with me or anything I did, but at this point how can I believe that?

I didn't want to talk to her, but at the same time I didn't want to just cut her off from me without saying anything. So all I did was block all posts from her from showing up on my news feed, and keep myself logged off from Facebook chat so I wouldn't see her profile picture.

I've been feeling AMAZING since then. Sure, I still have occasional guilt trips about this whole thing, but for the first time since the breakup (almost a year and a half at this point), I'm finally starting to feel like ME again. I've become more pleasant and outgoing, I'm hitting the gym harder than ever, I'm improving my public speaking skills, I'm performing better than ever at work (my project leads are at a loss for words over how well and how fast I'm completing my work), the list goes on. I feel like I'm primed and ready for when I start interviewing for full time jobs for when I graduate in December (I'm currently a software engineering intern, in case anyone is wondering).

Here's where you come in Reddit: Two nights ago, I received a message from her on Facebook saying ""We haven't hung out in FOREVER! How's are you? How's summer going?"". This girl has made the last year and a half of my life a living hell, and I'm not ready to start talking to her again, and honestly I don't feeling like I ever will be at this point. I want to say ""How can you honestly think we can remain friends after everything you've done to me?"", but it's not in my character to actually go through with something like that.

I have no clue where to go from here. I don't want to talk to her, but I'm not willing to put her down at all, and ignoring her is obviously out of the question now. What do I do/say?

**TL;DR:** In a relationship for 3 weeks, she breaks up with me out of nowhere. She dates a guy that treats her like shit, leaving me feeling extremely depressed (almost suicidal) for an entire summer. We start talking again and become close friends. I eventually make a move, but she doesn't want to get back together, saying she doesn't have time for a relationship. We become cuddle buddies for a while but break that off because we figured one of us was going to get hurt eventually. A few months later she gets into a new relationship (remember she told me she didn't have time for one). I don't talk to her at all out of spite, and she finally PMs me on FB two nights ago, asking how I'm doing because we haven't talked in a while. She doesn't know I'm pissed at her and want nothing to do with her, but I'm not willing to tell her off. What do I do?"
ifsru,7,2011-07-03,"Reddit, I need your advice (from people who were Comp Science and MIS majors in successful careers)",pharcydeeee,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ifsru/reddit_i_need_your_advice_from_people_who_were/,"I'm typing this from my phone so pardon the grammar mistakes. 

Some back story on me: 

I graduated with a bachelor's in finance last year probably during the worst time to graduate with a finance degree. Needless to say, I have yet to even get close to landing a job finance related. I made several mistakes while in college. 

One being taking 2 years off of college to travel and then upon returning into school I took it easy and took one or two classes a semester. This led me to graduate in 2010 at 26 instead of graduating around 2006 with a better economy. 

Second is I didn't do any internships. I feel that once I graduated I am looking over my undergrad years and doing all the career planning and researching on majors more than I did before I started college. This is all stuff I wish I knew at 18. 

So here's where I am at today. I am considering graduate school because, for me at least, seems like a ""do over"" and me fixing all the mistakes I've made as an undergrad. Yes, I am well aware a degree is just a piece of paper and experience trumps all (I am a prime example) but degree in tech fields I feel prepare graduates better for employment regardless of experience. Additionally, I'd take more weight in doing internships, joining clubs and organizations, and networking this time around. 

Things I've considered for graduate school:

1) An MBA. This option to me seems pointless at this point in my career because I lack any work experience besides being a Personal Banker at a bank. Additionally, I've heard that an MBA is pointless unless you're going to get into a top 20 MBA program. While I do enjoy aspects of business/finance and economics, getting into a top 20 MBA program without 5 years of experience is essentially very slim. 

2) A MS in MIS. A lot of people will say why get a MS in MIS when a bachelor's is enough. I already have a bachelor's, and I think having two bachelor's is a terrible idea when I can just go right in and get a MS in MIS and be considered on par or better than the guy with a bachelor's in MIS. It's more on the business end and I do understand working with databases from part time tech jobs I've work in the past in college. I am leaning more towards this because I can get into a Master's program in Jan 2012 and be done in Dec 2012. 

3) A MS in Comp Science. This option came out of left field when I was talking with my friends who are currently wrapping up their MS in Mechanical Engineering. They were basically saying a Comp Science major will always be able to find work, regardless of what you hear from people who say jobs are being outsourced. I have taken basic programming level in classes as an undergrad (intro to C+ and Java) and did fairly well and found it fun, but I am sure the further I get into it the more complex it'll get. If I went this route, I'd have to do 9 or 10 pre-req courses and then the Master's classes. Essentially it'd take 3 or 4 years and I am kind of put off at the fact that I'd be 30 when I'd graduate with a MS in Comp Sci. From my understanding, Comp Sci graduates go on to go into very lucrative and rewarding careers. 

So are there any Comp Sci majors who are late graduates in successful careers? Or career changers who decided to major in Comp Sci from an undergrad that wasn't Comp Sci? Any successful MIS majors?

One thing that I tend to do a lot, namely when I am programming in a new language or doing something that is new for me, is I guess what could be described as trial and error. When I'm not sure if what I am coding is right, I tend to try one small thing, compile and run and see what happened and fix it appropriately. I do this over and over until I get what I want. The problem I am now seeing, namely at my new internship, is sometimes the compile time is pretty long. So I can still do this ""method of learning"" but it takes 2-3 times longer than I am used to. Is this a bad way to go about doing things? Just to clarify, I know a lot about programming, I only tend to do this for things that are new to me. I can read all I want about a subject but most times example code online isn't enough. One part of me is saying that everyone does this (and if so this post probably seems idiotic) but the other part tells me I'm doing something different here. Can anyone help shed some light on this for me?

TL;DR Is programming by an iterative trial and error process a plausible method for learning how to do certain programming tasks?"

I apologize if I ask something that has been asked countless times before.  

First off, I have recently graduated as an undergraduate with a degree in Biochemistry.  After working in research labs and other jobs/internships in my field, I realized, a little too late, that I have no interest at all in that field.  Which is something my friends have been telling me for the past 3 years.  However, I do enjoy programming and do it in my spare time.  I took a Java course in college, aced it.  Taught myself HTML, PHP, C++ and I guess Basic for fun.  I feel like I can use all of these languages with reasonable levels of skill. I have also made several small programs/projects for fun as a result of me learning these languages and am picking up C# right now.

So here is my first question.  I was originally going to go for a Masters or PhD in Biochemistry, but have decided against that.  Would it be worth trying to get a masters in CS?  I am aware that this would probably be a somewhat difficult transition, having very little formal training in the field.  If I build up my self made portfolio and somehow prove myself, what would the chances of me getting in be?  Additionally, since I have taken very few courses in CS, I have almost no knowledge of the theoretical portions of CS.

Also, would I really need a Masters degree right now?  Currently, because of some of the projects I have done in the past along with lucky connections, I have a job/pseudo internship with a small company as a web developer, working with PHP.  I looked online for jobs and saw many companies would state a job requirement of a bachelors in CS or something equivalent.  Assuming I keep working on my skills, do I need a Masters degree right now?  I guess what I am trying to ramble on about is what does a Masters or higher degree offer me?

Finally, how should I go about improving my portfolio?  I have read elsewhere on this subreddit and others that I should see if I can jump into some open source projects or something akin to this.  Does this mean I should find some others who are working on a project or have an idea, or starting up my own project?  

Sorry if I am rambling.  I am still trying to organize my thoughts right now.  Thanks for any advice you can give."

However, I have the TV plugged into my computer (it's a radeon graphics card, but I'm not getting anything on startup.  The computer is booting, but the TV gives no response. 

 Am I trying to do something my computer can't handle; if so, how can I fix it?  Thanks in advance; if you need more details, I'm babysitting this post because i want to know ASAP, so just ask.

 

EDIT1:  I discovered that 1 of my DRAMs is malfunctioning, which caused the computer to not boot.  Now I get video, but it refuses to boot because of a fan error (it says CPU fan Error press F1 to enter setup).  Even if I ignore the fans in the advanced settings, it still happens.  My one thought to this is that the CPU fan I am using isn't the stock one and only has 3 pins whereas the motherboard socket for it has 4.

 

My computers specs:

CM Storm Sniper Case

Sabertooth 990FX Motherboard 

2 G-Skill RipJaws 4GB (one not working thus not installed)

AMD Phenom II Black Edition CPU

Radeon HD 6970 Graphics Card

Corsair HX 850W Power Supply

Sunbeamtech Core-contact 120 Heatsink &amp; Fan (instead of Phenom's stock)

My keyboard is a BlackWdiow and the TV is a Samsung (though now both seem to be working fine)
 
      
     
  
  
    
 
EDIT 2: by telling my BIOS not to force F1 on an error, i managed to proceed (since turning all the fan settings not ignore didn't work), however, I would like to fix that since I feel it could lead to problems in the future (more serious errors).

iktpa,8,2011-07-09,Fabricating work experience,Xarvas,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iktpa/fabricating_work_experience/,"For last few weeks I've been sending applications for IT internships and temp jobs and so far I got no response. I just finished second year at my university, and have pretty good grasp of C++, C#, SQL and couple other langueges (no Java though, still working on it). I do not, however have any work experience. I've talked to a friend who runs a small firm and does some headhunting there, that he always searches for people with at least minimal experience and advised me to make something up.

I live in a relatively small town, far from where I study and apply for jobs. If I wrote in my CV that I made a database here and a few programs there, it would look good and be hard to trace at the same time (who bothers to check a small company, without a website, few hundred kilometers away).

The question is, would it pay off. Of course all the added stuff wouldn't be false advertising because all I plan to add is stuff I did anyway, while learning those skills. Do you know whether HR really care for experience that much and do they see through this kind of ruse?"

I did not want to delay my 4 year degree by using a semester to co-op and hoped I'd find an internship. I do have a 4.0 GPA and I spend my time off learning as much about other fields (like areas in mathematics and physics) outside of EE stuff. 

I still have time to find a co-op and my university has good resources to help me do so, which may be what I decide on...

My actual question is this: if I graduate with a 4.0 and even some undergrad ""research,"" how badly does not having a co-op/internship/experience hurt my chances of getting hired? I do understand that experience is important, but aren't there entry level jobs out there that expect people with little to no experience?"

ild37,6,2011-07-09,Putting together a job procurement plan,DunDirty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ild37/putting_together_a_job_procurement_plan/,"Hi,

I am interested in putting together a plan to find and then be offered a position.  I am not sure exactly what should be involved in the plan.

Background
I am two years out of college.  I have had an internship every summer while in college and I have worked both years out of college.  All of my jobs were in the realm of finance (corporate and investments) and in New England.  At the moment, I am employed, but it is time for me to move on to continue toward my goal of buy-side finance.  I realize that encompasses a lot, but I am not entirely sure what offers I could get at the moment.

My thoughts are: 

* Cold calling buy-side analyst and PMs offering an example research piece showing off my skills
* Use a recruiter/headhunter
* Network with friends

I have never received a job offer through applying, which makes it an unattractive option, but perhaps I was doing it wrong.

I am hoping to put together a multistage plan or process to be able to work through effectively.  Something that is step by step, something like a critical path would be perfect with tasks to accomplish.  I am not really sure if I am missing anything for the job search or how I should stagger the different options, if I should.  Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Work for $9.00/hour (to start), programming in Python (don't worry if you've never heard of Python). No degree or professional experience required. Applicants will join a team of two other experienced Python developers. Must be able to work a consistent 10-20 hours a week schedule. The actual schedule is fairly flexible, and will be worked out between the applicant and supervisor. We can work around your school schedule. Applicant will also be required to provide support for the project via email, phone, and a ticketing system.

**Experience**: You will need to have a strong grasp of object oriented programming. You should know at least one OO language. We can teach you Python, but you need that OO foundation. Any knowledge of HTML, CSS, JQuery, or SQL would be a plus, but is not required. Linux experience would also be a plus.

**The project**: Work for a non-profit who helps people with disabilities locally. Applicant will join a team developing, maintaining, and supporting the online software suite that all the employees of the non-profit use. Because the software is developed in-house, the team is able to interact with its users on a daily basis, and provide real solutions to real problems.

**Other thoughts**: The applicants need to be sensitive to people with disabilities, as he/she will often interact with people of varying degrees of disability. The most important qualities in applicants will be enthusiasm about programming. You don't need professional experience or a portfolio. Basically, you need to be a decent person, and love to write code.

**Contact**: Send resumes/questions to ameng@cilorlando.org
(No, that website is not the project. But it is the company you would be working for)."

I am about to graduate in December for Computer Engineering. I have already had 3 rotations as a co-op translating into a full year of work experience.

I was called in for a job interview and then given an offer to be an intern with the possibility of full time whenever I graduate, and I need to decide what to do.

The job would be on the coding side of things and part time to work around my schedule. The primary work would be from home, only having to goto the office when necessary (most of the time). The place is about an hour from my house without traffic and 2+ with traffic. It seems like a nice place to work, but the distance is a major factor.

The other major factor is they are offering $15 an hour which is about standard in this area as starting intern. The problem is I have had 3 co-op rotations, made significantly more in the other jobs and am about to graduate. Yes it will look good on my resume, but the pay is so low that I feel like it will be a waste if I have to drive in there often. Also I feel that since I am about to graduate and have alot of experience I should be getting more.

What do you guys think? Am I creating too high of a self worth, or are they just trying to get cheap labor while they can? What do you suppose I do...

I took an introductory Java course last semester. I did some programming before that and I've dont a bit since then as well, but I still feel stupid. I'm still learning, but I don't think I should feel this helpless. Am I alone here?

It seems like whenever I read a tutorial, and try to read the code provided, I'm completely lost. I can kind of figure out whats going on, but I definitely don't understand as fully as I should. This is even the case for what I believe most people would consider relatively simple scripts.

I'm preparing for three more computer science courses in the Fall: another Java course, a Python course, and an algorithms and data structures course. Doing well in these courses is important to me, but what is more important is actually learning how to program, and learning how to program well.

How long should I be programming before I feel proficient enough to get a job as a programmer? I'd really like to get an internship next summer, but I don't feel like theres much hope of that happening with the way things are going right now. Any advice on what I can do so that I feel like I'm actually learning something would be much appreciated. 

EDIT: Also, since I'm already asking questions, do you consider it a good idea to learn a language well before moving on to frameworks? How about learning multiple languages at the same time? Should I stick with one language for the next year or should I learn 3 or 4 new languages?"

Here's a few with my parents (my dad is about as bad with women as I am, so they are all interesting).

My parents met at med school, my mom was an intern and my dad was in his second year to the best of my memory.  My mom is completely Italian, and my dad is a plethora of races.  Their first encounter involved my dad telling a series of offensive Italian jokes.  My mom got insulted and so she started telling offensive Jewish jokes to irritate him.

Second time they met, several months later.  They are both at a small medical school party.  My dad is talking to a friend of his, and my mom arrives halfway through the party.  After a while, she asks my dad if he wants to dance.  His reply?  ""I'm talking.""  She stormed off.

Their first date, about a year later.  My dad lost his voice, and so was basically unable to talk for the entire thing.

Their second date, about 2 weeks later.  They went skiing, my mom fell and ski patrol had to be called to take her down the mountain.  My dad kept skiing for the day.  (He really likes skiing)

3 years later, 2 years before they finally married.  My mom is doing some sort of work at a hospital in Virginia.  My dad is at a hospital in Massachusetts.  He makes a big deal about them meeting for their 3 year mark.  My mom assumes that he's going to give her a ring, so she prepares for that (saying yes, somehow).  My dad's plane is delayed, causing him to miss the anniversary thing.  When he finally comes down, he does not give her a ring, but a pair of slippers.  She kicks him out of her apartment and doesn't talk to him for 2-3 weeks.

I really don't know how I actually managed to exist after all of this.  Really.

What are your stories?"

- by JACK HANDEY



My first day in Hell is drawing to a close. They don’t really have a sunset here, but the fires seem to dim a bit, and the screaming gets more subdued. Most of the demons are asleep now, their pointy tails curled up around them. They look so innocent, it’s hard to believe that just a few hours ago they were raping and torturing us.

The day started off at a party at the Chelsea Hotel, where some friends were daring me to do something. The next thing I knew, I was in Hell. At first, it seemed like a dream, but then I remembered that five-Martini dreams are usually a lot worse.

There’s a kind of customs station when you arrive here, where a skeleton in a black robe checks a big book to make sure your name’s there. And as he slowly scans the pages with his bony finger you can’t help thinking, Why does a skeleton need a robe? Especially since it’s so hot. That’s the first thing you notice about Hell, how hot it is. I know it’s a clich?, but it’s true. Fortunately, it’s a steamy, sulfury kind of hot. Like a spa or something.

You might think that people in Hell are all nude. But that’s a myth. You wear what you were last wearing on earth. For instance, I am dressed like the German U-boat captain in the movie “Das Boot,” because that’s what I wore to the party. It’s an easy costume, because all you really need is the hat. The bad part is, people are always asking you who you are, even in Hell. Come on! “Das Boot”!

The food here turns out to be surprisingly good. The trouble is, just about all of it is poisoned. So a few minutes after you finish eating you’re doubled over in agony. The weird thing is, as soon as you recover you’re ready to dig in all over again.

Despite the tasty food and warm weather, there’s a dark side to Hell. For one thing, it’s totally disorganized. That anything gets done down here is a miracle. You’ll be herded along in one big line, then it’ll separate into three lines, then the lines will all come back together again! For no apparent reason! It’s crazy. You try to ask a demon a question, but he just looks at you. I don’t mean to sound prejudiced, but you wonder if they even speak English.

To relieve the boredom, you can throw rocks at other people in line. They just think it was a demon. But I discovered the hard way that the demons don’t like it when they’re beating someone and you join in.

It’s odd, but Hell can be a lonely place, even with so many people around. They all seem caught up in their own little worlds, running to and fro, wailing and tearing at their hair. You try to make conversation, but you can tell they’re not listening.

A malaise set in within a couple hours of my arriving. I thought getting a job might help. It turns out I have a lot of relatives in Hell, and, using connections, I became the assistant to a demon who pulls people’s teeth out. It wasn’t actually a job, more of an internship. But I was eager. And at first it was kind of interesting. After a while, though, you start asking yourself: Is this what I came to Hell for, to hand different kinds of pliers to a demon? I started wondering if I should even have come to Hell at all. Maybe I should have lived my life differently, and gone to Heaven instead.

I decided I had to get away—the endless lines, the senseless whipping, the forced sing-alongs. You get tired of trying to explain that you’ve already been branded, or that something that big won’t fit in your ear, even with a hammer. I wandered off. I needed some me time. I came to a cave and went inside. Maybe I would find a place to meditate, or some gold nuggets.

That’s when it happened, one of those moments which could only happen in Hell. I saw Satan. Some people have been in Hell for hundreds of years and have never seen Satan, but there he was: he was shorter than I thought he’d be, but he looked pretty good. He was standing on a big rock with his reading glasses on. I think he was practicing a speech. “Hey, Satan,” I yelled out, “how’s it going?” I was immediately set upon by demons. I can’t begin to describe the tortures they inflicted on me, because apparently they are trade secrets. Suffice it to say that, even as you endure all the pain, you find yourself thinking, Wow, how did they think of that?

My stitches are a little itchy, but at least the demons sewed most of my parts back on. More important, my faith in Hell as an exciting place where anything can happen has been restored.

I had better get some rest. They say the bees will be out soon and that it’s hard to sleep with the constant stinging. I lost my internship, but I was told I can reapply in a hundred years. Meanwhile, I’ve been assigned to a construction crew. Tomorrow we’re supposed to build a huge monolith, then take picks and shovels and tear it down, then beat each other to death. It sounds pointless to me, but what do I know. I’m new here. "

I'm less than a month away from my 19th birthday and less than two months away from enrolling in university for software engineering. Up until now the only languages that i tried to do anything in were php, pascal and c++. Php was my first language but it didn't interest me enough so i went over to c++ which is the language that taught me the fundamentals of programming. I can't say that im very good at it but i believe that i know more then the average student who's going to study software engineering ( i might be underestimating my future peers ) since i'm able ( or so i think ) to understand the concepts and recognize them in other languages. I admit that i'm not very good at OOP since windows programming is still somewhat foreign to me but i'm hoping that it's because of lack of practice since in pretty good at console based applications. 

Anyways university is not really the thing that i wan't to be doing now in life but the pressure to get that diploma is high so ill just get it sooner than later. 
While i don't know how good are the courses i think that the best way for me to learn would be to get an intern position in some company and work my way up from there. 
So here's the question : What do i need to prepare before applying to different companies? Do i need to make some apps to showcase my knowledge? basically i have no idea how the process of applying for work in the IT industry works and would like to find out more.

TL;DR: want to intern in an IT company as a programmer, how do i do that?"

ix4mk,1,2011-07-22,I Have 11 Months To Learn How To Create Awesomeness – Help a brother out?,brewer2,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ix4mk/i_have_11_months_to_learn_how_to_create/,"So let's start off with a little background. I'm a Computer Science major (I'm considering switch to Computer Science/Applied Mathematics joint major) that absolutely loves to program. I've spent some time considering what kind of programming I'd be interested in doing for a career. I want something that will allow me to apply both my interests in mathematics and physics – and then it struck me – game development! There are so many different sub-specialties in gaming too. If I decide that I want to spend more time working with math, I can go down the graphics path. If I find that physics is more interesting to me, then there is the option to develop physics engines. Or if I decide that I don't want to specialize in something else, I can do that too.

Here's my problem: I've never created a game before. I've done some programming and I'd say that I'm an intermediate level programmer. I've worked with Java and Python, as well as a tiny bit of C. Now this wouldn't be a huge problem, as I could just take my time learning, but I want to get an internship for next Summer. In other words, I have 11 months to learn how to create the awesomeness that is a video game. More specifically, I need to apply for internships in December, which means I need a working demo by the end of the year. After that I will have six months to refine my skills before I start the internship (assuming I get one).

What I would like is someone who has made games before (I'm sure theres at least one person like that here :)) that is willing to help me out while I learn. Sort of like a mentor. This person wouldn't have to answer a million questions – I know how to use Google – I just need someone that can help make sure that I stay on the right path. Also, I'm always open to suggestions from other people, so telling me what you think of my games/code would definitely be appreciated.

I currently have a well-paying job close to home (15 minutes) that gives me completely flexible hours, so as long as the hours for the internship are also flexible, money will not be an issue, and just the extra driving and time will be an issue.  I'm looking for a way to get official experience in the field, and I see this is a good choice.

I just don't like the unpaid side of it.  Is it worth it?"
iwtaw,3,2011-07-22,I have an Associates in Applied Science (programming) and my internship is ending soon. What to do now?,odnxe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/iwtaw/i_have_an_associates_in_applied_science/,"So, I'll make this as short and as sweet as possible. 

Background Info: I graduated this last May with an Associates in Applied Science (computer programming). Currently I'm working a programming internship over the summer, and they offered me the opportunity to continue working here if I continued my education and got a Bachelors degree.

Basically I have three choices and I would like some advice.

Option 1: Go to the university for a Bachelors in Computer Science, while continuing to work as an intern.


Pros: 

* Graduate with a BS in CS.
* Have 2-3 years of work experience when I graduate (huge).

Cons:

* The university would barely take any of my classes from tech school so the soonest I could reasonably graduate is in three years. 
* I'm already 23, so by the time I'd graduate I'll be 26 or so. 
* Have no free time between work and school work.

Option 2: Go to University and go for a B.A.T.S. which is a Bachelors of Applied Technology, while continuing to work as an intern.


Pros:

* It's designed with transfer students from tech schoosl in mind, so I could graduate in two years. However NONE of the classes have anything to do with computer programming really.
* A lot less course load then the Computer Science approach.
* More free time.

Cons:

* I won't learn anything related to computer science however, I would have that bachelors which is ""related"" to computer science.
* I'm very worried that this degree wouldn't have any credibility when job searching, and I would basically be riding on the coat tails of my internship experience when hunting for a job.
Notes:
* I would probably take a few of the CS classes that looked interesting, for example I would take data structures and algorithms even though I have a decent understanding of them.

Option 3: End the internship at August, and try to find a job with my 3 month internship experience to get me in the door along with my associates.


Pros:

* I can start working right away.
* I don't have to move away from my friends and family.

Cons:

* It's honestly risky, I could just not get very lucky in finding work.
* Pay would probably a bit lower than if I had a bachelors.

So, the biggest question I have... Would you not consider someone with a B.A.T.S degree(sprinkled in with some core C.S. classes) over a person with a Bachelors of Computer Science."

I'm just posting to see if any redditor from Darmstadt would be interested in meeting. I don't know many people there, mostly people from my lab and the people from my home (I'm living at the Cheruskia Fraternity - it's great there ;)) - and usually when I'm abroad I like to meet local folks to get to know stuff and just meeting new people in general :&gt;

Basically about me : I'm a typical computer/games/sf/fantasy fan and all that stuff ;-) I could go into details but I don't like leaving too many traces of IRL-me on the internet. Just ask if you want to know something specific.

I excel in programming (and I like it), but I'm not sure if I can get a job in the electronics area, this market is REALLY narrow in Brazil. And I can't stand the idea of I ending up coding ERPs. Ok, since I'm good at it I may get a good IT job. Right now I'm an intern in one of the biggest telecommunications company in Brazil, so I think I can work my way up to a good IT position.

But here comes the problem. I LOVE automation &amp; controls!! I'm also really good at it, but not the best. It's not a much wider field than electronics but even a ""decent"" position would satisfy myself.

I know this seems like a reposted question, but this one's a little different, actually.

Rather than what general advice you would give to a 16 year old, what kind of advice would you give me in regards to career/college/learning?

I know there is a large group of redditors who have programming/technology related jobs. If I had to pick my college major now, I'd definitely say Comp. Sci. I'm currently doing an internship with a small web-design firm and learning some programming on my own a home, which I know is a little bit of a late start at 16.

I get very good grades and work hard in school. If everything went the way I can only wish for, I'd get into Stanford as a CS major and begin my own tech startup in one of the tech hubs (so to speak) around California.

Now I know that's really ambitious and unlikely, but I know I'm not the first one to think it's possible and go for it. I've seen a lot of posts around reddit saying something like ""I wish I would have done ___"" in regards to their career.

So my question: what advice do you have for me to succeed?"

Starting salary for an entry-level position for an SDE is ~$90k, plus some stock.
However, I'm afraid that if I go to work right out of college, life will become pointless, boring, and stagnant. What's the point once you become comfortable in the position you are at in life? Accepting the offer is probably the best career choice, but a big part of me is telling me I'd regret it.

It's just so blatant and obvious here, that it's pathetic. I find it atrocious how people are judged on whether or not they get raises. I see plenty of hard-working, but shy people who are still stuck in the lower ranks, while the assholes, but nice-in-front-of-bosses are up there in management. And it makes me sick to the stomach when I'm eating lunch with other interns and some of them are talking all about money and they have to look all giddy and whatnot. 

I just really don't want anything to do with this bullshit. I don't want to be judged on my looks. Judge me on the effort I put into the work I did, and that'll push me.

I'm thinking of some smaller, but well-doing companies for my internship next year. Some are private, but for the most part, they're all small. Which leads me to the question in general: would I find corporate bureaucracy in a smaller company like I am here? 

And kind of an off-note, is Microsoft known for this type of bullshit? I've read very little on their professional environment workplace. It's a company that I'd like to work for. But being a big company, Microsoft kind of gives me that corporate bureaucracy vibe

iyv7x,13,2011-07-24,Solicitation for Grad School Advice,CSAnticipation,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/iyv7x/solicitation_for_grad_school_advice/,"Redditors of /compsci - I come to you with a plea for advice (and a throwaway account). The final summer of my undergraduate education is coming to an end, and graduate school application time rapidly approaches. I'm aiming at a Ph.D, and I've gotten conflicting advice from the people I've consulted as to where I should be aiming. A bit of background: I attend a respectable, though not top-ten, school. I have no published papers, though I have worked in a CS research lab for four months (and am returning after the summer). I have three internships under my belt, including one at a top-tier tech company, though none were research-focused. My GPA is around a 3.75/4.00, and my GREs are 750 Verbal/800 Quant/waiting on Analytical to come in the mail. I will have multiple strong letters of recommendation, including one from the professor whose lab I've been working in. I've looked at the CS GRE, but decided (tentatively) that I should not take it. As near as I can tell, my lack of publication is by far the most substantial weakness in my application. I've spoken to my own professors, employees of industrial CS research labs and grad students at several schools and the answers I've gotten have ranged from ""You should apply to mostly middle-of-the-range schools"" to ""You have a shot at any school you want to go to"". I am aware that quality of the group in my sub-field is more important than overall rank, and that's the rank I'm going by here.

So with all that laid out, here are my questions:

* How badly does my lack of publication cripple me? Do I have a shot at the best of the best schools (say, top-10/5) with the best of the best groups in my specific area, or should I aim more modestly?
* Is my decision to not take the CS GRE the correct one? I believe it can only hurt me, but I could be wrong: I've never done this before!
* On personal statements: I've read a lot about what **not** to put, but not much about what *to* put. Any advice here would mean a lot.
* I did not aggressively pursue research early in my undergraduate career because I did not intend to go to graduate school. I fell in love with the field the more I read and learned, and this kind of puts me behind the curve regarding research. If anyone has an idea on how I can explain this - or if I should not mention this - in a personal statement, I'd love to receive it.
* Am I correct in my belief that the GRE is more of a ""If you're not this high-scoring, into the circular file with you!"" and less of a metric where my scores would distinguish me?

Any advice would be very much appreciated!"

I am a recent graduate from a good university in Toronto, Canada with a degree in finance/economics. I have above avg grades and have also gone through the trouble of obtaining certain key industry certification such as the IFC and CSC. 

I have tried all summer long to get a job in my field (anything finance related). I speak 4 languages (English, French, Russian and Ukrainian).
I have sent out my resume to countless companies and have even gone as far as having a professional resume writing firm create one for me.
I am also social, affluent and fairly smart(from what my friends tell me). I work well with people and get along with almost anyone I encounter (you could say i'm a people pleaser).

My classmates (many of whom I helped get through the program) all have managed to secure jobs in the field.
I am lacking experience in my field (obviously since i can't get a job) but have been working steadily to pay my way through university in a number of different jobs and have many good references.

The point is, I don't even get a bite... it's like I have been blacklisted or something. Nobody even calls me back for an interview!!! 
The messed up thing is I have to complete a 350hr internship to officially get my degree and I can't seem to even get anyone to hire me for free!!!

After one operation and some chemotherapy treatments, the doctors were able to remove the tumor.  He seemed fine for the next 4 years, never complained about any sort of pain.  Then earlier this year, he was feeling those stomach pains again, and so he had it checked out.  Turns out, a cancer had been accumulating again in his stomach and so they placed him under intense chemotherapy.  He's been under this treatment for about 3-4 months now and it's clear that the chemo is not fixing anything.  He's lost his appetite for just about everything and because of this he's lost a ton of weight.  At first I was very confident that the chemo would fix him (since it did the first time around), but a few weeks ago his doctor told my family that my father has about 6 months left in him, and that we should start looking for a hospice.  My dad quit his business a long time ago, and our family gets by on his social security, welfare, and food stamps.  Oh and my school's financial aid combined with my sister's financial aid helped immensely as well.  It's not bad really, I'm just thankful that such financial benefits exists for people that are in my similar situation.

So now comes the question of family income.  Once my dad goes away, all financial responsibility for my family is going to be riding on my shoulders.  I live with my mother, my sister, and my younger brother (who is still too young to work).  My sister will be starting her first quarter at UCSD, and she will be receiving her financial aid in September.  I recently just graduated from UCSD with a Bachelors in Science (general biology).  Due to my graduation, I am no longer a UCSD student, so I won't be able to receive any further financial aid.  Now it's time for me to look for a job.  I have a passion for laboratory positions, and so far I have applied to 7 laboratory technician/research positions.  I have been rejected from 3 simply because there were more competent applicants.  So my question for you is:

1.) **Should I continue to apply for lab positions?**  I really want a lab position, but I need a job fast and it just seems futile to think that I will eventually get a lab position sometime in the future when I need a job now.

2.) **Are there any other jobs out there that I should be looking at?** I want to put my bachelors degree to good use.. but I have no idea what other positions are out there.

3.) **Do you have any other advice for me?** Where to start? How to improve my resume?  Which job is in high demand? Anything helps, really!

As far as job experience goes, I've only managed to have 1 job as a bag boy (formal name is courtesy clerk) at an Albertsons down the street for about 2 months, other than that I have no other job experiences.  I was also stupid enough to not pick up any internship positions while I was at school.  If I had all the time in the world, I wouldn't mind applying for an internship, but due to the circumstances that I am in, I don't think I can spend any time at an internship.

I transferred in to the store absolutely loving it compared to my old store. Here's where it starts to break down:
A couple months ago we lose an agent who graduated and got a real job out of state. A month ago two agents in the same week get promoted to a higher ranking Geeksquad position and get to work from home (no option of staying in-store.) The same week those two get promoted one guy up and quits. Then yesterday I just got the news that the other agent is now quitting as well, because he got a paid internship (lucky!)

This then leaves me as the only CIA (agent authorized to do repairs on computers) and the other 3 are just COA (people who answer your questions and do paperwork when you bring in your computer to us.) I am currently training two of them to help me out repairing stuff but its just not enough help!

People want their computers ASAP, not a week from the time they dropped it off, just to say, ""Oh, you have a virus. Buy Tech Support for a year and we can remove it for you in another 4-5 days.""

I have people calling in constantly wanting to know the status of their computers just for me to tell them we're still working on it, it needs removals, needs to go to the service center in Kentucky and it'll take 2-3 weeks, ect, ect , ect. They then yell at ME for not having it done and I'm not very considerate of their time constraints, blah, blah, blah. I can do nothing than to break down and say, ""I'm sorry there's nothing more I can do for you. I'll have it done as soon as possible. But right now we are understaffed and I'm the only repair agent to 20+ computers in the precinct. I'll do what I can.""

I never break down crying at work but I have 3 times in the past week. It's really stressing me out and I don't know what to do. Not to mention Best Buy is in a hiring freeze right now so we can't get any extra help if needed. 

What do I do to stop this?! Been job hunting myself but haven't gotten any calls.... 



TL;DR  Work at Geeksquad as the only person with knowledge as how to fix computers. 20+ computers in the store now. Customers pissed and its getting to me very deeply. No luck finding new job.

j0qfy,4,2011-07-26,"My girlfriend has medical issues, some known and some unknown. No health insurance and no money for it. We live in the US. What are our options?",FlamingArms,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j0qfy/my_girlfriend_has_medical_issues_some_known_and/,"Full story:

She has had eczema all her life and woke up one morning about a year ago covered in it from head to toe. She was living in Germany at the time and came back to the US where her family was. She was seeing several doctors, mostly dermatologists and one parasitologist, trying to figure out what was going on. Most of the dermatologists told her that this was just eczema and that she would be stuck with it or they simply prescribed her more steroid creams. She also received light treatment at one point. None of this helped.

She has seasonal allergies and has also been diagnosed with allergies to yeast, wheat, and sugar. At the time when she was sick, she was practically bedridden and was thinking she might have celiac disease. Some doctors refused to test her, but eventually she had a saliva and stool sampling test done that diagnosed her with a gluten allergy. She hasn't ever received the biopsy to be officially diagnosed with celiac. She had passed what some doctors identified as intestinal lining though shortly after coming back to the US. This was one of the reasons that she was tested for parasites.

So here's where we are now: she is eating gluten-free, sugar-free, and yeast-free. She's applying moisturizers all over her body regularly and her full-body eczema has gone away for the most part. She still has dry skin relatively all over and itches as well. However, the problem is that she still flares up in different spots on her body for no apparent reason. These flare ups are worse than the eczema she used to have before she suddenly became sick, so she is still uncomfortable even though she's improved quite a bit. 

So now we don't know where to go. She has a part-time job and is trying to hold down an internship. She has no insurance and little money, but these flare ups are still quite debilitating. We have many questions but no way of getting answers. So, reddit, what are our options? We've had some recommend that we call university hospitals in the area. We will do that, but we also expect to be turned down since we have little money.

We live in the US, so we have no universal healthcare options and I think she'd be turned down even applying for healthcare if she DID have the money. Pre-existing conditions and all that, apparently we're not a good investment.

So please send us some advice, we could really use it.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has eczema and many allergies, but even with those under control is still suffering from this recent full-body flare-up that just came out of nowhere. We want to know why she is still experiencing symptoms even though she has her allergies under control. She has little money and no insurance and we live in the US anyway, so getting coverage will be extremely difficult with pre-existing conditions. Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit**: So, thanks for all the advice so far. We're looking into Medicaid and the universities around our area. If it comes down to it, we may just have to walk into a teaching hospital and force them to run some tests. Psh, I'll do it. Anyway, any additional advice would be great and I really appreciate all the advice given so far!"

I also like the thought of working with massive data sets that are measured by the terabyte. 

Towards the end of December I'll start looking for a summer internship and working at an analytics company (think Mixpanel, AdMob) might be of interest to me so I'd like to work on a project that will help me decide if this is something that I want to pursue.

What would be a good data mining or web analytics related project for someone who doesn't know much about either topic? Also, keep in mind that, while I'm not a beginner, I'm certainly not an expert programmer. Having to learn new things doesn't faze me, but I'm sure there a limit to what I should try to do.

EDIT: I'd like to make use of matplotlib.pyplot and numpy if possible."

I want to keep up to date on the news (politics/technology/world), continue to read more about 15th century Europe, learn C# for my job, continue learning the Android platform on my own, cook better on my own, learn about the gritty details of how a car works to take better car of them, better understand thermodynamics, learn about investing in stocks, learn to play the guitar...all these goddamn things and I feel like I just don't have time for!

How do some of you older Redditors manage your time/hobbies? What have you learned? Any little ""systems"" that you stick to? How do you decide to make time for the many things you want to enjoy/learn about while staying up-to-date with friends/families? Just general advice on time management. I think I do it well enough but I'm far from a level of efficacy that I'm satisfied with."

2. I did ask him if he wants to go watch a movie sometime.  He said yes but we don't know when exactly because he's super busy with work stuff.
3. He always stops to talk to me whenever he's not busy and I do the same with him.  I really like talking to him because we share a lot of common interests.
4. We're both really nerdy people.  However, my impression is that he hasn't had much experience with girls and romance.  I'm not sure if he got the hint from me asking him out to the movies.

j36sc,1,2011-07-29,[for hire] Information Security Management student looking for job (Open app),[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/j36sc/for_hire_information_security_management_student/,"Hello,

My name is Dennis Buizert and I currently live in the Netherlands. I am 25 year old Information Security Management student, who is actively looking for a full time job. 
I’m writing this open application because the position I’m interested in is not available, open or has not yet been created internally. 

The position I’m looking for is some kind of (junior) Information Security Management position this is a broad meaning. 

Information security means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.

With my current study, gained experience and knowledge of the last few years I think I am a suitable candidate for a starting business (15-50+ employees) or for a major corporation (junior position). I’m young and eager to learn, able to perform solo but i’m also a great team player. I’m able to adapt and can handle stress very well. 

I have done several internship at different companies such as T-Mobile Netherlands (Business Security) and a government IT organ (DICTU). At T-Mobile Netherlands I create a Incident Report and Response Process from scratch for their ISO27001 certification. At DICTU is created together with a classmate a Business Continuity Plan after reorganizing current and outdated documents. 

Interviewing people to get information is not a problem for me. I always give a 110% at what I do. I’m always on time and deliver on time. Able to detect when things will be delayed and report those delays on time and in a proper fashion. 

If the position I’m interested in and you think your company is interested and open in creating this position I would love to be a part of creating it. 

My skills are a still at a basic level but will evolve quicker once I use it in practice. A sum of things I am able to perform and have knowledge of; 

Risk Management, Crisis Management, Business Continuity Management, Law and regulations (self generated or federal, Security Classifications, Access Control, Cryptography, Governance, Compliance and Auditing, Change Management (ITIL)

I hope that this open letter has interested you in me and I would love to hear back positive or negative.

Exchange rate is about $1 = 3.4n, but import taxes apply so let's say about $1 = 4n (or so).


I'm looking for a gaming PC. Of course, $550 only gets you so far, but I'm finishing my internship in 6 months time and I'll be able to spend more on upgrades should they prove necessary. So I'm looking for a PC which I can upgrade later.


My budget is 2000n, which I can stretch to 2100n but probably not much more than that. However, I already have a PC, and I'm just looking to upgrade it, so case, PSU, dvd drive, fans and peripherals are already there.


This is what I've come up with so far:


Type|Item|Price
:---|:---|---:
**Motherboard**|[Intel DH61WW](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/motherboards/desktop-motherboards/desktop-board-dh61ww.html)*|329n
**CPU**|[Intel Core i5-2400 Processor (6M Cache, 3.10 GHz)](http://ark.intel.com/products/52207/Intel-Core-i5-2400-Processor-(6M-Cache-3_10-GHz\))|785n
**Memory**|1x4GB G.Skill‎|135n
**Video Card**|[Asus HD 6850 1GB GDDR5](http://www.asus.com/Graphics_Cards/AMD_Series/EAH6850_DC2DIS1GD5/)|750n
 | | 
**Total**| |999n


*The motherboard is from the infamous Cougar Point series, but this is a B3 I'm buying so I'm all clear on the SATA bug.


Now, my PSU is marked 500W, which should be plenty, my case is Micro-ATX and fully functioning, and I already have case fans and a CPU fan.


My real concern is for the size of the video card; From the pictures, it looks as if it doesn't have room on the motherboard - the DIMMs are right above it! Do you think it'll fit in?


What do you think about this build?"

Do some startups help with relocation for someone that lives in the east coast? Also, what can I do throughout the year to make myself a stronger candidate as a web developer?
